00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
The Untamed

2
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Episode 16

3
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,640
Master,

4
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,640
the people of Lord Cheng are waiting outside.

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,720
Lord Cheng is clearly here for Childe Qin.

6
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,280
The dead's clothes are lost.

7
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,960
I'm worried...

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,520
Lord Zheng,

9
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,520
Childe Qin is my assistant.

10
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,080
Please call him Mr. Jiu.

11
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,160
Yes, yes, yes.

12
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,640
But now...

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,120
Don't worry.

14
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,840
I said two hours is two hours.

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:58,960
But,

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,760
I need to trouble you to kill the head.

17
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,320
Please tell me, Your Highness.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,160
Please go to Dongshui Gate.

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,480
Go and check the fish from the West Restaurant.

20
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
See which fish is there.

21
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:08,880
Yes.

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
Didn't Mr. Jiu say that

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
the dead should be served in the small store?

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
Why did the fish be delivered to the small store?

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,960
Fish are valuable ingredients.

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,800
It's inevitable that it will be damaged on the way.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
The fish will keep the fish

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,440
that are dead

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
for themselves.

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,200
Or sell it to the small store.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
If you find the fish,

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,640
you can find the store to buy fish.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,920
I understand.

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
But Lord Cheng...

35
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,760
Mr. Jiu just arrived.

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,600
I'll take him for a walk.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,360
Just one hour.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,840
Bai Feng,

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,600
drive.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes.

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,480
One hour?

42
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,160
Or that one?

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,000
That one is good.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,160
Yes.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,200
In order to help the crown prince,

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,280
Marquis Zhong Yong is really unyielding.

47
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,520
He even brought you here.

48
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,200
I wanted to find a chance

49
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,240
to intervene in the prison.

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,440
They did it right.

51
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,120
It saved you a lot of trouble.

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm not afraid of trouble.

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
But this matter is deeply involved.

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,760
I'm afraid that you'll risk your life.

55
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,160
You also saw Lord Cheng's face today.

56
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,160
I know that he and the crown prince are in a fire.

57
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Maybe

58
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,560
he will be in the battle

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
and become someone else's tool.

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,120
I'm not afraid.

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
But don't worry.

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,160
I will be careful.

63
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,480
Whether it's to kill a woman

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
or to make up for the mistakes of the King of Jin and my father,

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,960
I'm willing to take the risk for this case.

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,400
Okay.

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,520
Just do it.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,480
You just need to be vigilant.

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
I've already passed the test in front of His Majesty.

70
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,240
You can take all the cases

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,520
of the Ministry of Justice.

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,480
Thank you.

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Moreover,

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,080
as for the disp landfill,

75
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm not afraid of them.

76
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,480
I'm not afraid of them, either.

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,000
But I'm also not thinking about the life I've lived.

78
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,040
Your Highness.

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,480
Please take the message to me.

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,280
Why did you bring me to the Prince Yi's Mansion?

81
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
I brought you here to meet someone.

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
I happened to drop those insects.

83
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,480
Why is it so quiet here?

84
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,840
This is not the Prince's Mansion.

85
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,880
How can it be quiet?

86
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,560
Brother Qi.

87
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,160
Why are you here so early?

88
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,600
Hurry up and put on your clothes.

89
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,840
Where did you go last night?

90
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,120
Yuan...

91
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,240
Xiaowan.

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
Brother Qi, you should have told me earlier.

93
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,840
Aku much wants me as a reflection.

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,200
That's not my fault.

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,760
Don't worry, Your Highness.

96
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,640
Helpless after you came back?

97
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,160
Pret saved in front of south?

98
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
Still will be your second helpsui?

99
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,320
There's an annoyance on the entrance.

100
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,560
Owe her to the whore so fast.

101
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Why do you like Prince Cheng?

102
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,120
to take the Crown Prince's bad luck?

103
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

104
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,320
Go back now.

105
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
I'll take you to see my wife later.

106
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,880
You can go by yourself.

107
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,440
She'd rather not see me even if she's in a daze.

108
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,120
Only you can make her break her promise.

109
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,160
I'll help you solve that problem.

110
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,320
Uncle.

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,680
I brought someone to see my wife.

112
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,600
Is she free?

113
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,880
She's copying the scriptures.

114
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
Please wait a moment.

115
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,640
Why do you call Yan Li's mother your wife

116
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
instead of your consort?

117
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,600
I'll tell you later.

118
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,240
Just call her your wife.

119
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,840
Greetings, Madam.

120
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,400
It's been over a year.

121
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
You look more like your father.

122
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
This is...

123
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,720
This is the ninth wife of the second house of Qin.

124
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
Her name is Wan.

125
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,880
Greetings, Madam.

126
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
I didn't know you'd come.

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
I'm sorry for not greeting you.

128
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
It's my fault for visiting you.

129
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,080
This is for you.

130
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,320
Don't mind it.

131
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
I can't accept it.

132
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
The seventh husband

133
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,120
finally brought his wife to see me.

134
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm very happy.

135
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Please accept it.

136
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,760
It's a gift for the future.

137
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Thank you, Madam.

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,840
Waner and I will visit you often in the capital.

139
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
No need.

140
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,280
I'm not here to see you.

141
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,480
I'm here to see you.

142
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,680
I'm here to see you.

143
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
No need.

144
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,320
Just keep an eye on A'Li for me.

145
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Xilang,

146
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,080
if possible,

147
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,600
leave the capital as soon as possible.

148
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
Your Highness,

149
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,680
I've been informed that

150
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,440
Y seperti you in this family

151
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,720
is extremely important.

152
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,440
I'll come to see you when I'm free.

153
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,640
Please do your best.

154
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Don't worry.

155
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
I'll go.

156
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
I'll come.

157
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
I'll go.

158
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
I'll go.

159
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I'll go.

160
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
I'll go.

161
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
I'll go.

162
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
I'll go.

163
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
I'll go.

164
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
I'll go.

165
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
I'll go.

166
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I'll go.

167
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
I'll go.

168
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
I'll go.

169
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
I'll go.

170
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
I'll go.

171
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
I'll go.

172
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
I'll go.

173
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I'll go.

174
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,240
Fu Chengye tried to kill you.

175
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,760
So that's why Fu's family was beheaded?

176
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Madam is Fu Chengye's sister.

177
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,760
What about Prince Yi?

178
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Prince Yi was a member of Fu Chengye's family

179
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,120
when he was still a member of the Guanzha clan.

180
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,320
He was strict.

181
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
Prince Yi was a son of a farmer who was a part of the family.

182
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,040
He was bullied by Fu Chengye

183
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,400
because of his military achievements.

184
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,960
He was able to marry Fu's daughter.

185
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,640
He was a good son.

186
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,600
He was a good son.

187
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
He was a good son.

188
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
He was a good son.

189
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
He was a good son.

190
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
He was a good son.

191
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
He was a good son.

192
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
He was a good son.

193
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
He was a good son.

194
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
He was a good son.

195
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
He was a good son.

196
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
He was a good son.

197
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
He was a good son.

198
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
He was a good son.

199
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
He was a good son.

200
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
He was a good son.

201
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
He was a good son.

202
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
He was a good son.

203
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
He was a good son.

204
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
He was a good son.

205
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
He was a good son.

206
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
He was a good son.

207
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
He was a good son.

208
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
He was a good son.

209
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
He was a good son.

210
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
He was a good son.

211
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
He was a good son.

212
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
He was a good son.

213
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
He was a good son.

214
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
He was a good son.

215
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
He was a good son.

216
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
He was a good son.

217
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
He was a good son.

218
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
He was a good son.

219
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
He was a good son.

220
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
He was a good son.

221
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
He was a good son.

222
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
He was a good son.

223
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
He was a good son.

224
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
He was a good son.

225
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
He was a good son.

226
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
He was a good son.

227
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
He was a good son.

228
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
He was a good son.

229
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
He was a good son.

230
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
He was a good son.

231
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
He was a good son.

232
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
He was a good son.

233
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
He was a good son.

234
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
He was a good son.

235
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
He was a good son.

236
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
He was a good son.

237
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
He was a good son.

238
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
He was a good son.

239
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
He was a good son.

240
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
He was a good son.

241
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
He was a good son.

242
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
He was a good son.

243
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
He was a good son.

244
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
He was a good son.

245
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,400
And His Highness

246
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,440
also loved him a lot.

247
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,240
He was a good son.

248
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
He was a good son.

249
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,000
He was a good son.

250
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
He was a good son.

251
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
He was a good son.

252
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
He was a good son.

253
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,120
Lord Han.

254
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,560
I really don't want to man up toTM

255
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,040
Go

256
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,560
That was the first time His Majesty

257
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:25,920
One from the powerful military

258
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,800
was a commandant of the Royal family

259
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,880
When Yuan Jun changed his position,

260
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,040
Prince Yi was already in the position of the Crown Prince.

261
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,640
But he still kept the seriously injured His Majesty

262
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
at his back.

263
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,360
His Majesty was so fond of Yan Han

264
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,200
that he appointed him as the Crown Prince

265
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
and named him Prince Yi

266
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
with high regard.

267
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,520
He also considered Yan Li as his adopted son

268
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,760
and granted him the title of Yan.

269
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,240
So Yan Li's heir is a lowly man.

270
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
He is a powerful man.

271
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,760
No one really thinks he is a member of the imperial clan.

272
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,600
Why didn't you make the title of Princess Consort?

273
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,040
Madam Yan wanted to marry him.

274
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,960
But she couldn't bear Yan Li's

275
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,160
childishness.

276
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,400
So she rejected the title and left him alone.

277
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,920
Fortunately, the imperial clan

278
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,440
really treated Yan Li like their own grandchild.

279
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,000
With the imperial clan's mother around,

280
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
no one in the palace dared to be rude to her.

281
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,360
They didn't leave each other.

282
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Madam and Prince Yi

283
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,200
are really deeply in love.

284
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,040
I'm afraid that

285
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,880
you and I

286
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,760
can only wait for the right time.

287
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
But if you're in danger,

288
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,760
I won't let you off.

289
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,280
Even if I have to risk my life,

290
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,600
I will find the person who hurt you

291
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,640
and get him back.

292
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,640
Your words

293
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,480
really

294
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,160
reassure me.

295
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,880
You can rest assured.

296
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,200
Even if you die,

297
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,440
I will live well.

298
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,200
Rest assured?

299
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,960
Then you can rest assured, too.

300
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,160
I won't die in front of you.

301
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,640
Master.

302
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,800
Those dogs

303
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,120
were taken to the House of Marquis of Zhongyue.

304
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,920
Tell the Ge Clan

305
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,000
to take them to the capital

306
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
to save them from being beaten.

307
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,080
Yes.

308
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,600
Your Highness, Mr. Jiu.

309
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,040
I have a small gift.

310
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,800
The Zheng's family has been waiting for a long time.

311
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
Please lead the way, Lord Zhan.

312
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,880
Don't make any moves here.

313
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,720
I won't make you a carriage in the future.

314
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,840
Don't do it here.

315
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,080
Then other places are fine.

316
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,840
I can do it.

317
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
Thank you for your hard work.

318
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,480
Master, I was thinking

319
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,480
that the three victims have nothing to do with each other.

320
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,120
The place where they went to do their work

321
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,080
is far from the place where they left the body.

322
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,840
Where did the murderer

323
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,680
take them away?

324
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,600
Don't worry, Lord.

325
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,120
Please let me handle it.

326
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,280
Get some red thread, red pen,

327
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,600
and quy-yan net.

328
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,640
Yes.

329
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Your Highness, what's the use of these?

330
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,160
The murderer hasn't left any clues yet.

331
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,560
It means that he is very cautious and meticulous.

332
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,080
People like him

333
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
usually find a familiar place to do the case

334
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,280
and plan the time and route of the case in advance.

335
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,400
He has to do the case once every half month.

336
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,200
If he runs the tailor shop alone,

337
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
he won't have time

338
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,080
to find the victim all over the capital.

339
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,840
If he often closes the door and takes a rest,

340
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,320
he will definitely cause suspicion.

341
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,720
So,

342
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,760
we can calculate the place where he was

343
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,800
by his three times throwing away the body.

344
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,440
But these three places are not close to each other.

345
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,720
Your Highness,

346
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I would like to ask the tailor

347
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,000
to ask these quy-yan net

348
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,320
on the map

349
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,080
and make the place where the murderer left the body.

350
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,560
The first victim is under the jade bridge.

351
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
The second victim is in the abandoned old house.

352
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,480
The third victim is in the dark alley.

353
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,960
Red thread.

354
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
The third victim is in the dark alley.

355
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,720
The fifth victim is in the dark alley.

356
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,720
If the murderer wants to avoid the victim,

357
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,400
he has to throw the body away

358
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
between these two places

359
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,440
and return to the residence.

360
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
He can't use a cart

361
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,360
or ride a horse to send the body away.

362
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,640
A normal person

363
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
who has been carrying a body for nearly 100 years

364
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,480
has to walk four or five miles an hour.

365
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,400
It's not easy.

366
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,640
He has to take a break on the way

367
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,560
to avoid the patrol

368
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,560
and deal with the body.

369
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,360
It takes at least an hour and a half.

370
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,920
If he doesn't have time,

371
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,040
he will be in danger.

372
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,280
If he doesn't have time,

373
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
he will be in danger.

374
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,480
If he doesn't have time,

375
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,640
he will be in danger.

376
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,920
The remaining time

377
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,240
can be returned to the residence

378
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,400
and the rest can be opened.

379
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,800
This area

380
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,160
is within five miles

381
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,360
from every abandoned place.

382
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,800
Bai Feng,

383
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,360
take someone to check

384
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,920
which people

385
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,040
are likely to be wearing shoes

386
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,840
on their stairs.

387
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,360
It might be a tailor.

388
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,480
But his shoes

389
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,840
are probably not of his own.

390
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,760
I understand.

391
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Gone not only his shop,

392
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,720
theтовenary said

393
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,000
that it's fine on the floors,

394
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,760
but there are likely to be other places

395
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,440
where the stitch tricky.

396
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,160
Search all the houses

397
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,760
with stairs.

398
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,560
Yes.

399
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,000
Bai Feng,

400
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,040
in a few hours,

401
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,360
it's the last day of the gas killing.

402
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,320
Where is the Record?

403
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,720
I can't take care of Xiao Jin today.

404
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,520
Go now.

405
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,280
I'll go with you.

406
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,720
Your Highness,

407
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,240
I've found some small shops

408
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,520
selling jade beads in the west market.

409
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,920
I'll go with you to the west market

410
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,760
to check the remains.

411
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,520
Yes.

412
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
I want to go to the clothes store

413
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,360
to see if I can find new clues

414
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,600
from the body.

415
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,520
I'll go with Mr. Jiu.

416
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,120
Don't worry, Your Highness.

417
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,920
If there's any accident,

418
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,280
remember to use the fire.

419
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,120
Yes.

420
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,160
Mother is one of the commenting figures.

421
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
She never goes to

422
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,320
I read it in the book.

423
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,800
But why are you a man?

424
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,320
Why are you a man?

425
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,360
Tell me.

426
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,120
Why aren't you a woman?

427
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,360
Why aren't you a woman?

428
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,560
You're a woman.

429
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,960
You can even sell yourself for me.

430
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,880
Why are you a man?

431
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,120
Why are you a man?

432
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Why are you a woman?

433
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,320
Bring me more wine.

434
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,720
Your Highness.

435
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,040
Marquis Zhongyong asked me to bring this

436
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,360
to the Crown Prince.

437
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,080
I've found out the clue

438
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,400
to the five capable men.

439
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,800
They're searching for the suspect.

440
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,440
What else did Marquis Zhongyong say?

441
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Marquis, please rest assured.

442
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,440
Good.

443
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
If this case can be solved in time,

444
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,800
I won't forget the credit

445
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,600
of Marquis Zhongyong.

446
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,880
Lord Fuyin.

447
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
Uncle Fang.

448
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,880
Where are the bodies of the three victims?

449
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,880
Bodies?

450
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,800
Didn't you order someone

451
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,000
to take them away?

452
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,760
I've never ordered that.

453
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,360
What about the victims' clothes?

454
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,640
They left together.

455
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,000
I was wondering

456
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,400
if the people who were frozen

457
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,400
could wait for the case to be solved.

458
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,760
Do you know who that man is?

459
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,720
Of course I do.

460
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
He's the one who sent the bodies

461
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
to the police station with Marquis Zhan.

462
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,200
It's Cheng again.

463
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
What's the point?

464
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,960
He took all the evidence.

465
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,280
How are we supposed to solve the case?

466
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,680
Let's go back to the government office.

467
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,560
His Highness will find new evidence.

468
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes.

469
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,480
Yes.

470
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes.

471
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,520
Be careful.

472
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,080
Be careful.

473
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,680
Be careful.

474
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,280
Be careful.

475
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,320
Sirs.

476
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Good morning.

477
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,760
The shop just opened.

478
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,840
The fish congee in the West

479
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,000
is the most authentic.

480
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,560
Then serve us two dishes first.

481
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,760
Let's try

482
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,800
the most authentic

483
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,680
fish congee.

484
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,240
Sure.

485
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:45,960
Wait a moment.

486
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,440
Your Highness, do you think

487
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,760
this is where the victims

488
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,760
used to dine?

489
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,240
The third victim

490
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
lived outside the city.

491
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,760
It's rare to see them in the city.

492
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,120
He must also want to try

493
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,120
the authentic fish congee.

494
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,560
Here are the dishes.

495
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,720
Brother.

496
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,560
Look at your purse.

497
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,880
It's in a bad shape.

498
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,160
Sir, you're mistaken.

499
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,880
This purse is not mine.

500
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,880
It was given to me by a lady

501
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
who came to have porridge

502
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,680
a few days ago.

503
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,560
I'm afraid that she'll find it

504
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,480
and hang it on her waist.

505
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,520
It's more obvious.

506
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Do you remember

507
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,000
what kind of clothes the lady was wearing?

508
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
She was wearing...

509
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,160
It seems to be

510
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,480
the usual clothes for the arm.

511
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,320
Your Highness,

512
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,040
the victim was wearing

513
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,240
the clothes for the arm.

514
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,960
Then...

515
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,280
The lady was dead?

516
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,000
Then...

517
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
What's that purse?

518
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,280
Look.

519
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,880
This is a magic trick to make a wedding dress.

520
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,800
The day of the wedding dress

521
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
is the day the victim disappeared.

522
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,760
Sir,

523
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,880
Sir.

524
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,840
Sir.

525
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,160
Please have a seat.

526
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,200
Have a cup of tea

527
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
and have a rest.

528
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,160
Thank you.

529
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,400
You're a few rolls short.

530
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,800
It's almost done.

531
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Thank you, Sir.

532
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,280
You're so kind.

533
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,320
Let's go.

534
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,960
Hurry.

535
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,720
Feik.

536
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,120
It's the Jin Yi Pavilion.

537
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,120
alturaρα

538
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
Check it out on the map.

539
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,640
Arrest the доступ option.

540
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,360
The possession is to be lost.

541
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,400
Please prepare for the other cons汉

542
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:22,760
His Majesty will know if I have property to build

543
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,680
Do I have to go?

544
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,080
Marquis Zhongyong will definitely let Qin Wan go.

545
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm not going.

546
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,400
You're the only girl in the political party

547
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
that's held once a year in the palace.

548
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,000
We're a family.

549
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,400
It's boring if you don't come.

550
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,000
Who am I with?

551
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,400
We were not worshiped by the same ancestors

552
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,560
twenty years ago.

553
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,160
I don't want to poison people.

554
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,040
I don't want people to see me as an outsider.

555
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm not comfortable.

556
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,800
You're not an outsider.

557
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm leaving.

558
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,000
You...

559
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,200
I'll go to pay respect to Madam

560
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,720
tomorrow morning.

561
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,680
Okay.

562
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,520
I'll wait for you.

563
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,200
Why are you here?

564
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,240
Brother Qi asked me to prepare some jewelry.

565
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,640
I have to teach you the etiquette and rules of the palace.

566
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,800
You don't know

567
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,800
that all the nobles in the capital

568
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
are very hardworking.

569
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,840
If I don't teach you anything,

570
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,560
how can I let you enter the wolf den?

571
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,440
What are you afraid of?

572
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
I can't understand it when I go to the inn.

573
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,240
I won't move or say anything.

574
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,120
It's useless to admit that they are hardworking.

575
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,600
You're so smart.

576
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
You can do everything you want.

577
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,000
Ning,

578
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,760
I only want to tell you one thing.

579
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,560
I'm going to the palace to visit the Empress Dowager.

580
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,880
If anyone bullies you,

581
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,080
just beat them back.

582
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
It's the way of the fish.

583
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,320
My grandmother is very stubborn.

584
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,080
Brother Qi,

585
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,160
you should tell me

586
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,640
not to be too harsh.

587
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,920
Brother Qi,

588
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,240
why don't you ask Waner

589
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,800
what she's feeding?

590
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,920
Do I need to ask Waner?

591
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
This is a toast.

592
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,880
It's not a thousand cups of wine.

593
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,400
It can be a hundred cups.

594
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,200
I want it, too.

595
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,240
Why are you a girl?

596
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,560
Why am I not?

597
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,880
Give it back.

598
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,520
Even if

599
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,880
I have to stay on for a month,

600
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,120
then why can't I go to the palace

601
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,320
and visit the Empress Dowager for her?

602
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,400
Anppenapa will blame me

603
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,800
if I working in the palace for too long.

604
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,400
When my mother and father

605
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,160
find out about these Theater of Magic wasn't here,

606
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
the government will beаничed against me for unforeseen reasons.

607
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,120
If all my family members

608
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,600
in the palace

609
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,160
vote against me for the throat cosmetic,

610
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,760
can sit under me

611
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,720
without considering his identity.

612
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,360
Guards.

613
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Change his seat.

614
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,760
His Majesty asked Noble Consort Su to accompany me to the palace.

615
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,400
His Majesty allowed me to sit on the throne.

616
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,880
If Her Highness has any doubts,

617
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,320
it's the Empress' honor to hurt her.

618
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,760
The one sitting on the throne

619
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,000
is Princess Yanzhen, the empress's legitimate daughter.

620
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,840
The one sitting on the throne is Feng Chenbi.

621
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,200
His father, Duke of China, is Noble Consort Su's relative.

622
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,360
They are born to be enemies.

623
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,080
But as long as they meet Qin Zhaoyu,

624
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,040
they will become allies immediately.

625
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,040
Feng Chenbi also treats His Highness...

626
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,120
The past and present disputes between maids

627
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,080
are not all for men, right?

628
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,120
This banquet was accompanied by Noble Consort Su.

629
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,920
The Empress didn't participate.

630
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,960
You know who is the most popular one, right?

631
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,600
The concubines in the harem are very competitive.

632
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,080
They fight for their children.

633
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
If they are favored by their mother, they will be favored by their children.

634
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,160
Naturally, the King of Cheng is always trying to suppress the Crown Prince.

635
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,680
Now your family wants to marry you into the palace.

636
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
You have to be very careful.

637
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,320
You can't be a good person.

638
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,440
It's so lively today.

639
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,120
Yes.

640
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,120
Are you vague?

641
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,600
Your aunt should observe the futureメIis populations for said good.

642
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,640
Thanks to the experience of the Empress,

643
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,200
Qin Zhaoyu, she is now the agencies of Her Majesty,

644
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,460
Emperor.

645
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,200
His Majesty arrives.

646
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,340
sedan

647
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,340
sedan

648
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,800
sedan

649
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,000
sedan

650
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,300
music

651
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,860
good night evolution

652
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,180
I wish I was on his side

653
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,420
You guys get it

654
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,960
thank you

655
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,880
My god

656
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,380
Gang

657
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,700
car

658
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,740
this is

659
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,660
hated

660
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,260
Your Majesty, yes.

661
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

662
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,740
Long live Your Majesty.

663
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,780
No need to bow.

664
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

665
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,420
Princess Royal

666
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,620
has informed me of your trip to Jingzhou.

667
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,300
In the letter, she even mentioned

668
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,180
to let me take care of her little girl.

669
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,500
If that's not good,

670
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,500
she'll come to the capital with a whip.

671
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,900
I'm really worried.

672
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,460
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

673
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,140
I'll take good care of myself

674
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,860
and won't make you worry.

675
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,340
Your Majesty, don't worry.

676
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,340
The prescription I prescribed for you

677
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,460
will help you get rid of the fever.

678
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,700
She hasn't been able to get a whip for a long time.

679
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,420
The medicine of Lady Qin Jiu is so brilliant.

680
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,540
It can even change one's temper.

681
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,860
Your Majesty,

682
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,700
I've been studying

683
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,180
and I saw it with my own eyes.

684
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,660
In Jingzhou, everyone is called the little fairy.

685
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,620
The little fairy who came out of the mansion

686
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,540
to cure the disease?

687
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,940
She's really a great person.

688
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,060
She's much better than

689
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,260
the most talented women in the capital.

690
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,260
Women have their own talents.

691
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,060
Why do you have to compare?

692
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,100
Whether it's calligraphy, medicine, or women's crafts,

693
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,620
women who are well-known and sensible

694
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,380
are all worthy of respect.

695
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,180
Good.

696
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,980
What Lady Qin Jiu said is very impressive.

697
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,740
You may leave.

698
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

699
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,060
Why isn't my brother going in?

700
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,540
Is he waiting for me?

701
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,740
Or is he afraid that my father will ask about the case of the folk girl?

702
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,380
If I had known that you were so concerned about this case,

703
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,820
I should have let you handle it.

704
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,260
My brother is the Crown Prince of the Jingji of the Gongwei.

705
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,060
I'm just a Prince of Cheng.

706
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,420
How dare I compare with the Crown Prince?

707
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,500
Your Highness, Your Highness.

708
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I'm sorry for not being able to help you.

709
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
I'm afraid that you'll be too tired.

710
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,540
Your Highness, Your Highness.

711
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,380
The officials are waiting outside.

712
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,180
Send them in.

713
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,860
Yes.

714
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,180
May your father live a long and happy life.

715
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,100
May your Majesty live a long and happy life.

716
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,020
Rise.

717
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

718
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,460
Sit down.

719
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,300
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

720
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,420
Come, everyone.

721
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,220
Drink up the cupping.

722
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,660
May your spirit and mind be healthy.

723
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,980
May your spirit and mind be healthy, Your Majesty.

724
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,600
supported by theés 연

725
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,780
across the United Kingdom

726
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,860
from China

727
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,700
to Beijing

728
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,940
sniffing

729
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:08,660
its

730
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,780
Hai

731
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,100
Army

732
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,560
It isn't a big deal.

733
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,360
Seeing because I'm sick,

734
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,600
I can't just let Wushuang Ziyang pass it on.

735
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,520
This is not the year I expected.

736
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,880
Lord Xu Whitian must be worried long.

737
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,980
Business concerns me.

738
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,120
I need a moment to pixelate myself even more.

739
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,080
Mister Yin,

740
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
I have something to report.

741
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,580
What is it, Song Qing?

742
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,780
Your Majesty,

743
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,140
on the New Year's Eve,

744
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,580
when the people celebrated the New Year,

745
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,340
I thought of those miserable women

746
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,900
and their families.

747
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,380
I felt so uneasy.

748
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,180
They were so heartbroken.

749
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,580
How could they live with the family?

750
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,300
The time has come.

751
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,300
Please let the case proceed.

752
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,500
The case has progressed.

753
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
It will soothe the people's hearts.

754
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,300
Father,

755
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,900
the case has progressed.

756
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
It will be over soon.

757
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
What has progressed?

758
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,700
I...

759
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,100
I...

760
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,700
I have something to report.

761
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,900
Go ahead.

762
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,100
Your Majesty,

763
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,500
the case of the women in the capital

764
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,300
has been solved today.

765
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,500
It's because the Crown Prince

766
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
is unwilling to mention it

767
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,100
at the Chuxi family banquet.

768
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,700
So I didn't dare to report it.

769
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,100
This is the report

770
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,300
written by the government of the Jingzhao Prefecture.

771
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,500
It's the report of the case

772
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,300
written by the government of the Jingzhao Prefecture.

773
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,700
Please read it.

774
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,300
The criminal is cold-blooded and cruel.

775
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,500
Thanks to the arrival of the Prefect of Jingzhao Prefecture,

776
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
he saved the innocent girl.

777
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,100
This tailor

778
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,500
hates women

779
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,500
and kills them because of their high price.

780
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,500
In this country,

781
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,100
if there is such a case,

782
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
I will not let you go.

783
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,300
You are such a

784
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,300
vicious and vicious person.

785
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,700
Your Majesty,

786
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
this man

787
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,300
was abused by his mother

788
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,900
and left a deep scar.

789
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Although his cruelty is not only one side,

790
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,700
he is not related to the government

791
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,100
because of his personal interests.

792
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,300
The case of the ghost and chess

793
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
can be solved within a few days.

794
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,300
It shows that

795
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
the government is young.

796
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,900
That's great.

797
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,500
Get up and talk.

798
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

799
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,100
The Crown Prince and Zheng Qing

800
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,900
have worked hard.

801
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,300
But in Zheng Qing's report,

802
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,500
I found some obvious clues

803
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,300
found by the coroner.

804
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
Why didn't such a talent

805
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,500
do anything before?

806
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,500
Your Majesty,

807
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,900
this coroner

808
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,300
is the Crown Prince Shaobao,

809
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,700
Marquis Zhongyong, Qin Shu,

810
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,500
who recently recommended the Crown Prince.

811
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,900
Your Majesty,

812
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,900
I will do my best

813
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,700
to help the country.

814
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,900
Qin Qing, you have a good intention.

815
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,300
Your Majesty,

816
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,900
I have another report to report.

817
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
Please read it.

818
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,500
About...

819
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,900
State Off interpretation.

820
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,500
Marquis Zhongyong

821
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
strongly coffers a record

822
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,380
to help the country

823
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,980
over his Born in Me too two years ago.

824
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,680
He texts them

825
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,580
and chocolate bar.

826
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,960
The

827
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,160
How could you make such a big mistake?

828
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,760
I'm willing to guarantee for the government

829
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,320
that everything in the memorial is true.

830
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,760
I'll send you

831
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,920
to destroy the evidence

832
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,560
and arrest the person who hindered the case.

833
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

834
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,560
Crown Prince, you're well-behaved

835
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,880
and thoughtful.

836
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,160
It's the season of new spring.

837
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,160
We should

838
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,960
wish for peace and prosperity.

839
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,320
Thank you for your praise, Father.

840
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,640
All right, sit down.

841
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,960
Thank you, Father.

842
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,600
Come on,

843
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,440
raise your glasses.

844
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,040
We here

845
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,200
wish for peace and prosperity.

846
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,880
We wish you peace and prosperity.

847
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,220
locate the government

848
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,620
Your Majesty.

849
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,500
Are you feeling ill?

850
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,700
It hurts my chest.

851
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,860
Do you need a doctor?

852
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,280
No need.

853
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,040
It's the same every year.

854
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,320
Don't alert His Majesty during the New Year.

855
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,240
I'm so bored.

856
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,720
Help me out for some fresh air.

857
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,440
Yes.

858
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,640
Be careful.

859
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,440
Your Highness. Your Highness.

860
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,760
Your Highness. Your Highness.

861
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,160
Someone!

862
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Call the imperial physician.

863
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,880
Send him to Chongming Hall and report to His Majesty.

864
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,120
Yes.

865
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Your Highness. Your Highness.

866
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,360
Changb beaucoup ih!

867
00:40:52,200 --> 00:41:21,800
The fact that Yang Jian made such a direct Ц induce us to fear empy Song and

868
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Fifteen fame

869
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Bravo!

870
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,040
Chen Yanchi,

871
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,160
I wish Your Majesty

872
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,720
a great success.

873
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:57,960
Isn't he

874
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,920
the seventh son-in-law?

875
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,680
In the blink of an eye,

876
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,560
how did you become

877
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,720
the fake general?

878
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,400
Your Majesty,

879
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,600
I'm a man of honor

880
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,800
and a man of virtue.

881
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,480
I'll do my best

882
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,680
to destroy the evil and

883
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,760
be filial to Your Majesty.

884
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,400
Good.

885
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,560
You're a good destroyer.

886
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,920
Then I'll

887
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,160
appoint you as the Minister of Justice.

888
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,840
Your Majesty,

889
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,880
please give me

890
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,960
a fair trial.

891
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

892
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,120
Good.

893
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,040
You may rise.

894
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

895
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,160
The seventh son-in-law

896
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,040
is really thoughtful.

897
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,080
Since the promise has been made,

898
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,440
then Your Majesty,

899
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,400
please come with me

900
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,960
to the Zhenghua School

901
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
to celebrate

902
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,840
the same day with the people.

903
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

904
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,440
Good.

905
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,360
Your Majesty.

906
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,280
Your Majesty,

907
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:58,960
the Empress Dowager...

908
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,360
The Empress Dowager is ill.

909
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,160
What's wrong with the Empress Dowager?

910
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,440
She has an emergency illness.

911
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,960
Then why didn't you invite the imperial physician?

912
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,800
All the officials in the Imperial Hospital

913
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,320
are all in Funing Palace.

914
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,640
But the medicine is ready.

915
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,960
The Empress Dowager can't drink it.

916
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,160
It's not going to work.

917
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,520
Prepare the rice.

918
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,520
Yes.

919
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,280
Waner,

920
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,480
go and see the Empress Dowager.

921
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,480
She's taking me to the Palace.

922
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,880
The situation is not clear now.

923
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,760
If someone makes a move,

924
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,600
I'm afraid someone will take advantage of it.

925
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,280
Don't worry.

926
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:39,920
If there's a chance,

927
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,160
I'll help you.

928
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:41,960
Okay.

929
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,600
Your Majesty.

930
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,360
Your Majesty,

931
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,480
the situation is not clear now.

932
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,360
If the people

933
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,160
can't see the Empress Dowager and the Crown Prince,

934
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,080
they'll be worried about the people's safety.

935
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,080
Your Majesty.

936
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,560
Your Majesty.

937
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,480
What if you make a move?

938
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,880
The Empress Dowager's words

939
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,440
are not only sugar-coated but also immunity fluid.

940
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,200
Đi later makes the 2025 Chinese re tram en FaceIt Click it the happy calendar

941
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,960
Đi later make the 2025 Chinese re tram en FaceIt Click it on hurts

942
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,440
Du hai completely nor are we on Mars

943
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,680
Du hai completely nor are we on Mars

944
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,080
It's the only way the fate is Kontra

945
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,280
And also Vashe is joined Too late

946
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,560
And also vashe is joined

947
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,000
All of our lives are going to bear fruit

948
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,000
But we want to be satisfied

949
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The fire is moving in the snow

950
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So cold, so warm

951
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:04,000
If a dust falls into the shadow

952
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The snow falls, a body is white

953
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
If a body is dark, it can be engraved in the heart

954
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Pain will also be buried

955
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Open your heart, love doesn't matter the deep sea

956
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Please give me courage, let fate be open

957
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Don't be afraid of the starlight being covered by the night sky

958
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:55,000
The stars will shine outside the sky

959
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:06,000
The sky is dim like a pillow, but it is the color of the star

960
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:34,000
The sky is dim like a pillow, but it is the color of the star
