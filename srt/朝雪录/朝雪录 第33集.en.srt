00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,950
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,270
On the night Consort Jin passed away,

4
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,030
I was on duty at Yingyang Gate.

5
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,640
After the incident,

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560
before Prince Jin's guard, Song Xiwen,

7
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,280
could be detained
by the Court of Judicial Review,

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,539
the Empress seized him

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,680
and sent him to
the Imperial Punishment Department.

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,410
She then ordered me to secretly

11
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,210
take the body out of the palace.

12
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,229
What makes you so sure
this was the Empress's doing?

13
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,840
How could the Empress summon
a mere palace guard like you?

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,370
It was my godfather, Wan Xi,

15
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,390
who passed the message to me.

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
He serves only the Empress

17
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,560
and has her complete trust.

18
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,470
Where did you take the body?

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,800
It was hidden in a secret compartment
under the night soil cart.

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,990
Under the cover of darkness,

21
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,250
I took it out of the city

22
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,360
and buried it on Qiwu Mountain.

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,120
Nonsense!

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,750
The body was clearly found
in the backyard of Prince Jin's mansion.

25
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,710
Be honest!

26
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,150
I swear I'm not lying!

27
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,200
I really did take Song Xiwen's body

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,550
and bury it in the mountains.

29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,710
I really have no idea

30
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,970
how the body ended up
at Prince Jin's mansion.

31
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,280
Then how can you be certain

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,329
that the dead man was Song Xiwen?

33
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,260
Song Xiwen often

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,150
accompanied Prince Jin into the palace,

35
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,190
and I'd seen him

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,560
during my shifts.

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,740
Did you see Song Xiwen's body
with your own eyes?

38
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,070
What was its condition?

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,560
It was only

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,000
when I was about to bury the body

41
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,070
that I noticed it was somewhat stiff,

42
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,750
with blood marks from torture

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,020
but no wounds on the face.

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,650
That's how I recognized him as Song Xiwen.

45
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,460
Bai Feng,

46
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,440
take him to confirm the burial site.

47
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,170
Yes, Master.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,560
Bai Feng,

49
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,970
if you find these seeds at the location
Wang Han mentioned,

50
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,330
that will confirm
where the body was originally buried.

51
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,680
Yes.

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,840
Let's go.

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,770
Wang Han was likely telling the truth.

54
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,210
I found these

55
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,780
on the body during my initial examination.

56
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,260
These are Vaccinium bracteatum seeds.

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,050
They help calm the mind and stop coughs.

58
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,600
They typically grow deep
in remote mountain forests.

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,530
So they couldn't possibly appear
in the backyard of Prince Jin's mansion.

60
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,180
At that time, I suspected
that the body had been moved,

61
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,579
but Li Muyun was present,

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,780
so I held my tongue.

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,770
You were right not to say anything.

64
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,810
I once suspected the Empress was
involved in Prince Jin's case.

65
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,160
If Song Xiwen's death

66
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,840
was truly the Empress's doing,

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,430
then Prince Jin might still have a chance
to clear his name.

68
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm just afraid that when that happens,

69
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,090
the Crown Prince will certainly
be stripped of his title.

70
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,820
If Li Muyun hadn't intervened,

71
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,810
the Marquis of Zhongyong
would never have let you  off.

72
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,160
As long as we're together,

73
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,690
I'm not afraid of any storm.

74
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,720
Mother,

75
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,600
where do you feel unwell?

76
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,840
Have you summoned Wan to check on you?

77
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,279
I just didn't sleep well last night.

78
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,450
What troubles you so much

79
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,280
that you cannot sleep at night, Mother?

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,840
Have a seat. Sit first.

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,720
Thank you, Mother.

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
In what seems like the blink of an eye,

83
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,770
even your hair has turned gray.

84
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,520
My health is failing day by day,

85
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,360
and I don't know
how much longer I can hold on.

86
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,970
I had hoped

87
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,920
that with Lin as your right hand,

88
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,940
I could rest easy even in death.

89
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,940
I never imagined
that he would die before me.

90
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,840
I called you here today

91
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,890
to discuss

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,010
having Chi inherit the title
as soon as possible.

93
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,350
So he can then take on
his father's responsibilities

94
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,290
and protect you.

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,400
What do you think?

96
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,580
Since he's to inherit the title...

97
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,770
well,

98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,140
Li

99
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,110
has been the Heir of Prince Yi
for many years now.

100
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,470
Taking this opportunity,

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
we might as well confer titles upon
both of them together.

102
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,190
You truly treat Li like your own son.

103
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,590
Li is my godson,

104
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,080
so I naturally favor him a bit more.

105
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,000
It's also to repay

106
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,710
Prince Yi for risking his life
to save mine years ago.

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,840
When all is said and done,

108
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,240
it's all fate.

109
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,330
Then I ask one thing of you:

110
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,659
no matter

111
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,440
what happens in the future,

112
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,650
you must treat Chi well.

113
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,140
Mother, please rest assured.

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,450
I promise you,

115
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,730
as long as Chi

116
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,220
doesn't commit any capital offenses,

117
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,300
I will ensure his safety

118
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,570
for the rest of my life.

119
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,890
Good.

120
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,040
Good.

121
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,720
Now I can rest easy.

122
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,040
Your Highness, I've confessed everything,

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,970
and the burial site has been found.

124
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Please show mercy

125
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,140
and spare my life, Your Highness.

126
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,020
I can spare you,

127
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,690
but you must do something for me.

128
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,400
As long as Your Highness spares my life,

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,380
I'll do

130
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,590
whatever you say.

131
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,630
Turn yourself in to Prince Cheng.

132
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,970
No, no, I can't.

133
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,400
The Empress's maternal family has
eyes and ears everywhere.

134
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,460
Once I show myself,

135
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,020
I'll be dead anyway.

136
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,590
As long as you confess

137
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,180
that the Empress ordered you to
dispose of Song Xiwen's body,

138
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,850
Prince Cheng will ensure
you can see His Majesty alive.

139
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,220
But she's the Empress!

140
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,020
For the sake of royal dignity,

141
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,770
His Majesty will have me silenced!

142
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,130
You're just a palace guard.

143
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,240
What does royal dignity
have to do with you?

144
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,570
Since I'm telling you to turn yourself in,

145
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,170
I have ways to keep you alive.

146
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,840
If you refuse,

147
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,160
the moment you leave this mansion,

148
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,130
you'll be hunted
by both Prince Cheng's men

149
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,590
and the Empress's forces.

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,580
You'll probably die even faster.

151
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
Then what should I...

152
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,630
tell Prince Cheng?

153
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,720
Tell the truth.

154
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,720
However,

155
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,530
Prince Cheng and I don't get along.

156
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,130
If you want his protection,

157
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,130
don't mention that I saved you.

158
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:27,980
Alright.

159
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,130
I'll do as Your Highness says.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,450
[Court of Judicial Review]

161
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Song Xiwen has been dead for so long.

162
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,010
Why have you only come forward
and confessed now?

163
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,130
My godfather said

164
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,840
that someone of high status gave orders

165
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
for me to lay low for a while

166
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,860
so as not to let any word slip out.

167
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,720
Because my family urgently needed money,

168
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,920
I came back secretly,

169
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,800
hoping to get some money
from my godfather,

170
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,930
only to learn that he'd been arrested.

171
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,159
That was when I knew
how serious things were.

172
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,159
Song Xiwen was a large man,

173
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,120
and his body was heavy.

174
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,730
How did you manage to

175
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,530
dispose of his body so quietly
on your own?

176
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,690
When I took over,

177
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,130
his body

178
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,970
was already in the night soil cart.

179
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,840
The person who handed it to me was...

180
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,010
a eunuch named Kang Bowen.

181
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,260
Minister Li, you can verify this
through a simple investigation.

182
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,690
Is...

183
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,440
what you're saying true?

184
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,310
If I've spoken even half a lie,

185
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,030
may Heaven strike me down,

186
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,330
and may I die a terrible death!

187
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,090
Very well!

188
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,330
Guard,

189
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
arrest Kang Bowen immediately!

190
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,940
Yes, Your Highness.

191
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:38,789
Your Highness,

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,169
a eunuch's body was found in the well

193
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,740
at the Harem Attendants Bureau
in the North Garden.

194
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,600
It's said to be Kang Bowen,
the head of the Harem Attendants Bureau.

195
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,450
What?

196
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,890
Note this:

197
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,570
the deceased was Kang Bowen.

198
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,700
There's mud around his mouth and nose.

199
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,690
No injuries to the back of his head.

200
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,570
There's an abrasion on his forehead,

201
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,370
likely from hitting the well wall
during the fall.

202
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,290
Note this:

203
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,820
the deceased's shoe soles

204
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,930
have traces of moss and mud,

205
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,290
yet the moss along the well's rim
shows only footprints

206
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,810
and no slip marks.

207
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,450
This indicates that the deceased

208
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,710
didn't accidentally fall into the well.

209
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,170
Apply white vinegar to the body's skin.

210
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,360
Apply more to the shoulders, arms,
and wrists.

211
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,520
If he had been forced to
jump into the well,

212
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,840
there should be marks of

213
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,040
dragging or binding.

214
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,670
All bones are intact,

215
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,510
with only a few abrasions on the body.

216
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,580
I need to open the chest cavity

217
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,780
to determine the actual cause of death.

218
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,180
Stop!

219
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,370
This person was a suspect
in the Song Xiwen case.

220
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,680
Without my permission,

221
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,720
how dare you conduct an autopsy here?

222
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,450
Kang Bowen was a palace eunuch.

223
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,480
The Empress Dowager personally ordered
Princess Yongci and me to

224
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,290
assist the Imperial Punishment Department
in determining the cause of death.

225
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,130
If Your Highness Prince Cheng has
any objections,

226
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,410
feel free to ask Her Majesty
to withdraw her order.

227
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:25,810
You...

228
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,910
Your Highness,

229
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,360
Princess Yongci's skills as a coroner

230
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,420
are unparalleled.

231
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,630
Surely,

232
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,290
with Her Highness's assistance,

233
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,820
the truth behind this case
will come to light.

234
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,880
There's water in the deceased's lungs.

235
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,590
He must have been alive
before falling into the water,

236
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,520
which confirms death by drowning.

237
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,700
Based on the current findings,

238
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,520
I believe

239
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,520
that Kang Bowen did indeed commit suicide
by jumping into the well.

240
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,720
Within the harem,

241
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,690
the one who could easily silence Wan Xi

242
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,420
and drive Kang Bowen to suicide

243
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,850
can only be the one in the Fengyi Palace.

244
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Imperial power is always blinding.

245
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,310
Especially

246
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,670
when she's a mother
who loves her son dearly.

247
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,180
Leave us.

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,570
Mother,

249
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,330
Kang Bowen committed suicide

250
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,690
by jumping into a well.
His body has been found,

251
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,410
and it was Qin Wan
who performed the autopsy.

252
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,240
What does Kang Bowen's suicide

253
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,010
have to do with you?

254
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,760
Yan Qi has captured Wang Han.

255
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,720
He confessed and implicated Kang Bowen,

256
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,770
and also confessed

257
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,700
that you ordered him to
dispose of Song Xiwen's body.

258
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,450
Is that true?

259
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,000
Complete nonsense!

260
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,530
I meant well by letting Song Xiwen go.

261
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,970
How could I have known
he would be murdered?

262
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,500
Yan Qi thinks
he can just arrest a few servants

263
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,330
and use them to implicate and challenge
your position as Crown Prince?

264
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,530
It won't be that easy.

265
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,690
Mother...

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,530
let's not fight for
the throne anymore, okay?

267
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,300
If it comes to it,
I'll give up being Crown Prince.

268
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,570
Say that again,

269
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,240
and I'll die right here in front of you!

270
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,050
As long as there's breath left in us,

271
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,450
we must fight for the throne
to the very end!

272
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,170
Only by claiming that throne

273
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,370
can you make your father...

274
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,170
can you make your father pay for

275
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,110
his indifference toward us.

276
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,780
Mother, please calm down.

277
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,040
I was wrong.

278
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,890
I was wrong.

279
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,300
Your expression, especially around
the eyes, looks just like his.

280
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,410
If he saw you,

281
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,110
he would surely be delighted.

282
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,720
Mother,

283
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,100
what are you talking about?

284
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,090
Who is "he"?

285
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,480
Your father, of course.

286
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,050
Che.

287
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,640
Remember this:

288
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,210
as long as there's breath left,

289
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,940
you must fight for the throne
to the very end.

290
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,520
I will remember, Mother.

291
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,330
Swear to me.

292
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,030
Even if one day I am gone...

293
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,490
you must keep your promise.

294
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,090
Mother.

295
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,050
Swear it!

296
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,650
Heaven above bears witness,

297
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,050
I, Yan Che, hereby swear:

298
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,740
even if

299
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,720
I alone survive in this world,

300
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,240
I will still fight

301
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,230
to claim the throne!

302
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,480
If you break this oath...

303
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,790
If I break this oath,

304
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,970
may I be eternally condemned to
live as a beast

305
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,260
and never

306
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,450
be reborn as a human.

307
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,840
By Heaven's mandate,

308
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
I, the Emperor,

309
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,880
hereby appoint Yan Chi,
Heir of Prince Rui,

310
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,120
to succeed to the title of Prince Rui.

311
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,480
Prince Rui Yan Chi

312
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,880
is devout and respectful,

313
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,360
honors Heaven and Earth,

314
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,170
follows the principles of nature,

315
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,210
and upholds the royal family
and the state through virtue.

316
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,360
Today, I appoint Yan Chi as Prince Rui,

317
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,090
grant him the royal seal,

318
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,520
and bestow upon him the hereditary title
along with endless imperial favor.

319
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,640
Thus decreed!

320
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
I, Prince Rui Yan Chi,

321
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,070
thank Your Majesty for this great honor.

322
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,690
Your Highness,

323
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,240
with your succession and marriage,
you have double happiness.

324
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,600
This humble servant wishes you
and Princess Yongci

325
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,690
many children

326
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,090
and a long life together.

327
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,840
[Prince Rui's Mansion]

328
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,520
Chi!

329
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,220
Chi!

330
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,330
I've inherited a title too!

331
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm now Prince Yi!

332
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,680
His Majesty isn't
just toying with me, is he?

333
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,360
His Majesty's words are law.

334
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,170
Do you think he jokes like you do?

335
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,970
Right, right.

This humble servant congratulates
Your Highness Prince Yi.

339

His Majesty has high hopes for you

and will soon send you to
the Ministry of Personnel for training.

341

You must make His Majesty proud.

at the Ministry of Personnel?

344
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,330
With my temperament,

345
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,640
how can I possibly sit still in an office?

346
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,050
Is His Majesty trying to drive me crazy?

347
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
Why are you looking so glum, Prince Yi?

348
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,810
Are you not satisfied
even after becoming a prince?

349
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,610
Do you want to reach for the moon?

Look at you?

You want me to compliment you, don't you?

361
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,210
Your robe looks quite impressive,

362
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,140
and the color really brings out
your gallant spirit.

363

Before,

366

the capital was full of royal kin,

367
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,810
and I was the only outsider.

368

Now,

369

I've inherited a royal title,

370
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,819
and His Majesty values me greatly.

371

If you marry me,

372
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,369
I can't promise you a life of
extravagant luxury,

373

but you'll never go hungry

374
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,980
or face others' contempt.

375

In my heart,

No matter what compensation he asks for,

383
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,480
I'll do everything in my power
to give it to him.

I won't marry anyone else either.

505
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,930
Fighting poison with poison?

506
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,580
These spiders, centipedes, and snakes—

507
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,540
if Yan eats them, he'll die!

508
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,080
Then what's the point of curing his eyes?

509
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,530
You...

510
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,190
Ning,

511
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,970
don't be mad.

512
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,520
Li means well.

513
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,310
Li,

514
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,630
thank you for these...

515
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,460
"medicinal ingredients."

516
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,280
Come on,

517
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,890
return to my residence with me.

518
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,930
Stay with me for a while,

519
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,190
and let's have a drink.

520
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,930
To be honest with you, Yan,

521
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,690
His Majesty hasn't been
in a good mood lately

522
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,040
and keeps making me study affairs
at the Ministry of Personnel.

523
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,080
Once His Majesty decides to
cut me some slack,

524
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,410
I'll definitely pay you a proper visit.

525
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,290
Working at the Ministry of Personnel

526
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,360
has always been

527
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,800
a necessary path for princes' training.

528
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,560
Li, many would envy

529
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,330
how much His Majesty values you.

530
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,970
Alright,

531
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,340
get back to your lessons.

532
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,210
And don't bring

533
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,840
these things to Yan.

534
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,630
They'll only slow his recovery.

535
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,260
Yeah,

536
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,350
that was pointless of me, okay?

537
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,350
I will definitely find

538
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,150
better medicinal herbs for  Yan.

539
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,070
I take my leave.

540
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:55,780

588
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Lately,

589
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,980
I've been feeling uneasy.

590
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,610
I can never quite figure out

591
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,670
what His Majesty truly intends to do.

592
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,080
You mean

593
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,970
that His Majesty has only
temporarily confined the Empress

594
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,830
and doesn't intend to depose her?

595
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,890
Deposing the Empress would shake
the foundations of the country.

596
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,150
It would require not only solid evidence

597
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,010
but also formal petitions
from court officials

598
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,060
before His Majesty could take such action.

599
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,070
Given His Majesty's harshness toward
the Crown Prince,

600
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,330
the Empress's confinement is likely
to be only temporary.

601
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,680
Deposing the Empress

602
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,590
is merely a matter of time.

603
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,420
Are you worried

604
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,350
that His Majesty wants to use
Prince Jin's case to depose the Empress?

605
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,480
I don't know either.

606
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,800
The Empress still refuses to say
why she wanted Song Xiwen dead.

607
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,720
If His Majesty meant to
depose her over that,

608
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,850
he could've simply reopened
Prince Jin's case.

609
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,560
So why would he have Prince Cheng
investigate Song Xiwen's death,

610
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,760
forcing him to turn against
his own brother, the Crown Prince?

611
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,560
And Yan Li.

612
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,760
Why would His Majesty

613
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,070
assign him to the Ministry of Personnel,

614
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,620
such a prominent position?

615
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,650
With His Majesty's discernment,

616
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,110
he must know
that Yan Li is neither suited for

617
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,620
nor willing to undertake this position.

618
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,450
Could it be

619
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,850
that His Majesty plans to
make Prince Cheng the new Crown Prince,

620
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,510
using Yan Li to toughen him up?

621
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,430
I keep feeling the truth is within reach,

622
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,610
yet I can't grasp it.

623
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,650
If you can't figure it out,
don't think about it for now.

624
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,560
The Empress Dowager once warned me

625
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,820
that we should stay far from that throne.

626
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,610
She must have

627
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,490
foreseen the chaos that would ensue.

628
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Having you inherit your title early

629
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,360
was her way of giving us a shield.

630
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,040
Indeed.

631
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,520
Given His Majesty's deep wariness of
the Shuoxi Army,

632
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,480
I doubt I'd have inherited
the title so quickly

633
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,940
if the Empress Dowager hadn't spoken
for me.

634
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,930
But if Yan Qi ascends to the throne,

635
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,780
your princely title

636
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,810
may not be enough to protect us.

637
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,980
Don't worry.

638
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,190
He won't get the chance.

639
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,530
Let's go to sleep now.

640
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,920
We need to conserve our strength

641
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,179
to deal with those beasts that lie ahead.

642
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,560
It was wrong of Mother
to secretly release

643
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,469
Song Xiwen.

644
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,409
But Mother has always been upright
in conduct.

645
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,400
She would never take someone's life.

646
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,929
There must be someone
plotting behind this.

647
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,449
Father, I beg you
to investigate thoroughly.

648
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,710
Whether there's a conspirator or not...

649
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,690
see for yourself!

650
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,639
No.

651
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,750
Mother would never lie to me.

652
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,940
Mother couldn't possibly do
such a thing, Father!

653
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,190
The evidence before us is irrefutable,

654
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,640
yet you remain so stubbornly blind.

655
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,250
Tell me,

656
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,360
during your confinement,

657
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,440
have you taken a single moment
to reflect upon yourself?

658
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,430
I

659
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,190
have been negligent and complacent,

660
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,250
failing to live up to your teachings.

661
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,450
But as the head of the harem,

662
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,330
Mother truly has no reason

663
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,190
to kill a mere guard of Prince Jin.

664
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,560
Wang Han, a palace guard, dared to flee.

665
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,600
How can
such an untrustworthy person's testimony

666
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,370
be trusted, Father?

667
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,160
Then, by your logic,

668
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,520
I've indulged

669
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,120
this treacherous person in
slandering my Empress?

670
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,640
In your eyes,

671
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,370
am I

672
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,330
just a muddle-headed ruler

673
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,610
who can be easily manipulated by others?

674
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,680
I never dared to think that.

675
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,770
I spoke rashly.

676
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,760
Please forgive me, Father.

677
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,550
Father.

678
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,270
Father, please calm your anger.

679
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
The Empress has committed
such a serious crime.

680
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,080
It's understandable
that Che loses his composure

681
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,340
out of concern for her.

682
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,120
But

683
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,040
the witness and his testimony
are both here.

684
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,770
Che, you should consider this:

685
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,600
before Kang Bowen
threw himself into the well,

686
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,330
he was summoned by the Empress.

687
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,810
If she hadn't pressured him,

688
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,410
why would he have given up his position
as the head of the Harem Attendants Bureau

689
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,820
and taken his own life for no reason?

690
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,040
Shut up!

691
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,440
Yan Qi,

692
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,610
you must be the one scheming behind this!

693
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,340
How dare you!

694
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,850
I'm still alive,

695
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,600
yet you dare to act so presumptuously.

696
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,630
If you were to

697
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,850
truly sit on this throne one day,

698
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,120
would your brothers have
any chance of surviving?

699
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,540
I may be dull in wit,

700
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,350
but I have never coveted power.

701
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,600
My inappropriate behavior
in front of Father today

702
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,120
was only because I couldn't bear to see
Mother being framed by villains.

703
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,600
I'm

704
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,700
willing to accept punishment.

705
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,510
I only beg you, Father,

706
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,020
not to listen to slanderous words

707
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,860
and to restore Mother's innocence soon!

708
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,890
You insolent brat!

709
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,370
I think you've

710
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,850
long forgotten

711
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,120
what loyalty means.

712
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,300
Draft the edict:

713
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,780
the Crown Prince Yan Che

714
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,290
shows favoritism in his actions,

715
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,020
is willful and temperamental,

716
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,200
disrespects my words,

717
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,080
and behaves improperly
in the royal presence.

718
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,140
If such a disloyal and unfilial person
were to be ruler,

719
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,250
what would become of my country?

720
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,750
From this day forward,

721
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,320
Yan Che is stripped of

722
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,090
his position as Crown Prince

723
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,350
and confined to the Imperial Clan Court.

724
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:32,980
Thank you...

725
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,830
for your mercy, Father.

726
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,370
Move aside.

727
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,170
I need to see the Empress.

728
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,680
Your Highness,

729
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,760
without His Majesty's decree,

730
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,490
no one may enter Fengyi Palace.

731
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,560
Fine, I won't enter.

732
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,640
But surely, I can say a few words

733
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,400
through the door, right?

734
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,000
How pitiful.

735
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,170
You're confined here

736
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,560
and don't even know

737
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,090
that your own son has been stripped of
his title as Crown Prince.

738
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,370
I really feel sorry for you.

739
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,320
What nonsense are you spouting?

740
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,520
Che is the only son of His Majesty and me.

741
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,340
No one can challenge his position
as Crown Prince!

742
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,500
Others may not be able to challenge it,

743
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,200
but if His Majesty wants to depose him,

744
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,810
a single imperial edict would suffice.

745
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,010
Poor Crown Prince...

746
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,860
Now I should address him

747
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,970
as the "Second Prince."

748
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,480
Shut up!

749
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,640
Poor Second Prince,

750
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,370
from now on, he can only live in hardship
at the Imperial Clan Court.

751
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,040
And you, you probably won't hold on to

752
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,970
your position as Empress for long.

753
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,070
You and your son may never see
each other again.

754
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,700
Please take care of yourself

755
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,810
and don't be too heartbroken.

756
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,450
Don't be too heartbroken!

757
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,120
You madwoman! Come back!

758
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,850
Come back!

759
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,930
Unlock this door! Unlock this door!

760
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,330
I need to see His Majesty!

761
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,350
Unlock this door!
I need to see His Majesty!

762
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,240
I need to see the Empress Dowager!

763
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Unlock this door!

764
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,480
Unlock this door!

765
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,040
Mother!

766
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,730
Greetings, Mother.

767
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,810
Zhaoyu,

768
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,490
why are you here?

769
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,480
Che hasn't been deposed, right?

770
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,450
Right?

771
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,100
Thanks to His Majesty's mercy,

772
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,520
I was granted special permission

773
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,450
to bid farewell to you

774
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,680
before being sent to
the Imperial Clan Court.

775
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,890
Mother.

776
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,620
He really made his move.

777
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,310
It happened so suddenly.

778
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,370
We cannot just sit and wait for death.

779
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,210
Mother, do you have any good ideas for
saving the Crown Prince from this crisis?

780
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,330
We don't have much time.

781
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,890
Mother, please think of something quickly

782
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,340
so that I can ask my father

783
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,330
to act for us.

784
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,730
Good child.

785
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,040
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

786
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,760
As long as the Empress Dowager is
still alive,

787
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,510
His Majesty won't dare to take
further action against Che for now.

788
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,640
But Prince Cheng

789
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,130
will certainly seize this opportunity
to destroy us completely.

790
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,660
The most important thing now is

791
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,290
to get Che out of
the Imperial Clan Court immediately.

792
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,730
As long as he's alive,

793
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,390
there will always be hope.

794
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,000
Understood.

795
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,810
Congratulations, Your Highness!

796
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,740
How satisfying.

797
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,370
Father has finally confined
that useless fool.

798
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,330
Thank heavens,

799
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,330
Master, your time has finally come.

800
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,930
Is that woman behaving herself today?

801
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,090
Her Highness

802
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,360
went to the palace
to pay her respects to Noble Consort Su.

803
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,000
It's this late,
and she still hasn't come back.

804
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,850
Once I become the Crown Prince,

805
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,330
I'll get rid of her sooner or later.

806
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,750
Don't you want to

807
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,000
give me an explanation about Che?

808
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,000
I understand why you're upset, Mother.

809
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,600
Your deep care for your grandchildren

810
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,810
is their blessing.

811
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,220
But Che is truly lacking in the talent

812
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,330
required to ascend the throne.

813
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,000
A weak ruler with strong ministers

814
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,290
will only plunge the court into chaos.

815
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,500
The longer this is delayed,

816
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,560
the harder it will be
to control the situation.

817
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,520
I know

818
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,680
all of this.

819
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,330
But throughout history,

820
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,060
how many deposed crown princes

821
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,250
have met a good end?

822
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,840
Che is naturally carefree

823
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,080
and has absolutely no desire for power.

824
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,120
I only ask Your Majesty to show mercy

825
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,430
and exile him far away.

826
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,940
If he remains confined
within the Imperial Clan Court,

827
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,750
I'm afraid his fate is sealed.

828
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,330
I...

829
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
will handle this matter carefully.

830
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,820
I still have some memorials
to review today,

831
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,210
so I won't be joining you for the meal.

832
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,810
Mother, please...

833
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,060
rest and take care of yourself.

834
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,680
Huai.

835
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,180
The Empress has been confined to
Fengyi Palace,

836
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,760
while Noble Consort Su is not yet familiar

837
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,970
with managing the harem affairs.

838
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,330
From today on,

839
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,680
let me take charge of

840
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,120
harem matters.

841
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,640
Then,

842
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,550
Mother, please

843
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,970
don't worry about

844
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,890
the state affairs either.

845
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,220
That's how it should be.

846
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,290
Thank you, Mother.

847
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,740
Just wait a little longer.

848
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:39,600
Soon,

849
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,490
the truth will come to light.
