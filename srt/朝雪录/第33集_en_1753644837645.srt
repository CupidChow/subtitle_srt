1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,240
to find Du Xiaoman.

2
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,480
Du Xiaoman wants you to watch

3
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,440
Zhao Xuelu.

4
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,680
On the night when Consort Jin was killed,

5
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,800
I was on duty at Yingyang Gate.

6
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,080
After the incident,

7
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
the guard of Prince Jin, Song Xiwen,

8
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,760
was not arrested by Dali Temple,

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,920
but was captured by the Empress

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,160
to the Yucheng Temple.

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,720
I was ordered to secretly

12
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,560
send Shi Shen out of the palace.

13
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,240
How do you know that it was the Empress?

14
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,280
How could the Empress summon

15
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,400
a lowly guard like you?

16
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,280
My godfather, Wan Xie,

17
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,800
told me that

18
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,160
he only did things for the Empress

19
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,320
and trusted the Empress the most.

20
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,400
Where did you send Shi Shen to?

21
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,720
He was hiding in the dark room

22
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,400
under the night carriage.

23
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,880
I sent him out of the city in the dark

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,320
and buried him in the mountain of Qiwu Mountain.

25
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,960
Nonsense!

26
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,160
Shi Shen was clearly in the backyard of Prince Jin's mansion.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,560
Let him go!

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
I didn't say anything nonsense!

29
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,080
I really buried Song Xiwen's body

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
in the mountain.

31
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,600
I don't know

32
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,440
how Shi Shen

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,880
got into Prince Jin's mansion.

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,440
How could you be sure that

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,040
the dead person must be Song Xiwen?

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,840
Song Xiwen often went to the country with Prince Jin.

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,320
I saw him when I was there.

38
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,400
You saw Song Xiwen's body with your own eyes.

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
What was your description?

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
I found it

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,920
when I was preparing to bury him.

42
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,520
Shi Shen was a little stiff.

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,640
He had a thin blood.

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,880
There was no scar on his face.

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,760
That's how he recognized Song Xiwen.

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Bai Feng.

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,160
Take him to confirm the location of the burial.

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,880
Yes.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,600
Bai Feng.

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,760
If Wang Han said that

51
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,800
there was such a grass,

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,320
he must be hiding somewhere.

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,760
Yes.

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,600
Let's go.

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,000
Wang Han didn't lie.

56
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,080
This is the first time

57
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,480
I found the body of Shi Shen.

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,840
The name Wu Fanzi

59
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,800
has the role of a sedative.

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,960
He usually grows up in the old forest in the mountain.

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,760
He would never appear in the back yard of Prince Jin's mansion.

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,640
I suspected that Shi Shen was touched.

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,560
But I didn't say it when Li Muyun was there.

64
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,840
It's right that you didn't say it.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,160
I suspected that Prince Jin's case was related to the empress.

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,080
If Song Xiwen's death

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,440
was really the empress's hand,

68
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Prince Jin would still have the possibility of committing a crime.

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,360
I'm afraid that

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,720
the crown prince's position in the crown prince's position will be not protected.

71
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,640
If Li Muyun is not protected by the imperial family,

72
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,400
the Empress of Zhongyong will not let you go.

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,920
As long as we are together,

74
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,640
I'm not afraid of any storm.

75
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,480
Mother.

76
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,360
Where is your body?

77
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,800
I can send Yongci to the palace.

78
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,200
I just didn't sleep well last night.

79
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
Why did you make me so worried?

80
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,200
You are so restless at night.

81
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,160
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

82
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,760
Thank you, mother.

83
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,760
In a blink of an eye,

84
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
you are both white.

85
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,320
I'm not in good health.

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
I don't know how long I can last.

87
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,080
I originally thought that

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,880
I could use you as my shield.

89
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,680
I can rest assured.

90
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,800
I didn't expect that he would be in my position.

91
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,640
I called you here today

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,720
to discuss with you.

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,440
As soon as possible,

94
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,280
I will let the seventh son-in-law take the throne.

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,440
What do you think?

96
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,120
Since you want to take the throne,

97
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,080
it's good that Li is the heir to the throne for many years.

98
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,320
At this time,

99
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,560
I'm lucky to have both of his brothers as my side.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,240
You really treat Li as if he were your own son.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,480
Li is my son.

102
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,200
I naturally like him and favor him.

103
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,000
I also want to repay the favor of King Yi

104
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,760
for saving me back then.

105
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,200
It's all about fate.

106
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,120
I want you to promise me

107
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,440
that you will treat the seventh son-in-law

108
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,720
no matter what happens in the future.

109
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,840
Mother, don't worry.

110
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,400
I promise you

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,000
that as long as the seventh son-in-law doesn't commit the sin of treason,

112
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,480
I will keep him safe for the rest of my life.

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,880
Okay.

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,600
Okay. I'm relieved.

115
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,760
I've confessed everything.

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,960
I've found the place where the body was buried.

117
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,920
Please spare my life.

118
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,120
I can spare you,

119
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,400
but you have to do me a favor.

120
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,120
As long as you spare my life,

121
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,640
what will I do if you say something?

122
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,640
I'll surrender to Prince Cheng.

123
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,080
No, no, no.

124
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,120
The queen's family is heavily guarded.

125
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,160
If I go there, I'll die.

126
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,400
As long as you confess that

127
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,040
the queen ordered you to kill Song Xiwen,

128
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,240
and Song Xiwen lost his body,

129
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,920
Prince Cheng will keep you safe.

130
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,280
But that's the queen.

131
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,880
For the dignity of the royal family,

132
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,920
His Majesty will kill me.

133
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,160
You're a minor.

134
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,960
What does it have to do with the dignity of the royal family?

135
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Since I let you surrender,

136
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,240
I can save your life.

137
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,040
If you don't obey,

138
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,440
you'll be arrested by both Prince Cheng

139
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,320
and the queen

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,360
from the moment you leave the mansion.

141
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,320
I'm afraid you'll die faster.

142
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,720
What should I say to Prince Cheng?

143
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,040
Tell the truth.

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,880
But I don't agree with Prince Cheng.

145
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,040
If you want him to protect you,

146
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
don't say I saved your life.

147
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,600
Okay, I'll listen to you.

148
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,080
Song Xiwen has died for so long.

149
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,760
Why did he surrender now?

150
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,240
My godfather said

151
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,040
the noble lady ordered me to hide

152
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,560
in case I would leak the news.

153
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
I ran back secretly

154
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,640
because my family needed money.

155
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,400
I wanted to ask my godfather for some money,

156
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,120
but I heard my godfather was arrested,

157
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,200
so I knew the trouble was big.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,840
Song Xiwen is tall and heavy.

159
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
How did you kill him

160
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,280
without any warning?

161
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,520
When I took over,

162
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,960
Song Xiwen's body

163
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,440
was in the night carriage.

164
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,920
I was with

165
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
a maid named Kang Bowen.

166
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
Minister Li found out the truth.

167
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,040
Is it true?

168
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,280
If I tell a lie,

169
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,600
I'll be struck by lightning.

170
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I'll die.

171
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,200
Okay.

172
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,360
Guards.

173
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,560
Arrest Kang Bowen and bring him back.

174
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,360
Yes.

175
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,680
Your Highness.

176
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
A body was found

177
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
in the night carriage.

178
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,720
It's said that it's Kang Bowen, the owner of the night carriage.

179
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,480
What?

180
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,160
The owner of the night carriage isshi.

181
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,480
He's under arrest.

182
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,800
button.

183
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,640
A survivor is Kang Bowen

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,800
with someplease made from his mouth.

185
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,960
The back of his brain is intact.

186
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,920
There are some green tiles and mud.

187
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,880
But the green tiles on the edge of the well

188
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
only have the traces of the sand

189
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,640
without being painted.

190
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,960
It means that the deceased

191
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,960
didn't accidentally slip into the well.

192
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,400
Apply some white vinegar to the body.

193
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
Apply more to the shoulder and wrist.

194
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,040
If you are forced to jump into the well,

195
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,800
there should be a trace of

196
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,960
the sand or the cloth.

197
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,360
The bones are all healed.

198
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,840
Only a few scratches.

199
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,560
I have to cut the chest

200
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,760
to check if it's really the deceased.

201
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,160
Stop!

202
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,120
This is a suspect in Song Xi's case.

203
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,480
I didn't allow it.

204
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
How dare you check here?

205
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,280
Kang Bo Wen is an eunuch in the palace.

206
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,480
The Empress Dowager ordered me and Princess Yongci

207
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,960
to investigate the cause of death in the imperial jade city.

208
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,800
If Prince Cheng has any objections,

209
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,160
you can ask the Empress Dowager to take back the order.

210
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,000
You...

211
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,720
Your Highness,

212
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,240
no one can remember

213
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,320
Princess Yongci's dance.

214
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm sure that with the help of Princess Yongci,

215
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
this case will be revealed.

216
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,840
Your Highness,

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,480
can you walk on the canteen?

218
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,200
I can't see the sacrifice on the Mental Basilisk well clearly.

219
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,520
The eye part is red.

220
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,440
Do you see the blood thieves here?

221
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,080
Jegan,

222
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,320
you're right.

223
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,380
The bleed on the body top

224
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,580
are not byANTIC.

225
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,080
The blood on his face

226
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,640
its a Strike of Death치.

227
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,000
Did you come here to check?

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,660
Did you really?

230
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,320
Yes.

231
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,760
is indeed a suicide.

232
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
In this harem,

233
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,760
the only person who can let Wan Xi

234
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,960
seal the seal of Kang Bowen

235
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
is the one from Fengyi Palace.

236
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,920
The imperial power is always charming.

237
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,480
Not to mention

238
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
the mother who loves her child.

239
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,400
Leave.

240
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,680
Mother.

241
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,360
Kang Bowen committed suicide.

242
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,320
The body has been found.

243
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,880
It's the autopsy done by Qin Jiuzuo.

244
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,200
Kang Bowen committed suicide.

245
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,920
What does it have to do with you?

246
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,520
Yan Qi caught Wang Han.

247
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,080
He was the one who killed Kang Bowen.

248
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,640
And he also confessed

249
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,000
that mother ordered him to kill Song Xiwen's body.

250
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,480
But it's true.

251
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,720
Nonsense.

252
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,320
I was going to let go of Song Xiwen.

253
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
How could I know he would be killed?

254
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Yan Qi thought he could easily

255
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,600
take the throne of the Crown Prince

256
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,440
by just arresting a servant.

257
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,320
Mother.

258
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,240
Let's stop fighting, okay?

259
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,200
At worst, I won't be the crown prince.

260
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,400
If you dare to say no,

261
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,400
I'll die in front of you.

262
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,520
As long as Yan Xi lives,

263
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,600
we'll fight to the end.

264
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
You can only revive yourself

265
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,160
by taking that throne.

266
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,000
So...

267
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,880
So you can avenge

268
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,720
your father's crimes on us.

269
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,040
Mother,

270
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,160
don't be mad.

271
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm wronged.

272
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm wronged.

273
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,960
Your proceed is the fairest of us all.

274
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,360
The most beautiful thing in my eyes is him.

275
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,560
But if he sees you,

276
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,360
he will be happy.

277
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,720
Mother, what are you talking about?

278
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,400
Who is he?

279
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,760
Of course, your father.

280
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,360
Chen,

281
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,760
remember this.

282
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,840
As long as you live,

283
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,080
you must fight for your life.

284
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,200
I remember it.

285
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,960
Swear it.

286
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,640
Even if I'm not here one day,

287
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,400
you will do it.

288
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,560
Mother.

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,960
Swear it.

290
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,200
God is above.

291
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,920
God is above.

292
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,680
Even if I'm the only one left,

293
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,200
I will fight for my life.

294
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,480
If it's true,

295
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,760
if it's true,

296
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,440
I will be born again.

297
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,560
I will never be a human again.

298
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:12,780
The Bnos

299
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,880
According to His Majesty's order.

300
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,240
Prince of Rui Yanchi will be crowned after the enthronement.

301
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,740
King Yanchi will be honored and legitimate

302
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,400
as a suggestive spirit in heaven.

303
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,320
He will be promoted according to the kept brotherhood

304
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,120
and harbored high και drive사�иває.

305
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,240
I, Yan Chi, will be the King of Rui

306
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,080
and serve the King of Qin, the Prince of Yan

307
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,400
and serve the King of Xi, the Prince of Huang.

308
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
With this...

309
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,720
King of Rui, Yan Chi.

310
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

311
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Your Highness,

312
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,880
the wedding is coming soon.

313
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,560
I wish you and Princess Yongci

314
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,080
a long life and a long life.

315
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,320
Brother!

316
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,040
Brother!

317
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,360
I've been crowned as the King of Yi.

318
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,040
His Majesty won't be angry with me, will he?

319
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,960
His Majesty said so himself.

320
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,960
You can't talk nonsense like you.

321
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,800
Yes.

322
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,440
Even if he's angry with me,

323
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,640
I'll let him be.

324
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,080
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

325
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,520
His Majesty has been waiting for you.

326
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,320
He will send troops soon.

327
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,080
You must work hard.

328
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll leave now.

329
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,560
I have to go to the Ministry of Personnel to take the post?

330
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,080
How can I sit still

331
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,480
in my own way?

332
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,200
I'll suffer a lot.

333
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,840
Why doesn't Prince Yi seem happy yet?

334
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
You still remain dissatisfied being the Prince

335
00:16:42,560 --> 00:17:02,140
and you want to get a place in the

336
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Heaven?

337
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,940
You're not satisfied with the dragon?

338
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,700
You recognized me from the back?

339
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,140
Not brother?

340
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,540
Not only from the back,

341
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,780
even if it's in the light,

342
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,260
I'll go to congratulate brother.

343
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,860
Ning'er.

344
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,460
I...

345
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,300
Can you look at me again?

346
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,260
Look at you?

347
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,300
You want me to praise you, right?

348
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,020
Your royal family is very imposing.

349
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,380
The color suits you, too.

350
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,540
It's very handsome.

351
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,020
I mean,

352
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,420
you can look at me again.

353
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,020
In the past,

354
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,220
there were royal families in the capital.

355
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,740
Only I was the outsider.

356
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,140
Now,

357
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,580
I've also been crowned.

358
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,100
His Majesty also values me.

359
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,980
You marry me,

360
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,940
you can't say you're just a maid.

361
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,500
At least you don't have to worry about being eaten or drunk.

362
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
You don't have to be looked down upon.

363
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,140
I will never have anyone else in my heart.

364
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,100
I know.

365
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,300
But...

366
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,060
Brother's eyes are still not healed.

367
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,900
I know.

368
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,540
I can beg His Majesty.

369
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,860
No matter what compensation he wants,

370
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,180
I can give him my best.

371
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,020
But you...

372
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,460
I can't give it to him.

373
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,180
This is...

374
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,420
Pull the hook.

375
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Don't beg His Majesty.

376
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,220
I...

377
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,660
I won't marry anyone else.

378
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,660
It's a deal.

379
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,300
It's a deal.

380
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,460
Ming Er,

381
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,700
did you come?

382
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,300
She didn't come.

383
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,380
Never leave.

384
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,260
Never leave.

385
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,220
Never leave.

386
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,900
Song Xi Wen.

387
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
Wan Xi.

388
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,300
Kang Bo Wen.

389
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,100
Good.

390
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,380
Very good.

391
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,180
My empress

392
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,060
is actually so capable.

393
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,140
Send the edict.

394
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,460
The empress, Zhao Shi,

395
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,580
is sick and exhausted.

396
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,660
Therefore, her might be slandered.

397
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,700
To get rid of the imperial dominance of Zhao,

398
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,460
she is confined to the Fengyi palace.

399
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,820
She didn't have to be seen,

400
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,220
but some others

401
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,340
had been abandoned and tried to spare.

402
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,380
Wait for me.

403
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,240
and juggle with your owner?

404
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,400
Come on, I care about that.

405
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,080
All right, let me introduce you.

406
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,440
You must be his Millennium Monk.

407
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,400
Here, let me show him Young Master Jiaxin.

408
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,160
Meet him on the spiritualよ around the room at your feet.

409
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,400
Was this meant forこ parking?

410
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,680
We want Li Splice to be a strings- його.

411
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,080
Think about it carefully.

412
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,880
Did you collude with the Ma attacked sondern?

413
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,200
Yes, your highness.

414
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,700
Li Splice killed his sisters and brothers.

415
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Although we were wrong.

416
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,600
We wouldn't consider it

417
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,480
as fair and just.

418
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,560
Now our onlyポピαιичgar

419
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960
is our Hydragon to reduce his roof.

420
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,160
I'm so happy.

421
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
The King of the Deceased

422
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,960
Father said you don't have to go to Wen'an tomorrow.

423
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,520
Sorry for you.

424
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,760
It's just a temporary storm.

425
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,080
It will pass soon.

426
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,040
I hope the storm

427
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,960
can be over soon.

428
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
The King of the Deceased

429
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,840
Help!

430
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,480
The Seventh Madam is bleeding!

431
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,960
Your Highness, the Seventh Madam is in a low fever.

432
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,000
Qin Xiang is just a concubine.

433
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
She's just pregnant.

434
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,480
What's the point of asking for an imperial doctor?

435
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,560
Go back!

436
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,080
What's going on?

437
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,280
Your Highness,

438
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,480
please save the Seventh Madam.

439
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,000
She's going to have a miscarriage.

440
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,240
Your Highness,

441
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Qin is a grown-up man.

442
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,320
He's pregnant and he still wants to play in the water.

443
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,200
But his birthmark is too slippery and he fell.

444
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,240
I'm afraid he can't keep it.

445
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,280
Your Highness,

446
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,760
you can scold me if you want.

447
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,360
I told you

448
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
not to talk to me like that.

449
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,680
Whether he wants to die or not,

450
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,560
when will he die?

451
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,800
Only I can decide that!

452
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,480
If you still can't figure out your place,

453
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,600
go to the underground

454
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,280
and pay for that damn seal.

455
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,120
Your Highness,

456
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,680
it's you!

457
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,280
Hong Chen Bin,

458
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,960
if you're really smart,

459
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,160
you should know when to shut up.

460
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,080
Something's wrong with the gold jade mae infinity mirror.

461
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,360
It createspretty shoes.

462
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,160
Jiuling加油?

463
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,880
H ic Jr I can't even lie down on my lap.

464
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,960
For a little while,

465
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,520
you 생sun Mercizone

466
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
You can't serve me.

467
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,640
I'm sorry.

468
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,400
I'll eat it.

469
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,520
Jiuling energy drink,

470
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,360
I'll have to work for you.

471
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
It moves my memory

472
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,000
and makes me unforgettable.

473
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
The journey of life is endless.

474
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,640
I've never been able to define the meaning of meeting you.

475
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,200
The story is not the end.

476
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,720
The tears are not the only ones.

477
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Love is a secret.

478
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
The bottom of my heart

479
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
collects the time I spent with you.

480
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
When I grow old,

481
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,320
I'll slowly recall

482
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,040
the love.

483
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,840
First bow to heaven and earth.

484
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,320
Let you solve the puzzle.

485
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,720
I'll travel with you.

486
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Second bow to heaven and earth.

487
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Love is a secret.

488
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,160
The bottom of my heart

489
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,320
collects the time I spent with you.

490
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
When I grow old,

491
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,960
I'll slowly recall

492
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,160
Love is a secret.

493
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,960
The bottom of my heart

494
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,120
collects the puzzle.

495
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Love is a secret.

496
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,160
Third Brother, you've been taking off and wearing the medicine.

497
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,560
Is your eye condition getting better or not?

498
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,440
Since Yong Ci lost his needle,

499
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,640
I've been able to drink and eat occasionally.

500
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,240
As long as the sky is clear,

501
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
I won't have a pain like before

502
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,240
if I don't wear the medicine.

503
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,840
It seems that you're well-prepared.

504
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,520
Congratulations, Third Brother.

505
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,480
And congratulations to myself.

506
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,360
This is the good medicine

507
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,800
I've been searching for for you.

508
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,800
I hope you can recover soon.

509
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,880
No, recover quickly.

510
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,200
What good medicine?

511
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,360
What's this dirty thing?

512
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,080
My medicine.

513
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,360
I finally found it.

514
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,800
I'll poison it with poison, okay?

515
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
I'll use these poison weapons to attack the enemy.

516
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,240
Maybe you'll recover tomorrow.

517
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,680
Poison with poison?

518
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,360
These spider webs are so big.

519
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,400
If Third Brother eats it, he'll die.

520
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,920
How can his eyes get better?

521
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,360
You...

522
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,720
Ning, don't be angry.

523
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,440
A-Li is doing this for my own good.

524
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,480
A-Li, thank you for these poison weapons.

525
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,280
Let's go.

526
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,600
Come back with me and have a short class.

527
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,680
Drink with me.

528
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,720
To be honest,

529
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,440
His Majesty is not in a good mood today.

530
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,360
He's always watching me learn some strength and martial arts.

531
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,800
When His Majesty lets me go,

532
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,440
I'll go to the mansion to have a chat.

533
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
You're not leaving?

534
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,440
It's the way to the capital that a prince should practice.

535
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,480
A-Li is so important to His Majesty.

536
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,440
Many people are looking forward to it.

537
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,040
Okay, go with your lessons.

538
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,760
Don't look for these messy things

539
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,640
for Third Brother.

540
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,040
Ning has recovered.

541
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,240
Yes.

542
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,960
I'll do it again, okay?

543
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,360
I'll find better medicine for Third Brother.

544
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,840
Goodbye.

545
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,680
I'm leaving.

546
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,080
You made this?

547
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,560
Of course.

548
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,720
I made it for you.

549
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,440
When I close my eyes,

550
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,560
I realize I love you a little bit.

551
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,320
Right, right, right.

552
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
Forget the pain

553
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,160
Woo, My heart is pure

554
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,180
Some stage

555
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,380
Topheaded

556
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,880
Purify und coupled

557
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,980
It's close to the hundred-year moon

558
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,740
All of the soaked crashing

559
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,800
Villain

560
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,220
With수

561
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,940
Through the storm

562
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,400
How many years

563
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,500
Cheese

564
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,100
whatever I want

565
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,140
is to have a home with you.

566
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,960
Now, I've realized my dream.

567
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,040
Nothing else is important.

568
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,220
石垂頭

569
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,300
寒冬

570
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,180
I love you

571
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,380
with every breath.

572
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:24,380
When I close my eyes, I realize

573
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,380
that love is like a dream.

574
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,380
I've been feeling uneasy lately.

575
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,380
I can't see what His Majesty wants to do.

576
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,380
You mean

577
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,380
His Majesty just temporarily locked the Empress in the palace

578
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,380
and didn't plan to leave?

579
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,380
The Empress is the foundation of Dongyao.

580
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
It requires evidence and

581
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,380
the court's advice and request to be followed.

582
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,380
With His Majesty's strictness to the Crown Prince,

583
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,380
it's only temporary.

584
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,380
The Empress will be gone sooner or later.

585
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,380
Are you afraid

586
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,380
His Majesty wants to use Prince Jin's love to depose the Empress?

587
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,380
I don't know.

588
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,380
The Empress won't tell me why she wants to kill Song Xiwen.

589
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
If His Majesty wants to depose the Empress,

590
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,380
he can just start Prince Jin's case.

591
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,380
Why would he let Prince Cheng investigate Song Xiwen's death

592
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,380
and make him be killed by the Crown Prince?

593
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,380
And Yanli.

594
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,380
Why would His Majesty put Yanli in the position

595
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,380
of the one who's so eye-catching?

596
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,380
In His Majesty's eyes,

597
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,380
he can't see that Yanli is not suitable

598
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,380
and he's unwilling to do this job.

599
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,380
Could it be that His Majesty wants to make Prince Cheng the Crown Prince

600
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,380
and use Yanli as a weapon?

601
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,380
I always feel that the truth is right in front of me.

602
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,380
But I just can't find the clue.

603
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,380
Don't think about it if you can't figure it out.

604
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,380
The Empress told me

605
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,380
to stay away from that position.

606
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,380
I think it's a mess.

607
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,380
The reason I let you kill him

608
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,380
is to protect our family.

609
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,380
Yes.

610
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,380
If it wasn't for the Empress

611
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,380
I wouldn't have been able to kill him

612
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,380
if His Majesty didn't tell me to kill Song Xiwen.

613
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,380
But if Yanqi did it,

614
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,380
you, the King,

615
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
wouldn't be able to protect us.

616
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,380
Don't worry.

617
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,380
He won't have this chance.

618
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,380
Go to sleep.

619
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
You need to be strong

620
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,380
to deal with the Tiger King.

621
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,380
I shouldn't have let Song Xiwen go.

622
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,380
But I'm a man of my word.

623
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,380
I won't let anyone die.

624
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,380
There must be a traitor.

625
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,380
Please investigate it, Father.

626
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
Don't let anyone get hurt.

627
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Read it yourself.

628
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,380
No.

629
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,380
Mother would never lie to me.

630
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,380
Mother would never do such a thing.

631
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,380
The evidence is clear.

632
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,380
You're still so stubborn.

633
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
Let me ask you.

634
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,380
In these days,

635
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,380
have you ever thought about it?

636
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,380
I was too insolent

637
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,380
and I was ashamed to teach you.

638
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,380
But as the head of the six palaces,

639
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
I killed a guard

640
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,380
beside the King of Jin for no reason.

641
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,380
As the guard of the imperial guards,

642
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,380
how could Wang Han escape?

643
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,380
Such a man of his word

644
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,380
is unbelievable, Father.

645
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Then, in your opinion,

646
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
I can still tolerate this traitor

647
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,380
slandering my Empress.

648
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,380
In your eyes,

649
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,380
I'm a man of my word.

650
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,380
I can't be a traitor.

651
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,380
I dare not.

652
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,380
I made a mistake.

653
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,380
Please forgive me, Father.

654
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,380
Father.

655
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Please calm down.

656
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,380
The Empress committed such a serious crime.

657
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
It's inevitable that the Crown Prince

658
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
would be concerned about it.

659
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,380
But the evidence is clear.

660
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,380
You should think about it.

661
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,380
Before the suicide of Kang Bowen,

662
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
the Empress summoned him.

663
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,380
If the Empress didn't put pressure on him,

664
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,380
why would she

665
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,380
commit suicide

666
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,380
without the help of the head of the palace?

667
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,380
Shut up!

668
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,380
Yan Qi,

669
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
you must have been secretly leading the way.

670
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
You're rude!

671
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,380
I'm still alive.

672
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,380
How dare you be so arrogant!

673
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
If one day,

674
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,380
you really become the Emperor,

675
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,380
do you still have the right to speak?

676
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,380
I know I'm rude,

677
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,380
but I never want to practice power.

678
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,380
Today, I lost my memory.

679
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,380
I was framed by a traitor

680
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,380
because I couldn't tolerate my mother.

681
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,380
I'm willing to be punished.

682
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,380
I only ask you

683
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,380
not to listen to the traitor

684
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,380
and pay back your mother's innocence.

685
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,380
You bastard!

686
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,380
I think you've already forgotten

687
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,380
what you've done.

688
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
You're right.

689
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,380
Crown Prince Yan Che

690
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,380
is a man of the heaven

691
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,380
and is a man of the heaven.

692
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,380
He's not respected by the court

693
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
and he's not respected by the people.

694
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,380
He's dead.

695
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,380
He's not loyal to the Emperor.

696
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,380
He's not like the old Ye He.

697
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,380
From now on,

698
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,380
Yan Che will be the Crown Prince

699
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,380
and will be sent to the Zongzheng Temple.

700
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,380
I...

701
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,380
thank you, Father.

702
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,380
Step aside.

703
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,380
Step aside.

704
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,380
I want to see the Empress.

705
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,380
Your Highness,

706
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,380
without the imperial edict,

707
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,380
no one is allowed to enter Fengyi Palace.

708
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,380
Fine.

709
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,380
I'll just say a few words

710
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,380
and that's enough.

711
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,380
Poor you.

712
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,380
You're imprisoned here.

713
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,380
You don't even know

714
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,380
that your son lost the position of Crown Prince.

715
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,380
It's so heartbreaking.

716
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

717
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,380
Chen is the only legitimate son of His Majesty.

718
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,380
No one can touch his position of Crown Prince.

719
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
No one can touch him.

720
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,380
But His Majesty wants to depose the Crown Prince.

721
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,380
He can just give the edict.

722
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,380
Poor Crown Prince.

723
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,380
I should call him

724
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,380
Second Prince.

725
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,380
Shut up!

726
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,380
Poor Second Prince.

727
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,380
He can only spend his days in the Zongzheng Temple.

728
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,380
I'm afraid your guards

729
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,380
can't keep him.

730
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,380
You and your son

731
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,380
will never see each other again.

732
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,380
You must take care of yourself.

733
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,380
Don't be too sad.

734
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,380
Don't be too sad.

735
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
You're crazy. Come back!

736
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
Come back!

737
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,380
Open the door!

738
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,380
Open the door!

739
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,380
I want to see His Majesty!

740
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Open the door!

741
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,380
I want to see His Majesty!

742
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,380
I want to see the Empress Dowager!

743
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,380
Open the door!

744
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,380
Open the door!

745
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
Mother.

746
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,380
I pay my respects to you.

747
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,380
Zhao Yu.

748
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Why are you here?

749
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,380
Chen didn't get deposed, right?

750
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
Right?

751
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,380
I'm grateful to His Majesty.

752
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,380
He allowed me

753
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
to enter the Zongzheng Temple

754
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,380
and bid farewell to you.

755
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,380
Mother.

756
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,380
He did it.

757
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,380
It happened so suddenly.

758
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,380
We can't wait for the right time.

759
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Do you have any idea

760
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,380
to save the Crown Prince from danger?

761
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,380
We have little time.

762
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,380
I'll think of a way

763
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,380
to make my father

764
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,380
be the last one.

765
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,380
Good boy.

766
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,380
I was right about you.

767
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,380
As long as the Empress Dowager is here,

768
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,380
His Majesty won't dare to move the carriage.

769
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,380
But the Crown Prince

770
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,380
will kill him in time.

771
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,380
Most importantly,

772
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,380
let Chen leave the Zongzheng Temple.

773
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,380
As long as he's here,

774
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,380
everything can be done.

775
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,380
Okay.

776
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,380
Congratulations, Your Highness.

777
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,380
Thank you.

778
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,380
Father finally

779
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,380
put that wretch in jail.

780
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

781
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,380
You finally got away.

782
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,380
Is that woman

783
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,380
still in the cell?

784
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,380
The Princess went to the palace

785
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,380
to bid farewell to the Noble Consort.

786
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,380
She won't come back in this world.

787
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,380
I'll take the position of Crown Prince

788
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,380
and destroy her sooner or later.

789
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,380
Don't you want to

790
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,380
explain to me about Chen?

791
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,380
I know why you're angry.

792
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,380
It's their fortune

793
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,380
that you're training your children.

794
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,380
But Chen's talent

795
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,380
is really unworthy of the throne.

796
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
If the army is strong,

797
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,380
it will surely cause a stir in the court.

798
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,380
The longer it takes,

799
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,380
the more difficult it will be to deal with it.

800
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,380
I know what you're talking about.

801
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:29,080
But the

802
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,380
I will be careful.

803
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,380
I still have some memorials

804
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,380
to finish today.

805
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,380
I won't accompany you to dinner.

806
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,380
Please rest in peace.

807
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,380
Huai'er,

808
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,380
the Empress was grounded in the Fengyi Palace.

809
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,380
Since then,

810
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,380
the Noble Consort has been unable to

811
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,380
deal with the harem.

812
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,380
From today on,

813
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,380
I will be in charge of

814
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
the harem.

815
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Then,

816
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,380
please don't worry about

817
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,380
the previous court affairs.

818
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,380
That's exactly what I should do.

819
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,380
Thank you, Mother.

820
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,380
Wait a little longer.

821
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,380
The truth will be revealed

822
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,380
soon.

823
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,380
The harem is so cold,

824
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,380
so warm.

825
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,380
If a dust

826
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,380
falls into the haze,

827
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,380
the snow falls

828
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,380
and the whole body is white.

829
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,380
If a deep love

830
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,380
is engraved in the heart,

831
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,380
the pain will also be

832
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,380
felt.

833
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,380
Open your heart.

834
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,380
Love doesn't fear the deep sea.

835
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,380
Please grant me courage

836
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,380
to let fate be in the way.

837
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,380
Don't be afraid of the starlight

838
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,380
being touched by the night sky.

839
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,380
The stars will shine

840
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,380
beyond the sky.

841
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,380
The stars are bright

842
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:13,380
and the night sky is bright.

843
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,380
The night sky is bright.

844
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,380
The night sky is bright.

845
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,380
The night sky is bright.

846
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,380
The night sky is bright.

847
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,380
The night sky is bright.

848
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:48,380
The night sky is bright.

849
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,380
The night sky is bright.

850
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,380
The night sky is bright.
