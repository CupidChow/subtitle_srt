1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
???

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Said you

3
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,480
So long

4
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,480
You changed your mind to join the Ministry of Justice

5
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
to investigate Prince Jing's case?

6
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
Yes.

7
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
You returned to the capital this time

8
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480
and you were already in the tiger's den.

9
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
This Prince Jing case

10
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
is also a counter-offensive against His Majesty.

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
If the news is leaked,

12
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
have you thought about it?

13
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Uncle, don't persuade me.

14
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,480
I was raised by the royal mother.

15
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,480
In those years, Brother Jin treated me like a brother.

16
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,480
He kept his promise of not taking bribes.

17
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,480
I have to use the blood of my enemy to clear his name.

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
But...

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Uncle, I have one more request.

20
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Go ahead.

21
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Lady Qian Jiu has agreed to help me investigate the case.

22
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,480
But only her daughter is left in the second room of the Qin family.

23
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
I'm afraid that after entering the capital,

24
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
she will be subject to the order of the Marquis.

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
So I'm afraid that I can't thank her enough

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,480
if I can give her a title and support her.

27
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
That's a good idea.

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,480
I don't know how to repay her kindness.

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,480
If the title of Marquis Anyang can protect her,

30
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
I can't help it.

31
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Thank you, Uncle.

32
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Lady!

33
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Lady, the Crown Prince is here.

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

35
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
You don't have to be so polite.

36
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,480
When will you return to Shuxi?

37
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,480
I'm afraid that I can't leave yet.

38
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,480
You can't leave, either.

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,480
And you can't leave, too.

40
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Why?

41
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
Yesterday, His Majesty appointed me as the investigation supervisor

42
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
of the Ministry of Justice.

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
I will supervise all the cases related to the criminal record

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,480
of the internal affairs of the State.

45
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
The investigation supervisor of the Ministry of Justice?

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,480
So you won't return to Shuxi anymore?

47
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
I won't.

48
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Now, I officially invite Lady Jiong to help me

49
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,480
as the investigation supervisor.

50
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Officially?

51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,480
Then I can go to the banquet in a proper way?

52
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Of course.

53
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
After I return to the capital, I will do the same.

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,480
No matter where you are, I will be there.

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
I can do anything.

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
That's great!

57
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
I received a report before I came.

58
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
There is a missing person in Qin's mansion.

59
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Please go to the banquet.

60
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Is she the maid of the night?

61
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
No.

62
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,480
The mansion said that it was Aunt Ba.

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Aunt Ba?

64
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Please lead the way.

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Thank you.

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Baifeng, she didn't call me the princess.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
So?

68
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
So she trusts me more.

69
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Congratulations.

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Master.

71
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
What are you looking at?

72
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
You can't do your family's work, right?

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Hurry up. Let's go.

74
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Aunt Ba lived here before she died.

75
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Her two maids said that she was sick a few days ago.

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
She went to bed early last night.

77
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Who knew that she would die in bed when she left the house this morning?

78
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Your Highness.

79
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
That's right.

80
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
That's right.

81
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Where is Master San?

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
His family is sick in bed.

83
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
I'm the one who helped the grandmother.

84
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,480
If you need anything, just tell me.

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
I'm Master San's concubine.

86
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm the only one who's here.

87
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
If there's anything I don't know about the mansion,

88
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
please tell me.

89
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Your Highness, Sister Jiu is a woman.

90
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
If she shows up like this,

91
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,480
I'm afraid she'll be hurt by her reputation.

92
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
What do you think of her?

93
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,480
She's a woman, but she also cares about the people.

94
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
If you and Master Huo believe me,

95
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
I'll do my best to help you.

96
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Sister Jiu, you just came back.

97
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
The people in the mansion don't have any money.

98
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Why don't you ask your brother...

99
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Sister Jiu.

100
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
You're a good woman.

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,480
I admire you and Master Huo.

102
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,480
The government's case is not for the people to stay here.

103
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Young Master, Third Madam, please go back.

104
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Yes.

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
As you said, Your Highness.

106
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Thank you for saving my sister.

107
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
It's about family matters.

108
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
I have nothing to do with it.

109
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Let's go in and have a look.

110
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Open the door.

111
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Go and ask your grandmother.

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Hurry up.

113
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
The Liu family is indeed a good family.

114
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,480
The calligraphy and the sword are all famous.

115
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

116
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Master Huo, Ninth Madam.

117
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Are you sure it's a dead body?

118
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Your Highness, Ninth Madam, please follow me.

119
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Please look.

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,480
This is a very fine, but very deep mine.

121
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
The dead body is in the back of the well.

122
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
The top and bottom are red blood points.

123
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,480
The skin is a kind of the skin of a child.

124
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,480
It's enough to see that the dead body was killed alive.

125
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Please go in.

126
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,480
The stone box has improved a lot with the ninth madam.

127
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Yes, it's thanks to the ninth madam that she didn't learn to be self-cultivated.

128
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
When the Master of Huo's House came in,

129
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
did you ever touch the dust in the house?

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm not a genius.

131
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
I still understand this rule.

132
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Is there anything wrong?

133
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
The dead body was killed alive.

134
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
They should have struggled to survive.

135
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
But why is the room so clean?

136
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Even the maid didn't hear anything.

137
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Could she have been unconscious?

138
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Ninth Madam, please go in.

139
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Did you find anything?

140
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
This isn't a place for murder.

141
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
The body was moved here after it was killed.

142
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,480
The murderer has nothing to do with this house.

143
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,480
The ninth madam's reasoning is so correct.

144
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,480
This is related to the reputation of Qin's house.

145
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,480
After a person dies, the body's vital points and lower limbs will form blood vessels.

146
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,480
After an hour, the body will begin to shrink from the limbs.

147
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,480
After three hours, the whole body will shrink.

148
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Now, the dead body's limbs have shrunk.

149
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
But the body's body is soft.

150
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,480
It can be seen that the body has been dead for less than three hours.

151
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,480
It should be between Yin Zheng and Mao Chu.

152
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
It should be the end of the night patrol of the Qin's house.

153
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
It should be the gap between the servants and the servants.

154
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Only by knowing the rules of the Qin's house and its interior

155
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,480
can we be able to act like we're innocent for a short time.

156
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,480
It's not an outsider to be so familiar with Qin's house.

157
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Ninth Madam, can you tell me

158
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
where can we see the body being moved?

159
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Look.

160
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,480
The dead's palm is scratched with a fine strip.

161
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,480
The wound is thin and the nails are broken.

162
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
There's still mud in the armor.

163
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,480
It can be seen that the dead was lying on the mud when he was struggling.

164
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Moreover, the dead is lying face down at this time.

165
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,480
But the bent state of the legs is very different from lying flat.

166
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Only when the body is in a state of collapse

167
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
can the legs be bent in a full-body shape.

168
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
From the extent of the body's shrinkage,

169
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
the dead should be in a state of collapse for an hour.

170
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,480
The limbs began to shrink and were moved to this state.

171
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Therefore, except for the left back,

172
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,480
the left side is the blood that forms.

173
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
The big arm and the outside of the small legs

174
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,480
are the blood that forms when they catch me.

175
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,480
The most important thing is that the dead's shoe is not inside the house.

176
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
An hour after the death,

177
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,480
it's not a matter of time before the body is moved from the outside.

178
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,480
The body is chosen by the people in the body.

179
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,480
It will not take an hour to move the body.

180
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
It will not only put the body on the bed

181
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,480
and not even hide the wounds of the death.

182
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,480
Such a hasty move is definitely not a murder.

183
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Yes.

184
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
From the size of the limbs,

185
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
there are other people who move the body.

186
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
And it's the two of them that move the limbs

187
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
that can move Jiang Ying's body to this point.

188
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,480
It's to confuse the body.

189
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
This is also a dangerous scene.

190
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,480
There must be a hidden meaning behind the death of the six bodies.

191
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm so tired.

192
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
I'm so tired.

193
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Mother,

194
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,480
do you think that murderer of the eight-eared woman

195
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
is still in the house?

196
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
If...

197
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
If Xiang'er and the others catch her,

198
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
you think...

199
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
You're confused.

200
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
There are so many officials in the house.

201
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
The murderer is hiding here,

202
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
waiting for the head to be pressed.

203
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Then I'm relieved.

204
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
What's strange is that

205
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,480
we haven't reported the officials yet.

206
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Why are these officials so anxious?

207
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
That's right.

208
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
There are so many people coming.

209
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
And that Prince Rui

210
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
wants Jiu to follow them.

211
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Did he fall in love with Jiu?

212
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
A girl like that

213
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
can't be a good match for him.

214
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
I just didn't expect

215
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,400
that the star of the

216
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,000
king's

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,480
will be so fast.

218
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Since he wants the star of the king's,

219
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
we can't

220
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
offend the murderer.

221
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
When he returns to the capital,

222
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
we'll see how he will face that girl.

223
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Your Highness.

224
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Who found Liu Shi's body first?

225
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,480
It's Liu Shi's personal body.

226
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Call her in.

227
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Lord Huo.

228
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,480
What does the Crown Prince mean?

229
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Please don't worry.

230
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,480
The Crown Prince just wants to ask.

231
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
Jiu Jin'er.

232
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
What did the Crown Prince say

233
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,480
in the house just now?

234
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,480
The Crown Prince has been watching the coronation.

235
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
He didn't say much.

236
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Didn't you find anything wrong?

237
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
The Crown Prince is an outsider.

238
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
How can I keep an eye on him?

239
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
You...

240
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Jiu Jin'er.

241
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,480
The Crown Prince trusts you a lot.

242
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
If you hear anything

243
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
that's not good for the Qin family,

244
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,480
we have to be prepared.

245
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,480
After all, you three are not married yet.

246
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
The reputation of your family

247
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
and the family's family style

248
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,480
are closely related.

249
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Don't worry, grandmother.

250
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
I will do my best

251
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,480
to keep the family's family style.

252
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Good. Good.

253
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
I'm Xiu Qin.

254
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
I'm Xiu Shu.

255
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
Greetings, my lords.

256
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Who of you

257
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
discovered that

258
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Liu Shi died in the house?

259
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
It was me.

260
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
I wanted to see

261
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,480
if my aunt was alive.

262
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,480
But when I entered the house,

263
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
I saw my aunt

264
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
dead on the bed.

265
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Do you know that

266
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
false evidence is a crime?

267
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm not a murderer.

268
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
I'm not a murderer.

269
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm not a murderer.

270
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
There are people who are involved

271
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
in the crime of false evidence.

272
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
According to the law,

273
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
the culprit is the second-class.

274
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
I dare not lie to you.

275
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
What about you?

276
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
I...

277
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,480
I saw it too.

278
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,480
How dare you!

279
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
How dare you lie to me

280
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
in front of the Crown Prince!

281
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
I don't know what law is.

282
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Take her away

283
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
and beat her to death!

284
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Please spare me, my lord!

285
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
Huo,

286
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
are you going to torture me?

287
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Chen.

288
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
I don't know the law.

289
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Please forgive me.

290
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
The maid said

291
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Liu Shi didn't go out

292
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
after he fell asleep.

293
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
But when he died,

294
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
he was wearing a mask

295
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
and clearly went out to play.

296
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
The nails were broken.

297
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
It can be seen that he struggled to survive.

298
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
But there are no traces

299
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,480
of fighting in the house.

300
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
All kinds of illegal places

301
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
are not lying.

302
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,480
The Crown Prince is really wise.

303
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
To be honest,

304
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
I lied to you

305
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,480
when I was being punished.

306
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
If you want to punish me,

307
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
punish me.

308
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Grandmother!

309
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Mother!

310
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
Grandmother!

311
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Your Highness,

312
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Lord Huo,

313
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
my grandmother didn't mean to lie.

314
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
It was because of Ba Yi Niang

315
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
that she met with someone in private

316
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
and caused the murder.

317
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
My grandmother

318
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
had to make this decision

319
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
to keep the reputation of Qin's Mansion.

320
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
If you want to punish me,

321
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
punish me.

322
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Since there is a reason,

323
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
just say it clearly.

324
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
I was the first one

325
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
who found out about Yi Niang.

326
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
But at that time,

327
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Yi Niang was already in a mess

328
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
and died under the flower bed in the Eastern Courtyard.

329
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Eastern Courtyard?

330
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Could it be the flower bed

331
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
outside the Purple Bamboo Forest?

332
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
Yes.

333
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,480
Master.

334
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Why is this place so chaotic?

335
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
I interrogated the servants.

336
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
They said that this place was not urgent.

337
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Old Madam Qin invited someone to be the Taoist priest.

338
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
She ordered me to seal the place overnight.

339
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Take them away!

340
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Go!

341
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Hurry up!

342
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Did this place not have an urgent matter to talk about?

343
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
The one that didn't have an urgent matter to talk about

344
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
was the Purple Bamboo Forest in the mansion.

345
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
But my sixth sister

346
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
was hiding in this place.

347
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Old Madam Qin is very kind and considerate.

348
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
But this place is not urgent.

349
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Why would the eighth sister

350
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
have a private meeting with someone here?

351
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Your hand is used to cure people.

352
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,480
I can even make a body of a shaman.

353
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
I'm not afraid.

354
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,480
The law of action is a pre-existing law.

355
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
If one makes a mistake,

356
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,480
he should be punished with the same punishment.

357
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
You read that book?

358
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
I read it and realized that

359
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I was a narrow-minded person.

360
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,480
I just read it quickly and took the benefit.

361
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
If I don't use my power,

362
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I think even if I do the investigation,

363
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
I will be punished by you.

364
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Master,

365
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Master Huo has something to report.

366
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
I know.

367
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Old Madam Qin has a hidden agenda.

368
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
I'm sure she has cleaned up this place.

369
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
No need to waste time.

370
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Your Highness,

371
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Liu's clothes have been found.

372
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
She buried them in the backyard.

373
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Where did she lie when you saw her dead?

374
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
She was lying there.

375
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Tell me,

376
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
where are her head and feet?

377
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Bai Feng, do as she said.

378
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
What?

379
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Yes.

380
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,480
The foot of the old lady was a little bit here.

381
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
The head was facing left.

382
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,480
The body was lying on the ground.

383
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
The foot was like this.

384
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
I can do it myself.

385
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,480
The head was on the ground.

386
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,480
These books were broken.

387
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
It must be the traces of Liu's struggle.

388
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Have you cleaned up this place?

389
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,480
The old lady asked us to move her back

390
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
and change her clothes.

391
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Then she swept away the soil and leaves here.

392
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
There was a drag on the ground.

393
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,480
From here to there.

394
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,480
Master, can I get up now?

395
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Get up.

396
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
Thank you, Old Madam.

397
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Get up.

398
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Is this the dead man's handkerchief?

399
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Is it his real hair?

400
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Looking at the real foot, it looks like the living body of the old lady.

401
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
It's dirty and dirty.

402
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
It's a personal thing.

403
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
It never used this color.

404
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Then why did you bury this handkerchief with the dead man's clothes?

405
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,480
I found this handkerchief in his arms

406
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
when I was changing clothes for the old lady.

407
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,480
I was in a panic and buried it together.

408
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
It's a man's handkerchief.

409
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
It should be a token of the meeting with Liu.

410
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
But this handkerchief is so heavy.

411
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,480
It doesn't look like the left hand of the young master of the Fu family.

412
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Could it be Qing Shan?

413
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
What do you think?

414
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,480
I saw Liu Chun and the Liu family appear together in the Purple Bamboo Forest.

415
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Tell Liu Chun to take Liu Chun to the police station.

416
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,480
Take me to interrogate them and take the maid back to the house.

417
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Yes.

418
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Let's go.

419
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,480
The criminal should have pulled the bar from behind

420
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,480
and pulled the bar to cut the air.

421
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
The leaves are blackened.

422
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,480
The criminal must have been standing here for a long time

423
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
and then pulled the bar.

424
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
The handkerchief is still in the handkerchief.

425
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
The criminal must have been standing here for a long time

426
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,480
and then pulled the leaves.

427
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
If he hides here,

428
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
he will never be able to find the leaf.

429
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,480
If he pulls the bar from behind,

430
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Liu Chun should be in that position.

431
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
It's a busy night here.

432
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,480
It's hard not to make a sound when the murderer appears.

433
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Liu Chun is here.

434
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,480
If he hears the sound from behind,

435
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
he will definitely turn around.

436
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,480
It's hard for the murderer to get the handkerchief from behind.

437
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Unless...

438
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Unless Liu Chun knows this person, he won't be able to make a sound.

439
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Or maybe...

440
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
What did the criminal say to him?

441
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
He doesn't dare or want to face it.

442
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,480
The criminal can only be so calm and do as he says.

443
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Liu Chun, you're awake.

444
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
What happened?

445
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
I didn't see you.

446
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
I was so worried.

447
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
I'm sorry.

448
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
I'm sorry.

449
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
I'm sorry.

450
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
I'm sorry.

451
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm sorry.

454
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm sorry.

455
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
I'm sorry.

456
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
I'm sorry.

457
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Lady Jiu, when I first saw you,

458
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
I found something strange on you.

459
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
I didn't dare to interrupt.

460
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Please come with me to the banquet.

461
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
What's strange?

462
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
I...

463
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Your Highness,

464
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:18,000
the victim has a

465
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,480
heart.

466
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,480
Xu He, why are you not sure that it's Yang Meichuang?

467
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
Lady Jiu,

468
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
I was thinking,

469
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
isn't she the concubine of Qin?

470
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
It's unreasonable to get this disease.

471
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,480
I don't dare to talk.

472
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,480
As a coroner, you should only see what the dead can see.

473
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,480
No matter what the dead's identity is, it has nothing to do with the autopsy.

474
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Although coroners are the best, they cannot have a clear mind.

475
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,480
Only by having a clear mind can you see things clearly.

476
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
I will remember that.

477
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Since you have the Yangmei window, can you still use it?

478
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Liu Shi has been ill for two months.

479
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,480
The window is also slowly being removed.

480
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,480
It is said that he will not be able to communicate with anyone.

481
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
Then with him...

482
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Will the illness be more serious if he is in contact with someone?

483
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Not necessarily.

484
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Some people with strong bodies can be cured even if they are infected with the disease.

485
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
They won't even be able to live for a lifetime.

486
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Judging from the scratches on the dead, the coroner's strength is quite strong.

487
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
His body will be able to resist the sword.

488
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I have ordered people to examine all the dead bodies.

489
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,480
No matter if the illness is serious, we will be able to find the dead.

490
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Why don't we wait until the owner of the handkerchief is examined?

491
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,480
The evidence we have right now cannot confirm that the coroner is in contact with the dead.

492
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
If we keep going like this, it might be too...

493
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Because there is no evidence, there is no way to examine the dead.

494
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,480
The bigger the evidence, the less likely the dead will be able to breathe.

495
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
That's why it is easy to show the dead's feet.

496
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,480
This is called checking the dead's body with the help of the evidence.

497
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,560
The situation of the

498
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
The situation of the

499
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Qin's father is very influential.

500
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
There is no doubt.

501
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
If Qin's father really cared about his reputation,

502
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
he wouldn't have treated you like a grass.

503
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,560
How they treated me has nothing to do with this case.

504
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,560
It's just that the crown prince is the personal investigator ordered by the emperor.

505
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
The government has already taken the responsibility.

506
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
If we act like this, it might be a trap.

507
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,560
The soldiers are noble and the wine is not.

508
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
If we can catch the real murderer earlier,

509
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,200
what about the

510
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
The crown prince

511
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
The crown prince

512
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
The crown prince

513
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
The crown prince

514
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
The crown prince

515
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Where did the wine girl go?

516
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
You too.

517
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
What are you talking about with Chen?

518
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
What if we can't protect the child?

519
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
What should we do?

520
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
You should say less.

521
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
The wine girl has entered the second door.

522
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Great

523
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Grandmother, the crown prince ordered to search the whole house.

524
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,200
No matter where you are, you should search the whole house.

525
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
What?

526
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Why didn't you stop him?

527
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,200
The crown prince is now the secret investigator who is on the side of the emperor.

528
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
How dare you go against him?

529
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,840
My family has never been bullied like this.

530
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
Let's go.

531
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Take me to the temple.

532
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
I want to show the ancestors

533
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,840
what kind of descendants of the old Zhong Yonghou

534
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,840
have been bullied by others.

535
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
Let's go.

536
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Mother, be careful.

537
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
Uncle Mo

538
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,840
Take good care of her.

539
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Yes

540
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Brother, why did sister-in-law touch the birthmark again?

541
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
She is always thinking about it.

542
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
I was worried about something in the house.

543
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
So I talked to her.

544
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Let's go.

545
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Put it here.

546
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Everyone is here.

547
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
It's so rare.

548
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Stop, stop, stop.

549
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Your Highness, the old lady doesn't listen to me.

550
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
She insists on crying in the temple.

551
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
She is old.

552
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
If there is anything wrong,

553
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
we can't explain it to the Zhong Yonghou.

554
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
How about we stop it?

555
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Uncle Mo, if the Zhong Yonghou wants to ask,

556
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
I will answer.

557
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,120
But you are the governor of Jingzhou.

558
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
If you are not careful,

559
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
don't blame me for being rude.

560
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
I am not a good investigator.

561
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Please don't be angry, Your Highness.

562
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
I will never dare to do it again.

563
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
I will never dare to be rude again.

564
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
I will be your mother.

565
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Prime Minister,

566
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
please don't stop it.

567
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Next.

568
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
I shouldn't offend the left.

569
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
I shouldn't offend the right.

570
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
How can it be so difficult to be a governor?

571
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Your Highness.

572
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
It seems that we don't need to find the master.

573
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
Then we can see the result.

574
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,760
You didn't eat the medicine I prescribed, did you?

575
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
You should eat the medicine I prescribed.

576
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Jiu, I don't refuse to take the medicine.

577
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
It's because

578
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
someone touched my hand.

579
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
But your brother always says that I am thinking too much.

580
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
I have no choice.

581
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
So...

582
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
I will go.

583
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Why is there an extra shot of shot-cigarette?

584
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Jiu,

585
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
please save our Young Mistress.

586
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Although the medicine is made by the kitchen,

587
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
I secretly hid some medicine sticks

588
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
because Young Mistress was not feeling well.

589
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
But if the Young Master doesn't believe it,

590
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
I will go.

591
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Why don't you tell the Third Mistress?

592
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Young Mistress won't allow it.

593
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I'm afraid that if it gets worse,

594
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
the Young Master will be embarrassed.

595
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Don't be confused anymore.

596
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Your body can't stand the injection again.

597
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
If you don't take the medicine,

598
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
you and your child will be in danger.

599
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
I wish I was really confused.

600
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Jiu,

601
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
you should marry someone who is of your own kind.

602
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
If she can't treat you the same way,

603
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,680
she will be in a very bad situation.

604
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Is there anyone outside?

605
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
No.

606
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Jiu, the Young Master is always

607
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
kind to other women.

608
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
There is only Young Mistress by his side.

609
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
He is always close to Young Mistress.

610
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Close to her?

611
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Even my maid is like that.

612
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
No wonder...

613
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
No wonder he always says that I'm being paranoid.

614
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
But I'm his whole person.

615
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
Does he have anyone else in his heart?

616
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,320
I know it best.

617
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
If you look at his feelings

618
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
more than your own child's life,

619
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
I have no other choice.

620
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
But I'm sure that

621
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
if you hurt yourself and your child,

622
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,320
not only will the Young Master not like you more,

623
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,320
but he will also be more and more angry.

624
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,320
Even the Old Madam and the Third Mistress

625
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
will be angry.

626
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
I can treat the illness, but I can't treat the heart.

627
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
There are some things

628
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
that I need to think about myself.

629
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
This yard is not clean.

630
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
I will make medicine into medicine pills and send it over.

631
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Sister-in-law,

632
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
it's not easy for a woman to be a doctor.

633
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
If you don't love yourself,

634
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
how can you let others love you?

635
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Jiu.

636
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Xinlan, how are you?

637
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Where did you go just now?

638
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I went to the temple crying.

639
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
I was worried about you.

640
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
I had to accompany you.

641
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Sister-in-law, you almost lost your child.

642
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
But you were not with me.

643
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
You are really a filial son.

644
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
I'm always busy with my work.

645
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
In this Qin's house, there are three uncles,

646
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
a nanny, and grandchildren.

647
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
In this Qin's house,

648
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
you are the only husband.

649
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
If you don't love yourself,

650
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
please forgive me.

651
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Xinlan, did I say something to you?

652
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
No.

653
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

654
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
I will accompany her in the future.

655
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Jiu.

656
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Jiu.

657
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Oh no, the old lady fainted.

658
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
Jiu.

659
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
You are just a little bit weak.

660
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,240
It's nothing serious.

661
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
You fainted and it's nothing serious?

662
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
You don't even have a prescription.

663
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
Do you still have grandmother in your eyes?

664
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,240
Take three doses of medicine.

665
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
You are still young.

666
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Sister-in-law, did you catch the murderer?

667
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,880
No.

668
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Jiujie, you have been following them.

669
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
What did you find out?

670
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Why do you have to

671
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
make a man in our house take off his clothes and check his body?

672
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
What does this mean

673
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
that Qin's house will be

674
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
in a state of emergency in the future?

675
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
I found the Yangmei window that Ba Yi Niang got.

676
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
The crown prince suspected

677
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
that it was dyed by the person who secretly informed him.

678
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
He plans to follow this clue

679
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
and continue to investigate.

680
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Still investigating?

681
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
This...

682
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
The men in the He family

683
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
have already taken off their clothes and checked their bodies.

684
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
What else can he investigate?

685
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
I am a person of Qin's family.

686
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
The crown prince won't tell me anything.

687
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
You are still well-informed.

688
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Xia'er.

689
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Grandmother, mother.

690
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Don't worry.

691
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
The government has its own rules.

692
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
It won't be a mess.

693
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
It's the only way now.

694
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
You should go back and see your daughter-in-law.

695
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
So that she won't feel uncomfortable.

696
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Jiujie has been tired for a day.

697
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Go back and rest.

698
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
I will come again tomorrow to greet grandmother.

699
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
She is always so fake.

700
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
She is so annoying.

701
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
Grandmother, are you feeling better?

702
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
You scared me, grandmother.

703
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Jiumei, I will see you out.

704
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Brother, you don't have to see me out.

705
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Or else sister-in-law will wait for a long time.

706
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
It's getting late.

707
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
How can you go back alone?

708
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Don't worry, young master.

709
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
I will definitely send Jiuniang to you.

710
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Recently, the house is not safe.

711
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
You must be more careful.

712
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
If you have any problem, you can tell me.

713
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
I will help you.

714
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Thank you, brother.

715
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Sister-in-law is the most important.

716
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
You don't have to worry about me.

717
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Jiumei is right.

718
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I should go back.

719
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Young master, take care.

720
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
What are you looking at?

721
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Nothing.

722
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
I can't tell.

723
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
You are the youngest, but you are the bravest.

724
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
You even dare to look at your body.

725
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
I have been used to it since I was a child.

726
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
You are really different.

727
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
A woman from a rich family

728
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
doesn't have to suffer such a crime.

729
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Last time, you fell into the well.

730
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
You were scared for three days.

731
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
Old madam is always afraid of

732
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,440
the well in the house.

733
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,440
She is always in a hurry.

734
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,440
She is always told to seal the well.

735
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,440
Why are you afraid of the well?

736
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,440
After I entered the house,

737
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,440
old madam said this when she was fine.

738
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Every time someone mentioned the well,

739
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,440
she was a little panic.

740
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,440
As for why,

741
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
I don't know either.

742
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
You don't have to send Caihe.

743
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,440
I can go by myself.

744
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Miss Jiu, take care.

745
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Master San.

746
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Beat him to death!

747
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Kill all the people in the well.

748
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
The servants are investigating at home.

749
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Father still thinks we are not shameful enough.

750
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Is that it?

751
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
This is not a good place to live.

752
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,080
You are a traitor, I will kill you

753
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Cai He

754
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Master

755
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Enough

756
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
You still have the nerve to scold Chen

757
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
If you didn't favor that bitch

758
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
How could you do this

759
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Go

760
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
The three of us

761
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,080
Now is the time for the storm

762
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,080
We can't let anyone see us

763
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Cai He

764
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
You go

765
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Arrange all the maids in that house in Jiangxi

766
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
What Jiangxi

767
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
I want to kill them secretly

768
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
After a while

769
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,080
Kill all those who like to talk

770
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Who is so vicious

771
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
Put incense in the pregnant woman's medicine

772
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
It's a disaster

773
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I can't

774
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
If someone is in favor of sister-in-law

775
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,080
Brother has no other woman

776
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Who can put his hand in her yard

777
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
Even if brother is not fond of sister-in-law

778
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,080
It doesn't hurt his own flesh

779
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Anyway, there are not many good people in this house

780
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
This medicine is used up

781
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
I have to go to the pharmacy tomorrow

782
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
By the way

783
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
I told you to put those purple bamboo in the box

784
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,080
What happened

785
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
You are right

786
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
It's Wantang

787
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
I put the purple bamboo in an invisible place

788
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,080
Let Wantang clean the house

789
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
Wantang

790
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
Go clean the makeup table of your wife

791
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
Ok

792
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
Sister Fulin, I'm done

793
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Then you go to rest for a while

794
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
it is good

795
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
I went to the second door with him

796
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
I found that he gave the thing to a woman

797
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,080
and came back

798
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
I think he is good

799
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,080
I didn't expect he is a playwright

800
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Madam

801
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,080
How about I go to inquire about that woman tomorrow

802
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm not worried about that woman

803
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
Let's prepare some Wantang

804
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
Madam

805
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,080
Does Lianye's death have anything to do with aunt Ba?

806
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I can't be sure about this

807
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,080
But the way to kill Lianye and aunt Ba is very similar

808
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,080
They were attacked by the police and died of suffocation

809
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
They all went to Zizhu forest

810
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,080
Lianye has the scar of running away and resisting

811
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
It can be seen that the criminal is the first time to commit a crime

812
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,080
He has no experience of controlling the victim

813
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
And aunt Ba's fatal injury is only one

814
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,080
The criminal is very strong

815
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,080
He is very aggressive

816
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,080
It's not the first time to kill

817
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,080
I have no doubt

818
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,080
I have no doubt

819
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,080
If we find the murderer who killed aunt Ba

820
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Lianye's death will be clear

821
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,080
Similarly

822
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,080
Only the murderer knows Lianye has been to Zizhu forest

823
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,080
The master behind Wantang

824
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,080
is very likely the murderer who killed aunt Ba

825
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Sister Jiu

826
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Sister Jiu

827
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,080
Sister Jiu

828
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Help

829
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Sister Jiu

830
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Brother, don't worry

831
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,080
What's wrong?

832
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,080
No, no

833
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,080
It's the crown prince of Rui

834
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
He came to my yard

835
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
Then I can't hide my illness

836
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,080
Why did the crown prince go into the yard again?

837
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
It's said that Liu Chuan is missing

838
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
He is looking for him everywhere

839
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
Then Liu Chuan is

840
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Sister Jiu

841
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,080
If I was caught by aunt Ba's adulterer

842
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
That would be too unjust

843
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
The rabbit doesn't eat grass

844
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,080
If I touch my father's woman

845
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,080
Then I will be a beast

846
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Brother, don't worry

847
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,080
I will tell the crown prince about your illness

848
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
Really?

849
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
Really

850
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,080
Thank you sister Jiu

851
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,080
Sister Jiu

852
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,080
Sister Jiu

853
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,080
The house is not peaceful recently

854
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,080
Old lady has many troubles

855
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
I tell you

856
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
Don't go to Zizhu forest

857
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,080
Old lady

858
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,080
She is afraid of the water well in the house

859
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,080
She is so afraid that

860
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
She will lock the well in the house overnight

861
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,080
She is crazy

862
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Brother

863
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,080
Do you know that there is a well in Zizhu forest?

864
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,080
How do you know?

865
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
You just tell me

866
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Does the old lady lock the well in Zizhu forest

867
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
Is it related to that well?

868
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
Yes

869
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,080
The wind blows

870
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,080
The moon shines

871
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,080
The moon shines

872
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,080
The moon shines

873
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,080
The moon shines

874
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
The moon shines

875
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
The moon shines

876
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
The moon shines

877
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,080
The moon shines

878
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,080
The moon shines

879
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
The moon shines

880
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,080
The moon shines

881
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,080
The moon shines

882
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
The moon shines

883
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:51,080
The wind and snow give me a bow

884
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:58,080
If a deep love can be like a heart

885
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,080
The pain will also be happy

886
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,080
Open your heart

887
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,080
Love does not matter the deep sea

888
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,080
Please give me courage

889
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,080
Let fate be open

890
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,080
Don't be afraid of the starlight

891
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,080
Be covered by the night sky

892
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,080
The stars will shine

893
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:34,080
Outside the sky

894
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,080
The stars are like dust

895
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:45,080
But they are the colors of the starry sky

896
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,080
The stars are like dust

897
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,080
But they are the colors of the starry sky

898
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,080
The stars are like dust

899
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,080
But they are the colors of the starry sky

900
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,080
The stars are like dust

901
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,080
But they are the colors of the starry sky
