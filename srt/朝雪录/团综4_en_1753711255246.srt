1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Find Zhang Tai and Maidong back

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,960
Maidong invites you to watch

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,000
the five-month big detective

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,360
Your Highness

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,960
Your Highness

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,600
Your Highness

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,920
I caught six artists on the street

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,040
Please punish me

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,600
I have to watch a dance

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
I can't watch it

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,160
Six what?

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,440
Six artists

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,160
Artists

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,160
I'm ENTP

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,480
Come on

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,160
Six artists, come here

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,880
Bring them up

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,640
My lord

19
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,840
I'm innocent, my lord

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,920
You're innocent

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,400
I don't know

22
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,840
if I can get down

23
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,480
Come on

24
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,640
Six artists, stand still

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,680
You're all drunk

26
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,240
You'll think I'm watching a dance

27
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,800
You know?

28
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,440
Some of us can dance

29
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,560
We can dance

30
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,720
Come on

31
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,360
Your talent

32
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,400
I know that

33
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,360
90,000 words

34
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,760
Come on

35
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,080
Three, two, one

36
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,640
I want to let you go

37
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,240
I want to let you go

38
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,720
But I can't let him

39
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,200
Let him

40
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,560
Let you go

41
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,720
I'm also

42
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,920
I'm also

43
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,080
Two people

44
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,480
Good

45
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,560
I like it

46
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,320
I'll learn it when I get back

47
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,800
Enough

48
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,640
Do you know what you did?

49
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,400
No

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,280
You don't know, do you?

51
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,560
Someone stole my sky-viewing picture

52
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,960
It must be the second-class artist

53
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:34,920
Artist

54
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,640
Come on

55
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,480
We're artists

56
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,040
Bring me my treasure

57
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,680
Yes

58
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,400
His treasure

59
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
Isn't his treasure double-edged sword?

60
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,560
You must have a thief in it

61
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,880
The thief must be guilty

62
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,600
I want to see who is guilty today

63
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,560
You two

64
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,040
Divide it into two groups

65
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,720
Touch the things in the box

66
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
If you can feel it

67
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,880
I'll spare him for now

68
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,520
If you can't

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,040
Keep touching

70
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,240
Stand on both sides

71
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,800
Stand on it

72
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,360
OK

73
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,760
Come on

74
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,440
Put their handcuffs down first

75
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,960
You're capable

76
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,440
I like it

77
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,800
I like it

78
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
I'm weak

79
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,640
But these things are okay

80
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,480
Not bad

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,840
Come on

82
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,960
You two

83
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,160
Put your hands into the box

84
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,400
This is too

85
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,320
It's really a bit exaggerated

86
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,000
It's really a bit disgusting

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,400
Come on

88
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,520
Ladies first

89
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,080
OK?

90
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,040
Come on

91
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,240
Where to start?

92
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,880
From these two sides

93
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,640
Come on

94
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,520
Touch it slowly

95
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,760
Touch it carefully

96
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,280
Touch it carefully

97
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,560
What are you looking at?

98
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,200
It's alive

99
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Touch it carefully

100
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,400
Is there a spider?

101
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,080
No

102
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,040
It doesn't matter if there's no spider

103
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,080
Touch it

104
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,080
It's stuck

105
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,960
You have to take it out

106
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,680
You touched it again

107
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,280
I touched it

108
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,800
No

109
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,280
It's moving

110
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,960
It's moving

111
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,920
You're crazy

112
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,480
It's a spider

113
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,960
It's breathing

114
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:30,960
This one

115
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,600
Mud

116
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,440
Why don't you touch it?

117
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,560
Mud

118
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,320
Not bad

119
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,600
You two

120
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,040
You've passed this level

121
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,000
But

122
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
It's a bit simple

123
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,160
You have to learn some words from me

124
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,080
I didn't say it

125
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,960
I heard that

126
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,600
There are some rumors in the world

127
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,440
You learn from me

128
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,920
I'll say one word and you learn one

129
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,520
Do you want to slide on my shoulder?

130
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,760
Do you want to slide on my shoulder?

131
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,120
Do you want to slide on my nose?

132
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
It's just a word

133
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,080
Slide

134
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,080
Do you want to slide on my nose?

135
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:27,720
Do you want to swim in my neck?

136
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
The last sentence is

137
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,960
Do you want to hide in my belly?

138
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,800
Not bad

139
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,640
I like you very much

140
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,520
How about this?

141
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,400
Make a few more sentences

142
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,920
I'll pass this level

143
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,520
Do you want to play Go with me in my belly?

144
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,360
It's a bit different

145
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,440
You two face to face

146
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,120
Stare at each other

147
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:53,840
Come on

148
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you want to swim in my head?

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,640
Try it

150
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,360
OK, not bad

151
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,040
You two

152
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,000
You've passed this level

153
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,280
OK

154
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,600
The other four haven't passed this level

155
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,280
OK

156
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,640
Come on

157
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,920
No

158
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,520
Don't do it

159
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,640
This time

160
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,520
I need to upgrade it a little bit

161
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,480
It's easy

162
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
During the process of touching

163
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,120
I need to ask and answer quickly

164
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,680
OK

165
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,160
No matter what I ask

166
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,920
Answer quickly

167
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,440
OK

168
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,960
Come on

169
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,720
What?

170
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,400
Where are you holding?

171
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,320
Say it quickly

172
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,160
Where are you holding?

173
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm holding

174
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm holding the yellow hand

175
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,480
Hurry up

176
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,320
I can't do it

177
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,000
Hurry up

178
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,640
Say three advantages of Yixing

179
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,200
Say it

180
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,920
Good boy

181
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,760
Beautiful

182
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,280
They are both red

183
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,800
Who do all the girls like most?

184
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,920
Of course it's Yue Ning

185
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
What is this?

186
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,600
What is this?

187
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,480
Is it alive?

188
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
It's alive

189
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,060
It

190
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,400
Are they animals who can eat?

191
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,160
Be bold

192
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,000
...

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,760
Clam?

194
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,800
A little bit

195
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,440
A squid

196
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,080
WAIT

197
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:40,160
Red cat

198
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm so excited

199
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,160
Come on, let's change a seat

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,600
Let's have a look

201
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,560
Come on, reveal the truth

202
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
This is not good

203
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,680
This is not good

204
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,960
This will really bite

205
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,920
Bite

206
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,520
What is he talking about

207
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,560
This time, you two

208
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
You have to upgrade a little bit

209
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,800
I want to listen to you two

210
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,640
While singing and touching

211
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,120
If you can't sing well this time

212
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll do it

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,600
I'll do it

214
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,400
I'll do it

215
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,720
You do it

216
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,640
I like you so much

217
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,240
Don't hit yourself

218
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,600
Come on, start singing

219
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,720
Hurry up

220
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,240
Lu Qing, you are so beautiful

221
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,720
Fans

222
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
What fans

223
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,480
Strong fans

224
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,000
No

225
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,040
Less fans

226
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,240
No

227
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,480
We are fans

228
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
You are so fast

229
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,880
You guessed it before you finished singing

230
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,000
No, the main thing is that

231
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,120
There is nothing scary when you touch it

232
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
Your Highness

233
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,640
Cang Bao found the thief

234
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,520
What

235
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,200
Look, we are innocent

236
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,720
It must be the leader of you six

237
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,320
To save you

238
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,560
If you don't believe it, let's go over there and have a look

239
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,240
Yes

240
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,160
Come on, take these six people here

241
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Go with me

242
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,240
Don't press, we will go by ourselves

243
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
I don't believe it

244
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,200
Rong Chief

245
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,680
God, is it worry-free

246
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,000
Looks like I can kill a thief with one stick

247
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
This thief must be here

248
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,480
or behind?

249
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,120
Behind this

250
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,280
Behind this

251
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,200
This is a crypt

252
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,320
You do know the prince

253
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,080
Bye.

254
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,160
Oh my god.

255
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,440
Don't be afraid.

256
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,360
Don't be afraid.

257
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
Slow down.

258
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,160
Slow down.

259
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,720
This is too high.

260
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,040
Stop him.

261
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
Chen Hongsheng.

262
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,240
Isn't this Lord Chen?

263
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,240
Lord Chen.

264
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,000
Why is this?

265
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,280
If I say

266
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,920
this is a beautiful misunderstanding,

267
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,680
do you believe me?

268
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,280
Yes.

269
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,160
Then this misunderstanding is a bit beautiful.

270
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,360
Come on, Lord Chen.

271
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,040
Let me see.

272
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,640
So ambiguous.

273
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,200
Yes.

274
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,680
A bit ambiguous.

275
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,560
A bit enjoyable.

276
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,200
A pair of hands.

277
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,080
Do you know what this hand

278
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,040
does?

279
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,560
It can travel through time and space.

280
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,840
Does this thing work?

281
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
This thing

282
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,720
has a special use.

283
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,680
Let me show you.

284
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,760
You lied to me.

285
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,880
How do you think I can sit on this chair?

286
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
You are...

287
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,520
You are good at it.

288
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,760
Good at it.

289
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,440
This thing is good.

290
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,720
Really.

291
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,200
Let me try.

292
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,280
Let me show you.

293
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll show you later.

294
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,840
Great.

295
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,720
Come on.

296
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,000
Lock Lord Chen in the prison.

297
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,480
Serve him strictly.

298
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,440
No.

299
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,320
I, Chen Hongsheng,

300
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
will definitely come back.

301
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,040
He looks happy.

302
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,440
He is enjoying it.

303
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,720
Is there any reward?

304
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,920
I will definitely come back.

305
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,280
This thing looks

306
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,120
strange.

307
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,320
I'll keep it.

308
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,240
Why did you keep it?

309
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,520
You may travel through time.

310
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,720
What is travel?

311
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,120
You may go to a place

312
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
where no one knows you.

313
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,600
You will start to become a good performer.

314
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,720
I want this.

315
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,680
It's easy to say.

316
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,920
I have prepared four levels

317
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,000
waiting for you to sit on it.

318
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I will give you a box of time.

319
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,680
OK.

320
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,280
If you can't finish it,

321
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,720
you will stay here with me forever.

322
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,400
OK?

323
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,080
So cool.

324
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,920
How about this?

325
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,400
I'll exchange it with that.

326
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,080
He will keep it.

327
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,560
OK.

328
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,920
Let's act as if we are friends.

329
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
Let's go through the level first.

330
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,600
OK?

331
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,920
Hurry up.

332
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
The first level.

333
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,240
Two people act together.

334
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,760
Eat three pieces of bamboo.

335
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,800
Eat two pieces of fish for each other.

336
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,520
Pass the level.

337
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,280
I'll eat it.

338
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,200
The eye mask and your vision are so high.

339
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,000
The position of the eye is very suitable.

340
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,520
Come on.

341
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,440
Three, two, one, go.

342
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,200
Here?

343
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,080
Yes.

344
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,400
Hold your hand.

345
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,160
There are two hands.

346
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,400
Hold your hand and pinch the middle of the chopsticks.

347
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,200
You hold that side.

348
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,080
That side is the tip.

349
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,000
That side is the tip.

350
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,880
Yes, pinch it.

351
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Slow down.

352
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Down.

353
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,640
Your chopsticks are down.

354
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,880
Then to the left.

355
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,240
Yes.

356
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,040
OK.

357
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,120
The first piece.

358
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,680
The second piece.

359
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,600
Is it one piece?

360
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,080
One piece.

361
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,920
Do we have to eat like this?

362
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,440
We have to eat.

363
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,320
Tear it off.

364
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
It's too sticky.

365
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,680
Yes.

366
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,520
The main thing is that it's a little big.

367
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,600
It's so sticky.

368
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,880
I can't speak.

369
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,800
I'll add the next one first.

370
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,760
Where?

371
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,280
Yes.

372
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,680
That's it.

373
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,800
To the front.

374
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,320
To the left.

375
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,720
Yes.

376
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,080
Yes.

377
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,240
It's stuck.

378
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
Harder.

379
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,320
Yes.

380
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,720
Come on, open your mouth.

381
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,520
Open your mouth and go inside.

382
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,920
OK.

383
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,560
OK.

384
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,520
Congratulations on passing the level.

385
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,960
Please go to the next level.

386
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,120
Hurry up.

387
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,000
Is it here?

388
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,640
Where?

389
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,600
Is it here?

390
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,280
I have a feeling that it's you two.

391
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,360
The second level.

392
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
The pain is gone.

393
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,760
The two of you have two sharp feet.

394
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,640
One rope.

395
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,240
Jump three times.

396
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,600
The scream is not loud enough.

397
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,960
Again.

398
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,680
Whether you pass the level or not,

399
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,800
it's up to me.

400
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,840
It seems to be better.

401
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
One.

402
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,760
One, two.

403
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,240
I want to eat.

404
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,160
Waner.

405
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,080
The road ahead is difficult.

406
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,800
Are you willing to go with me?

407
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,720
I'm willing.

408
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,680
Three, two, one.

409
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,280
I...

410
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,000
It's OK.

411
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,360
Just jump.

412
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,320
Just sit on the ground.

413
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,520
It's painful.

414
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Qiong Rong.

415
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,600
Please.

416
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,080
Please.

417
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,440
Still begging.

418
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,640
OK.

419
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
I'll use this.

420
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,480
This is good.

421
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
This mat is good.

422
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
You're the best.

423
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,640
I'll use this.

424
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,520
You're the best.

425
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,280
Come on.

426
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,040
You're so handsome.

427
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,720
I'm so happy.

428
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,120
I'm so happy.

429
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,400
I'm so happy.

430
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
I'm so happy.

431
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,520
It still hurts when I touch it.

432
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,400
It's OK.

433
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,440
It's better.

434
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,800
Yes, it's a scream.

435
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,400
Come on.

436
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
One, two, three.

437
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,760
You're so funny.

438
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,480
Move your feet up.

439
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,400
Wait.

440
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,200
What?

441
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,280
You finally figured it out.

442
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,000
You finally figured it out.

443
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,080
I'm thinking why I have to

444
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,960
touch the mat.

445
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,080
Why you two

446
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,640
haven't figured it out

447
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,960
for so long?

448
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,800
You're so good.

449
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,600
There's no other way.

450
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Come on.

451
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,800
You get closer.

452
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,200
Come on.

453
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
I have to be faster.

454
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,600
How is it?

455
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,120
Come on.

456
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,920
Wait.

457
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
My feet.

458
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
My head.

459
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,720
So refreshing.

460
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
They're so tired.

461
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Come on.

462
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,640
Come on.

463
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,160
Get ready.

464
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,520
One, two, three.

465
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,520
One, two, three.

466
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
One, two, three.

467
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
One, two, three.

468
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
One, two, three.

469
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
One, two, three.

470
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
One, two, three.

471
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,040
I have to be faster.

472
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,760
Really?

473
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,840
You want to hit him, right?

474
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,040
You want to hit him, right?

475
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
What?

476
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,480
Did I make you unhappy

477
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,240
when we were filming?

478
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,200
We...

479
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Come on.

480
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Calm down.

481
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Calm down.

482
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,120
Come on.

483
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Calm down.

484
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm so tired.

485
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,640
It's okay.

486
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
It's okay.

487
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Come on.

488
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,160
One, two, three.

489
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
One.

490
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Two.

491
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Wait.

492
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Wait.

493
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Wait.

494
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,560
You stepped on it at the end.

495
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,760
So heartbroken.

496
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,440
Okay, congratulations.

497
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,160
Welcome to the next round.

498
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
Hurry up.

499
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,360
Where is the next round?

500
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,560
Hurry up.

501
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,920
The most important position.

502
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,560
Here is the third round.

503
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Rose-themed.

504
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,920
Please stand.

505
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,280
The first person lies on the ground.

506
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,080
Sit up and sit.

507
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,960
Send the rose in your mouth to the other person.

508
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,920
Five roses in total.

509
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,640
Successful.

510
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Okay, come on.

511
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,320
Wait.

512
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,240
You...

513
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,040
You throw it over there.

514
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,440
Then I'll bite this side.

515
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,520
Two, three, two, one.

516
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Wait.

517
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Alright.

518
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,800
A cake.

519
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,000
A cake.

520
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,680
Nice.

521
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,660
My turn,

522
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,240
my turn.

523
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Congratulations

524
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Keep it yourself

525
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Five flowers

526
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Five golden flowers

527
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Congratulations

528
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Now please move on to the next level

529
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Congratulations

530
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Go, hurry up

531
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Where is the fourth level

532
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
Here

533
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Here, here

534
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Here

535
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
See you again, everyone

536
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Congratulations to you for coming to the last level

537
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,440
You six have to write a paper and a pen together

538
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Write down your wishes

539
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,440
You don't have much time left

540
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Like this

541
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
That side is low

542
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
Come on

543
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Stick the ink

544
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
Stick the ink

545
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Low

546
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Put it down

547
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
What shall we write

548
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Write a simple word

549
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
OK

550
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
We can write a exclamation mark

551
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
I was just about to say

552
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
We are so good

553
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
No ink, Zhang Jiaxin

554
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
One more time

555
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
He adds difficulty to himself

556
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Hurry up, don't drop it

557
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
OK, stop

558
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Click

559
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
Perfect

560
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
Art

561
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Congratulations to you

562
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Congratulations

563
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
This is done

564
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
Let me see what this is

565
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Go

566
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Come is calm

567
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Go is go

568
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Click yes

569
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Shake your head

570
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
What language is this

571
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
This is our curse

572
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
This is the language of the future

573
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
The language of the future

574
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
That's fine

575
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Come on

576
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
This is what you want, right

577
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Double B

578
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
After a long time

579
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Finally got this double B

580
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Although I can't bear to leave this era

581
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
But we have to go back

582
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Yes

583
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
But after we go back

584
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
What are we doing

585
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
What are we doing

586
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Is there any drama to broadcast recently

587
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
What's it called

588
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
What's it called

589
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Which platform

590
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Love Qiyi

591
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
What's the name

592
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Zhang Xuelu

593
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Let's go home and watch

594
