1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The End

2
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Princess

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Where is the Princess?

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The King is not well

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I will go to the scene first

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yan Chi

8
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We finally waited for this day

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Open the door

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Princess, don't

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is about the King's mansion

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It needs the Dali Temple and the Ministry of Justice to send a letter

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Only then can we open this door

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Princess

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is a criminal's mansion

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can't destroy the seal without permission

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's against the law of the Heaven

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
His Majesty gave me the authority to walk

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
His Majesty ordered me to go to the banquet

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why did you say it without permission?

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If His Majesty is not willing

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will personally ask His Majesty for forgiveness

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will personally ask His Majesty for forgiveness

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will personally ask His Majesty for forgiveness

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I will personally ask His Majesty for forgiveness

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The King's Mansion

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Where is the thief?

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Bring him here

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Go

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Go

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What happened last night?

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Tell me the truth

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I heard from someone in the casino

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The King's Mansion

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Was sealed

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The servants buried a lot of treasures in the backyard

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I thought

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I would come here to see the luck

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The soil here is indeed fresher than anywhere else

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I...

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What?

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The King's Mansion

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I am the Minister of Justice, Zheng Fuying

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I tore the seal

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you want to investigate

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will go to the Court of Judicial Review with you

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You misunderstood

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I am here

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
To find the bones that suddenly appeared

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
As for the seal

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Even if you don't do it

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I will also unseal it

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
When I was investigating the King's Mansion

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I had someone search the place

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There is no possibility of hiding anything in the mansion

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But a year later

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
A body suddenly appeared

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I will find out the reason

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But I don't like to interfere in other people's affairs

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't like to work with people

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Even the Court of Judicial Review doesn't allow it

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No one can catch the ability of the Princess

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
As long as the Princess can let me

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Find out the results as soon as possible

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can explain it to the Emperor

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
She didn't stop me from investigating

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I just finished the first inspection

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The victim is a man

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Age between 20 and 23 years old

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
About 68 inches

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The body is also a corpse

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The body is already a corpse

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The time of death is more than a year

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you know why the body is dead?

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The victim's chest bone is scarred

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It should have been pierced into the heart by a person from the front

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Two inches of sharpness

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Is it a sword or a dagger?

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you want to know the cause of death

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You need to do further tests to know

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The victim is tall

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The eyes are round

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The eyes are round

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It is more than the people of the Zhou Dynasty

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It seems to have foreign blood

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This Li Muyun is really not a common man

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can't let him get close to this body

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Li Siqing is a good person

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He is indeed a master of the court

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
In this case, I don't have to worry about it

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Just let Siqing handle it

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Princess, please calm down

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I definitely have no intention of

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
To be angry in front of the Princess

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Please give me the credit

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Forgive me for being crazy

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Since it is a matter of credit

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It is not easy to escape

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Zheng Fuying

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Please move this body to the courier house

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Without my permission

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No one is allowed to enter

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, Your Highness

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I haven't heard the word King Jin for a long time

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am incompetent

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Get up

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You are not to blame for this

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Thank you, Your Majesty

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But this matter involves King Jin

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You still need to investigate it carefully

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How about this?

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's put this matter aside

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yongci doesn't have to rush to throw a banquet

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now the Empress Dowager's body has just recovered

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Want to go out of the city to visit the Qing Dynasty

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How about this?

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's wait until the last day of the year

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes, Your Majesty

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can leave now

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Princess Yongci, please stay

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yongci, you have to spend more time with the Empress Dowager

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And the Princess

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yongci

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please don't worry about the King Jin

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So that the two old people won't be sad

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I understand

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You are always thoughtful

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I am relieved

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You are full of filial piety

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You should think about your life

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I am not in a hurry

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You are not in a hurry

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am afraid someone is in a hurry

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If you have someone you like

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Tell the Empress Dowager

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I will help you

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, Your Majesty

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Your Majesty

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You are really worried about Prince Rui

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yongci is already a simple person

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If Yan Chi is more considerate than his father

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He can't help this marriage

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You are really worried about him

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I am worried about him

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I am worried about him

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I am worried about him

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's okay

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why?

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why do you want me to die with you

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
For your own cause?

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is not fate

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This is stupid

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Get out

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't have a son like you

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Come

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Like this

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Blow more

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Come, drink tea

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Waner is with you

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
She is so happy

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yes

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't know when she will be like before

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She is still young

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Everything will be fine when she grows up

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I hope so

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't worry

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think she is lucky

171
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
She is lucky

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
She will have a good life

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Speaking of luck

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Did you hear about it?

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Prince Yu married a concubine

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He gave her a child

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I am really lucky

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
She has been eating and drinking all her life

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
She has a daughter

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
She has a son

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know how many people she killed

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Longfeng?

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I am so lucky

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What do you mean by that?

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think no one can compare with you

187
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Look at the emperor

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He is so smart

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Prince Rui is so brave

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He has a daughter

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
She is with you

192
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What else can you do?

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Look at me

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have only one son

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I will cry

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You are getting older

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You are getting more and more talkative

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Grandma

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let me see

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Blow

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Good

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You should grow up well

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Waner

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What is Xiaoqi busy with?

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What?

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I haven't seen her in the palace for days

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If she doesn't show up

208
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I will have to help you look at her

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't care if she shows up

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't want to look at her

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Look at her

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
She is so quick to say what she thinks

213
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Waner is so generous

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If Xiaoqi doesn't come to beg me

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I won't marry Waner to her

216
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes, that's the decision

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yanchi

218
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You must come back safely

219
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Brother

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Brother

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The royal family in the capital is under my supervision

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I promise you

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I will tell you every day how much rice they eat

224
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I just want you to beg the emperor

225
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And marry Princess Yongning to me before the wedding

226
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why don't you beg my mother?

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
She is your aunt

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My aunt loves my cousin the most

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
She will be happy as long as she says it

230
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yongning is a hot tempered person

231
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He is not easy to deal with

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Aren't you afraid that you will be a groom?

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And you will be in trouble?

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I will just cook rice and eat it

235
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You are so good at cooking

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If she still wants to be a groom

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I will divorce her

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If I can't divorce her, I will send her to the temple

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You are so generous

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Brother, I am not like you

241
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I am a man who does great things

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Why should I be generous?

243
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Brother, look at me

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you want me to help you?

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Sure

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Do me a favor first

247
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Go ahead

248
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No, no, no, no

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yan Qi is a man who does great things

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If he knows about this

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I will be doomed

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He is not in the capital

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's too late to know

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes

255
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I will go to the temple

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Li, do you remember what you should pay attention to when hunting?

257
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You should not act without permission

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You should not enter the forest alone

259
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You should not...

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You should not...

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You should not hunt alone and get hurt

262
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You are right

263
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If there is anything that you don't know

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You should ask the Crown Prince

265
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You are really a child who is not grown up

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You are always making a fuss

267
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Your Majesty, if I am a child

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What are Crown Prince and Brother Qi?

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You are really a silly child

270
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I will go over there

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Your Highness

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
General Jiang ordered me to tell you that Yan Chi has left Shuo Xi

273
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's time

274
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Good

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Do as planned

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Brother, why are you here?

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That was...

279
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You should ask less to survive

280
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
How is it going with what I told you to do?

281
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I have already arranged it

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I will wait for you to order me

283
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Why are you in a hurry?

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This kind of thing

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You should play it slowly

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So you don't waste your time

287
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That kid in Xieqing Mountain

288
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He is really a child

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That kid in Xieqing Mountain

290
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
He is the right person to be the Crown Prince

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
When we go over there

292
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Mrs. Hu and Mrs. Wu

293
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You should take a look

294
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Mrs. Wu's taste is right

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Mrs. Wu's taste is right

296
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He is just a second rank official

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
He will not be able to be the Crown Prince

298
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Second rank official?

299
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What is the difference between him and Xia Dongbing?

300
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Xiang, what do you think?

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I will decide

302
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I can decide my own fate

303
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No one should think about it

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank you

305
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I am sorry

306
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I know a little

307
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I will take a look

308
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Can I?

309
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Fortunately, I am not injured

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I am fine

311
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Have you seen my mother, Mrs. Zhong Yonghou and sister?

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Only Mrs. Wu and Mrs. Zhong Yonghou came to the flower garden

313
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know if there is Mrs. Zhong Yonghou

314
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Thank you

315
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you want to go?

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can help you

317
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No, I can go by myself

318
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Goodbye

319
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Wait

320
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This

322
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's dirty

323
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Thank you

324
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Greetings, father

325
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Give the order

326
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Start the competition

327
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes

328
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Crown Prince, please

329
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Go

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Crown Prince, please

331
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It would be great if I could marry a man like Prince Chen

332
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What?

333
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Your Majesty

334
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You two are a match

335
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I heard it right

336
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Chen and Qi are a match

337
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You heard it right

338
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I know that Wen Wu is very sick

339
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He has been working hard to make a living

340
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He has never been lazy

341
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If Qi is half as hard as the Crown Prince

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He wouldn't be so bad at it

343
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Give the order

344
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
If you shoot, you will be rewarded

345
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes

346
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
If you are soft, don't force yourself

347
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You are so mean

348
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If you shoot again, you can't get the bow

349
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But the bow is mine

350
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You are mean

351
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Thank you for your compliment

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Your Majesty

353
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Your Majesty

354
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
One arrow, two arrows

355
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
One arrow, two arrows

356
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
One arrow, two arrows

357
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I am sorry for being late

358
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Please forgive me

359
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's good that you are late

360
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's not a big deal

361
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Get up

362
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Since the Empress Dowager has spoken

363
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Get up

364
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Thank you, Your Majesty

365
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Thank you, Your Majesty

366
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Did you set this up?

367
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I saw two arrows flying around the bird

368
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I was afraid that the bird would fly away

369
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Why did you use the arrow of a famous enemy?

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's not about the name

371
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I just wanted to warn you

372
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't want to hurt people's lives

373
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Your Majesty said that you have a big reward

374
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Don't be so harsh

375
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Prince of Rui, Yan Chi

376
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You are good at archery

377
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You will be rewarded with thousands of taels of gold

378
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Thank you, Your Majesty

379
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Father is really good at archery

380
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Father

381
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Wan

382
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Wan

383
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's been a long time

384
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
How are you doing?

385
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I have something to tell you

386
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What is it?

387
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
His Majesty hopes that Father will give up the military power

388
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But Father...

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
His Highness doesn't want to listen to you

390
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yes

391
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Father is worried that the military power will be used to attack the enemy

392
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
He insists on completely destroying the enemy

393
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But His Majesty is afraid that he can't wait for that long

394
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
If His Majesty insists on taking back the military power

395
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Is His Highness planning to rebel?

396
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Why do you have such a bad idea?

397
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm serious

398
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If His Majesty wants to take back the military power

399
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Either you and His Highness are expelled from the military

400
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I will be a foster child

401
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Or His Highness will rebel with the army

402
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
His Majesty will kill you and we will rebel

403
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We have to plan for that

404
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You just said you and I

405
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Even if I have nothing to do with it

406
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Even if I die because of it

407
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You have to marry me

408
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I will never separate from you

409
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Master, I have something to tell you

410
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Tell me

411
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
On the order that Noble Consort Su gave to the Qingtian Sword

412
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Princess Consort Chen reported that it was the name of the ninth lady

413
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I was afraid that it would cause a big trouble

414
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So I didn't dare to steal the book

415
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Please decide

416
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Prince Chen will never really want to marry me

417
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You must not act impulsively

418
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Don't worry

419
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
No matter what her plan is

420
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I will not let her succeed

421
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Then I will wait for your good news

422
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You are so busy and you rushed back

423
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I feel sorry for you

424
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I will do my best to do your job

425
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Then tell me

426
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
How was your job?

427
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Your Majesty

428
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
There is another secret in the military grain corruption case

429
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I arrived at Shuoxi

430
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
King of Rui has already removed the post of the food officer who colluded with the transport office

431
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I learned from the interrogation

432
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The one who gave the transport office food officer a bridge

433
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Was a local official from Liangzhou

434
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I didn't dare to investigate because I was afraid of disturbing the people

435
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But so far it has been clear

436
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
In the military grain corruption case

437
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Shuoxi Army is really a victim

438
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
King of Rui is not allowed to bribe and bribe people

439
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
There is another person behind the scenes

440
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Your Majesty

441
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
According to what I saw and heard

442
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
King of Rui is loyal to the Zhou Dynasty

443
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
He is very loyal to the emperor

444
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
King of Rui is the emperor's Shuoxi Army

445
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Also the same iron wall of Zhou Dynasty

446
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I am King of Rui's only son

447
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
If you still have doubts

448
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You can ask me to go to the capital

449
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If King of Rui doesn't listen to me, I will kill myself

450
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If you still can't

451
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You can take me to the capital

452
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Send to Shuoxi

453
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
To shock the whole army

454
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Don't talk nonsense

455
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yes

456
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You just said

457
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Even you are afraid to investigate Liangzhou officials

458
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Isn't that behind the scenes?

459
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I haven't heard from the emperor yet

460
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I dare not speak at this moment

461
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I beg your Majesty to give me some more time

462
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I will investigate thoroughly

463
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Tie the person behind the scenes to the emperor

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
People who are good at the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of War

465
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
How many can there be?

466
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Enough, I already know about this

467
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You go first

468
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Your Majesty, I have one more thing

469
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Your Majesty, the queen and the noble consort want to see you

470
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You wait inside first

471
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We will talk later

472
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes

473
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Your Majesty

474
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You have to be the judge for me and Qi

475
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The people who are in the inner world

476
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The women chosen by us

477
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The family and family

478
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I am not as good as the wife of the Marquis

479
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I am not as good as the Crown Prince

480
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's all my mother's fault

481
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I am not as good as her

482
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
If you have any feelings

483
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
If you have any other women

484
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You can decide for yourself

485
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You can report it to the Heavens

486
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I have to ask the queen for permission

487
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I don't know if it's allowed

488
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You don't have to ask for permission

489
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I have it

490
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Thank you, Your Majesty

491
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
People of Music

492
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,880
...

493
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,680
why don't you applause?

494
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
You're not going by yourself

495
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,160
Princess that說

496
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,560
Say something

497
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,360
2017

498
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:44,760
2019

499
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,320
let's go

500
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,200
Let's go

501
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Hurry up

502
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,440
aging

503
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,320
Let's go

504
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,200
Well

505
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,760
So I told you

506
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
U negative

507
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,720
Only ones who follow

508
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,600
To original

509
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,600
I can ask you to take good care of our Princess Yongning.

510
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Since it's what you asked me to do,

511
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I'll do it.

512
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
No need.

513
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
My sword can't kill people.

514
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,600
I'll beat you up with it.

515
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
I'm a thug, but I'm useful.

516
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
I can talk and talk to people.

517
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Unlike some people who ignore you,

518
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
I can walk without being convinced.

519
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm not good at martial arts,

520
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
but I'm useful.

521
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,600
I can use my sword to beat you up.

522
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Yanli, I won't mind if you make fun of me.

523
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
But if you make fun of Brother San,

524
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
I'll cut you off.

525
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,600
That's not what you mean, right?

526
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Take it.

527
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
That's what I mean.

528
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
You want to marry Brother San, you want me to die.

529
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
I'll die sooner or later.

530
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
I'll tell you clearly today.

531
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
I won't agree to marry Brother San.

532
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
I won't agree.

533
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
I can also not marry Brother San.

534
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,600
As long as I find a woman who can be with him,

535
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
I don't need to say anything.

536
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
You should have said it earlier.

537
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
I can't do this kind of thing.

538
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Whether it's family matters, taste, or talent,

539
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
I can give him everything.

540
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
What about his appearance?

541
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
He can't be worse than me.

542
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
He can't see.

543
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
But I can see.

544
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
You're being unreasonable.

545
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
He's better-looking than you.

546
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
How can I find him?

547
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
What are you laughing at?

548
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Fine, fine, fine.

549
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
I'll find him tomorrow.

550
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Bai Feng, you're the witness.

551
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,600
If I can find him, he can't fail.

552
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
I'll find him tomorrow.

553
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
I'll find him tomorrow.

554
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,600
I'll find him tomorrow.

555
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
I'll find him tomorrow.

556
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I'll find him tomorrow.

557
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
I'll find him tomorrow.

558
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
I'll find him tomorrow.

559
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,600
You can't do anything about me.

560
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,600
I have to go back and watch the night.

561
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I'm leaving now.

562
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Why don't you go find him now?

563
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
It's too dark.

564
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,600
It's not clear if you will find him.

565
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
Didn't you say you were good at acting?

566
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
I was just stupid.

567
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Could it be someone from the City King?

568
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Let's go.

569
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Let's go down.

570
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Yes.

571
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Hurry up. Get up.

572
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Slowly.

573
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
You look so dirty.

574
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Let me wipe it for you.

575
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Who are you?

576
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Don't move.

577
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
What medicine did you give me?

578
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Oh, you mean this?

579
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,600
This is what the Fengqi House specifically teaches girls to use.

580
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
It can wake you up, but it's full of poison.

581
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
It can't move you.

582
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
It can only let me do whatever I want.

583
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
What's the point of doing this?

584
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,600
I heard that you and Yongning are best friends.

585
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
If I were to get close to you...

586
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Who is it?

587
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Yongning?

588
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
You're so stubborn.

589
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,600
How dare you touch the girl I want?

590
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Yongning, are you really going to marry her?

591
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
She's just a civil servant.

592
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
It's a waste to get her married.

593
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Let's just forget it.

594
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
What?

595
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,600
She's not only the woman I want,

596
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,600
but also a dog by my side.

597
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
You don't deserve to touch her.

598
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Do you understand?

599
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Yongning, she's my aunt.

600
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
We're really close.

601
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
You're going too far.

602
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Close?

603
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,600
I'm the prince of the Tian family.

604
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,600
How can you be close to the Tian family?

605
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Yanqi, Yanqi.

606
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
You're not even the crown prince.

607
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
How dare you turn your back on me?

608
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
If it weren't for the Feng family,

609
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,600
who's going to pay for it?

610
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,600
You and your mother would have died in the palace.

611
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
When you asked me for money,

612
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
why didn't you say I didn't deserve it?

613
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Fine.

614
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Fine.

615
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
In conclusion,

616
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Inamb нихita

617
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
To prove She's quick to give up

618
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:52,480
Our將軍 我

619
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Could you see IFrom far away?

620
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
You really went crazy.

621
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
It's all dirty here.

622
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Let's change the place.

623
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Did you arrange the camp for the patrol?

624
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Yes.

625
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
The patrol is full of men from the city.

626
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Go and check who is missing tonight.

627
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Don't make any statements.

628
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Go and meet the guest.

629
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Yes.

630
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
And

631
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
you can't tell anyone about the encounter.

632
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Master, the encounter was not with the princess.

633
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
It was with me when I was hunting.

634
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
The secret key to Tianshu Camp.

635
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Hurry.

636
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
The secret key to Tianshu Camp

637
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
The smell of the drug powder.

638
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Waner.

639
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
The secret key to Tianshu Camp

640
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
How is it?

641
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Are you satisfied with the environment?

642
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,600
I rarely use these ideas on women.

643
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
You are really different from others.

644
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
You don't make any noise.

645
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
You are so calm.

646
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,600
I really like you.

647
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Why don't you be my concubine?

648
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
You want me to be your concubine

649
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
because you think highly of my talent.

650
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,600
I can help you to get a good job.

651
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
And I am the only one who can live.

652
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,600
I hope you can get along with the princess.

653
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,600
You think I am a coward who lives in the women's palace.

654
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
You are not.

655
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
You treat me like this.

656
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Because of Yan Chi, you lost your face.

657
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
You can't live a good life.

658
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,600
So you can only make your hatred worse by bullying me.

659
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
I warn you to shut up.

660
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
It seems you are not only a coward who lives in the women's palace.

661
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,600
You are a coward who lives in the women's palace.

662
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Now you know I am not a man who loves women.

663
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
I am afraid of being begged.

664
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,600
I am very patient to the woman who can make me happy.

665
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
I am afraid of snakes.

666
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
Do I have to go to the snake to save me?

667
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
You don't even understand this.

668
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,600
You are not only a coward but also a fool.

669
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Good.

670
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Good example.

671
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
But you are too smart.

672
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
You should keep Yan Chi.

673
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
I really want to see

674
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:45,600
how he knows you are completely broken by me.

675
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
It must be interesting.

676
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,600
At that time, you are the princess of Yongzi.

677
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:12,940
You are the one who is living in the

678
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Foundation.

679
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:27,600
I will kill you.

680
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
Oh dear money.

681
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Your stupid mother told you?

682
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Now it's all settled.

683
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
What?

684
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
You are my dad's father.

685
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,100
I in 6 weeks will change my life

686
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,700
Ha Seven!

687
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,100
Are you all right?

688
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:12,800
I'm fine.

689
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,740
Chris!

690
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,740
What are you doing?

691
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,740
How dare you kill me?

692
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,740
Yunche.

693
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,740
Yunche.

694
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:50,740
Why do you turn around at night?

695
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:57,740
But I still see your light.

696
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:04,740
The fire is burning in the snow.

697
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,740
It's so cold and warm.

698
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:16,740
If I fall into the shadow of love,

699
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:23,740
The snow will fall and my body will be white.

700
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:30,740
If I fall into the heart,

701
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,740
The pain will also be gone.

702
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,740
The pain will also be gone.

703
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,740
Open your heart.

704
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,740
Love is not afraid of the deep sea.

705
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,740
Please give me courage.

706
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,740
Let fate be open.

707
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,740
Don't be afraid of the starlight.

708
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,740
The moon will be bright.

709
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,740
The stars will shine.

710
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:11,740
The sky will be bright.

711
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,740
The sky is dark.

712
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:23,740
The stars are bright.

713
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:40,740
The sky is dark.

714
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,740
The sky is bright.

715
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,740
The sky is dark.

716
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,740
The sky is bright.

717
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,740
The sky is dark.
