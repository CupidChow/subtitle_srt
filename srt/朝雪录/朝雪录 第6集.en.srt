[Episode 6]

3
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,080
Prepare the carriage.
We're going to the Marquis Mansion!

4
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,720
Yes.

5
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,970
Greetings, Your Highness.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,860
Your Highness,

7
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,520
is Wan in the carriage?

8
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,160
Chen, why are you looking for me?

9
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,880
Wan, your sister-in-law
went to visit her family.

10
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,160
She started bleeding
the moment she entered the mansion.

11
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,490
The physician said
both she and the baby are in grave danger.

12
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,690
Fuling, go get the medicine box ready.

13
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,420
Understood.

14
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,440
Your Highness,

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,310
I'll examine
the Grand Princess another time.

16
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,980
I understand.

17
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,680
Go quickly.

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,169
I...

19
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,210
Cut them according to the prescription
and boil them.

20
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,670
Reduce three bowls to one,

21
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,710
and divide it into four doses.

22
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,800
Take three during the day,
and one at night.

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,060
Continue for two days.

24
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
Xinlan,

25
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,010
I've just finished the acupuncture.

26
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,070
Get some sleep now.

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,610
Wan.

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,840
How is it? Is the baby alright?

29
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,550
Xinlan is stable for now.

30
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,240
But she still needs to take her medicine.

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,520
If the bleeding returns,

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,210
we'll have to
perform the acupuncture again.

33
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,490
Great!

34
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,500
Oh my.

35
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,400
Why is this happening?

36
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,970
Thank you, Wan.

37
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,210
It's all thanks to you
that Xinlan and the baby are safe.

38
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,930
Chen, there's no need for that.

39
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,170
Xinlan is weak
in both Qi and blood circulation,

40
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,800
and she's already seven months pregnant.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,020
She shouldn't have made the trip
back to her hometown.

42
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,820
That was an oversight on my part.

43
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,840
Pregnant women are prone to overthinking.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,040
You'll need to spend more time with her,

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,420
so she doesn't fall into melancholy.

46
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,300
Alright.

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,560
Your Highness, you're entering
without considering others' opinions.

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,730
If word of this gets out,

49
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,610
I'm afraid it could damage the reputation
of the Young Marshal of the Shuoxi Army.

50
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,079
Miss Qin, you've done a commendable job
assisting the Yue family.

51
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,010
I simply wanted to thank

52
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,430
Madam Qin in person.

53
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,340
Please don't mention it, Your Highness.

54
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,579
It's my responsibility as a citizen.

55
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,210
There's one more thing—

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,010
Wan!

57
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,320
Wan,

59
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,450
you saved Xinlan and the baby today.

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,110
This is a little something from us.

61
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,110
Please accept it.

62
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,240
Wan, if you don't accept it,

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,440
it'll feel like you don't like our gift.

64
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,720
Well, thank you, Chen.

65
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,080
As long as you're happy with it.

66
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,210
I'll take my leave now, Your Highness.

67
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,409
My Lady,

68
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,280
this sapphire jewelry set
is from Jinxiu House.

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,570
They usually only take custom orders
from the wealthy and noble.

70
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,120
It's not something
you can get on short notice.

71
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,050
I believe

72
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,190
this was the head ornament
Chen originally bought for Xinlan.

73
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,640
Young Madam Qin is the second daughter
of the Prefect of Jianzhou.

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,230
I heard she became pregnant
soon after the wedding.

75
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,760
Young Master Qin
seems very pleased about it.

76
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,860
Your Highness,

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,620
how do you know so much
about the affairs of the Qin family?

78
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,280
It's because of you, Miss Qin.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,050
It's only natural
that the Yue and Qin families

80
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,680
will have more interactions in the future.

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,580
I feel it's necessary
to gain a better understanding.

82
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,240
Miss Qin, please don't take offense.

83
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,610
I wonder if my brother
is truly content with this marriage.

84
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,390
What does that have to do
with the Yue family?

85
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,000
Young Madam Qin hasn't fully recovered,

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,360
yet Young Master Qin
didn't stay by her side.

87
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,390
Instead, he rushed to give you
that lavish gift—right in front of me.

88
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,560
It seems that, to him,

89
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,290
the opinion of the royal family

90
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,250
matters more

91
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,490
than his wife's well-being.

92
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,320
Chen acted under the expectations
of Madam Qin and the Third Madam.

93
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,510
He did it

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,930
for the future of the third branch.

95
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,500
As a man,

96
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,930
he sacrificed his wife and child

97
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,140
for his own ambition.

98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,720
This place

99
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,620
was never meant for you.

100
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,430
Would you consider

101
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,409
returning to the capital?

102
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,830
I can make the arrangements.

103
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,260
My father has already been buried.

104
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,240
We still have property in the capital.

105
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,050
I'll go back sooner or later.

106
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,240
That's great.

107
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,740
In the future,

108
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,550
if I ever need anything,

109
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,760
please

110
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,980
lend me a hand.

111
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,350
That's what I thought.

112
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Your Highness hasn't fully recovered yet.

113
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,120
Please don't fight with anyone—

114
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,520
your wound might reopen.

115
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,230
Miss Qin, if you have time,

116
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,420
could you help prepare
the first-aid medicine I need?

117
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,280
I'll be leaving

118
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,620
Jingzhou soon.

119
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,210
Are you returning to Shuoxi?

120
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,300
How many days until you depart?

121
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,590
If I rush,
it will take three to five days.

122
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,300
If not, maybe six or seven.

123
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,490
That soon?

124
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,560
It's too late to test the medicine, then.

125
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
I'll head to the pharmacy
to gather the herbs.

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,200
Thank you for seeing me off,
Your Highness.

127
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,730
There's no need to be so formal
between us.

128
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,390
From now on,

129
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,150
you can call me Yan Chi.

130
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,460
I wouldn't dare overstep.

131
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,120
After all we've been through together,

132
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,730
I thought we shared
a certain understanding.

133
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,970
Why still so distant?

134
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,710
I don't dare speak of "understanding"
with Your Highness.

135
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,510
Your Highness is of royal blood—

136
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,910
manners must be upheld.

137
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,250
Master, are we really going back
to Shuoxi?

138
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,450
No.

139
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,970
Then why did you...

140
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,500
Why hasn't Miss Shen's portrait
arrived yet?

141
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,320
Shen Yi dismissed
all his servants before he fled.

142
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,190
Miss Shen had always stayed by
her father's side.

143
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,240
She hadn't been in the capital for long,

144
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,970
and she'd never attended
any poetry gatherings or flower festivals.

145
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,610
No one in the capital has seen her face.

146
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,390
She has a similar temperament.

147
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,400
Forget about her appearance for now.

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,530
Send the Eagle Squad

149
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,050
to search along the river
for any trace of her.

150
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,320
Report every single detail

151
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,120
immediately.

152
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,820
Yes.

153
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,750
Someone was spying on Miss Qin
under the cover of night.

154
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,150
Master, how did you know?

155
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,700
The muddy footprints were made by clogs.

156
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,530
Judging by the length of the wooden soles,

157
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,170
the person

158
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,770
was likely
around five feet seven inches tall.

159
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,040
Look at the direction of the footprints—

160
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,940
they lead

161
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,030
toward Tinglan Garden.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,460
But why are you certain
it happened at night?

163
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,170
It rained at 5 p.m. yesterday.

164
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,390
If the person had been spying before that,

165
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,950
they wouldn't have worn clogs,

166
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,210
and the footprints
would have been washed away by the rain.

167
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,660
Send word to Yingqi—

168
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,130
have him depart for Jingzhou immediately.

169
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,680
Yes.

170
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,100
Why are there so many herbs

171
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,320
for treating external injuries
in the mansion's pharmacy?

172
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm not sure.

173
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,600
Madam Qin oversees
all the medicinal supplies here.

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,930
Those rare herbs

175
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,460
are reserved for
the masters and madams only.

176
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,320
Help!

177
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,250
Someone's dead!

178
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,250
Someone's dead!

179
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,840
My Lady, don't go.

180
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,380
I'll go take a look.

181
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,770
Call for help if there's something wrong.

182
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,080
I'll go with you.

183
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,180
What are you waiting for?

184
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,510
Quickly, come and help!

185
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,780
My Lady!

186
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,250
Turn over.

187
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,340
We're too late—
she's been dead for some time.

188
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,110
Go get help.

189
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,200
Help! Someone's fallen into the water!

190
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,410
Help!

191
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,080
Lianye?

192
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,870
How could it be her?

193
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,970
You know her?

194
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,900
She

195
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,990
is one of Madam Qin's second-class maids.

196
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,650
Who are you?

197
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,200
Why are you here?

198
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,690
I am—

199
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
My Lady,

200
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,370
I've brought someone here.

201
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,250
Second Young Master.

202
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,970
Second Young Master?

203
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,370
My Lady, this is your cousin—

204
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,810
Young Master Qin Li from the third branch.

205
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,470
He doesn't often stay at home.

206
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,840
Li,

207
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,650
I didn't mean to be rude earlier—
my apologies.

208
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,450
I hope you won't take it to heart.

209
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,930
Not at all.

210
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,720
Don't mention it.

211
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,480
Second Young Master, Miss Qin.

212
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,630
Wait.

213
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,770
Report it to the authorities first.

214
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,800
We'll handle her after the coroner
has finished the examination.

215
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,530
Understood.

216
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,480
Steward Liu.

217
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,640
Lianye?

218
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,590
Miss Qin,

219
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,320
I'll take care of this matter.

220
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,370
You and the Second Young Master
should leave now.

221
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,420
When do you plan
to report it to the authorities?

222
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,020
Lianye is a second-class maid
under Madam Qin.

223
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,260
I'll need Madam Qin's instructions

224
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,550
before I can proceed.

225
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,780
Wan,

226
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,060
Madam Qin has always overseen
the household affairs.

227
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,510
You don't need to worry about it.

228
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,730
It's pouring outside.

229
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,140
Let me escort you back.

230
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,480
My Lady.

231
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,410
Thank you, Steward Liu.

232
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Li, give me the medicine.

233
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,760
Second Young Master,

234
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,600
you must be tired.

235
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Let me wipe your sweat.

236
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
No need.

237
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,650
It's fine, Second Young Master.

238
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,440
Let me wipe it for you.

239
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,150
No need.

240
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,170
Li, let me see.

241
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,960
Let me take a look.

242
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,290
Syphilis?

243
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,020
Please save me, Wan!

244
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,330
Li, did you follow me all this way

245
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,840
just to ask for treatment?

246
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,330
How did you know I was following you?

247
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,880
If you don't want to talk, please leave.

248
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,040
Wan,

249
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,800
I didn't mean any harm.

250
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,650
I've been lingering around
your courtyard all afternoon,

251
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,990
but I didn't have the courage to speak.

252
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,920
When I saw you... heading out,

253
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,810
I followed without thinking.

254
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,330
Please have a seat.

255
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,530
I can get up by myself.

256
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,380
Wan,

257
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,490
I know I'm just
a worthless illegitimate son.

258
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,890
I don't deserve your kindness.

259
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,420
This filthy disease of mine

260
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,190
should never taint your eyes.

261
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,890
But I have no choice.

262
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,900
If word gets out,

263
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,130
even if I survive,

264
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,360
my life will be completely destroyed.

265
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,240
Wan,

266
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,560
for the sake of the years
we spent growing up together,

267
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,680
please help me.

268
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,690
Give me your hand.

269
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,440
How long has it been?

270
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,260
Ten...

271
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,760
Three or four days.

272
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,340
Do you know who passed the illness to you?

273
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,800
Someone from the bro...

274
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,510
Bro...

275
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,330
Wan, stop asking.

276
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,490
I don't want to dirty your ears with it.

277
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,560
If I make it through this,

278
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,660
I swear I'll stay clean

279
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,800
and never go to those messy places again.

280
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,390
You know

281
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,870
this is a serious illness.

282
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,770
I can't guarantee a cure.

283
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,460
As long as you're willing to try,

284
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,720
that alone means the world to me.

285
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,750
I wouldn't ask for anything more.

286
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,530
Li,

287
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,530
I don't have the right medicine
with me now.

288
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,610
Why don't you come back
around this time tomorrow night?

289
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,870
Thank you so much, Wan.

290
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,170
Wan, if you need anything, please tell me.

291
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,570
I'll do anything for you.

292
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,290
Li, you just need to tell me—

293
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,690
is there any purple bamboo
in this mansion?

294
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,140
Behind the pond
is the Purple Bamboo Grove.

295
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,540
Wan, have you forgotten?

296
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,920
Second Young Master,

297
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,080
when Her Ladyship lived here,

298
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,710
she was under five years old.

299
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,020
I do remember seeing the grove,

300
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,540
but I can't recall exactly where it is.

301
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,880
There's no purple bamboo anywhere else

302
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,810
except in the Purple Bamboo Grove.

303
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,870
But Wan,

304
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,210
don't go there.

305
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,110
Grandma issued a ban long ago—

306
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,000
without her permission,

307
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,940
no one is allowed
to enter the Purple Bamboo Grove.

308
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,730
Why?

309
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,760
Wan, stop asking.

310
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,490
In this household,

311
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,430
the less you know, the better.

312
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,860
I'm leaving.

313
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,480
My Lady, where did you get
the purple bamboo?

314
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,770
From Lianye.

315
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,130
My Lady,

316
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,339
are you going to get involved in this?

317
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,780
What if His Highness

318
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,310
asks us to go to the capital
in the next few days?

319
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,670
We've been planning this for so long.

320
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,000
What if it gets delayed?

321
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,329
If that happens,

322
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,079
I'll ask His Highness

323
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,570
to pass on the clues
we found to Prefect Huo.

324
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,410
Anyway,

325
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,810
we can't let Lianye die for nothing.

326
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,770
Since Madam Qin
had already forbidden this place,

327
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,300
why would Lianye come here?

328
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,440
I knew it.

329
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,610
Miss Qin.

330
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,950
What are you doing here?

331
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
I'm not familiar with this mansion.

332
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,000
I went out for a walk early this morning
and lost my way.

333
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,060
Could you point me toward Tinglan Garden,
Steward Liu?

334
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,960
It's that way.

335
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,370
My Lady!

336
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,600
Where have you been this morning?

337
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,490
What happened?

338
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,270
I went to the Purple Bamboo Grove.

339
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,460
From the wounds on Lianye,

340
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,090
it looks like she was chased
and attacked there.

341
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,090
She must have seen

342
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,490
something she wasn't supposed to,

343
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,880
and it cost her her life.

344
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,520
Then,

345
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,200
I saw Steward Liu Chun.

346
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
The way he looked at me was chilling.

347
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,520
I've always found

348
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,260
Liu Chun a bit strange.

349
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,130
Back when he brought gifts
during the festivals,

350
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,930
he would just stare at us.

351
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,940
But he's a long-time servant
of this household.

352
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,810
Could it be...

353
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,580
Could it be that he killed Lianye?

354
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,640
My Lady,

355
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,930
this place gives me the creeps.

356
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,480
Why don't we

357
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,970
move back
to the Marquis of Anyang's Mansion?

358
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,580
We can't.

359
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,000
We have to stand on our own now.

360
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,470
If we rely on others for everything,

361
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,240
we'll never be able to
hold our heads high.

362
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,940
But...

363
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,130
Don't be afraid.

364
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,350
Just be prepared

365
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
and don't let anyone cause trouble.

366
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,730
Why is it so hard to live a peaceful life?

367
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,100
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

368
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,130
Not bad.

369
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,190
It's just that the landslide
looks a bit rough.

370
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,760
I've been on watch all night.

371
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,600
At least I managed to catch the spear.

372
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,860
Did you find anything?

373
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,090
Around 10:30 p.m.,

374
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,440
Qin Li and Miss Qin

375
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,610
went to Tinglan Garden together.

376
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,810
They chatted for a while,
then Qin Li left.

377
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,640
It looked like
he was seeking medical advice.

378
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,300
No one else came by after that.

379
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,300
Seeking medical advice?

380
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,370
Tell Yingqi to keep an eye on her.

381
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,440
Master, let me take over
watching Miss Qin.

382
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,440
Yingqi is still busy investigating

383
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,600
the assassin
who targeted you and the Prince.

384
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,730
We can't afford any delays in our plan.

385
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,800
You want to keep an eye on Fuling,
don't you?

386
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,670
Killing two birds with one stone.

387
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,400
I learned it from you.

388
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,280
I joined the Ministry of Justice

389
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,650
to investigate
the real culprit of Prince Jin's case

390
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,760
and the mastermind behind the plot
to seize the Shuoxi Army.

391
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,810
Miss Qin's autopsy skills

392
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,330
could be a great help to me.

393
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,580
You're clearly using your position
for personal gain,

394
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,240
yet you make it sound so noble.

395
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,150
Your footing is weak.

396
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,970
Go lift the stone lock 200 times.

397
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,680
Seriously?

398
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,940
Miss Qin, you are here.

399
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,700
Miss Fuling.

400
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,500
I need to prepare an emergency remedy
for the Heir of Prince Rui.

401
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,090
I'd like to choose the herbs myself.

402
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,480
Physician Qian, please lead the way.

403
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,090
Alright.

404
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,880
Isn't this the living Bodhisattva,

405
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,070
Miss Qin?

406
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,030
What brings someone of your stature

407
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,750
to our pharmacy today?

408
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,080
Concubine Liu,

409
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,930
Miss Qin is choosing herbs
for the Heir of Prince Rui.

410
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,330
We can't wait any longer.

411
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,960
Miss Qin, you've really climbed up
the ladder, haven't you?

412
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,320
I wonder—
how much does a consultation cost now?

413
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,660
What do you mean, Concubine Liu?

414
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,240
Are you saying

415
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,870
you'd like to consult me?

416
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,670
How would I dare trouble you, Miss Qin?

417
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,380
Just have Physician Qian
prepare my medicine.

418
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,130
I'll choose it myself.

419
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,430
Here.

420
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,930
She was so rude

421
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,480
just because Master Qin An favors her.

422
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,170
But I heard

423
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,080
he's been too sick
to handle anything lately.

424
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,280
Let's see how long her arrogance lasts.

425
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:37,950
Let me do it.

426
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
She's not worth getting angry over.

427
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,290
Let's just focus on our work.

428
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,070
Why is there only one basket?

429
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,200
What if Lord Yan's medicine

430
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,730
gets mixed up
with the Second Young Master's?

431
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,090
We'll sort them out later.

432
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,440
We need to keep a record
of all the herbs we've collected.

433
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,400
By examining the herbs, someone could
figure out the prescription formula.

434
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,340
If we don't mix in Lord Yan's medicine,

435
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,900
Li's condition might be exposed.

436
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,760
Miss Qin, did you find
all the herbs you needed?

437
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,410
The herb supply in the mansion
is quite complete.

438
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,050
Physician Qian, you manage it very well.

439
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,920
It's my duty.

440
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,280
What's wrong with Concubine Liu?

441
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,440
She said her menstrual cycle
has been irregular.

442
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,100
Who prescribed this formula?

443
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,040
I'm not sure.

444
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,430
Miss Qin, do you think it's appropriate?

445
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,140
If Concubine Liu believes it is,
then so be it.

446
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,700
Physician Qian,
please prepare some herbs for me.

447
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,740
Please excuse me.

448
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,360
Follow me.

449
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,130
My Lady, is something wrong
with the prescription?

450
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,260
It seems to cure menstrual disorders,

451
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,330
but in fact,

452
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,950
it's for syphilis.

453
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,100
Could it be...

454
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,530
Second Young Master?

455
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,040
I don't think so.

456
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Li didn't take any medicine before.

457
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,750
[Grace and Purity]

458
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,880
After coming to Miss Qin's courtyard,

459
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,930
be quick with your tasks

460
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,460
and cautious in all things.

461
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,110
Miss Qin, you're back.

462
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,990
Was Madam Qin looking for me?

463
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,400
She heard that Fuling has been
assisting you with diagnoses all day.

464
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,610
Worried that your place
might be short-handed,

465
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,130
she sent two maids to help out.

466
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,440
This is Wantang.

467
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,830
This is Wanxing.

468
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,770
Greetings, Miss Qin.

469
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,770
You may rise.

470
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,920
Are they to your satisfaction, Miss Qin?

471
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,220
Anyone chosen by the Madam
is surely excellent.

472
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,490
As long as you're pleased, Miss Qin.

473
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,070
Madam Qin is waiting for my response,

474
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,410
so I'll take my leave now.

475
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,300
I'll go pay my respects to Madam Qin.

476
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,230
There's no need.

477
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,520
She knows you're busy,

478
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,940
and asked that you take some time to rest.

479
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,880
Thank you.

480
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,930
Fuling,

481
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,720
let me do it.

482
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,450
Arrange for them to stay here.

483
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,070
Yes.

484
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,970
Follow me.

485
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,180
-Yes.
-Yes.

486
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,370
My Lady,

487
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,460
the two girls have settled in.

488
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,300
Madam Qin sent someone over so suddenly—

489
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,850
she must be trying
to find out your whereabouts.

490
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,450
Someone searched this room,

491
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,500
but none of the papers or books
were touched.

492
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,870
That means they're not suspicious
of my identity yet.

493
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,330
I ran into Liu Chun this morning
in the Purple Bamboo Grove.

494
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,530
Now they've planted two new girls here.

495
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,670
I don't know who they're working for,

496
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,940
but they're definitely connected to
Lianye's death.

497
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,830
Guard the house

498
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,830
and keep an eye
on who they are in contact with.

499
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,490
Got it. Rest assured, My Lady.

500
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,330
Get out!

501
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,000
Leave!

502
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,140
Go back and tell Marquis Song:

503
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,760
His Majesty has already shown mercy—

504
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,720
he's merely demoting him from Duke

505
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,410
to Marquis.

506
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,360
But if he keeps pestering me,

507
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,170
one word from me is enough

508
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,370
to turn the Marquis Mansion
into the Song Mansion.

509
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,030
Get lost!

510
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,240
Chi,

511
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,000
the power struggle
between Prince Cheng and the Crown Prince

512
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,860
is already coming to the surface.

513
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,180
The Shuoxi Army holds
half of the nation's military strength—

514
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,700
everyone's eyeing it
like a juicy piece of meat.

515
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,760
You may have His Majesty's favor now,

516
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,290
but your words just now

517
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,780
were a bit too bold.

518
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,810
I'm afraid someone might use that
against you.

519
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,870
Before I came here,

520
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,480
His Majesty gave orders: The Shuoxi Army
may be summoned but not relocated.

521
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,370
That level of trust is unheard of.

522
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,770
But make no mistake—
it's like setting my father on fire.

523
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,680
Still, my father wouldn't listen.

524
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,630
He wanted to earn military merit
to repay the Emperor's grace.

525
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,290
In such a volatile situation,

526
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,190
with me as the heir
gaining so much attention,

527
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,660
I fear His Majesty won't tolerate

528
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,660
the presence of my father and me.

529
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,450
It hasn't been easy for you.

530
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,450
But alas, Prince Rui lacks your foresight.

531
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,660
My father is brave and loyal.

532
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,470
He mistook my intentions

533
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,900
for scheming.

534
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,990
Prince Rui is not an inflexible man.

535
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,990
I believe that one day,

536
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,200
he will understand your efforts.

537
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:12,980
I hope so.

538
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,250
I only pray he sees it
before it's too late.

539
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,780
My Lady,

540
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,790
those two have fallen asleep.

541
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,550
Guard the back window.

542
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,960
If you see Li, let him in.

543
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,150
Second Young Master, please come in.

544
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,670
Wan.

545
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,180
I...

546
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,400
Look.

547
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,420
It's only been a day.

548
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,880
Why has it gotten so much worse?

549
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,980
Wan, am I hopeless?

550
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,060
No.

551
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,130
But you need to be honest with me.

552
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,680
Is your illness truly unrelated to
anyone in the mansion?

553
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,850
I swear to God.

554
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,430
My wife resents the idea
of me taking concubines—

555
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,200
I don't even have a consummation maid.

556
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,410
How could I possibly dare approach
any of the women in this household?

557
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,940
Wan, you have to believe me.

558
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,680
Trust me!

559
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,580
It's not that I don't believe you.

560
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,720
But this prescription
isn’t interchangeable between genders.

561
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,930
If the disease was passed on
to someone else,

562
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,660
I'm afraid your secret
won't stay hidden for long.

563
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,610
Are you telling the truth?

564
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,510
I am.

565
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,620
Wan, just treat me alone.

566
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,560
That's great.

567
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,400
I've placed the prescription
in the package.

568
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
These ointments are for the ulcers.

569
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,800
Make sure to apply them exactly
as I instructed.

570
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,370
Come back to me once you've finished them.

571
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,240
Thank you, Wan.

572
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,240
I'm leaving.

573
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,440
Li,

574
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,000
do you know

575
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,480
why the Purple Bamboo Grove
became a forbidden place?

576
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,720
I really don't want to lie to you,

577
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,200
but as an illegitimate son,

578
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,520
there are some things
I dare not speak carelessly.

579
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,700
Wan, stop asking.

580
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,330
Just stay away from Purple Bamboo Grove.

581
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,340
Thank you for telling me the truth, Li.

582
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,130
I'm leaving.

583
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,680
Looks like
we must go to Purple Bamboo Grove.

584
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,909
Concubine Liu?

585
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,520
Could it be that

586
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,170
Lianye saw
Concubine Liu meeting someone here

587
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,170
so she was killed?

588
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,139
Miss Qin, have you forgotten?

589
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,000
This place is forbidden.

590
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,650
Anyone who trespasses will be punished.

591
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,120
I...

592
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,409
I just...

593
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,190
My Lady!

594
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,590
My Lady.

595
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,600
Miss Qin,

596
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,420
Physician Qian has arrived.

597
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,090
We can go get the medicine.

598
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,610
Got it.

599
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,120
Steward Liu, what else can I do for you?

600
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,370
It's been raining a lot lately.

601
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,070
We are cleaning up the mud.

602
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,000
This place is very filthy.

603
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,060
It's better for you
to not simply walk around, Miss Qin.

604
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,310
Wanxing,

605
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,100
how did you know
I was in Purple Bamboo Grove?

606
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,890
Fuling asked me to follow you,

607
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,560
so I followed you.

608
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,290
Why didn't I see you on the way?

609
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
I have no idea.

610
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,200
Don't follow me in the future

611
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,610
without my instruction.

612
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:07,860
Understood.

613
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,850
Go away!

614
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,120
If you come any closer,

615
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,810
I'll die in front of you.

616
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,250
Qin Shuang?

617
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,640
Calm down, My Lady.

618
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,000
My Lady!

619
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,260
Put down the scissors!

620
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,520
Go away! All of you!

621
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,920
If you come any closer,
I'll die in front of you.

622
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,440
Shuang, put down the scissors first.

623
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,740
I have been repenting for so long.

624
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,850
Why are you still locking me up?

625
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,160
I asked the maid to beg you every day.

626
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,930
Why wouldn't you see me?

627
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,080
Shuang.

628
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,450
Shuang, put down the scissors first.

629
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,450
Put them down.

630
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,930
Let's talk in the yard.

631
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,490
I punish you

632
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,800
for your own good.

633
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,180
Think about it.

634
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,070
You offended the Grand Princess.

635
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,440
If I don't punish you by locking you up

636
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,330
to vent the Grand Princess's anger,

637
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,650
what should we do?

638
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,310
If it's for my own good,

639
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,060
why didn't you and Xiang come to see me?

640
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,660
Shuang,

641
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,440
I'm a young lady of the Qin family,

642
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,360
not a criminal.

643
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,950
Why are you doing this to me?

644
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,460
You don't look like
the young lady of the Qin family.

645
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,750
If this continues,

646
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,790
our whole family will be humiliated.

647
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,820
I don't have a good life anyway.

648
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,890
Instead,

649
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,960
I'd rather...

650
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,760
I'd rather...

651
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,330
Shuang!

652
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,330
Mother!

653
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,500
Help!

654
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,560
Untie the rope.

655
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,210
Yes.

656
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,570
Throw it down!

657
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,280
-Help!
-Mother.

658
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,650
Put it down.

659
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,160
Madam, please forgive me.

660
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,730
The well
was supposed to be completed today,

661
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,730
so the water has been drained.

662
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,930
We were taking care of the mud.

663
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,000
But Miss Qin Shuang

664
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,890
suddenly...

665
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,440
What's the use of saying this now?

666
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,250
Hurry up and save her!

667
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,250
Go!

668
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,080
Help! It's so dark here!

669
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,690
Help!

670
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,440
I'm going to sink in the mud.

671
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,220
What a sin!

672
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,320
Shuang, we put the rope down.

673
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,480
You tie it around your waist.

674
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,680
We'll pull you up now.

675
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,350
I'm done.

676
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,250
Pull!

677
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,700
Wait!

678
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,560
I'm stuck!

679
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,040
A dead man!

680
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,620
I'm caught! Pull me up!

681
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,520
There's no dead person.

682
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,480
How could there
be bones of dead people in the well?

683
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,770
-Pull it up!
-Hurry up!

684
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,000
Hurry up.

685
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,400
Harder.

686
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,470
Be careful.

687
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,380
Hurry up!

688
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,180
Help her out!

689
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,850
Be careful.

690
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,210
Come on.

691
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,870
Quickly, help her over there.

692
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,730
Help her sit down.

693
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,440
A dead person... I saw a dead person.

694
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,210
Wan, there's a dead person in the well.

695
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,810
There are
bones of dead people in the well.

696
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,330
Look at her.

697
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,800
She's so scared
that she's talking nonsense.

698
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,210
There are
no bones of dead people in the well.

699
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,040
Mother.

700
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,070
There really are
bones of dead people down there.

701
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,400
I saw it with my own eyes.

702
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,290
He grabbed my skirt.

703
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,730
All white bones.

704
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,850
That's enough.

705
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,800
Concubine Liu is here.

706
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,700
Aunt,

707
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,150
better let the servants
go down and have a look.

708
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,410
So many people are watching.

709
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,340
We can't hide it.

710
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,790
It's even worse for them
to talk nonsense outside.

711
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,940
Yes, you're so thoughtful.

712
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,780
Liu Chun.

713
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,210
Yes.

714
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,530
Find someone to go down and have a look.

715
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,690
Yes. Come.

716
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,510
Alright.

717
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,560
Are you hurt?

718
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,800
-Don't be afraid.
-I'm fine.

719
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,320
It's alright.

720
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,040
Madam, we've searched everywhere.

721
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,410
There's nothing else

722
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,340
other than the withered branches.

723
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,080
Got it.

724
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,260
Get someone to clean the well,

725
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,390
so that you won't harm others again.

726
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,480
Look at you.

727
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,760
You're really something.

728
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,360
You're taking a withered branch
as a dead bone.

729
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,210
Don't mess around anymore.

730
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,120
Got it?

731
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,610
But I saw it with my own eyes.

732
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,640
Enough.

733
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,120
Mother,

734
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,520
will you still lock me up?

735
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,430
Go back and rest for a few days.

736
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,310
Wan,

737
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,240
you must be tired today.

738
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,530
Go back and rest.

739
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,400
Let's go.

740
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Mother, let's go.

741
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,000
Wan, why are you still holding that?

742
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,850
Just throw it away.

743
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,120
I don't want to see it.

744
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,880
Wan.

745
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,670
I treated you badly before.

746
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,220
Why did you help me?

747
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,110
We are sisters.

748
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,970
Besides, you didn't hurt me.

749
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,560
After this incident,

750
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,490
don't do anything stupid anymore.

751
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,890
My Lady,

752
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,810
are there really human bones

753
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,470
in the well in the flower shed?

754
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,380
Human bones are white,

755
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,980
yet the withered branches look black.

756
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,640
Even if Qin Shuang was afraid,

757
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,250
she would still be able to
differentiate that.

758
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,270
The Qin family is so scary.

759
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,370
You must not

760
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,030
wander around alone anymore.

761
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,850
Am I alone?

762
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,190
Didn't you ask Wanxing to follow me?

763
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,820
I was worried about her in the room,

764
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,080
so I let her follow you.

765
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,280
Wanxing may be timid,

766
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,050
but she is quick-witted.

767
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,370
She doesn't follow rules like Wantang.

768
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,570
If you don't like her,

769
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,320
I'll ask Wantang to follow you.

770
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,420
No need.

771
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,450
I want to see what she really wants to do.

772
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,420
My Lady, can we go back
to the capital early?

773
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,890
The more I live here,
the more scared I am.

774
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,690
What are you afraid of?

775
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,250
Evil prevails over justice.

776
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,170
Besides,

777
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,800
when we go to the capital

778
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,100
depends on Lord Yan.

779
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,080
Be patient.
