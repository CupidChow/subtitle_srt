The Long Ballad

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
Your Majesty,

4
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
I don't want anything else if I win.

5
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,000
I just want

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,240
Young Marshal Yan to be my consort.

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,600
Your Highness, please be careful.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
I've never met you.

9
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,880
How can I be your consort?

10
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,600
Yan Chi,

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,480
don't you remember me?

12
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,120
When you were searching for the border,

13
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,080
did you save a Beidai soldier

14
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
who was taken away by Rong Di?

15
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,880
I saved countless people.

16
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,120
I can't remember.

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,200
You led the troops personally

18
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,000
and sent me back to the border.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,560
How can you not remember?

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,640
Take a good look.

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,520
I was the one who led the troops to search the border.

22
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
I thought it was the soldiers of the young years

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
who escorted me.

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,960
If I had known it was the princess,

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,560
I wouldn't have acted so hastily.

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,480
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,840
whether Young Marshal Yan is willing to marry me or not,

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,280
I'll get married today.

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,080
No.

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,240
Why?

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm not worthy of you.

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,720
First,

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
I'll marry Yan Chi.

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
I'll marry the one I love.

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,000
But you're not her.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,640
Second,

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm here.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,440
I think you can't win.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,560
I love you so much.

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,480
How can you humiliate me like this?

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,560
Sister.

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,440
Enough.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,760
Let's go.

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,120
Father,

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
it's time for the South Campus to bloom.

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,400
In three days,

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,440
I'll go to the West Han Dynasty with the princes and princesses

48
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,680
to have fun

49
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,360
and practice archery.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
Since I can quit the old camp,

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,680
I can promote the friendship between the three states.

52
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,160
May I?

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,960
Father,

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
you're so strong and precious.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,560
It's rare for you to appear.

56
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,880
I'm happy to see you.

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,520
That's good.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
The Crown Prince must ensure

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,880
your safety.

60
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,600
Don't do anything rash.

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,520
I'll obey your order.

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
Waner,

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,080
what if His Majesty

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,120
really wants Brother Qi to marry her?

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
I'll just let him do it.

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,600
It's none of my business what others do.

67
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,160
Brother Qi, what are you doing?

68
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
I'm going to chase Waner.

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,800
You can't go.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,880
Mrs. Zhong You Hong and Qin Zhao Yu are in the car.

71
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,280
What's the use of chasing her?

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,120
She's angry.

73
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,720
When she sees Yuan Wu making such a fuss,

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,520
she'll be upset.

75
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,200
But I've refused her on the spot.

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,920
What's the use of refusing her?

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,120
Waner said

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,280
if His Majesty

79
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,080
fulfills Yuan Wu's wish for the two states,

80
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,600
will you still disobey him?

81
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,520
If that's the case,

82
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,280
what's the use of disobeying him?

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,720
Waner said it again.

84
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,120
What did she say?

85
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,360
She said

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,920
you're the Crown Prince of the King of Rui.

87
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,320
You should be the state's priority.

88
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,960
She can't ruin your reputation

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,000
because of personal feelings.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,840
So...

91
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
So what?

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
I'll tell you if you agree to take me

93
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,560
to the back of the house.

94
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,840
No way.

95
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,360
You...

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,200
Brother Qi,

97
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,160
promise me first.

98
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,960
I have a way to get you there.

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Who are you?

100
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,960
I don't know you.

101
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,160
You pretended not to know me just now.

102
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
Now you're trying to coax me.

103
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,520
I'm not jealous of you.

104
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
I'll give you a chance.

105
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,840
I'm sure you've seen

106
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,800
what happened at the banquet today.

107
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,640
The envoys of the Western Han and the Northern Dynasties

108
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,880
are all looking for the Fifth Princess.

109
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,280
No matter who gets what they want,

110
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,440
they will be with us forever.

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,800
But His Majesty and Her Majesty

112
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,640
only have one daughter.

113
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,240
Even if they want to marry the Fifth Princess,

114
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,680
between the Third Prince of the Western Han

115
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
and the Crown Prince of the Northern Dynasties,

116
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,160
there can only be one son-in-law.

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,120
The other one

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,600
must marry the royal family

119
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,480
or the royal family.

120
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,360
What do you mean?

121
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,560
The Northern Dynasties and the Western Han

122
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,160
are far away from home,

123
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
but they are all the royal family.

124
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,880
No matter which country you're from,

125
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,080
all the countries

126
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,000
must be grateful for your kindness.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
What do you think?

128
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,720
Is that what you think, too?

129
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,560
It's your life.

130
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,440
Of course, it depends on you.

131
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
If you have any questions,

132
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,480
I'll ask your uncle when I get back.

133
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,320
I don't want to do that.

134
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,480
Thank you for your kindness, Sister Ba.

135
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,800
But marriage and marriage are far away from home.

136
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,600
It's always a matter of appearance.

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,080
It's a matter of hard work.

138
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,640
Besides, the wealth of the imperial family

139
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,320
is not what the King of Qin wants.

140
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,560
I won't bother you and Sister Ba.

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,440
You are indeed a good person.

142
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,920
You have different thoughts and desires.

143
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
You're exaggerating.

144
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm just a commoner.

145
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,160
I just care about the truth.

146
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Your Highness, don't blame me for being talkative.

147
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
I think you should have

148
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,160
settled the matter with the Crown Prince earlier.

149
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Don't just keep it in the dark.

150
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,840
What kind of princess is she this time?

151
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,160
What if there's another princess from the Western Han Dynasty?

152
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,360
What should we do?

153
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,160
But I settled it so early.

154
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
I'll investigate the case later.

155
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
I'll be the one to take the responsibility.

156
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
I'll be the one to take the responsibility.

157
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
I'll be the one to take the responsibility.

158
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
I'll be the one to take the responsibility.

159
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
I'll be the one to take the responsibility.

160
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
It seems that if I investigate the case later,

161
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I'll be easily criticized.

162
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Someone will say that

163
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
I can only enter the Ministry of Justice

164
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
with his help.

165
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
How can I make my father happy

166
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
if I do this for him?

167
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Moreover, he's just entered the capital.

168
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Many things are still unknown.

169
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,160
I can't let him be distracted by love.

170
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,160
But it's not a big deal to keep it in the dark.

171
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,160
It's just a promise.

172
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Those who have a heart of gold

173
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,160
will be the allies of the alliance.

174
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Those who have no heart of gold

175
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
can also go back on their promise

176
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
to the mountain and sea.

177
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
I only believe that

178
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
the water will flow to the city.

179
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
I won't force you.

180
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I don't have the ability to do this.

181
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
What?

182
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
You want to settle it with Bai Feng?

183
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Wait.

184
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Why are you talking about me?

185
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Are you two together?

186
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
If you think it's him,

187
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
you can do it earlier.

188
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
I won't.

189
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,160
As long as you don't marry the Crown Prince,

190
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
I'll stay with you for a day.

191
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I won't let you be alone.

192
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Don't worry.

193
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
I will marry you

194
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
in a grand way.

195
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Heng Xin is here.

196
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
What is this pepper?

197
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
What is this pepper called?

198
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
I found it by accident.

199
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
I came here alone.

200
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
You are the first person to travel with me.

201
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
When you sent Yuan Wu back to the Northern Dai,

202
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
you didn't travel together.

203
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,160
I really hope Yuan Wu would come earlier.

204
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
What do you mean?

205
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
If he had come earlier,

206
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
I would have seen you

207
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
being jealous of me.

208
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Nonsense.

209
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm not jealous.

210
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,160
You are so beautiful.

211
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,160
You really don't recognize her as a woman?

212
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Only when you are not awake

213
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,160
and you touch the human heart,

214
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
she will be beautiful.

215
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,160
I have been through the storm alone for many years.

216
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I have never met this love.

217
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Until you came to my world

218
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,160
I wrote down my wish.

219
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Why is there a small island here?

220
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,160
This is the place I want to take you.

221
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,160
When I get closer to you,

222
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I find I love you a little.

223
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
This is so beautiful.

224
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
I prepared all these for you.

225
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Waner.

226
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
I said

227
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,160
I will only marry the one I love.

228
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
The one I love

229
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
can only be you.

230
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,160
I have been through the storm alone for many years.

231
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I have never met this love.

232
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Until you came to my world

233
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,160
I wrote down my wish.

234
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,160
The day you gave me

235
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,160
makes the future beautiful.

236
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,160
When I get closer to you,

237
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,160
I find I love you a little.

238
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Princess, it's almost the end.

239
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Why don't we come back tomorrow?

240
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
No, we can't make it tomorrow.

241
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Princess, it's probably Young Marshal.

242
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
You bitch.

243
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
I will kill you myself.

244
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,160
I have been practicing martial arts since I was young.

245
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I have never been lazy.

246
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,160
But when father was young,

247
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
he was more hardworking than me.

248
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
He is the God of War that I can't forget.

249
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,160
The late emperor wanted to make father the Crown Prince.

250
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
But father was not loyal to the throne.

251
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
He was afraid that the first clan would fight against each other.

252
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
It made the Empress Dowager sad.

253
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
So he decided to avoid Shuoxi.

254
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Now the emperor is the only one who can take the throne.

255
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Does the emperor know about this?

256
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
It doesn't matter if he knows.

257
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Since mother died,

258
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
father is more reluctant to go back to the capital.

259
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160
The King of Rui's Mansion has been occupied by no one for many years.

260
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
It's getting worse.

261
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Then you are keeping a low profile.

262
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
In father's eyes,

263
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
I am just a son who is worried about his own safety.

264
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
But he doesn't know

265
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
that the court where the wind and clouds change

266
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
is the place where the bloodless murderers are.

267
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,160
The only place where I can live is Shuoxi's Mansion and King of Rui's Mansion.

268
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
I will be killed by someone.

269
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
I have to stay here and die.

270
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
So I can make a way for Shuoxi.

271
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Then why don't you explain your intention to King of Rui?

272
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
If father would listen to me,

273
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,160
how could the murder of my father and son happen again and again?

274
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
How could I be so simple?

275
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
I tell you this

276
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
just to let you know

277
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
that my life

278
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
is as broken as King of Rui's Mansion.

279
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
You still have me.

280
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
In my heart,

281
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
you are the best man in the world.

282
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
You are the best man in the world.

283
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Because of you,

284
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
my return is more meaningful.

285
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Yu'er.

286
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Leave.

287
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Yu'er.

288
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
The Crown Prince is here.

289
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
He wants to see the Ninth Madam.

290
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Is the Empress Dowager's illness getting worse?

291
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
It seems not.

292
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
I don't know what your father's plan is.

293
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
What if

294
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
he made the Ninth Madam worry about him?

295
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Yu'er, what should we do?

296
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Yan'er, I finally found you.

297
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Mother, why are you in such a hurry?

298
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Today, a group of ladies came to my house.

299
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
They haven't left yet.

300
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Your father insisted that I go to the warehouse

301
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
and find some flowers for him.

302
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
I don't have time for that.

303
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Hurry up. Go and find them for mother.

304
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
But father asked me to accompany the Ninth Sister.

305
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Go to the study, right?

306
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Your father told me

307
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
and asked me to prepare some good wine for him.

308
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Otherwise, how can I find you in such a hurry?

309
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
How about this?

310
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
You go and find some flowers for me.

311
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Let Mo Yi accompany Wan'er

312
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
and bring the wine with him.

313
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Well...

314
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Brother, just go.

315
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
I still have to entertain the guests.

316
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
I will bring the wine to the study.

317
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Wan'er is so sensible.

318
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I'll go now.

319
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Hurry up.

320
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Hurry up.

321
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
This way, please.

322
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Hurry up.

323
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Ninth Madam,

324
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
I have a stomachache.

325
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Let me check.

326
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
No, don't bother.

327
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
I...

328
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I'll go to the study.

329
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm fine.

330
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Give me the wine.

331
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
I'll send it to the study.

332
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Thank you, Madam.

333
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
The study is right ahead.

334
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Who is in the study?

335
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
How could the Marquis

336
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
think of such a stupid trick?

337
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
I'm here.

338
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Greetings, Your Highness.

339
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Why are you here?

340
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I'm just here to deliver wine.

341
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I didn't mean to disturb you.

342
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
I'll leave now.

343
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Take your wine away.

344
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,040
I never drink

345
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,160
some ill-known wine.

346
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,440
With your help

347
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,620
as the Venerable, Home memorizing God's Name,

348
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,000
won't you be satisfied?

349
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,220
I'll write to The Ninth Madam,

350
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,340
don't trade in things

351
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,760
which are not yours.

352
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,760
Who comes around is underستimatedness.

353
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,360
Well said, Your Highness.

354
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,220
What you did

355
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,100
will go under.

356
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,120
What do you want to do

357
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,880
to become weak as snake on the wr processed.

358
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,960
If I come here,

359
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,560
I will definitely expel the servants from the Academy.

360
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,960
I will never allow any of them to enter.

361
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,760
If you didn't mean to seduce me,

362
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,960
why did you come here?

363
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,760
If you had done such a thing in the Eastern Palace,

364
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,160
you would have been sent to the city's prison.

365
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Your Highness, you think

366
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,960
I came here to seduce you?

367
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Why do you think

368
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,560
all women in the world

369
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,360
will be so fond of you?

370
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,760
How dare you?

371
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,160
Thank you for your compliment.

372
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,560
Shameless.

373
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,160
It's a shameless mistake.

374
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,760
Your Highness, what's wrong?

375
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Shaobao Qin, why is the martial arts expert you mentioned

376
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,160
still not here?

377
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,160
If he doesn't come, I will leave first.

378
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,560
Your Highness, didn't you see him before?

379
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Martial arts expert?

380
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,960
Isn't it for young men?

381
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,360
That's to hide your identity,

382
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,160
so Wan'er was put in a man's clothes.

383
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,360
Even the government knows about this.

384
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,160
So the Ninth Madam came here...

385
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,360
Your Highness, you are here.

386
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,160
Of course she will come to greet you.

387
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,560
Then that wine...

388
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
I have a guest to entertain.

389
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,160
Let me bring the wine here first.

390
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,360
I will eat it later.

391
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,160
Ninth Madam, the ingredients...

392
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,560
Just open the jar.

393
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,760
You don't have to take it to heart.

394
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,160
I will go to the palace to feed the Empress Dowager.

395
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
I will take my leave now.

396
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
You brought me here just to see these?

397
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Sister Jiu has received so many rewards.

398
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,360
We should congratulate her.

399
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,960
Sister Wu, look.

400
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,760
The Empress gave Sister Jiu this winter pearl.

401
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,360
Each one is as big as a pigeon's egg.

402
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,560
What is this?

403
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,160
Wan'er saved the Empress Dowager.

404
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,560
She deserves any reward.

405
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
It's really hard to predict.

406
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,760
Looking at Sister Jiu's current look,

407
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,360
who would believe that she once knelt at the old house

408
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,960
in her old clothes?

409
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,760
Sister Wu, why are you saying these?

410
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,160
What is there to say?

411
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,560
I haven't mentioned about Sister Jiu being divorced.

412
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,160
Fifth Madam, don't go too far.

413
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
You slave, how dare you yell at me?

414
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,760
Sister Wu.

415
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,960
Get out.

416
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,560
She is clearly disrespectful to me.

417
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,960
Why are you scolding me instead?

418
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Because I'm not welcoming you.

419
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,760
Sister Jiu just became a noble lady.

420
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,760
It's up to us sisters to decide.

421
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,560
It's not you two. It's only you.

422
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,760
That's right.

423
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,560
Based on what you said just now,

424
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,360
I want to make you feel comfortable.

425
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,160
I want to make you dream.

426
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,160
Sister Wu.

427
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Princess, Sister Jiu.

428
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Sister Wu was broken by her mother.

429
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,560
Don't be angry.

430
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,960
Sister Wu is not willing to leave her side.

431
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
It's also a matter of human nature.

432
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,760
But she is biased towards the right.

433
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm afraid she will eat big bones in the future.

434
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,560
I hope she won't do anything wrong again.

435
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Fuling, take the jewelry that was sent from the palace

436
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,560
and let Sixth Sister take it.

437
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,960
Okay. No, no.

438
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,760
These are too valuable. I can't take them.

439
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,360
Just take them.

440
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,160
Anyway, our little Wan'er never brings these things.

441
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Sister Jiu, I was stupid before.

442
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,560
I made you suffer a lot.

443
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,160
I... I don't dare to ask for your forgiveness.

444
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,760
If you still recognize me as your sister,

445
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
I will take you in the future.

446
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Sixth Sister never really harmed me.

447
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,360
What can I forgive?

448
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,960
Okay, okay.

449
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,360
Keep your sisterhood for later.

450
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,960
Little Wan'er still has to be a needle in the Empress Dowager's hair.

451
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,160
We have to hurry and enter the palace.

452
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,960
That's right. Sister Jiu, go and do your work.

453
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
I will persuade Sister Wu to leave.

454
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,160
Little Shuangshuang, I think you are getting more and more graceful.

455
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,360
Your tone is getting more and more like Yanli.

456
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
If I'm like her, she's like me.

457
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Okay, okay. Hurry and enter the palace.

458
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
Hurry and change your clothes.

459
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,560
My Lord.

460
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Let me ask you.

461
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,760
Why did you turn the person who sent the wine to the Crown Prince into Qin Wan?

462
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
This is a secret.

463
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,960
Qin Wan?

464
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,160
I was in a rush to go to the storage room.

465
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,560
It just so happens that the Ninth Lady...

466
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,760
You still dare to lie to me?

467
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Father, please calm down.

468
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,560
This is my idea.

469
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,160
Mother is just a loving daughter,

470
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,560
so she will help me with my work.

471
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,760
Please don't blame me, Father.

472
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,560
Why did you do this?

473
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,760
Consort Xuan is in danger.

474
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I'm worried that she might be in danger.

475
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,960
So I wanted to test Sister Jiu's intentions

476
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,560
so that I could prepare for it.

477
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,960
Stupid!

478
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Brother.

479
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,760
Do you know that what happened today

480
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,360
almost ruined Father's plan?

481
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,160
I don't understand what you're saying.

482
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Even if Sister Jiu helped the Empress Dowager,

483
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,360
she's still a maid who's been sheltered by the Marquis.

484
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,960
How could she affect the overall situation?

485
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,160
I don't know.

486
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,360
The Crown Prince...

487
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,560
Yan'er.

488
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,560
I've already told you

489
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,160
that today's Consort Chu is the future Empress.

490
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,760
It's the state affair that the Crown Prince chose.

491
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,160
You're related to the Qin clan.

492
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
You're related to the general and the royal family.

493
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,160
You can't treat her like a child.

494
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,560
If the Empress and the Crown Prince

495
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
knew what you did today,

496
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,360
they wouldn't choose you as the Crown Princess.

497
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,760
My Lord, please don't.

498
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,160
If you still want your daughter

499
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,360
to have a motherly life,

500
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,960
don't let her be a coward

501
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,560
and do such a foolish thing.

502
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,160
I will obey your order.

503
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,360
Yan'er.

504
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
What I want

505
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,360
is to be her wife.

506
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,360
Yan'er.

507
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,760
Yan'er.

508
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Although I've alreadyểnd a court official,

509
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,560
but I didn't give up my love

510
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,560
and didn't care for my wife's love.

511
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,040
I take the

512
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,160
catartden of love!

513
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,860
Look at this.

514
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,060
Wow.

515
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,700
Although ,

516
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,580
lower body is messed up,

517
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,640
but the vital parts can't be used.

518
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,580
It's still sadniest part onions get burnt.

519

Your Highness

528
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,340
It's not convenient to meet in the ceremony hall.

529
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,340
These two sets of beads have been offered to you

530
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,340
by Madam for many days.

531
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,340
I'm giving them to you two.

532
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,340
May you and your brothers live a long and happy life.

533
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,340
Thank you, Madam.

534
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,340
May you live a long and happy life.

535
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,340
Brother Qi, what does my mother mean?

536
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,340
You and I are like brothers.

537
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
Why do you still help us?

538
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,340
We know each other.

539
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,340
I'm afraid that you're causing trouble everywhere.

540
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,340
You're afraid that I'll be an identity to you

541
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,340
and won't help you anymore.

542
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,340
My mother is just being nosy.

543
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,340
We will never be an identity in this life, right?

544
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,340
Of course.

545
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,340
I'm not afraid of you.

546
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,340
I'm afraid that you'll be an identity to me.

547
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
Of course.

548
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,340
It's quite pretty.

549
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,340
In this age,

550
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,340
why does Madam have an impetuous intention in her painting?

551
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

552
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,340
May the Empress Dowager live a long and happy life.

553
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,340
May the Empress live a long and happy life.

554
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,340
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

555
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Have you had breakfast?

556
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
You woke up early and called me.

557
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
You had half a bowl of rice porridge.

558
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,340
The First Princess is really not over-anxious.

559
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,340
Your medical skills are really amazing.

560
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,340
That's because Your Majesty is a talented person.

561
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,340
The Empress Dowager and the First Princess are blessed with a son.

562
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,340
Only by asking for the ninth daughter can you show your magic.

563
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,340
Your Majesty, the ninth mother is giving birth to her mother.

564
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
We should be quiet

565
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,340
to avoid disturbing the mother's mind.

566
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,340
Okay, okay, okay.

567
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
It's still the Empress's consideration.

568
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,340
Let me take a good look at you.

569
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,340
You saved my life.

570
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
Thanks to Your Majesty's wise decision,

571
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,340
I can rest assured and do my best to save you.

572
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Your Majesty's filial piety and your medical skills

573
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
are indispensable.

574
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,340
Although the Empress Dowager's stroke is acute,

575
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,340
it's good that it was cured in time.

576
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,340
It can be recovered in a few days.

577
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,340
But this disease is very frequent.

578
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Remember not to be agitated again.

579
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
Your Majesty, you must be calm and calm.

580
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,340
Don't worry too much.

581
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Everything can be done for you.

582
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,340
But this is a very important matter.

583
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,340
Mother, if you have any trouble,

584
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
you can ask me to do it.

585
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,340
I have to listen to this little fairy.

586
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,340
Look, now someone is here to take care of me for you.

587
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,340
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager's illness has stabilized.

588
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,340
As long as you take the medicine,

589
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,340
you will be cured in five or six days.

590
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
The things I gave you yesterday

591
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,340
may not be all your favorite.

592
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,340
Tell me, what do you want today?

593
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,340
What I value is not the wealth.

594
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,340
I just want to ask Your Majesty for a favor.

595
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,340
A favor?

596
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,340
Tell me.

597
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,340
I beg Your Majesty to allow Princess Yongning

598
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
to attend the trip tomorrow.

599
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
What a coincidence.

600
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,340
Why is there someone who mentioned this to me?

601
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,340
The people outside the door, come in.

602
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,340
Your Majesty, may the Empress Dowager be blessed.

603
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,340
May the Empress Dowager be blessed.

604
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,340
What are you little monkeys doing behind the curtain?

605
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Get up, all of you.

606
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

607
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,340
Your Majesty, you have a good eye.

608
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,340
They are my shield.

609
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,340
Brother Qi, you said you wouldn't betray me.

610
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,340
So you are trying to be a good person for Brother Qi.

611
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
You lied to me again.

612
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,340
I will not let you off.

613
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
Xiao Jiu, come here.

614
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Come to my side.

615
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,340
I ask you, have you been studying and writing these days?

616
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,340
Nanny Chen,

617
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,340
is she still not willing to talk?

618
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Yes.

619
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,340
Your Majesty, go and do your business.

620
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,340
I am tired, and I want to rest.

621
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Let Sui'er stay by my side.

622
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,340
Come, come here.

623
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,340
That's good.

624
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,340
I have been here for half a day.

625
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,340
I should also let Mother rest.

626
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
Come.

627
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
Ning'er,

628
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Jiu Niang and Qilang have asked for your grace.

629
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,340
Tomorrow, you can go to the rink with me.

630
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

631
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,340
Li'er, don't you have this proposal?

632
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,340
Then you will be with me to protect Ning'er.

633
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,340
I will not let you go.

634
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,340
I will not let you go.

635
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Then you will be with me to protect Ning'er.

636
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,340
Okay, I will find trouble.

637
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

638
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,340
Qilang, you don't have to.

639
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,340
In case that Beidai Princess is in trouble again.

640
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,340
Yes.

641
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,340
Mother, you rest well.

642
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,340
I will leave first.

643
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,340
When I have lunch, I will come to greet you again.

644
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,340
When you come to the Zichen Hall later,

645
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
I have something to tell you.

646
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,340
Yes.

647
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Go quickly.

648
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
Come.

649
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,340
Be careful.

650
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Don't worry.

651
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,340
Grandmother is well.

652
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
She is fine.

653
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
Really?

654
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,340
Brother Sui is the son of Concubine Jin.

655
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,340
The day Concubine Jin was killed,

656
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,340
she was also in the Hall of Light.

657
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
Grandmother is tired.

658
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,340
I will take you to the bath.

659
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,340
Go.

660
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,340
Don't hurt yourself.

661
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
Let's go.

662
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
Let's go to the bath.

663
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Go.

664
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,340
Aunt Chen,

665
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,340
Sui Ge was very naughty before.

666
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,340
Why is she so stubborn now?

667
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,340
His Majesty mentioned this seriously.

668
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,340
Since Concubine Jin died,

669
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,340
she stopped talking.

670
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
Great.

671
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,340
Qin Jiu is the granddaughter of the eldest princess.

672
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,340
She risked her life to save me.

673
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
She is not someone else.

674
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,340
His Majesty's heart is not with Sui.

675
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,340
You can teach her more.

676
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,340
I don't want her to be the head of my wife.

677
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,340
I will do my best.

678
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
By the way,

679
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,340
don't tell your father that I am ill.

680
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,340
He has a heavy responsibility and is far away.

681
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,340
Even if he knows, he can't get out of it.

682
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Why should he worry about it?

683
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,340
I understand.

684
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,340
Grandmother is well.

685
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
You don't have to worry about these things.

686
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
Okay.

687
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
Tomorrow,

688
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
Dr. Zhang and Dr. Lin will wake up

689
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:42,520
to prepare for the

690
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,340
I want to see you every day.

691
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,340
Okay.

692
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
This is my duty.

693
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,340
You come every day.

694
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
That's great.

695
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
I just want to be close to you.

696
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:58,340
So that my aunt can come to see me early.

697
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,340
I am glad to see her again.

698
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Don't worry about it.

699
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340
Don't worry about me.

700
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,340
I will be good.

701
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,340
You can go now.

702
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,340
See you.

703
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,340
See you.

704
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:20,340
See you.

705
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,340
Xiaoqi.

706
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,340
What are you looking at?

707
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,340
Go to Zichen Palace quickly.

708
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,340
His Majesty is waiting for you.

709
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,340
Yes.

710
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,900
I'll leave it to you.

711
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,060
Don't worry.

712
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,860
I won't let you down.

713
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,580
I'll go first.

714
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,420
I want you to rest at ease.

715
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,820
Oh.

716
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,320
Solo players from our tape model company

717
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,940
Where does Ni Chang whatsapp go?

718
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,780
Lovers inarks meat

719
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,980
Your hair looksIII good

720
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,180
Meili, on-site

721
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,540
He has been keeping an eye on you

722
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,020
Didn't you say you'll bring me a cup of teapt germs with your name

723
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,820
Lover on the multiple Mythological

724
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,820
and the horse riding.

725
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,820
It's a good show for you.

726
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,820
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

727
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,820
It's cold in the winter in the north.

728
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,820
But the scenery here is very beautiful.

729
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,820
It's rare.

730
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,820
I think

731
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,820
as long as there is a real princess,

732
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,820
it's beautiful everywhere.

733
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,820
If you don't like the scenery,

734
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,820
you can come with me to the forest

735
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
to ride and run.

736
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,820
It's also a different experience.

737
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,820
Your Highness, you finally open your mind.

738
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,820
Today, the princes of the two countries are out for a trip.

739
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,820
But the scenery is so beautiful,

740
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,820
how can it show the man's spirit?

741
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,820
It's better than the horse riding and running.

742
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,820
Your Highness, don't worry.

743
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,820
Your horse riding is not as good as others.

744
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,820
I will let my brother have a try.

745
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,820
Later, let my brother write a poem.

746
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,820
No need.

747
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,820
As the crown prince of a country,

748
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,820
this poem is just a piece of cake.

749
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,820
With this skill,

750
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,820
I would rather read a few more good books.

751
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,820
It's more comfortable.

752
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,820
The crown prince is handsome and high-spirited.

753
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,820
I'm not as good as him.

754
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,820
But who can make me

755
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,820
a good mother

756
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,820
who is not as good as the crown prince?

757
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,820
If you want to be famous,

758
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,820
you can only rely on yourself.

759
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,820
Brother, why don't you

760
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,820
stay away from the enemy?

761
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,820
Think about

762
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,820
how to entertain the two countries' distinguished soldiers.

763
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,820
Your Highness, please come with me

764
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,820
to the plum trees to watch the plum blossoms.

765
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,820
Please.

766
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
Let's go.

767
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,820
I'm not going.

768
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,820
I want to enjoy the spring scenery.

769
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,820
Other than the plum trees,

770
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,820
where else can I enjoy the spring scenery?

771
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
Another year of spring and autumn.

772
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,820
I'm so tired.

773
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,820
Brother, you're the best.

774
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,260
It's the Spring Festival again.

775
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,260
You're a bad girl.

776
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,500
I'm leaving.

777
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:10,980
Thank you.

778
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,460
I'm leaving.

779
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,860
Help, Lady Qin Jiu!

780
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,220
My princess is injured in the South Campus.

781
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,220
I want to ask Lady Qin Jiu to go to the hospital.

782
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,620
There's a royal doctor in the South Campus.

783
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,820
Why don't you go to the hospital?

784
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,260
Our princess thought

785
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,100
Young Master Yan would go with her today.

786
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,300
Who knew she'd never seen him in the South Campus?

787
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,700
She was angry and wanted to go back to the capital.

788
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,180
She was scared when she saw her arriving in the capital.

789
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,380
She threw her out.

790
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,780
She's still unconscious.

791
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,660
Since she's injured in the capital,

792
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,420
why didn't she go back to the palace?

793
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,620
We don't know where she's injured.

794
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,220
We dare not move her.

795
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,020
She's a noble lady.

796
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,420
She can't be treated by men.

797
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,940
So we have to ask the little fairy to go to the hospital.

798
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,060
Do you think I can do it?

799
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,380
Our princess is reckless.

800
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,900
We've tried many times.

801
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
We've never seen any effect.

802
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,100
If the little fairy doesn't want to go,

803
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,260
it's understandable.

804
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,500
But...

805
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,940
This concerns the diplomatic relations between the two countries.

806
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,820
If anything happens to our princess,

807
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,300
the Crown Prince of the State and Young Master Yan

808
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,780
will be punished.

809
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,100
Where's Princess Yang Wu?

810
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,540
I'm here.

811
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,620
Good.

812
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,200
How's Shanshan?

813
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,960
I'm她.

814
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,920
You can let me stay here with you.

815
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,040
Let me go with you.

816
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,320
I won't leave till we proceed with the work.

817
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,280
I will.

818
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,480
You're busy at the moment.

819
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,160
Kusar function isooni,

820
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,640
I'll take care of his parents.

821
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:35,100
If love falls into the haze

822
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:42,100
The wind and snow fall, and my whole life is white

823
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:49,100
If love can be engraved in my heart

824
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:55,100
The pain will also be returned, the pain will also be returned

825
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:01,100
Open your heart, love does not fear the deep sea

826
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Please grant me courage, let fate be grand

827
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:15,100
Don't be afraid of the starlight being touched by the night sky

828
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:23,100
The stars will shine beyond the sky

829
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:36,100
The sky is dim like dust, but it is the color of the starry sky

830
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:54,100
The sky is dim like dust, but it is the color of the starry sky
