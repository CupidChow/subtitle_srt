1
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:39,840
're back to his

2
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,800
With newspapers

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,080
mosquitoes

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,400
Which one of the children

5
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,040
is detained

6
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,120
If you die in the palace

7
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,760
Will be said to be a bad omen

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,680
That year, Empress Dowager was just a Noble Consort.

9
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,520
She was always taken by the late Empress and was not taken care of.

10
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,840
How could she make a single mistake?

11
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,760
Empress Dowager had to arrange to send this child out of the palace.

12
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Don't cry.

13
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Don't cry.

14
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Mother.

15
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,760
It's all my fault. I couldn't help but keep you by my side.

16
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Noble Consort.

17
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Go and tell Shengsheng to report to the Empress.

18
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Tell her that I gave birth to a prince.

19
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,760
That we are both safe and sound.

20
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,760
We are both safe and sound.

21
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Take her away.

22
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Don't let her know about her life.

23
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,760
How can I meet you in the future?

24
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
In this life,

25
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
I don't want to.

26
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Otherwise, we will both die.

27
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Mother.

28
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,760
No matter what happens,

29
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I will be content with her.

30
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Please give me a name.

31
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
She was just born.

32
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
She is going to be with her family.

33
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
She will be in the palace.

34
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,760
I hope she can forgive me for being a motherless woman.

35
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Call me Yan Han.

36
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,760
I didn't expect that Yan Han, who was diagnosed with a kidney disease,

37
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,760
was able to survive outside the palace.

38
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,760
I will take care of her as her relative.

39
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
I have something important to tell you.

40
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,760
His Majesty is going to appoint Huai Ge as the Crown Prince.

41
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Didn't His Majesty say that he loves to take care of his brother the most?

42
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
He has the late emperor's seal.

43
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Why did he appoint Huai Ge?

44
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Huai Ge is the Crown Prince's son.

45
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
It is also a good thing that he is appointed as the Crown Prince.

46
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
So, Master ordered that

47
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Han Ge must leave the capital as far as possible.

48
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,760
So that no one will find out that he looks like Huai Ge.

49
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
To be honest,

50
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
the rules of the imperial family are also very strict.

51
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
They say that a newborn baby

52
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
will die in the palace.

53
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,760
I don't believe it.

54
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Master is not a man of no importance.

55
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,760
If there is no such opportunity,

56
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,760
how can Han Ge stay outside?

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Forget it.

58
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
I won't say it anymore.

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I will go back to the palace first.

60
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
I will see you out.

61
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Unfortunately, I didn't investigate it for a while.

62
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Yan Han found out about his identity.

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
From then on,

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
he hated the emperor of Yan.

65
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,760
He hid from our Li family.

66
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Yan Han

67
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Yan Han

68
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
At that time,

69
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
they chose to let you live.

70
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Now, it's my turn.

71
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,760
The world is still mine.

72
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
A few years later,

73
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,760
when I found out that he killed him,

74
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,760
and that he had a traitor's daughter, Fu Cheng Yan,

75
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
who was kind to him,

76
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
to save the late emperor Yan,

77
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
and to bury him alive,

78
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
I knew that

79
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
the Empress Dowager was most worried about

80
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
was to let you live.

81
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Everyone knows that the emperor is in the imperial court.

82
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
He was badly injured by the fire.

83
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
He only returned to the capital after he died.

84
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,760
So, Yan Han is the one who came back now.

85
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
It's the child with black birthmark on his waist.

86
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,760
He should be killed by the traitor.

87
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
No wonder he had a different handwriting

88
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
and killed the crown prince and Prince Cheng.

89
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Nanny Tian,

90
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
did you tell the Empress about this?

91
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
The father and the son are husband and wife.

92
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,760
The Empress had doubts about Yan Han.

93
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Yan Han sent someone to kill me

94
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
after he returned to the capital.

95
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
I had nowhere to go.

96
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,760
I had to go back to the capital to ask for a light.

97
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
I knew that the Empress was not well.

98
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,760
So I asked someone to bring the Empress some news.

99
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Did the Empress Dowager know about this?

100
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
Do you know how hard it is for a mother

101
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
to raise her child and grow up,

102
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
and live together for twenty to thirty years,

103
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
and get pregnant?

104
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
How could the Empress Dowager not know?

105
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
But both of them are her own children.

106
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
One is gone.

107
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
How could the Empress Dowager

108
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
bear to bury another one?

109
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Grandmother said

110
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,760
she had only made two choices in her life.

111
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
But the results were all bad.

112
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Could it be that she only left Yan Han's life

113
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
and hid his identity for him?

114
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Nanny Tian,

115
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
if what you said today is false,

116
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
do you know the consequences?

117
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
I have been entrusted by the Empress Dowager.

118
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
I should have died to atone for my sins.

119
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,760
But I'm afraid that one day the truth will be exposed.

120
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
No one can testify for the Empress Dowager.

121
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
That's the only way to live.

122
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
If I dare to make false claims,

123
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
I will be punished by the Prince

124
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
for my life.

125
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
If what you said today is true,

126
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
isn't Yan Li

127
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,760
the son of the current emperor?

128
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
No wonder His Majesty claimed that

129
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
he could establish a royal family

130
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
and kill the Crown Prince and Prince Cheng.

131
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
This is all for Yan Li.

132
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
I believe Yan Li.

133
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
He knows nothing about this.

134
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Besides, he is not here.

135
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
We'd better not tell him.

136
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
If Yan Li and Sui Ge are innocent

137
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
about this,

138
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,760
and the grandmother is the most pitiful one...

139
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Grandmother is trying to win the whole country.

140
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
She didn't expect

141
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
to see her own flesh and blood

142
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
in the end.

143
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Grandmother was so anxious

144
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,760
because of her long-term illness.

145
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Tomorrow,

146
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
I will go to the Imperial Hospital

147
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
to check the case of grandmother.

148
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
When you visit her,

149
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
be careful with Yan Zi.

150
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Yan Li and Sui Ge

151
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
are the sons of the current emperor.

152
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm afraid that they won't be able to

153
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
ascend the throne

154
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
if we reveal his true identity.

155
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
At that time,

156
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
you are the only royal bloodline.

157
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Have you ever thought

158
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
about being the son of the current emperor?

159
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
I'm not interested

160
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
in the throne.

161
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
But how do you think

162
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
the current emperor is?

163
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
He will be defeated

164
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
if he doesn't get the throne.

165
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,760
No matter who is the heir,

166
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
he should be the son of the current emperor.

167
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Grandmother said

168
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,760
we should stay away from the storm in the palace.

169
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Now it seems that

170
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
we should start a bigger storm.

171
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Good night.

172
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Here.

173
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Greetings, grandmother.

174
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Here you are.

175
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Brother's eyes are completely cured.

176
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Thank you for the golden needle.

177
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
It made my eyes

178
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
see the sun again.

179
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
But the golden needle

180
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
only works to connect the blood vessels.

181
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Xiaowan, thank you.

182
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Yes.

183
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Brother's eyes are cured.

184
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
I feel at ease.

185
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I think you should remove

186
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
the word little doctor.

187
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Change to doctor.

188
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Grandmother, don't joke.

189
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
You are going to lose this game.

190
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
Brother.

191
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Grandmother is playing chess.

192
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Brother asked me to come here in a hurry.

193
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
I thought...

194
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Shut up.

195
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Don't talk nonsense.

196
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
I called you here

197
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
to see you.

198
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Since I got the eye disease,

199
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
I have never seen

200
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
your style.

201
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
When you came in,

202
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
you were in a trance.

203
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
When I took you in,

204
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
you thought

205
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
His Majesty was coming.

206
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Brother Ze's name

207
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
really looks like him.

208
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Look at him holding the cigarette.

209
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
They look like

210
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
real brothers.

211
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Does it look like me?

212
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
That's a twist.

213
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Brother Li and I

214
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
are the best match.

215
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
This game is impossible.

216
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
You are arguing.

217
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
I feel dizzy.

218
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
You can go out first.

219
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Let's go.

220
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Go out and play.

221
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,260
Crown Prince breathed in afraid that her marriage would go down.

222
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
Which one do you like?

223
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,260
Have something to eat?

224
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
He wants to have amandor 안녕.

225
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Enough is enough.

226
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Here

227
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,640
She just has a headache and old-age.

228
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,560
She's fine.

229
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
Let's not disturb her.

230
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,760
Let her rest for a few days.

231
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,440
I'll do as you say.

232
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,160
Why did you

233
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,600
say that Yan Li and Yan Sui look alike in front of her?

234
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,000
She's weak and stubborn.

235
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,120
She can see that they look alike.

236
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,640
But she has a sharp eye.

237
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,480
She should remind me.

238
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,360
She'll know who is stronger later.

239
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,360
Let's investigate formed ring pot at night.

240
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,120
Luckily, I

241
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,920
can be straightened now.

242
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,480
I can rest now.

243
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,000
The seventh wave is here.

244
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You and my brother haven't found out yet?

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'll tell them that the Empress Dowager is fine.

246
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I won't disturb Xian Kangli.

247
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Eat slowly.

248
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's wrong?

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What?

250
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is there anything wrong with Third Brother?

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I...

252
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Sui Ge.

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
In front of the Empress Dowager,

254
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
she deliberately pointed out

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
that Yan Li and Yan Sui are like brothers.

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think

257
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
she already knew Yan Han's true identity.

258
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The Empress Dowager is fine.

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't worry.

260
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
She has been traveling abroad for many years.

261
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
How could she know this?

262
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll ask everyone to investigate.

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This is another unexpected secret.

264
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What did you find out?

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I went to investigate the Empress Dowager's old case.

266
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Only the case of the late Emperor was missing.

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And the old imperial doctor

268
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
was also killed on the way back from the old age.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yan Han deliberately destroyed the evidence

270
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
for Li Dai's escape.

271
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
This is clearly a short-term matter.

272
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's too late to investigate.

273
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Thank you.

274
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Young Marshal.

275
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Young Marshal, Princess Consort.

276
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
How are you?

277
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We are really close.

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't need to be so polite.

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
How is Shuang'er's health?

280
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is she having a serious pregnancy?

281
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Thank you for your concern.

282
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Shuang'er's pregnancy is not serious.

283
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
She has a good appetite

284
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and is sleeping well.

285
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll go to her house

286
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
to check her pulse in a few days.

287
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay.

288
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
By the way,

289
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I have something important to report to Young Marshal.

290
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What is it?

291
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Today, a few new people came to the front of the hall.

292
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
They are all from the Zhao Army of the North.

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
They never worked in the capital before.

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:38,200
The Daoist priest was appointed by the Zhao's

295
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Gu Huanfang.

296
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's your duty to tell me.

297
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If there is anything suspicious,

298
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
tell me immediately.

299
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes.

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Young Marshal, don't worry.

301
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The Zhao's people are trying to control the palace gate.

302
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The Empress may have to do something.

303
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But you transferred the palace gate without permission.

304
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Aren't you afraid of being suspicious of that person?

305
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
She has never been suspicious of me.

306
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Instead of being passive,

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
she should have done something

308
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
before the enemy came.

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The name of Yan Han's birth

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
is like the last piece of the map of Yan.

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The last piece of the map

312
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and all the clues of the chaos

313
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and the management of the victims

314
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
are obvious.

315
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yan Han did this

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
to cover up his identity.

317
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So,

318
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Princess Consort Xin will die.

319
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Mother will die.

320
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Consort Jin will die.

321
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Brother Jin will die.

322
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
My father will die.

323
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Princess Consort Xin must have found that black birthmark

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
when she was healing Yan Han.

325
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The medical cloth that can stop bleeding

326
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
must be tied to the wound.

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If the wound continues to bleed,

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I will be replaced immediately.

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll wait here.

330
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Princess Consort, Princess Consort, come quickly.

331
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
His Majesty's wound is broken.

332
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I almost

333
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
took his birthmark

334
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
as a piece of flesh.

335
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Fortunately, I found it in time.

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
His Majesty is fine.

337
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll leave now.

338
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Please have some tea

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
after you eat.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

341
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
His Majesty gave you tea.

342
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Thank you, Eunuch Yuan.

343
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Mother just gave birth to the baby.

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Consort Xin went to visit him.

345
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I called for the fire of killing.

346
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Your Majesty,

347
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:34,200
the

348
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Consort Jin

349
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
is the only one

350
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
who has a child.

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
She was born in a family of scholars.

352
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
She found the black birthmark

353
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
of His Majesty's previous life

354
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
in the Linglong Pavilion.

355
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
She found the black birthmark

356
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
in her ink.

357
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The black birthmark

358
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
is the only one

359
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
that can stop bleeding.

360
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's the only one

361
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
that can stop bleeding.

362
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's the only one

363
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
that can stop bleeding.

364
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's the only one

365
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
that can stop bleeding.

366
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
She is as stupid as to

367
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
fight with Yan Han

368
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
with a book of books.

369
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This is how she

370
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
led herself to death.

371
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
In his dream,

372
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
he heard the ni كان

373
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
of Master Sui

374
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
near the Yongan Palace

375
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and heard Consort Jin crying out.

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He toneredoged out

377
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and went to save the girl.

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Go have a look.

379
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Master Sui.

380
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,720
Move up.

381
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,360
Go seek help.

382
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,080
Yes.

383
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,200
But if the public knows it,

384
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,840
it will cause a stir in the court.

385
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,720
The King of Jin asked Wei Bao to set up a trap

386
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,360
and chose to help Yan Han to cover up his crimes.

387
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,120
But he told the truth to my father.

388
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,800
My father

389
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,000
also chose to hide the murder weapon

390
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,640
for the sake of the country.

391
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,200
Why does the sun and the moon turn around at night

392
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,200
but still light up your light?

393
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,400
The flowers are frozen in the snow.

394
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,080
Mr. Qin,

395
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,160
I'll leave my daughter to you.

396
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,520
Go! Go!

397
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,840
Go!

398
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,520
The two people who are dedicated to the country

399
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,760
become Yan Han's

400
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,640
secret sacrifice to cover up the world.

401
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,920
That's why my father told me not to be angry.

402
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,320
Because as long as Yan Han is in the position,

403
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,440
no one can be forgiven.

404
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,280
According to the court's justice,

405
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,560
I decided to investigate the death of Concubine Qin

406
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,480
and sent you away.

407
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,480
Now we know the truth.

408
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,480
There's nothing we can't do.

409
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,080
Yan Han's evil deeds will be repaid.

410
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
Yan's country will be at peace.

411
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,800
At the worst, my father will be the heir.

412
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,880
Yan Chi,

413
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,360
now

414
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,680
we can only rely on us.

415
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,680
Don't worry.

416
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,960
We will make everyone's fate

417
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,800
be chosen.

418
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,360
The north is in chaos.

419
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,920
The most shortage of grain and clothing in Hebei Road

420
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,160
is scrape the demand

421
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
for the Red Army.

422
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,720
S claim

423
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,040
that the roads on Hebei Road

424
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,520
have been replaced by

425
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,960
convoyfast duty horses only,

426
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,240
and the food is found outside the Connor Hupe Road.

427
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,480
Your Majesty is late.

428
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,420
ata

429
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,200
Here is the final assessment.

430
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,440
Any promptedon for any wrongdoing

431
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,400
play by Grindu datas?

432
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,040
Your Majesty,

433
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,600
The tiger goat of Huaiyang Army, which is inside Eastern Jingdong Road

434
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:09,900
Meet the news of the two commanders differential

435
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,120
Your Majesty, do you need to summon the Minister of Revenue

436
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,080
to discuss the disaster relief in the north?

437
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,720
No need.

438
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,480
I

439
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,800
have a clear plan.

440
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,160
I don't have any disaster relief.

441
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,120
I deserve to be hit.

442
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,520
Has the Fengyi Palace

443
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,520
been affected recently?

444
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,360
The Imperial Academy of Judicial Review reported that

445
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,200
the Empress heard that a few people died in Yanqi.

446
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,520
She was very happy.

447
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,560
After that, she still cried every day.

448
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,400
I think she is not guilty.

449
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
In the coming days,

450
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,240
we will strengthen the palace's funds.

451
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,800
We will order the Imperial Academy of Judicial Review

452
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,600
to keep an eye on Fengyi Palace.

453
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,640
If there is another case like the bloodbath of the Lord Cheng,

454
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,800
you, the Chief of the Imperial Academy of Judicial Review,

455
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,160
will go to Fengyi Palace to serve.

456
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,040
I will obey your order.

457
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,880
Your Majesty!

458
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,720
Your Majesty!

459
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,080
Your Majesty!

460
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,800
Your Majesty!

461
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,080
Your Majesty!

462
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,520
Your Majesty!

463
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,840
Your Majesty!

464
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,040
It's the result of the Empire's efforts.

465
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,080
Please come and take a look.

466
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Young Master.

467
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
Thank you, Young Master.

468
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Young Master.

469
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Young Master.

470
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
The magistrate of the Royal Household Department

471
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
has just changed the guards of the Feng Yi Palace.

472
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
His Highness Prince Xi

473
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
is to meet you outside the Feng Yi Palace immediately.

474
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
I think

475
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
there's already some arrangement.

476
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
An arrangement?

477
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Yes.

478
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
She can talk to The Empress

479
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
or send a message.

480
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
I didn't dare to be too close

481
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
and didn't see it clearly.

482
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
But I think

483
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
what the gatekeeper said is right.

484
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
Were you on duty today?

485
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
I should have been at night search.

486
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
But at noon,

487
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
Zhao's Magistrate said

488
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
that they wanted to strengthen the guards of the Royal Household Department

489
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,080
and transferred all of our guards to the Royal Household Department.

490
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
I always feel

491
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,360
I always feel something is wrong.

492
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
So I keep following him.

493
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,640
You're right.

494
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,800
Could it be that

495
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,480
he wants to leave the palace tonight?

496
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,440
I'm afraid there's a bigger problem.

497
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,400
Contact other friends immediately.

498
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,120
No matter what happens tonight,

499
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,240
find an excuse to stay in the office.

500
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,120
Don't tell the 14th and the 11th.

501
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,000
Yes.

502
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,360
Your Highness.

503
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,960
Deputy Zheng, did you find anything?

504
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,040
I was careless.

505
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,040
In Li Muyun's old scroll,

506
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,560
he found many murder cases about the Tian Dao Club.

507
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,760
When he was interrogating,

508
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,640
he didn't mention Tian Dao Club.

509
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,680
Also,

510
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,600
during the serial murder case of Guan Yinzhen,

511
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,760
he visited the Zhizhou Office of Guan Yinzhen.

512
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,040
It was his suggestion to arrest Zhang Dongxuan.

513
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,600
But he went back to the lower ground before the trial.

514
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,880
Zhizhou of Guan Yinzhen

515
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,840
was grateful for his not being corrupt.

516
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,320
Li Muyun knew that these murder cases

517
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,440
were related to Tian Dao Club,

518
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,800
but he didn't mention it.

519
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,600
He could have hidden the fact that he went to Guan Yinzhen.

520
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
He was not only covering up for Tian Dao Club,

521
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,200
but also covering up his relationship with Tian Dao Club.

522
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,720
Also,

523
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,160
I followed Li Muyun

524
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,120
to a private house in Tianshui Town in the east.

525
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,640
I investigated the name of the owner of the private house.

526
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
The owner is nothing.

527
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,320
But the house's gas transfer has been banned.

528
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Six years ago, the owner was Ning Buyi.

529
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
This is no coincidence.

530
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,800
Li Muyun and Ning Buyi must have a connection.

531
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,040
Why are you back?

532
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,880
We'll talk later.

533
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,800
What else did you find, Mr. Zheng?

534
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,880
I found Ning Buyi's file

535
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,520
is very suspicious

536
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,680
compared to the previous files.

537
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,360
The witness of Guan Yinzhen said

538
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,120
that he had seen two young men

539
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,480
besides Zhang Dongxuan in the case.

540
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,280
One of them was Ning Buyi.

541
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,000
The other one was the blind Gu Mu.

542
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,880
Gu Mu?

543
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,360
The witness said that this Gu Mu

544
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,280
was very handsome

545
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,840
and had a good temper.

546
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,480
So he remembered it very clearly.

547
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,040
After the case was listed

548
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
as a one-off case,

549
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,480
did Li Muyun call those files?

550
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,800
Yes.

551
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,760
But he just ordered people

552
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
to take away the part of the case.

553
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,280
The other parts were not altered.

554
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,320
Li Muyun is very careful in writing.

555
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,680
Usually, people who have evidence

556
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
won't do anything

557
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,920
in case they are found and can't be changed.

558
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,680
This is the way he teaches his subordinates.

559
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,080
Today, Yan Ze

560
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,640
persuaded the Empress alone.

561
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,720
If that Gu Mu is him,

562
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,120
then everything is clear.

563
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,000
So Gu Mu

564
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,440
is the son of Yan Ze?

565
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,440
For the past ten years,

566
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,360
Yan Ze has been looking for medical help.

567
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,240
But no one knows what he did.

568
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,640
He used his style to talk.

569
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,480
It's not difficult to take away

570
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,720
Li Muyun and Ning Buyi.

571
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,960
Besides, the late princess has been in the capital

572
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,800
to treat the patients of the elite in the capital.

573
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,200
She has accumulated a lot of people's affection.

574
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,480
If Yan Ze wants to use this relationship

575
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,960
to transfer Ning Buyi and Li Muyun

576
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,680
to the capital, it's not a problem.

577
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,920
In this way,

578
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,080
Yan Ze knew that

579
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,760
the late princess was killed by His Majesty.

580
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,880
So he said that Sui Ge'er

581
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,200
was very similar to Yan Li.

582
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,400
He knew His Majesty was fake.

583
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,680
But why did he make this promise?

584
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,880
It's still unknown.

585
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,920
But

586
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
from the signs of the temporary change of the room

587
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,760
in front of the hall today,

588
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,640
they must have made some moves tonight.

589
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,720
Wan'er,

590
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,480
this is an emergency.

591
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,240
We can't let the scene go to waste.

592
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,680
Just do it my way.

593
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,440
OK. I'll do as you say.

594
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,600
God,

595
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,920
the capital is in chaos.

596
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,280
Please assign people to

597
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,880
keep an eye on all the streets in the capital.

598
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,520
If anyone wants to break into the chaos,

599
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,520
arrest him immediately.

600
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,440
Yes.

601
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,760
Ask the government to send more people

602
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,000
to patrol the city at night

603
00:32:53,280 --> 00:33:19,060
to control the roads and check the

604
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,820
roads.

605
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

606
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,900
I'll go with you.

607
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,940
I said

608
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,180
we'll never separate in life and death.

609
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,460
Then we'll never separate in life and death.

610
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,620
Your Highness,

611
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,180
be careful.

612
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
The King of the Deceased

613
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,060
The King of the Deceased

614
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
The King of the Deceased

615
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,060
The King of the Deceased

616
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,060
The King of the Deceased

617
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,060
The King of the Deceased

618
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
Where is the person who is holding the sword?

619
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,900
When my father used to get angry,

620
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,900
he would let everyone out.

621
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,180
Why don't we come to His Majesty tomorrow

622
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,420
to avoid him from feeling bad

623
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,940
and we'll be scolded for nothing?

624
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,660
I'm practicing my handwriting.

625
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,660
Why would my father scold me?

626
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,180
Let's practice our handwriting too.

627
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,100
If we don't leave,

628
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,420
His Majesty won't be able to leave.

629
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,180
What's that?

630
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,380
Let's go.

631
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,740
We can't open the door.

632
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,820
Hurry up.

633
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:48,820
This way.

634
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,180
I'm so scared.

635
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,060
Don't be scared.

636
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,940
Follow me.

637
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,900
When we enter the palace gate,

638
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,980
we'll act according to the rules.

639
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
I'm the Princess Consort of Rui.

640
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,580
I'm here to treat Her Majesty.

641
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,180
The gate is locked.

642
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
Please come back, Princess Consort of Rui.

643
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,020
Why did you lock the gate

644
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,980
before the time is up?

645
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,660
You're responsible for

646
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,900
delaying Her Majesty's illness.

647
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,180
If you don't open the gate,

648
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,620
I'll ask Prince Rui

649
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,620
to explain the rules to you.

650
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,060
Wait a minute, Princess Consort.

651
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,060
We'll open the gate when we get down.

652
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,100
Speak out.

653
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,940
Where is your master?

654
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,820
It's poisoning.

655
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,900
It's notified of arriving soon.

656
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,780
What?

657
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,420
What's wrong with the edge when we enter the palace gate?

658
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,940
Your husband is sick

659
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,260
and he is suffering.

660
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,860
When it was treated,

661
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,140
I'm afraid there's going to be a coup.

662
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,460
Wan'er, we can only split up.

663
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,660
You go to Funing Palace to take care of the Empress Dowager and Cui Ge.

664
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,540
I'll go save Yan Han.

665
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,220
If he dies as His Majesty,

666
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,900
the coup will be over tonight.

667
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,300
Master.

668
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,060
Master,

669
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,460
all the people have been arrested.

670
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,140
The people from the Xue Fuwei have never sent a signal.

671
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,820
It seems that no one is still in the city.

672
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,940
You accompany the Princess Consort to Funing Palace to find Yue Ning.

673
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,860
I'll go with you.

674
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,460
Yes.

675
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,060
Yes.

676
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,660
Yes.

677
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,260
Yes.

678
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:12,860
Yes.

679
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,460
Yes.

680
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,060
Yes.

681
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,660
Yes.

682
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,260
Yes.

683
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,860
Yes.

684
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,460
Yes.

685
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,260
Protect the Empress Dowager and Cui Ge.

686
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,260
Yes.

687
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,220
The white internal organs of the blood of the Qingse

688
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,700
are detoxified.

689
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,660
Do you know how to use it?

690
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,260
If you dare to die,

691
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,220
I'll make you an imperial guard and accompany me.

692
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,780
I won't give you this chance.

693
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:52,980
Let's go.

694
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,060
Let's go.

695
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,460
Brother Li,

696
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,300
why are you locked up?

697
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,340
There are dead people everywhere.

698
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,940
I'm so scared.

699
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,060
Don't be afraid.

700
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,980
I'll go to the God of War to see His Majesty.

701
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,540
Well,

702
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,900
you hide behind.

703
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,300
Remember,

704
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,260
except me,

705
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,380
there are seven brothers and seven sisters-in-law.

706
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,500
Don't come out no matter who calls you.

707
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,860
Brother, don't go.

708
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,540
In case father is angry,

709
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,300
he treats you like my mother.

710
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,060
It won't.

711
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,780
Brother is very good at martial arts.

712
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,700
If you can't,

713
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,940
you can run away.

714
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,220
I promise no one can catch up with me.

715
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,060
Brother, you should come back soon.

716
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:46,660
Be good.

717
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:47,900
Go.

718
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,700
Go.

719
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,300
Be careful.

720
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,860
Go.

721
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,420
Young Marshal,

722
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,500
something is wrong.

723
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,620
The people guarding the inner gate tonight

724
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,580
are all living.

725
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,100
They are definitely not from the Hall of Heavenly Purity.

726
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,580
They only guard the inner gate

727
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,460
and don't light the lanterns.

728
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,380
I can't see the situation in the hall.

729
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,420
I dare not act rashly.

730
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,500
Is His Majesty in the hall?

731
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,140
Yes.

732
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,740
Prince Yi and the Ninth Highness

733
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,340
just went in.

734
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,020
They haven't come out yet.

735
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,860
When did they go in?

736
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,060
One hour ago.

737
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,660
We can't wait any longer.

738
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,660
Do as planned.

739
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,260
Yes.

740
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,620
Granny Chen,

741
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,660
why aren't Yan Li and Sui Ge back yet?

742
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,380
Yeah.

743
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,860
It's about time.

744
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,300
I'll send someone to ask.

745
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,820
Okay.

746
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,460
Ning.

747
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,660
Xiaowan, why are you here?

748
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,540
Where is the Ninth Highness?

749
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,300
Just now,

750
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,420
someone from the Hall of Heavenly Purity came to summon

751
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,220
His Majesty to check

752
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,420
Yan Li and Sui Ge's work.

753
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,420
They went there.

754
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,180
What's wrong?

755
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,420
Granny Chen,

756
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,260
keep a close eye on the inner gate.

757
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,300
No one is allowed to enter during this period.

758
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,060
Yes.

759
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,900
What's wrong?

760
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,820
Is Yan Li in danger?

761
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,740
I'll explain later.

762
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,620
Let's go find them first.

763
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,140
Okay.

764
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:49,840
Provincial deputy,ownership

765
00:40:50,140 --> 00:41:01,980
delicate

766
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,740
Chengけて

767
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,220
No, it was Han denied

768
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:57,760
he also did when the

769
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:06,360
situations where the

770
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,120
Brother,

771
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
what are you going to do?

772
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,160
How dare you!

773
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,720
I've seen enough of your injustice

774
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,440
in this palace.

775
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,960
I dare not to do it.

776
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,960
Wan Xi,

777
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,840
Kang Bo Wen

778
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,800
is loyal and upright.

779
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,240
What will happen to him?

780
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,680
All these years,

781
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,120
I've been doing dirty work for His Majesty.

782
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,680
I'll end up like a dog who's dying sooner or later.

783
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,920
But the world I want

784
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,160
hasn't come true.

785
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,760
I don't want to die.

786
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,640
Then

787
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,360
only His Majesty can die.

788
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,000
You...

789
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,040
You bastard!

790
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,960
You bastard!

791
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,360
The law of heaven is not fair.

792
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,560
Only if you're not tired of it,

793
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,360
you can learn from it.

794
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,520
The law of heaven is fair.

795
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,120
You've done a great job.

796
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,720
Who are you?

797
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,760
Don't you know

798
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,440
you're rebelling?

799
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,520
Rebelling?

800
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,560
What I've done

801
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
is to

802
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,840
rebelling

803
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,520
and to serve the law of heaven.

804
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,280
Yan Zi.

805
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,400
It's me

806
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,120
who killed two people because of you.

807
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,360
Yan Zi.

808
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,480
It's my Processing Section.

809
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,600
You Jooardumbles.

810
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,800
You need one or two กら 18mellows for one man.

811
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,560
I've prepared a secret

812
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,800
to the emissary.

813
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,880
If you don't keep it,

814
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,760
then think carefully.

815
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,360
Si Yin Grand Commandant

816
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,720
would want to help you.

817
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,120
I'll give it to you now.

818
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,720
Look,

819
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,840
don't you know

820
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,600
there're seven-year-old silver maids

821
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,400
inside Yan Shi?

822
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,560
Stop it!

823
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,920
You.

824
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,760
This way is blacked out.

825
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,360
Yes, dürfen.

826
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,360
the blood of Rong Di and the rebels.

827
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,360
If you don't want to die,

828
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,360
just surrender.

829
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,960
Zhao Wu is dead.

830
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,040
If you dare to do it first,

831
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,520
I'll kill him first.

832
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,520
Your Highness, the Empress lied to me.

833
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,000
They are not with the army.

834
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,440
They are from the Heaven Island.

835
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,000
You can't avoid it.

836
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,400
Kill him.

837
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,640
Kill him!

838
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:05,560
The wind and snow give me a white dress

839
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:12,560
If a deep love can be like a heartache

840
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,560
The pain will also be the same

841
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,560
Open your heart, love doesn't matter the deep sea

842
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:32,560
Please give me courage, let fate be open

843
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:39,560
Don't be afraid of the starlight being touched by the moonlight

844
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:48,560
The stars will shine beyond the sky

845
00:46:48,560 --> 00:47:00,560
The stars will shine beyond the sky
