1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Barbarous Love

2
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,440
You're up all night again.

3
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm not tired.

4
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,920
I just recorded the first few points

5
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,040
we discussed last night.

6
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,920
You were woken up by Zheng Fuyi's sigh.

7
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,160
It's okay. I'm not tired either.

8
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,240
It's time for her to get up.

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,720
It's okay.

10
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,280
Who dares to do that?

11
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,520
Your Highness.

12
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,160
Zheng Fuyi is really a good sleeper.

13
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,840
Your Highness, Princess, don't blame me.

14
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,960
I was wrong.

15
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,480
Your Highness is a young man.

16
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,800
Zheng Fuyi can be uncomfortable.

17
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,880
Zheng Fuyi can be uncomfortable.

18
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
It's okay. It's okay.

19
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,160
I just feel thirsty.

20
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,720
Your Highness,

21
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,560
if you don't treat me well,

22
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,560
I'll drink a cold drink.

23
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,240
Good.

24
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,880
Zheng Fuyi has been working hard

25
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,720
to plan the patrol.

26
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,920
But there's one more thing

27
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,680
that needs Zheng Fuyi to do.

28
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,200
I can't say that.

29
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,360
If you have any orders,

30
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,840
just tell me.

31
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,680
Please go to the secretary's office.

32
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,040
Copy the case of the three murders

33
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,480
of Guan Yingzheng and Childe Wu Si.

34
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,800
The stormy weather that day

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:41,000
and the daily

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,880
and monthly traffic.

37
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
I have no right to look at it.

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,760
I heard that Zheng Fuyi and the current chief of staff

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,160
are friends of the same subject.

40
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,000
You won't give me this, will you?

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,600
Don't worry, Your Highness.

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
I won't disobey your order.

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,560
Come on.

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,520
Bring my official robe here.

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,920
Go on.

46
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,200
Stay smile.

47
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,120
How come Guan Yingzheng's舞Take Record

48
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,000
paint?

49
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,480
He is to drive himself excited.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
You still suspect Zhang Dong-xuan?

51
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,440
Besides from the clip reads of me using the Eastern freely,

52
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,880
The body was found at his door.

53
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,040
And

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,960
the words he found in his house.

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
Even if he tried to kill someone,

56
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,960
it doesn't mean he has nothing to do with it.

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
But maybe

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,280
he didn't know these words.

59
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,960
My father must have proved his words

60
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,240
in Guanyin Town.

61
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,040
That's why he believes he's not the murderer.

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,240
I know.

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,000
Then why do you suspect him?

64
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,760
Before there's any evidence,

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,480
it's a matter of belief or not.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,600
You and Shen Gong choose to believe him

67
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,920
and there's a way to believe him.

68
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,840
If I don't believe him,

69
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,200
there's a way to believe him.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,400
The old liar is good at

71
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
telling lies.

72
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,320
As long as I suspect him,

73
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,280
he won't take us all in.

74
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
Okay.

75
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
I have some ideas

76
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,320
about these words.

77
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,240
How about we ask him

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,040
about the details of the other two cases

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,920
and the process of investigation?

80
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,280
Maybe he'll find something new.

81
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,120
The old liar is very talkative.

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,320
He became a fight when he saw me.

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,800
I won't go with you.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,800
I don't want to disturb you.

85
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay.

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,280
Your Highness, you're so angry today.

87
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
What do you want to know?

88
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,400
Ask him.

89
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,800
You've given the three victims

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
of Guanyin Town a guess.

91
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,280
But the other two victims' guess

92
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,880
is before the case of the peel-off

93
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,760
or after it?

94
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
How long is the time difference?

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,320
Of course it's before.

96
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,240
I'm not stupid.

97
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,960
I know that

98
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,720
the people of the Heavenly Dao Club

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,760
have already been watching me.

100
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,360
I even went to the street

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,600
to give them a guess.

102
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,080
If they find out,

103
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,520
I'll be doomed.

104
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,160
Bring it here.

105
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,000
These are all the punishments

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,000
for the victims of the folk legend.

107
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,280
The death of the two victims of Guanyin Town

108
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,440
is almost the same.

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,320
The second victim was taken by Xiu Qi.

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,160
He killed Yuan Pei and others.

111
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
He was pulled out of his tongue and died.

112
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,640
He was pulled out of his tongue.

113
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,360
The third victim

114
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,120
was not willing to raise his old father.

115
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,040
He was so cold that

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,920
he drove his father out of the house and died.

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,800
He was tied to a rope and

118
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
was frozen to death by the ice.

119
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,160
It was the same as the cold soldier.

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,120
What are you doing?

121
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,040
That's right.

122
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,160
Yes.

123
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Do you know

124
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
who hid these paintings in your house?

125
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,160
How did you know

126
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,440
that I didn't paint these?

127
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,880
No.

128
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,560
What are you doing?

129
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,280
You...

130
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,880
What are you doing?

131
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,560
I was suspicious yesterday.

132
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,800
Now,

133
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
I'm sure you have a blood disease.

134
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,120
You even said these words.

135
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,680
Don't mention killing.

136
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,040
If those officials know

137
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,920
that there is such a disease in the world,

138
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,640
then I will

139
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
cherish my crime.

140
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,360
You are not all people.

141
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Even the doctors

142
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,480
may have seen this disease

143
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,400
in medical books.

144
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,440
But you don't have to feel wronged.

145
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,240
You have rejected

146
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
all the cases.

147
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,720
If it's just a coincidence,

148
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,240
it's hard to get a new one.

149
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,920
I know it's not a coincidence.

150
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,360
Once the three cases of the murder case are solved,

151
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,680
I know

152
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
the people of the Heavenly Court

153
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,320
don't plan to let me go.

154
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,520
But I don't understand

155
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,840
why they are trying to frame me.

156
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
Aren't they afraid that

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,560
I will be caught by the people of the government

158
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,800
and be dragged out?

159
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,200
You are right.

160
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,520
But is there anyone else

161
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,680
who believes except the Shen Palace?

162
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
That's right.

163
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,320
If they knew I was caught,

164
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,720
no one would believe me.

165
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
They framed you

166
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,720
and covered up the crime.

167
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,000
They also eliminated

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,240
the existence of the Heavenly Court.

169
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,280
It's a good thing for them.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,760
This is too scary.

171
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,160
Do you know

172
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,640
who is the owner of the Heavenly Court?

173
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,680
I don't know.

174
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,560
The owner rarely appears.

175
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,520
I only know

176
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,080
he is a man with a white mask

177
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
and a tall and thin body.

178
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
I can't see his age,

179
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,400
but his voice is very stable.

180
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
What is the black

181
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,560
flower you are talking about?

182
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,600
You are so kind to me.

183
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,120
I will never forget

184
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,440
your kindness.

185
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,320
I will tell you everything

186
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
I know.

187
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,960
I heard from Zhang

188
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,640
that the Heavenly Court is specialised in

189
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,200
finding people like me

190
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,280
who are innocent and innocent.

191
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,360
He himself

192
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
has been greatly wronged.

193
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,800
The black and red

194
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,880
flower pattern

195
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,360
was created by the owner.

196
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,440
I heard that this kind of flower

197
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,080
can only be found

198
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,040
in the place where it is located.

199
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,360
It is a flower

200
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
that can bloom in the hell

201
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,160
only with human blood.

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
The pattern of this flower

203
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,960
is drawn in the place where it is located

204
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,800
to warn the world

205
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,560
that there is no heaven and no earth,

206
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,920
and that evil spirits are everywhere.

207
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Everywhere?

208
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
Isn't it saying

209
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
that as long as the Heavenly Court is alive,

210
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,840
there will be

211
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,840
a secret secret in this world?

212
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,600
Waner.

213
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,200
Mr. Jiu.

214
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,400
There are 800,000 people in the capital.

215
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,320
It is really the Heavenly Court.

216
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,280
Take him back to Puyang.

217
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,280
Yes.

218
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,200
Be careful.

219
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,280
Don't step on the stage.

220
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,560
Did you see it clearly?

221
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Did he really

222
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,920
get bitten by a cockroach?

223
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,600
I saw it clearly.

224
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
His face is covered with blood.

225
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,120
A few days ago,

226
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,200
did he

227
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
have a cup of bala skin?

228
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,760
A bowl of bala skin?

229
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,800
And a bowl of bala skin?

230
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,680
What is this?

231
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
It is a bowl of bala skin.

232
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,920
It is a bowl of bala skin.

233
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
It is a bowl of bala skin.

234
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
It is a bowl of bala skin.

235
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
It is a bowl of bala skin.

236
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
It is a bowl of bala skin.

237
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,040
How much grudge

238
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
will it be if they are used to pull the snakes?

239
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
I heard that

240
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,840
they are all evil people.

241
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,520
That's why they are punished by the Heaven.

242
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,040
It is so scary.

243
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,720
It seems that the capital is not safe.

244
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,040
Who said it is not safe?

245
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,520
If the Jinzhao Mansion

246
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,840
doesn't give us an explanation,

247
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,800
who will dare to

248
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,680
go out in the middle of the night?

249
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,320
Is it true?

250
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,200
Yes.

251
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,520
They must give us an explanation today.

252
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,080
They must give us an explanation today.

253
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
They must give us an explanation today.

254
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
They must give us an explanation today.

255
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,520
Back off.

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,640
Back off.

257
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,200
Back off.

258
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,880
Back off.

259
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,640
Back off.

260
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,240
Back off.

261
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,000
Back off.

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I am Princess Yongsi.

263
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I am here to check the crime scene in the capital.

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I am here to check the crime scene in the capital.

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Please step back

266
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,280
to protect the scene.

267
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,040
A princess is here.

268
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,000
A woman also came out at night.

269
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,080
Is it possible?

270
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,880
Yes.

271
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,920
Let's change a brave male dancer.

272
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,320
We just want to know

273
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,560
who is the dead one?

274
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,120
When can we catch the murderer?

275
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,160
Can we still go out at night?

276
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,920
Yes.

277
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,120
Yes.

278
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,720
Stop laughing.

279
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,840
It is just stepping on the scene to destroy the evidence.

280
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,280
The murderer will be released from the law

281
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,920
and be mixed with us.

282
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,000
Maybe the next one to be killed

283
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,720
will be one of us.

284
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
I guess we don't want to

285
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,840
suffer the consequences.

286
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,000
I am the Minister of Justice, Lang Yanchi.

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,480
I will strengthen the patrol at night

288
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,320
to ensure the safety of the people.

289
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,760
As for the identity of the dead,

290
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,880
after Princess Yongci's autopsy,

291
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,400
I will give you an explanation.

292
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,440
I think he is right.

293
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,920
He is right.

294
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,560
Come on.

295
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,160
Push them back.

296
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
Push them back.

297
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Come on.

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,240
Push them back.

299
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,360
Yes.

300
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,440
Now is the critical time of the investigation.

301
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,600
The more time is delayed,

302
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,960
the less we can break through.

303
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,800
You are all the people of Jingzhao.

304
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,040
You not only want to have the prosperity of the emperor,

305
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
but also have the responsibility to protect the throne.

306
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,400
You don't believe the rumors

307
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,200
and don't act without permission.

308
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,720
Please step back from your home

309
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,080
and help the case of the government of Jingzhao

310
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,640
to return the peace of the capital.

311
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,480
Come on.

312
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Everyone, step back.

313
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,040
Thank you for your kindness.

314
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,520
I promise you

315
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,360
I will investigate this case as soon as possible.

316
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I will wait for your call.

317
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,280
You can take a look.

318
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,600
Just look at this image.

319
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,080
Halloween

320
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,480
According to the traces of this place,

321
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,720
someone has always been hiding here,

322
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,120
but no clue whether they'rey the evidence.

323
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
What's this?

324
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,280
Record the location of the broken snake.

325
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,360
Remember.

326
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,080
The victim's right hand is unknown.

327
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,160
It should be traces left by the writing of Changnin.

328
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,080
The victim should be a scholar.

329
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,560
The finger is twisted.

330
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,760
There is a lot of blood in the mouth.

331
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,240
It should be cut off by Huohuo before he died.

332
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
Black and red.

333
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,640
Is it Wuyi Flower?

334
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,400
Chen Ying is a thousand-pointed jade.

335
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,600
It's a

336
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
There is a scent of dust in the ink.

337
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,440
It's still a good scent of dust.

338
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

339
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,680
Princess Yongci.

340
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,560
I am here to paint for the victim

341
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,920
under the order of the government.

342
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,080
Ninhua City is very good at painting.

343
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,880
Thank you.

344
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,960
Thank you, Princess.

345
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,880
The blood of the Ninhua City

346
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,960
that was not here before

347
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,720
is hard to paint for Childe Wu Si.

348
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
You are too kind.

349
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,720
I am just a painter.

350
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,840
I can do something

351
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,320
that can help the government.

352
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,440
It's also a way to protect the peace

353
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,560
of the capital.

354
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:17,960
Please.

355
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,120
Officer Zhang.

356
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
When the painting is done,

357
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,040
put the painting on the wall.

358
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,880
Tell the guards and officers of the neighborhoods

359
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,040
to go to the courier house.

360
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,240
Yes.

361
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Oh my god.

362
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,280
My dear, you died so tragically.

363
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,600
How can I live if you know this?

364
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,560
Are you sure that Mrs. Zhao is the victim?

365
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,480
He is my husband.

366
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,960
Officer Zhang.

367
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,520
In order to support the family business,

368
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,920
you left Wan Gui

369
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,720
and taught the guards and officers.

370
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,200
My dear.

371
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,720
Mrs. Zhao.

372
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,200
You said that Mr. Zhao

373
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,600
went out to teach people.

374
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
It was the guards and officers

375
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,040
who forced my husband to attend the class.

376
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,880
Princess.

377
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,720
Mrs. Zhao, please go back.

378
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,800
We will catch the murderer as soon as possible.

379
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,800
I'll send her away.

380
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,360
Mrs. Zhao, this way.

381
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,720
This way.

382
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,120
Did you find anything?

383
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,680
Why didn't you tell Mrs. Zhao?

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,400
Look at the handwriting on the pants.

385
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,360
This is the man, Yuan Yang.

386
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,920
There are some old letters on these clothes.

387
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,440
It shows that he didn't go out to teach people.

388
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,040
He was having an affair with someone.

389
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,880
This is the skin of a snake.

390
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,960
There are two cases of coincidences in the world.

391
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,800
If it wasn't for the death of Guan Yinzhen's brother,

392
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,800
who else could it be?

393
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,720
You don't suspect him?

394
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,600
The picture on the scene is blurred.

395
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,480
Sir, can you see

396
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,120
if this is the same as the painting of Tian Dao Club?

397
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,760
No.

398
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,800
Although it's blurred,

399
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,960
the color is the same as the overall shape.

400
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,840
What's the point of the color?

401
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,200
I have a secret recipe for powder brush.

402
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,600
The brush with these two colors

403
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,400
was ordered by the owner

404
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,680
to make it for me.

405
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,360
Did you add the Chen Shui Xiang

406
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,640
when you were eating ink?

407
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,400
Yes.

408
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,800
All the materials were set up for him.

409
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,200
Did you give the secret recipe to others?

410
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,960
I gave the secret recipe to the owner

411
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,360
to get out of Tian Dao Club as soon as possible.

412
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,520
Did the owner of Tian Dao Club

413
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,520
do it himself this time?

414
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
The murder case this time

415
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,920
is more cruel than before.

416
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,240
If they stopped three times

417
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,760
in the past,

418
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,800
it was to avoid the attention of the government.

419
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,840
But why did they commit the crime

420
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,120
after five years of torture?

421
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,760
Maybe they never tortured anyone.

422
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,800
They just transferred to the capital.

423
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,400
Capital?

424
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,160
Why is it the capital?

425
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,280
The Tian Dao Club

426
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,200
is in the place of Tian Xingdao.

427
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,160
Is it the emperor?

428
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,520
I really don't know.

429
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,360
It's just a guess.

430
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,800
No matter what the Tian Dao Club is up to,

431
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,280
we can't let them

432
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,560
continue to kill and kill.

433
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,080
But there are too few clues and evidence now.

434
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,640
How much do you know about the owner?

435
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,120
The owner is very fond of etiquette

436
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,200
and is particular about following the law of nature.

437
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,120
He always does what he should do.

438
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,920
According to the owner,

439
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,560
if he messes up the land,

440
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,360
it's like messing up the heaven.

441
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,720
In this way,

442
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,120
the owner

443
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,840
should be a self-righteous and self-righteous person.

444
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,880
He won't change the rules he set.

445
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,760
He won't change the order of the execution.

446
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,840
The Tian Dao Club's private method

447
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,880
is based on the hellish talk.

448
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,480
Today, we will find the murderer in order.

449
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,840
The first case of Guan Yinzhen and the capital

450
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
is all about the Bo Pi case.

451
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,960
The next case is the Ba Shi case.

452
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,360
The next one is the Han Bing case.

453
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
You're good at calculating.

454
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,640
Then should you also

455
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,360
deduce the time and direction of the case?

456
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,640
Your Highness, you're making fun of me.

457
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,720
I just read some books when I was young.

458
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,960
I got some money

459
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,400
from the investigation.

460
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,440
I just want to make some money.

461
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,840
Don't let the fourth person know about this.

462
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,880
If you can calculate

463
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,720
the time and direction of the three murders

464
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
in Guan Yinzhen,

465
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,680
I'll send you to jail immediately.

466
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,280
You want to use this method

467
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,560
to predict the time and location of the next case?

468
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,240
You're an old liar.

469
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,840
What?

470
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,000
What Mr. Zhang said

471
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,640
is that the set master

472
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,920
is so particular about the time and location of the case.

473
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,240
Then he should be more specific about the time and location of the case.

474
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,480
We just need to find

475
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,360
the key to the four-star case of Guan Yinzhen

476
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
and we can be prepared in advance.

477
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,920
Yes.

478
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,400
When can Your Highness and Princess

479
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,480
let me leave this prison?

480
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,320
I've been in this prison for five years.

481
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,520
I haven't touched any book.

482
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,840
I have to go back and prepare

483
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,080
in case I die.

484
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,000
Tonight,

485
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,400
I'll record the condition

486
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,520
and the blood moon sickness

487
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,120
of Mr. Zhang and give it to Your Highness.

488
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll send you out of the prison tomorrow.

489
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,920
How did you come up with the time and location

490
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,480
to predict the case with Zhang Dongxuan?

491
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,840
You're so smart.

492
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,680
I'm just a servant.

493
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,080
You used a drop of blood to draw his love.

494
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,480
That's your real ability.

495
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,680
I really admire you.

496
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,800
Don't be so picky.

497
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,800
This is the record of Guan Yinzhen's record.

498
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,080
I'll give it to Mr. Zhang tomorrow.

499
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,320
Let him see if there's anything

500
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,520
special

501
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
on the sky.

502
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,040
You really found it?

503
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,480
I thought you were just

504
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,760
trying to get rid of the government's seal.

505
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm really looking for it.

506
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,240
I'm really trying to get rid of it.

507
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,560
One more thing.

508
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,000
The residence of Luo Zhou, the governor of Guan Yinzhen,

509
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,840
was Li Muyun's.

510
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
Why doesn't Li Muyun's name

511
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,080
appear on the criminal record?

512
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,520
Because he never intervened in the case.

513
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,440
He acted as a third party

514
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
and directly intervened in the criminal record.

515
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,160
The criminal record was taken over.

516
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,560
Then the record and the record of my father

517
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,760
when he was re-inventing the case

518
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,400
were all taken over by Li Muyun?

519
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,440
He lived in Dali Temple after the case.

520
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,880
It's said that

521
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,080
there's no such chance.

522
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,440
What if he took over after my father's death?

523
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,680
But this case has nothing to do with the case of Prince Ji.

524
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,160
Li Muyun has no reason to do it.

525
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,720
Guan Yinzhen committed this crime under his control.

526
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,160
He probably knows about it.

527
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,120
There must be something to do with it.

528
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,920
But what is it?

529
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,680
I'll go and find out.

530
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,960
Don't think too much now.

531
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,200
You need to rest well now.

532
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,360
But there are so many things that I don't have the time to think about.

533
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,160
No matter how much trouble there is,

534
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,480
I'll stay with you.

535
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,280
We'll take one step at a time.

536
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,280
There will always be a day when the flowers bloom.

537
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,400
Let's not worry about this moment.

538
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,400
Let's go.

539
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,000
Hurry up.

540
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,600
Hurry up.

541
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,800
It seems that

542
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,400
when I was testing the corpse,

543
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,200
no one in this mansion is not filial.

544
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,480
They are all ignorant people.

545
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,200
You were just testing the corpse by order.

546
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,840
They still look down on us.

547
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,440
Don't take it to heart.

548
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,920
Just go back and sleep.

549
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,120
I'll buy you something to eat.

550
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440
I promise that you can eat something hot when you wake up.

551
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,080
It seems that

552
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,840
Bai Feng is not taking you out to play.

553
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,200
I went to find a good thing for my wife.

554
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,720
That is Mo Yu in the house of the nanny.

555
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,080
Who else can she be?

556
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,880
When my wife was not at home,

557
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,320
she came to inquire about the news every day.

558
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,600
I didn't give her a good word.

559
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,000
These days,

560
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,240
pack my things well.

561
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,280
We are going to move out.

562
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,760
My wife is going to marry the crown prince?

563
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,800
Don't talk nonsense.

564
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,800
Who said I was going to marry him?

565
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,680
No.

566
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,000
How can I move out if I don't marry him?

567
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,480
As long as a woman has the ability,

568
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,840
she can go wherever she wants.

569
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,400
She can also support herself if she doesn't marry him.

570
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,160
But you,

571
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,720
do you want to marry him?

572
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,800
Of course not.

573
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
My wife said that

574
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,200
if a woman wants to see herself as a treasure,

575
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,640
she doesn't have to force men to love her.

576
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,320
I don't do small things.

577
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,360
No matter how good my wife and the crown prince are to me,

578
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,000
it won't work.

579
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,680
What are you thinking about?

580
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,200
The woman I'm talking about

581
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
is General Bai.

582
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,880
My wife is dead.

583
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,640
Let's go.

584
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,200
Why are you embarrassed?

585
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,880
Stop talking.

586
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,520
Madam,

587
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,160
the ninth lady is back.

588
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,280
I went out to inquire about it.

589
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,680
She has been following the order to investigate the case.

590
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,000
She is not in the Jinzhao mansion,

591
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,880
but in the courier house.

592
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,280
Everyone knows it.

593
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,880
She is a prostitute who is also following the order to investigate the case.

594
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,320
Don't compare her with my daughter in the future.

595
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,560
Don't worry, madam.

596
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,720
I have asked someone to record everything she touched.

597
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,040
When she goes out,

598
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,280
she will burn everything,

599
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,640
to save the bad luck.

600
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,600
Do it.

601
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,560
This way.

602
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,520
Be careful.

603
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,200
Why are you two standing at the door?

604
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,240
What are you doing?

605
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
What are you doing?

606
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
What do you think I'm doing?

607
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,920
I...

608
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,760
I think the woman's back is familiar.

609
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,520
It seems to be my wife.

610
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
I think so.

611
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
I think so.

612
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
I think so.

613
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
It seems to be my old friend.

614
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,360
I don't know where she is from.

615
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,800
Fengji House.

616
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,400
She has been a familiar servant of Zhao for more than a year.

617
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,120
She is raised here as an outsider.

618
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,280
Disgusting.

619
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,040
You men are all bad guys.

620
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,040
Zhao Jiaxue's wife trusts him so much.

621
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,400
She even raises an outsider.

622
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,320
She deserves to be pulled out.

623
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,280
So I either don't get married,

624
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,280
or I won't raise an outsider.

625
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,560
I can't let the outsider

626
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,760
take advantage of our family.

627
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,200
It sounds good.

628
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,760
It's not sure who will take advantage of who.

629
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,760
Let's go.

630
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,440
Why are you teasing me?

631
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,960
Tell the news to the head of the station.

632
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,240
I have confirmed with the princess.

633
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,040
The two murders in the capital

634
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,000
are similar to the Guanyin Town's murder case.

635
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
If we don't report to His Majesty

636
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,240
and send more people to kill them,

637
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,560
I'm afraid there will be more victims.

638
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,960
But His Majesty didn't want to make trouble in the capital.

639
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
He is panic.

640
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,280
If he blames us,

641
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,680
We have too few clues.

642
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,640
If we don't create some obstacles for the criminals,

643
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,320
I'm afraid we haven't caught the criminals' foot.

644
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,640
His Majesty will let you be the first to be killed.

645
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,680
Why don't we discuss this with Li Siqing?

646
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,760
His Majesty trusts him.

647
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,160
Zi'an also ordered him to check.

648
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,640
He will make a decision about the ban.

649
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,760
You make a quick report first.

650
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,800
I'll talk to you and Li Muyun.

651
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

652
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,320
Master.

653
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,960
Master, something happened.

654
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,280
What happened?

655
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,600
King of Rui reported that

656
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,920
the army of Shuoxi wanted to make a mistake.

657
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,640
He said that there was a moldy bone in the military food he sent.

658
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,680
The army of Shuoxi is about to be cut off.

659
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,280
His Majesty asked His Majesty to come back

660
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,560
and discuss the strategy of the army.

661
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,480
Brother Qi.

662
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,800
You're just in time.

663
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,840
His Majesty asked me to enter the palace.

664
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,720
I'll leave the security to you and Yue Ning.

665
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,480
Don't let him get angry.

666
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,520
Don't worry.

667
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,200
Ning and I will definitely be together.

668
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,680
It's not the time to blame the army for being corrupt.

669
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,760
It's the time to solve the military food.

670
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,760
But the tax this year hasn't been paid yet.

671
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,000
We can't miss the opportunity.

672
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,920
Then go borrow.

673
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,840
Where to borrow?

674
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,920
The fastest way.

675
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,960
New Sixth т Merchantoffish

676
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,780
Your Majesty,

677
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,880
Liangzhou is mostly the closest to Shuoxi.

678
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,200
Haixuan River

679
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,240
Shuoxi River

680
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,880
Fu Jing

681
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,440
Hu об�� tout

682
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,720
Remove the 1500mAn

683
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,080
The hemp of Nono B upstairs

684
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,080
As it is now

685
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
The Crown Prince has won over

686
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
the year.

687
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,720
The county of Rom reservoir

688
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,880
The county of Rom reservoir

689
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,200
You can't rely on others.

690
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,520
You must leave now.

691
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,000
Go on a fast horse.

692
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,000
Send the provisions to Shuo Xi.

693
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,680
Even the rest of the provisions

694
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,800
must be prepared by yourself.

695
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,760
To ensure the army will use them in winter.

696
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

697
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,040
How dare someone

698
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,080
make such a bold move?

699
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,560
It's obvious that

700
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,360
I'm too generous.

701
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,320
Xi, I order you to be the Supervisor.

702
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,160
You must find out the traitor.

703
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,120
Even if it's about the state affair,

704
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,400
you must not let him off.

705
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,040
You'd rather be beheaded

706
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,480
than let him off alone.

707
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

708
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,200
Zheng is so good at it.

709
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,360
He can't do anything.

710
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,880
He's been in Shuo Xi for a year.

711
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,720
But he still has no idea.

712
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,360
Useless!

713
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,400
The army is not like the court.

714
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,040
You can get promoted

715
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,600
by a test.

716
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
The Hong Kong army is a close friend.

717
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,440
How can he be out

718
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,080
with a newcomer?

719
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,560
This time, Shuo Xi's case

720
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,080
can help him to make a step forward.

721
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,720
It's also good for us to plan for a long time.

722
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,160
But His Majesty

723
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,840
asked Yan Chi to be the Supervisor.

724
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,920
I'm afraid that he'll clean up

725
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,520
our people

726
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,640
by investigating.

727
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,600
The money he spent

728
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,920
and the number of people he took

729
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,560
will be wasted.

730
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,320
Mother, you're thinking too much.

731
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,000
King of Rui and his son are never compatible.

732
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,560
Yan Chi can't be King of Rui's master.

733
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,600
When the time comes,

734
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,000
I'll find some scapegoats

735
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,200
and send them to King of Rui.

736
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,160
As long as King of Rui is determined,

737
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Yan Chi can only be left with nothing.

738
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,320
The Crown Prince is weak and incompetent.

739
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,480
He sent the food to the King of Rui.

740
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,080
Why did your father let him go?

741
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Why else?

742
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,720
He's just for the Crown Prince's reputation.

743
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,480
If you don't accept Zhao Shuhua,

744
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,760
the Crown Prince will be out of the palace.

745
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,080
You can't fool him in terms of the enemy and the court.

746
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,160
He's not a good man.

747
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,040
But in terms of power and power,

748
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,120
he's not Zhao Shuhua's son.

749
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,080
If King of Jin is dead,

750
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,080
who's the son of Zhao Shuhua?

751
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,200
Mother, just listen to me.

752
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,720
As long as father doesn't mention the Crown Prince,

753
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,520
we shouldn't make a fuss.

754
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,040
Marquis Zhongyong is an old fox.

755
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,960
Even if the Crown Prince is in the high position,

756
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,120
he won't have a good life.

757
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,800
If we can succeed the Crown Prince,

758
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,920
we can push the battle.

759
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
If Yan Che is really the one to sit on that chair,

760
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,960
as a prince of power and power,

761
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,680
won't I be more comfortable than that bastard?

762
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,800
No way.

763
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,840
I can't accept Zhao Shuhua

764
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,600
as a man of power and power.

765
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,120
I entered the palace with him on the same day

766
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,440
and married His Majesty on the same day.

767
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,160
Just because he's a man of power,

768
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,680
I was promoted to the empress at the age of two.

769
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Why?

770
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,520
Until the last moment,

771
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,320
no one wants me to admit defeat.

772
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,880
Why have you come to the respectively?

773
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,960
You're not upset.

774
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,360
All will be alright.

775
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,120
Most important is,

776
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,240
the Crown Prince is here soon.

777
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,760
Chen Jinzhen.

778
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,600
Hard work.

779
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,360
ㅎㅎ

780
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,840
Boy,

781
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,640
you should learn from this.

782
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,640
If Second motive didn't arrive,

783
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,320
a man dies.

784
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,640
how long it will take.

785
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,360
Thank you, Mother.

786
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,040
Don't worry, Mother.

787
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,240
I'll take over

788
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,920
the military power of the Shuoxi Army.

789
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,680
I'll make Zhao Shuhua

790
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,000
bow to you.

791
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,520
Yanli

792
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,280
You haven't slept for another night.

793
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,760
I heard about the military power case from Ni'er.

794
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,400
Do you need me to do something?

795
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,800
No need.

796
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,280
It's all a trick of the villains.

797
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,320
I don't need you to do it.

798
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,760
But I can't be with you

799
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,320
for the next few days.

800
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,160
Just tell Yanli to do something.

801
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,480
Yanli

802
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,640
Your Highness.

803
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,080
What's going on?

804
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,160
It's worth it

805
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,040
if you don't marry me.

806
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,680
Since you knew

807
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,240
I'd give the horse to Ning,

808
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,640
you've been planning to give me a more precious horse.

809
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,680
So I...

810
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,360
Well...

811
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,720
I planned to give you a horse

812
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,440
long ago.

813
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,760
It's not convenient

814
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,200
to borrow it when you're leaving the mansion.

815
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,000
It's not convenient to ride a horse

816
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,120
when it's sunny.

817
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,360
So...

818
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,920
The horse is small,

819
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,440
but it's made of iron.

820
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,560
It can't be worn

821
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,880
without burning and sharpening.

822
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,600
How can a horse have these functions?

823
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,240
Come on.

824
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,920
Xiaowan.

825
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,000
Let me introduce you.

826
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,920
Look.

827
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,520
All these boxes

828
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,040
are independent medicine boxes.

829
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,840
And your beloved five-scented incense

830
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,080
can be put in this dark room.

831
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,080
And this small table with the activity.

832
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,920
There are tea, snacks, and

833
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,360
fish, fish, and dogs.

834
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,200
There's a set of zither

835
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,520
for your little anger.

836
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,200
No need to thank me.

837
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,960
If you really can't get over it,

838
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,040
just

839
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,280
embroider a small box for me.

840
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,160
But I can't be a maid.

841
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,920
You can't even embroider a box?

842
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,320
So what?

843
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,240
I can't do it either.

844
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,400
That's good.

845
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,960
Only those women

846
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,680
who have never seen the world

847
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
can do this.

848
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,480
Real heroes

849
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,760
can't think about

850
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,240
these trivial things.

851
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,760
Yes.

852
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
I think so, too.

853
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,760
Anyway,

854
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,960
I'll give you

855
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,760
what I made myself.

856
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,560
Yes.

857
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,840
I was going to do that at first.

858
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,440
They're a perfect match.

859
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,440
My brother Qi finally opened a gun.

860
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,080
Go ahead and do your work.

861
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,040
I'll go to the Dali Temple later

862
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,160
to see the case of Guan Yinzhen.

863
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,400
And

864
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,600
see the report before the trial.

865
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,040
It's not easy to meet Li Muyun.

866
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
How about waiting for me for a few more days?

867
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,680
The government will also go with me.

868
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,320
Don't worry.

869
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,960
I'll be careful

870
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,280
and be careful.

871
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,960
As long as you're comfortable.

872
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,360
I've already packed up

873
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
the house.

874
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,840
I'll go to see you after I'm done.

875
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,880
Little Ni Ni.

876
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,480
Qi looks tired.

877
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,280
It seems that Brother Cheng's family is not bad.

878
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,640
You can marry him.

879
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,600
Why are you telling me?

880
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,600
I'm not telling you.

881
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,600
Why are you so anxious?

882
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,640
I'm so happy to see you all.

883
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
We're here already.

884
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,520
Come in.

885
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,000
Princess.

886
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,480
Yeah?

887
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,560
Yes.

888
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,560
How could he?

889
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,920
What are you talking about?

890
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,920
Princess.

891
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,760
Who are you?

892
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,600
they would end up breaking up.

893
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,040
They wouldn't forget each other.

894
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,920
Do you understand?

895
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,920
Sister!

896
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,160
My son is here at last.

897
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
Take a saddle.

898
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,840
bribe master

899
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,280
Must come back when the tour ends

900
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,080
Find father and King Ji's head of the army as soon as possible

901
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
Ye~?

902
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,580
Choi 실험

903
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,680
Why isn't this Restaurant Song here?

904
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,800
Where could it be?

905
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,640
Go off, it doesn't matter.

906
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,760
Bask in the days when I don't have to

907
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,000
Peel it on the side and spread it out.

908
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,100
I'll do it.

909
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,900
Cai裝

910
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,560
Staff

911
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,640
Not good.

912
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,160
Tower

913
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,700
Have another try, and don't change it.

914
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,200
That's right.

915
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,600
Your Highness is our best friend,

916
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,480
we'll go with you.

917
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,960
Why don't we think it over

918
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,280
instead of just against Yu'er?

919
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,520
How about we find Wu Road

920
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,500
and leave the case

921
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,900
to Concubine física and Prince Luo?

922
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,000
If Your Highness wants to get rid of them,

923
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,120
the Prime Minister

924
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,480
would be excellent

925
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,380
to see if it depends on all your great Media Group.

926
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,080
Wei Bi,

927
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,160
Tamuung Khopag��도

928
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,780
is the only person

929
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,120
at the front line of the case already.

930
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,160
Besides it's just I'm at the front line of the investigation,

931
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,440
The case is coming again.

932
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,200
I'm really afraid that this board can't escape.

933
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,440
Li Buyuan is here.

934
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,320
You can ask Xiaowan how long it will take.

935
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,920
Even if we find some suspects,

936
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,320
we can get through it.

937
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
Xiaowan, can I have some tea?

938
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,440
Half a cup of tea is enough.

939
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,080
Half a cup of tea for Yan Chi.

940
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,160
Yan Chi

941
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,320
Where are you going?

942
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,840
I don't know where the Crown Prince is.

943
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,840
Please forgive me for being rude.

944
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,760
It's easy to say.

945
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,360
Sorry to trouble you.

946
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,240
It's okay.

947
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,680
But it's too boring here.

948
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,720
There's no place to have tea and rest.

949
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,800
I can only sit here and do nothing.

950
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,440
Dali Temple is a law-abiding place.

951
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,520
It's not for the common people.

952
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,000
If you are not satisfied,

953
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,840
you can report to His Majesty.

954
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,000
You...

955
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,080
Oh no.

956
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,160
I forgot to count to a few.

957
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,120
Is it half a cup of tea?

958
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,040
Xiaowan, be quick.

959
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,600
I can't hold it anymore.

960
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,440
I have a task to do.

961
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,960
If you don't have any orders,

962
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,920
please let me go first.

963
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,920
I haven't finished yet.

964
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,520
What?

965
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,480
You...

966
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,840
What happened, Minister Li?

967
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
I don't know.

968
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,480
He insisted on pushing me.

969
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
Minister Li,

970
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,240
why are you so angry with Princess Yongning?

971
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm afraid that she broke into the warehouse

972
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,920
and was criticized.

973
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,280
So I asked Mrs. Zheng to send me a letter.

974
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,960
But I don't know why she stopped me.

975
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,640
I was afraid of being disturbed.

976
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,560
So Princess Yongning was watching for me.

977
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,440
I see.

978
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,880
I was too impulsive.

979
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,880
I'll send the letter to the prison.

980
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,640
Minister Li, please wait.

981
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,200
I have another thing to ask.

982
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,200
Please go ahead.

983
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,920
The evidence of Zhang Dongxuan's witness

984
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,040
in the murder case of Guan Yinzhen

985
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,160
can only prove that he had contacted the victim.

986
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,880
He didn't witness his murder

987
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,280
or prove that he was there.

988
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,800
I've also found out yesterday

989
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,560
that Zhang Dongxuan had a blood test.

990
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,920
He can't be the murderer of Guan Yinzhen.

991
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,680
Minister Li, Mrs. Zheng,

992
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,800
do you agree to start the trial without him?

993
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,720
No one can solve Princess Yongci's medical skills.

994
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,520
I'll start the trial

995
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,880
as soon as possible.

996
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,960
Besides,

997
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,520
Shen Yi has listed the case as a one-off case.

998
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,800
Why is there no clue

999
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,920
that Shen Yi has put in the case?

1000
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,480
I was careless.

1001
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,440
I'll get someone to investigate it.

1002
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,080
Please do it, Minister Li.

1003
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,360
If Shen Yi can help us with the clue,

1004
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,120
maybe we can avoid the case

1005
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,840
of Guan Yinzhen being brought back to the capital.

1006
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,280
You're right.

1007
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,480
I'll do my best.

1008
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,640
I don't know that.

1009
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,880
It's hard to press on her.

1010
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,240
What is wrong?

1011
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,160
It's our misdemeanor to cut ties with government officials.

1012
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,160
Princess.

1013
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,800
Minister Zheng,

1014
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,000
the murder case has swerved on Anlu오-bation's West Chief Guard Pavilion.

1015
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,040
God,

1016
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,720
that can't be for this trial.

1017
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,120
not for Shen Yi?

1018
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,280
Isn't she Shen Wan?

1019
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,440
So it's for Jinbao.

1020
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,120
I'm not afraid of death.

1021
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,320
I'm not afraid of death.

1022
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,520
I'm not afraid of death.

1023
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,720
I'm not afraid of death.

1024
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,320
I'm not afraid of death.

1025
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,920
I'm not afraid of death.

1026
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,520
I'm not afraid of death.

1027
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,120
I'm not afraid of death.

1028
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,720
I'm not afraid of death.

1029
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,320
I'm not afraid of death.

1030
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,920
I'm not afraid of death.

1031
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,520
I'm not afraid of death.

1032
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,120
I'm not afraid of death.

1033
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,720
I'm not afraid of death.

1034
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,320
I'm not afraid of death.

1035
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,920
I'm not afraid of death.

1036
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,520
I'm not afraid of death.

1037
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,120
I'm not afraid of death.

1038
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,720
I'm not afraid of death.

1039
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,320
I'm not afraid of death.

1040
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,920
I'm not afraid of death.

1041
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,520
I'm not afraid of death.

1042
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,120
I'm not afraid of death.

1043
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,720
I'm not afraid of death.

1044
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,320
I'm not afraid of death.

1045
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,920
I'm not afraid of death.

1046
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,520
I'm not afraid of death.

1047
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,120
I'm not afraid of death.

1048
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,720
I'm not afraid of death.

1049
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,320
I'm not afraid of death.

1050
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,920
I'm not afraid of death.

1051
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,520
I'm not afraid of death.

1052
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,120
