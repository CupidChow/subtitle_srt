00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 24]

3
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,990
You, the Princess of Beidai,

4
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,770
slaughtered Imperial Guards for no reason.

5
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,419
Aren't you afraid
of His Majesty's punishment?

6
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,900
Would His Majesty really punish me

7
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,960
for the deaths of two lowly soldiers?

8
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,560
Ridiculous.

9
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,930
Besides,

10
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,900
if you die today,

11
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,020
no one will know I killed them.

12
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,579
You lured me here

13
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,790
just to kill me?

14
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,420
You're insane!

15
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,960
Didn't see

16
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,790
this coming
when you used all means to seduce

17
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,620
Young Commander Yan back then, huh?

18
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,740
Now,

19
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,579
I'm going to make you pay with your life

20
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,760
for all the shame

21
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,370
and neglect I've suffered

22
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,250
because of you.

23
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,770
Imagine how Yanchi

24
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,980
will treat you if you kill me.

25
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,050
You can't

26
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,980
intimidate me!

27
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,880
Your Highness!

28
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,750
Go after her!

29
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,180
Split up and get her!

30
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,810
Yes.

31
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,320
I don't care if she's alive or dead.

32
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,670
Bring that bitch to me!

33
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,460
-Yes.
-Yes.

34
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

35
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,980
You've come at the right time.

36
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,770
Has the Crown Prince

37
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,579
set off with the princes and princesses
from both countries?

38
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,410
They left more than two hours ago.

39
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,530
I wanted the Crown Prince

40
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,940
to smooth things over after you refused
to marry the Princess of Beidai,

41
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,880
but surprisingly,

42
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,170
he suggested going to enjoy the view
of plum blossoms at Southern Court.

43
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,900
I wonder if they've got

44
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,850
everything ready for their trip.

45
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,020
Sorry for causing you trouble,
Your Majesty.

46
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,310
So you know it.

47
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,140
Your public rejection of the marriage

48
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,820
nearly destroyed

49
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,650
your father's years of careful diplomacy
in the northwest.

50
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,760
If they're angry about this,

51
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,920
I don't mind leading troops
to take down Beidai and Xihan again.

52
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,030
Reckless words.

53
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,290
For this journey,

54
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,830
have we assigned additional guards?

55
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,350
I planned so,

56
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,270
but the Crown Prince said

57
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,090
they were only going to enjoy the scenery,

58
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,410
and with a peaceful mind,
there wouldn't be any danger.

59
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,940
So he rejected my proposal.

60
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,580
When I was still a Crown Prince,

61
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,390
I was cautious in everything.

62
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,950
If given a mission,

63
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,360
I would consider every detail

64
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,970
in case of any oversight

65
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,470
that might fail the duties
expected of the Crown Prince.

66
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,900
But Yan Che takes his role
as Crown Prince rather lightly.

67
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,770
Chi,

68
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,850
come.

69
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,580
Seven days later,

70
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,870
I

71
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,350
will go hunting
with those princes from the two states.

72
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,620
Do you know why I've entrusted

73
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,659
all security matters to you?

74
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,810
Zhou shares borders
with both Beidai and Xihan.

76
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,260
If anything happens

77
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,500
to their princes in our territory,

78
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,940
someone might take this chance

79
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,060
to stir up trouble.

80
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,700
So we must make sure nothing goes wrong

81
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,060
with the security for this hunt

82
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,390
and minimize the risks.

83
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,580
I've ordered to investigate

84
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,620
all staff coming with the envoys
from the two states

85
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,090
and set up security

86
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,580
within a hundred-li radius
around the hunting grounds

87
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,850
to avoid any unauthorized visitors.

88
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,650
If the Crown Prince

89
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,620
were half as vigilant as you,

90
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,740
I would

91
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,920
have much less to worry about.

92
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,530
But you've been keeping something from me.

93
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,110
Why?

94
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,650
Split up and search.

95
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,260
Yes.

96
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,500
Not until I read

97
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,700
the Yuzhou prefect's report did I learn

98
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,870
that the gold heist case was solved

99
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,490
with Miss Qin Wan's contribution.

100
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,070
Actually, that's not all.

101
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,970
The case of Qin An from Jingzhou,

102
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,650
the murder case of Song Rou,
daughter of the Duke of Song,

103
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,820
and the recent case
of the tailor assaulting a female resident

104
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,940
in the capital,
which the Crown Prince supervised,

105
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,600
were all solved
thanks to Miss Qin's expertise.

106
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,730
I didn't expect Miss Qin's forensic skills

107
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,410
to be this incredible.

108
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,530
Since Shen Yi...

109
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,620
The Ministry of Justice
and the Court of Judicial Review

110
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,080
have had no more experts
skilled in autopsy.

111
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,320
As the saying goes,

112
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,730
talented people are one in ten thousand,

113
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,530
and one such person
can outweigh all treasures in the world.

114
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,050
But she's a woman.

115
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,730
What a pity.

116
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,730
If she's given

117
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,390
an important position,

118
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,460
some censors might accuse her
of disrupting court affairs, I'm afraid.

119
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,270
Not only might it
cause instability in the court,

120
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,930
but she would also have to endure
numerous rumors and slander

121
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,730
that might humiliate her

122
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,870
for the rest of her life.

123
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,290
I'm fed up with these clichÃ©s.

124
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,260
Why should women

125
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,900
be confined to their homes
to raise children only?

126
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,650
Why can't they make their mark
and build their careers?

127
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,650
I think some people are just jealous

128
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,850
and afraid that talented women
might outshine them,

129
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,310
so they came up
with these absurd arguments.

130
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,020
That speech of yours

131
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,700
is rather surprising.

132
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,730
It seems

133
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,530
that you're quite concerned
about Miss Qin Wan.

134
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,770
Do you have

135
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,530
some feelings for her?

136
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,380
This has nothing to do
with personal feelings.

137
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,909
I'm talking about justice.

138
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,940
Your Majesty,

139
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,620
as they say, old conventions stop

140
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,049
real genius from shining.

141
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,530
I hope you can put talent
above everything else

142
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,620
and give Miss Qin Wan a chance
to demonstrate her abilities

143
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,950
for the imperial court.

144
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,180
If you agree,

145
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,810
I can continue to employ her

146
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,290
as a secret strategist

147
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,050
to work for the Ministry of Justice.

148
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,250
A secret strategist?

149
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,750
Isn't that somewhat unfair to her?

150
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,950
From what I know of Miss Qin Wan,

151
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,380
she is only passionate
about medicine and forensics

152
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,290
and cares nothing for fame or fortune.

153
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,900
You're granting her biggest wish

154
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,630
if you allow her to practice it.

155
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,650
Then let it be as you suggest.

156
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,930
Let her serve as your strategist for now,

157
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,980
and when the time is right,

158
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,900
I will give her

159
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,050
a proper position.

160
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,290
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for granting me this sidekick.

161
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,860
I have always rewarded based on merit.

162
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,140
Quite fair.

163
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,450
Your Majesty,

164
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,440
the Southern Court guards
have returned with news

165
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,970
that Beidai's Crown Prince
has gone missing.

166
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,140
What?

167
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,560
How could such an absurd thing happen?

168
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,690
What is our Crown Prince doing?

169
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,740
What is Prince Cheng doing?

170
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,620
Our Crown Prince is leading
guards from both states

171
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,600
in search of him.

172
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,700
But it's getting dark.

173
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,650
If we don't increase our search forces,

174
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,340
spending the night in the wilderness

175
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,290
could endanger
the Beidai Crown Prince's life.

176
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,370
Chi, heed my order.

177
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,100
Yes.

178
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Take a team and search
the Southern Court right away.

179
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,050
You must find the Beidai Crown Prince.

180
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,020
You have one night

181
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,910
to find him

182
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,260
or his body!

183
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

184
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,380
This is truly

185
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,380
what I feared most

186
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,550
coming to pass.

187
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,770
It was you.

188
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,260
You must have secretly harmed
my Crown Prince Brother.

189
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,060
Stop making false accusations.

190
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,290
Today, my guards saw you

191
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,690
sneakily following my brother.

192
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,500
We happened to take the same path.

193
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,700
This bamboo grove in the Southern Court

194
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,940
doesn't belong to your Beidai.

195
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,080
If you can go there,

196
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,980
why can't I?

197
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,650
Stop!

198
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,180
You guys...

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,020
Do you think
that my brother's disappearance

200
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,100
can give your Xihan a chance to get

201
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,490
Zhou's Princess Zhen? Dream on!

202
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,530
As long as I'm here,

203
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,590
you won't succeed!

204
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,810
Commander Yan, my Crown Prince Brother
is Beidai's great warrior

205
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,020
who is battle-hardened with great prowess.

206
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,570
Someone must've set a trap secretly,

207
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,570
or how could he disappear
without a trace, his fate unknown?

208
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,030
Please, we need the truth.

209
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,970
-Chi.
-Chi.

210
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
We've searched everywhere

211
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,140
and found no one in the vicinity.

212
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,300
Does Crown Prince Yuan Hong
have any bodyguards with him?

213
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,770
I am Xu Chang.

214
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,770
I'm responsible
for the Crown Prince's safety.

215
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,380
The Crown Prince

216
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,530
was hunting a silver fox
for Princess Yan Zhen.

217
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,900
He found me annoying as I tried
to stop him from continuing the hunt,

218
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,590
so he sent me away.

219
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,550
This disaster has occurred

220
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,080
due to my negligence.

221
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,530
I deserve punishment.

222
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,410
Rest assured,

223
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,500
it's not a mere guard like you
who should be punished,

224
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,930
but the one responsible for protecting
the princes of both statesâ

225
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,100
Zhou's Crown Prince.

226
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,900
What does this have to do with me?

227
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,280
Chi,

228
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,410
where are the additional guards

229
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,940
supposed to be dispatched?

230
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,380
Prince Yi's heir, Yan Li,

231
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,630
follow me into the mountain

232
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,380
and lead the guards to look for
Crown Prince Yuan Hong.

233
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,020
His Majesty has ordered us
to find him or his body

234
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,620
within one night.

235
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,450
Understood.

236
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,250
I'm going too.

237
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,970
Me too.

238
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,900
Prince Yuan Rui, General Chang,

239
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,630
please wait in the plum forest.

240
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,930
Have one of Crown Prince Yuan Hong's

241
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,410
bodyguards lead the way.

242
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,790
Let's go.

243
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,820
Chi,

244
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,140
I haven't found anything on my side.

245
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,810
Master.

246
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,980
Master!

247
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,160
Miss Qin and two Imperial Guards

248
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,340
left the palace with Yuan Wu's maid

249
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,800
and haven't returned yet.

250
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,950
How dare she

251
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,080
lay a hand on Little Wan'er?

252
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,210
Does she want to die?

253
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,160
Chi,

254
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,220
Ning and I will go find Miss Qin Wan.

255
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,140
You continue searching
for Beidai's Crown Prince.

256
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,020
Wan never waits for doom
without doing anything.

257
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,140
You don't know her well

258
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,740
and might neglect
her means of saving herself.

259
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,220
Changfeng?

260
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,390
This is our Crown Prince's horse,
Changfeng.

261
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,450
It's wounded.

262
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,670
Commander Yan,

263
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,220
in no case would Changfeng
abandon its master

264
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,290
and escape alone.

265
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,980
His Highness must be in danger!

266
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,930
Please save our Crown Prince.

267
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,870
Chi,

268
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,690
what is this?

269
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,340
This is a gorgon leaf.

270
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,570
Gorgon plants grow in ponds and swamps.

271
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,900
This indicates that Changfeng

272
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,570
must've struggled
in a cluster of gorgon plants.

273
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,900
Horses are sharp and smart.

274
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,100
They're the best at sensing danger.

275
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,220
Changfeng risked entering
the gorgon plant cluster

276
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,740
definitely to save Yuan Hong.

277
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,200
Map of the Southern Court.

278
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,410
Here.

279
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,380
And here.

280
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,900
And this area.

281
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
These are all the ponds and swamps
near the Southern Court.

282
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,140
Check paths that are only wide enough

283
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,860
for a single horse to pass through.

284
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,410
If you find scrapes on the cliffside,

285
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,500
that's the right track.

286
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,260
Understood.

287
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,340
Don't worry, Chi.

288
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,380
Whether he's breathing or not,

289
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,290
we will definitely
bring Crown Prince Yuan Hong back.

290
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,140
Chi,

291
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,570
I'll go with you to find Little Wan'er.

292
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,380
You stay here.

293
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,130
If Yuan Wu comes back,

294
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,170
ground her here.

295
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,360
Okay.

296
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,050
I absolutely won't let her go.

297
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:27,980
Let's go.

298
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,780
Keep searching over there!

299
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,500
Get her!

300
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,530
Yan Chi,

301
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,570
I believe

302
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,240
you will find me.

303
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,570
We're near the swamp.

304
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,050
Everyone, search carefully!

305
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,720
Yes, sir.

306
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,330
Swamps are treacherous.

307
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,800
If Yuan Hong really fell into a swamp,

308
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,930
I'm afraid he wouldn't have survived.

309
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,930
Unless out of desperation,

310
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,330
who would hide in a swamp?

311
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,930
Someone must've set a trap
in secret and chosen

312
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,339
to kill Yuan Hong when our Crown Prince
was handling security.

313
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,099
Not sure
if they only meant to harm those two,

314
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,060
or if they wanted

315
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,780
to spark another war
between Zhou and Beidai,

316
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,010
killing two birds with one stone.

317
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,730
Whatever this person's purpose is,

318
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,540
harming Yuan Hong
would implicate the Crown Prince.

319
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,579
What's the difference?

320
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,930
That makes a huge difference.

321
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,300
If they went after our Crown Prince only,

322
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,540
it'd be someone from Zhou

323
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,180
who covets the throne.

324
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,210
If they schemed

325
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,010
to reignite a war between Zhou and Beidai,

326
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,010
then it was most likely done
by people from Xihan.

327
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,340
But if they tried to hit three targets

328
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,940
by dragging Xihan into this,

329
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,460
then this person must be

330
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,040
unbelievably ambitious.

331
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,300
Changfeng.

332
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,710
Why did you stop?

333
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,010
Changfeng.

334
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:45,830
Changfeng!

335
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,700
Follow them!

336
00:17:59,340 --> 00:17:59,940
Over here!

337
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,640
Hurry and save him!

338
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,450
Yes!

339
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,050
You're awake.

340
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,170
Come on.

341
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,860
Try this wild onion soup to warm you up.

342
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,980
Seeing you faint earlier

343
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,630
almost gave me a heart attack.

344
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,010
Thankfully, you saved me

345
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,960
from danger with your wisdom.

346
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,960
âª Your smile âª

347
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,710
âª Warmed up every snowy night âª

348
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,690
Come on.

349
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,210
âª Softened each ray of light âª

350
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,740
âª And plucked my heartstrings âª

351
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,490
âª We spent autumn days together âª

352
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,100
Weren't you afraid I couldn't find you?

353
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,240
âª Leaves scattered in the breeze âª

354
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,540
I never thought you'd fail to find me.

355
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,600
âª Disturbed the quiet lake âª

356
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,060
But I was afraid I wouldn't find you,

357
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,850
âª And finally landed on my heart âª

358
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
and even more afraid that when I did,

359
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,590
it would be too late.

360
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,300
âª Having walked alone through
wind and rain for years âª

361
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,490
âª Never having encountered this love âª

362
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,450
âª Until you came to my world âª

363
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,710
âª And wrote our destined bond âª

364
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,960
âª The sunshine you gave me âª

365
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,840
âª Painted pictures of the future âª

366
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,500
âª Only when I drew near to you
did I realize âª

367
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:09,850
Oh, right.

368
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,080
The straw shoes.

369
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,110
âª This love was already deep and endless âª

370
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,250
See if they fit you.

371
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,900
Perfect.

372
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,490
Come on.

373
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,010
Didn't expect you

374
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,430
to know how to make these.

375
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,460
For countless battles in the wild,

376
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,860
it's an essential skill.

377
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,000
This one's not finished yet.

378
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,910
Come on.

379
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,670
Report!

380
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,340
Your Highness,

381
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,490
Crown Prince Yuan Hong has been found,

382
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,410
but with severe injuries.

383
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,780
Escort Miss Qin back home first.

384
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,900
I'll be right there.

385
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,030
Yes, Your Highness.

386
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,820
Severe injuries?

387
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,170
I'll go with you too.

388
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,100
But your legs...

389
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,030
Don't worry.

390
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,100
I'm fine now.

391
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
And I have you.

392
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,170
Beidai's Crown Prince
was gravely injured in our territory.

393
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,370
How could I just stand by and do nothing?

394
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,420
Okay.

395
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,780
My Crown Prince Brother
hasn't been found yet.

396
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,250
Why aren't you out searching for him?

397
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,730
Are you deliberately wasting time

398
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,930
to let my brother die?

399
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,280
Tell your Crown Prince

400
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,800
that if my brother doesn't return alive,

401
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,490
I will report it to my father

402
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,930
and lead troops south

403
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,250
to crush your Zhou!

404
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,100
Very well!

405
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,170
Our Shuoxi Army will be waiting for you.

406
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:51,860
How are you...

407
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,100
How am I still alive?

408
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,340
You should be grateful that I am.

409
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,650
I'll kill you!

410
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,790
Young Marshal,

411
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,820
my sister is losing it

412
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,250
due to our brother's disappearance.

413
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,170
Please don't take offense.

414
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,010
If my brother doesn't come back alive,

415
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,170
I'll fight you to the death!

416
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,170
No need for that.

417
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,520
Let's focus on saving his life.

418
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,300
Brother!

419
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,900
Brother!

420
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,820
Brother!

421
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,140
Brother!

422
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,900
Careful!

423
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,310
Keep crushing him like that,
and he really will die.

424
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,210
Miss Qin, please save him.

425
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,580
The wound
on Crown Prince Yuan Hong's chest

426
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,060
was caused by an arrow.

427
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,730
The arrow shaft was cut off,

428
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,780
yet the arrowhead remains inside his body.

429
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,450
To treat Crown Prince Yuan Hong's wound,

430
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,340
the first step

431
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,290
is to remove the arrowhead.

432
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,860
Crown Prince Yuan Hong
has already lost too much blood

433
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,190
and cannot take more.

434
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,760
Even if it had been treated
right after the injury,

435
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,150
no one would dare to cut open his chest

436
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,060
to remove the arrowhead.

437
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,460
You good-for-nothings.

438
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,380
If you can't save
Crown Prince Yuan Hong's life,

439
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,460
you can only apologize to my father
by killing yourselves!

440
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,130
Get lost.

441
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,520
Even if Yuan Hong really dies here,

442
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,060
it will take time for the news
to reach his state.

443
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,620
We might as well mobilize
the Shuoxi Army in advance

444
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,550
to guard against Beidai's attack.

445
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,470
The war clouds are gathering.

446
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,620
Brother,

447
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,700
what's the use of being scared?

448
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,450
Is there anything else on your mind
besides fighting and killing?

449
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,510
But this incident

450
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,780
was caused by your negligence.

451
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,250
I'm just worried about

452
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,820
the grave consequences
if Yuan Hong truly cannot recover

453
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,150
from his severe wounds.

454
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,710
We might as well plan ahead

455
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,730
to prevent Zhou
from falling into a disadvantage.

456
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,730
Brother,

457
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,770
you've misunderstood my good intentions.

458
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,030
Miss Qin,

459
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,490
we've fed him the anesthetic
and life-preserving decoction.

460
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,410
Get ready to extract

461
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,300
the arrowhead in a while.

462
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,860
Yes.

463
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,820
Crown Prince Yuan Hong
has taken the medicine.

464
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,020
We'll remove the arrow
once the anesthetic takes effect.

465
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,780
This is animal bait I found in his hair.

466
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,860
For this outing at the Southern Court,

467
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,010
the surrounding areas had been cleaned up.

468
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,490
How could any hunter sneak in
to spread baits?

469
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,850
This bait was found close to his scalp.

470
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,760
It couldn't have gotten there by accident.

471
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,630
Looks more like

472
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,580
someone rubbed this bait
into his hair,

473
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,250
so it remained there until just now.

474
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,250
Someone wanted wild animals
to feed on him to destroy the evidence.

475
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,860
This is clearly premeditated murder.

476
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,900
How vicious.

477
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,140
But there's one thing
I still don't understand.

478
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,060
Weren't you all
appreciating flowers together?

479
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,990
How did Crown Prince Yuan Hong
end up in danger alone?

480
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,370
All because of that snow fox
offered by Xihan.

481
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,750
Princess, look.

482
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,880
Is it too warm?

483
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,400
It ran away!

484
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,350
It is a heartless beast after all.

485
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,710
I'll catch it for you, Princess,

486
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,910
and teach it a lesson.

487
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,090
Get me a horse!

488
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,060
Be careful, Brother!

489
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,780
The snow fox ran wild?

490
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,650
W-What's wrong?

491
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,840
It stinks?

492
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,900
I only held it for a moment!

493
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,280
Did it defecate on me?

494
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,300
Now I see.

495
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,340
Crown Prince Yuan Hong
chased after the snow fox,

496
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,930
unwittingly giving the assailant
a chance to strike.

497
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,970
After severely wounding
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,

498
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,140
the attacker then used animal bait

499
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,800
to attract wild beasts
to destroy the evidence.

500
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,120
Someone capable of such a vicious scheme

501
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,410
certainly won't stop here.

502
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,060
As long as Yuan Hong is alive,

503
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,790
he remains in constant danger.

504
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,450
Only by catching the real culprit

505
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,010
can his safety be secured

506
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,810
and the border remain peaceful.

507
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,210
Leave this matter to us.

508
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,070
Just focus on treating Yuan Hong.

509
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,500
I'll go check on him.

510
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:38,820
Yue Ning,

511
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,870
keep a close eye on Yuan Wu.

512
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,960
Bai Feng,

513
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,210
guard this place.

514
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,890
I...

515
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,540
Yan Li,

516
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,820
take me to where you found Yuan Hong.

517
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:47,690
Okay.

518
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,800
This is where we found him.

519
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,240
Let's go check it out.

520
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,290
Apply acupuncture

521
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,540
to stop the bleeding.

522
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,820
Chi,

523
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,010
look at the hoof prints here.

524
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:42,930
Yan Li.

525
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,560
Horse-tripping rope.

526
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,740
Sure enough, someone intended to kill
Crown Prince Yuan Hong.

527
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,860
Do you have any suspects in mind?

528
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,450
Based on our investigation of the envoy,

529
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,250
I already have a suspect in mind.

530
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,230
However,

531
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,920
without sufficient evidence,

532
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,780
accusing anyone could be

533
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,310
seen as false allegations.

534
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,650
No matter who the assassin is,

535
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,910
this incident occurred in our territory

536
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,820
and involves our diplomatic relations,

537
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,620
so we must proceed with caution.

538
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,290
But any further delay

539
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,970
can endanger Crown Prince Yuan Hong.

540
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,410
I...

541
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,420
I have a plan

542
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,510
to catch the culprit in the act.

543
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,600
Hope you can approve, Your Highness.

544
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,650
Don't cause
any unnecessary harm to anyone.

545
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,170
Just tell me, yes or no!

546
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,820
What a hassle.

547
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,100
What medicine is Little Wan'er decocting?

548
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,410
Smells spicy and foul.

549
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,340
She called it fumigation,
which could bring down

550
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,540
the high fever first.

551
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,950
Then it all depends on
that bowl of medicine to save his life.

552
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,490
Never thought
that a dignified general of Beidai

553
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,570
would do something so underhanded.

554
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,070
Suicidal attempt?

555
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,380
No way since I'm here.

556
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,770
Your Majesty,

557
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,450
Xu Chang used Poison Arrow Wood,

558
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,250
highly toxic,

559
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,730
typically applied
to arrowheads for hunting.

560
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,010
Once ingested by a man, it'll cause

561
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,450
the intestines to turn black
and stick together.

562
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,380
Constant abdominal pain will kill the man.

563
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,410
Xu Chang,

564
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,670
you're accused of poisoning and murdering
Crown Prince Yuan Hong

565
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,620
with both witnesses and evidence.

566
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,150
What else do you have to say?

567
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,420
You were also behind the snow fox's
frightened escape, weren't you?

568
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,340
What are you doing?

569
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,820
You rubbed the wolverine's scent

570
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,880
on Princess Yongning deliberately.

571
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,340
Wolverines love hunting young foxes.

572
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,010
Is it too warm?

573
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,780
You used this scent
to drive the snow fox mad

574
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,450
in order

575
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,970
to lure your Crown Prince out,

576
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,630
so you could assassinate him.

577
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,170
Xu Chang,

578
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,730
it's said you're defiant
and have plenty of enemies.

579
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,110
You got where you are now

580
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,210
all thanks to
Crown Prince Yuan Hong's support.

581
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,610
Would you like to explain

582
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,580
why you tried to murder him?

583
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,210
Tell me

584
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,420
who on earth ordered you to do this!

585
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,730
Brother!

586
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,780
Are you alright now?

587
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,260
Brother,

588
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,270
how do you feel?

589
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,489
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,

590
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,570
no need for formalities.

591
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,489
It's okay.

592
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,020
General Xu,

593
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,340
when you shot that arrow at me,
I really wanted to ask you

594
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,050
why you tried to harm me.

595
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,699
That shot failed,

596
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,969
and you even tried to poison my medicine.

597
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,739
Xu Chang,

598
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,610
I've treated you so well, haven't I?

599
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:41,880
I

600
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,300
deserve to die for my crimes.

601
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,780
I

602
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,159
have nothing to say in my defense.

603
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,190
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,

604
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,960
I have confirmed intelligence.

605
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,739
Before he received your support,

606
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,790
Xu Chang

607
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,090
had already been bankrolled by someone
of high position and power.

608
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,090
And if this person
were to become the Crown Prince,

609
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,010
he could earn the merit
of backing the future emperor.

610
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,090
Am I right,

611
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,790
Prince Yuan Rui?

612
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,860
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

613
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,220
To cover up your crime,

614
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,640
you scattered animal bait

615
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,570
on the dying Crown Prince Yuan Hong

616
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,030
just to attract wild beasts to devour him.

617
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,780
Yuan Rui,

618
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,090
was it really you?

619
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,450
Rui,

620
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,830
say something.

621
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,880
Explain yourself.

622
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,570
Do you hear me?

623
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,180
Rui,

624
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,220
say something!

625
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,220
Why?

626
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,610
Why did you do this?

627
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,140
To become the Crown Prince!

628
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,560
Were it not for your incapability

629
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,260
to handle Yan Chi and Qin Wan,

630
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,900
Yuan Hong would have been dead already!

631
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,260
Shameless!

632
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,760
Yuan Rui,

633
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,910
I've treated you with deep
and sincere brotherhood for years.

634
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,290
Never did I expect you to be

635
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:16,090
such a vicious and despicable hypocrite!

636
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,820
Were it not for your stupidity
and incompetence,

637
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,490
our Beidai wouldn't have kept

638
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,380
losing territory to the Shuoxi Army!

639
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,910
If Wu weren't this useless,

640
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,090
she would have won over
Young Commander Yan of the Shuoxi Army!

641
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,050
I also wished for brotherly harmony.

642
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,380
But being a nice brother

643
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,100
means I can't be an emperor.

644
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,660
The foolish yield to the talented;
the capable take power.

645
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,120
This is the natural order!

646
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,130
You think too highly of yourself.

647
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,930
A kingdom without unity,

648
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,610
a ruler without benevolence,

649
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,270
and people unable to survive.

650
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,970
If you can't bring the court closer
to the people and settle people down,

651
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,370
even killing 100 crown princes won't help!

652
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,340
Using the national interest

653
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,470
to justify your greed and disloyalty,

654
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,880
you're nothing but a hypocritical schemer
trying to steal the throne.

655
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,650
Enough.

656
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,610
Take Yuan Rui

657
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,800
and Xu Chang

658
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,050
back to the Court of Judicial Review
for detention!

659
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,110
Yes, Your Majesty!

660
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,380
You don't deserve to be the Crown Prince.

661
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,010
Regarding this matter,

662
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,820
I will personally write
to inform the Emperor of Beidai.

663
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,200
The infighting between brothers

664
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,760
is truly regrettable,

665
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,490
but at least we've figured out the truth.

666
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,520
Crown Prince Yuan Hong,
don't let it hurt yourself too much.

667
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,920
This concerns Beidai's internal affairs,

668
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,300
and I shouldn't overstep my boundaries.

669
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,200
Once your wounds have healed,

670
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,840
you may personally take those two men

671
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,300
back to Beidai for punishment.

672
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,370
Thank you

673
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,170
for your consideration, Your Majesty.

674
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,790
Your Highness, your speech

675
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,800
is truly thought-provoking.

676
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,660
After this incident,

677
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,820
I don't think I'm worthy of courting
your Princess Zhen for marriage.

678
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,210
Upon my return,

679
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,100
I will devote myself to careful governance

680
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,670
so as to maintain our peaceful borders

681
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,620
and mutual prosperity.

682
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,900
That is excellent.

683
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,240
Guards,

684
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,920
escort Crown Prince Yuan Hong
to rest and recover.

685
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,570
Everyone else may leave.

686
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,760
Li and Chi, you two stay.

687
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,910
The fight
for the Beidai Crown Prince's position

688
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,610
occurred within their imperial family.

689
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,520
It's something

690
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,560
quite upsetting for me to see.

691
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,840
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

692
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,010
Chi and I absolutely have no desire
to be the Crown Prince.

693
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,000
We mean it

694
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,090
seriously.

695
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,460
It's easy to say that

696
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,120
when you're not involved.

697
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,770
Liu Yun just submitted a memorial,

698
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,530
stating that due to poor health,

699
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,720
he requested to return
to Xihan ahead of schedule.

700
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,780
He no longer intends
to marry Princess Zhen either.

701
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,220
This Third Prince of Xihan

702
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,970
is certainly a perceptive and clever man.

703
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:21,970
The marriage alliance

704
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,340
was to stabilize the borders
between our three kingdoms.

705
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,300
Given Beidai's infighting,
they're no longer a threat.

706
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,930
So our goal has been achieved.

707
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,930
It's also better for Princess Zhen.

708
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,380
All thanks to Miss Qin Wan,

709
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,260
who saved the Beidai Crown Prince's life

710
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,540
and helped

711
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,190
capture the real culprits.

712
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,660
In view of her great contributions
in a row,

713
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,220
I don't even know
how to reward her properly.

714
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,360
That's easy.

715
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,900
Your Majesty, you previously rewarded her
with gold and jewels.

716
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,030
This time, you could grant her a title.

717
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,670
I have no particular friendship
with any of you.

718
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,660
And I'm not marrying
the princess either now.

719
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,400
Why

720
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,700
would you all come to see me off?

721
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,020
By imperial command.

722
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,150
I'm just here for fun.

723
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,360
I'm here
because you didn't hurt Princess Zhen.

724
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,630
Actually, I also had
no good intentions before.

725
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,600
When I followed Yuan Hong,

726
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,080
I once considered

727
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,530
killing him with Beidai's arrows

728
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,840
and framing their own people.

729
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,930
I just didn't expect them
to have internal strife,

730
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,830
allowing me

731
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,790
to reap the benefits easily.

732
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,160
You wear makeup

733
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,210
to hide your severe lung disease.

734
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,050
You still refuse my treatment?

735
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,110
I can extend your life for 3 to 5 years.

736
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,300
To live those extra 3 to 5 years,

737
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,670
how much bitter medicine must I take?

738
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,260
Not worth it.

739
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,130
Now that Yuan Hong is severely injured,

740
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,260
Beidai will surely decline for years.

741
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,700
Our Xihan people

742
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,700
can finally catch our breath.

743
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,180
Thank you all for your mercy

744
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,320
in sparing my life.

745
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Don't mention it.

746
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,550
It's also mercy for the border civilians.

747
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,900
Here comes the imperial decree!

748
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,260
Qin Wan, receive the imperial decree.

749
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,970
The decree states,

750
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,090
"Qin Wan, the eldest legitimate daughter
of Qin Liang from the Qin family,

751
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,660
is virtuous and prudent in character,

752
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,130
diligent and gentle in manner,

753
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,610
harmonious and pure in spirit,

754
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,010
kind and benevolent in nature,

755
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,410
with remarkable talents.

756
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,900
She has won my favor

757
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,050
and is hereby bestowed
the title of Princess Yongci.

758
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,260
Let it be announced far and wide

759
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,410
so that all may know. By imperial order."

760
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,780
Tell her to receive the decree!

761
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,750
Please wait a moment, Mr. Yuan.

762
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,140
Princess Yongci
seems too exhilarated to respond.

763
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,740
Hurry and accept the decree!

764
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,850
Thank you for the decree.

765
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,820
Get up, get up.

766
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,720
Little Wan'er!

767
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,800
His Majesty also permitted
our stay at the Ministry of Justice.

768
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,060
Our revenge is within reach now.

769
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,170
From today onwards,

770
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,830
I can truly stand
shoulder to shoulder with you.

771
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,150
D-Don't look at what you shouldn't see.

772
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,220
It's the same for you then.
