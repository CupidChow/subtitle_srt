00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,880
The Untamed

2
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Episode 16

3
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,840
Your Majesty!

4
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,680
Your Majesty, we've been following the imperial decree.

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,240
If the people don't see the empress and the crown prince

6
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,040
they will be worried about the people's safety.

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,440
Your Majesty!

8
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,480
We should put our lives at stake!

9
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,640
Mother is in grave danger.

10
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,800
How can I be happy with the people?

11
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Your Majesty, the empress dowager is unwell.

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Her condition is critical.

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,800
I think Your Majesty should visit the empress dowager in Funing Palace.

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
When the empress dowager gets better, we'll send her back.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The people will appreciate Your Majesty's filial piety.

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,400
Does Your Highness remember that little doctor?

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
What doctor?

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
Please be kind.

19
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
What?

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Didn't the Ninth Lady get the title of doctor after saving the First Princess?

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
This can't be fake!

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,400
What are you two arguing about?

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,800
Father, the Ninth Lady of the Qin family is a doctor.

24
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,000
She must have a way to cure Grandmother.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
Your Majesty, please allow me to report.

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
My daughter, Ninth Sister, is only known as the first doctor

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,800
because of the rumors spread in the capital.

28
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
She's still young.

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
How could she be called the first doctor?

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
Whether it's true or not

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
it's true that she cured Grandmother, right?

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,800
Qi Lang.

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Yes.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,000
What they said about the Ninth Lady of the Qin family

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,200
being the first doctor, is it true?

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,200
The Ninth Lady of the Qin family

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,800
did indeed cure the First Princess.

38
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Are you confident that you can cure the Empress Dowager?

40
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,600
Your Majesty, I'm willing to try my best.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,800
This concerns the life and death of the Empress Dowager.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,000
How can I let you try?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
Your Majesty, my best effort

44
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,800
is to find out about the illness of the Empress Dowager.

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
The doctor isn't an immortal.

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
Before I met the patient,

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,400
I really didn't know if I was confident.

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,200
So, please decide if I should try.

49
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,600
So, you're saying that curing the illness is your ability.

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,400
If you can't cure it, it's the fault of His Majesty's servant.

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,800
You're still young. It's a good trick.

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm sorry for my rudeness. Please forgive me.

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,600
Your Majesty, the Ninth Lady is still young.

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,400
Although she's talented, she's still young.

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Let the Imperial Physician treat her.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Crown Prince of the Empress, go to the Zhenghua Gate quickly.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll be there soon.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,200
This concerns the safety of the Empress Dowager.

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,800
I'll take you to the Funing Palace.

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,400
Come on.

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
See His Majesty off.

62
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Empress Dowager, please wake up.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Empress Dowager, please wake up.

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
Empress Dowager.

65
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,200
It's too late.

66
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
We should report to His Majesty.

67
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
What?

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Please forgive me.

69
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Empress Dowager is in danger.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,400
Hu Yuan Zheng was in a bad situation yesterday.

71
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,200
I've tried my best. But...

72
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,000
Jin Jiu Niang, come here.

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,200
Your Highness, how is she?

74
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
She's fine.

75
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,400
Her nose is bleeding.

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Her lips are not.

77
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
Her eyes are dark.

78
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Her lips are pale.

79
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,800
Her organs are swollen.

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,400
Her limbs are stiff.

81
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,000
She's suffering from cold blood.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
Her limbs are swollen.

83
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,200
Her eyes are black.

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Her mouth is swollen.

85
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Her eyes are swollen.

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Her eyes are black.

87
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Her mouth is swollen.

88
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Her limbs are swollen.

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Her legs are numb and cold.

90
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
She can't sleep.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Chen Mo Mo,

92
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,400
did Her Highness cough during the day?

93
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,800
You have to tell us the truth.

94
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Yes.

95
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Did Her Highness have acupuncture pain

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
besides feeling numb?

97
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
Did she fall down

98
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
and can't talk?

99
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,000
You're right.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,400
During the day, Her Highness coughed

101
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
after having lunch.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
After taking a break, her legs are numb and painful.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,800
She had very little food in the afternoon.

104
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
After falling down,

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
she had blood in her nose.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She can't talk.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
She's unconscious.

108
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
When Her Highness fell down,

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
did Mo Mo serve her?

110
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,200
Yes.

111
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,400
Although I held her,

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,600
she fell on me

113
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,800
without holding on.

114
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
If I held her,

115
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
her nose and coma

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
are not related to the injury.

117
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Your Majesty, I can confirm

118
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
that Her Highness is unconscious.

119
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Her pulse is blocked

120
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
and her blood pressure is low.

121
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Then...

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Can we save her?

123
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,200
It's been an hour since Her Highness was ill.

124
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,800
Three more hours to go.

125
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Your Majesty,

126
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
within an hour,

127
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,800
is the best time to save her.

128
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,200
If you believe me,

129
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll let her go.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Whatever you need,

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,800
whatever you do,

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
they will cooperate with you.

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Chen Mo Mo,

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
please give me the prescription.

137
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Here.

138
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,400
The prescription is very good.

139
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,000
You only need to add one more dragon,

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,800
one more dragon,

141
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,200
and two thousand more.

142
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,800
Although these two medicines

143
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
can help to relieve the bleeding,

144
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,400
they are all poisonous.

145
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Her Highness's blood pressure is weak.

146
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,000
How can she take this kind of medicine?

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,400
If it hurts her life...

148
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
The medicine can cure the cough and cause a serious disorder.

149
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
If she dies,

150
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
why would she need to bleed?

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
What's the point of taking the medicine?

152
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,000
But Her Highness has no appetite.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,600
It's useless to take the medicine.

154
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Wait until Her Highness wakes up.

155
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,200
Otherwise, the medicine will be more dangerous.

156
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Since it's dangerous,

157
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
why did you force her to take the medicine?

158
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
We tried our best

160
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,200
to keep her awake.

161
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,400
We had no choice but to do this.

162
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
You...

163
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Your Majesty,

164
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,800
when the doctors were taking the medicine,

165
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,000
there were still 12 police officers

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and police officers in the Empress Dowager's room.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
There was no mistake in the treatment.

168
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,600
It's just that they didn't see the effect

169
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
because they were too steady.

170
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,000
Steady?

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm afraid they didn't want to make any contribution,

172
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
but they didn't want to make any mistake.

173
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Your Majesty,

174
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
the doctor is not an immortal.

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,400
It's hard to keep the patient alive.

176
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
If the patient is cured,

177
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
how can we not take the medicine

178
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,800
and kill ourselves?

179
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Your Majesty,

180
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
please forgive the young lady.

181
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Since the young lady

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
has already pleaded for your love,

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you may all rise.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

185
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Why are you still standing there?

186
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,400
Go and make the medicine.

187
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
Make the medicine.

188
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,400
Count Chen,

189
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
please take the herbs

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,640
and the

191
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,200
Yes.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
Your Majesty,

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
it's about time.

194
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
There are many people at Zhenghua Gate

195
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,800
waiting for the natural.

196
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Your Majesty,

197
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
do you still want to go?

198
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
Jin Jiu Niang,

199
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
I only ask you one question.

200
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Can you save the Empress Dowager?

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
I will do it with a stable mind.

202
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
As the Empress Dowager,

203
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
I will do my best to save her.

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,200
Qi Lang,

205
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
I'll leave your grandmother

206
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,800
to you and Jin Jiu Niang.

207
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Uncle, don't worry.

208
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Since Jin Jiu Niang

209
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
still has a chance to live,

210
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
she will be able to change her position.

211
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
I hope so.

212
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Tomorrow,

213
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,400
the court meeting of Zhengdan will be held.

214
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,000
The envoys from the north and the west

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,400
will also come to the court.

216
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,400
The two countries have always been on fire.

217
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,000
If it weren't for the civil war

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that occurred last year,

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
the two countries would have been in a war.

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,400
During the period of the two countries' envoys,

221
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
you should pay more attention.

222
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Don't let the two countries

223
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,800
have more troubles

224
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
in our country.

225
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,800
The two countries have been on fire.

227
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
The two countries have been on fire.

228
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
The two countries have been on fire.

229
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
The two countries have been on fire.

230
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
The two countries have been on fire.

231
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
The two countries have been on fire.

232
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
The two countries have been on fire.

233
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
The two countries have been on fire.

234
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
The two countries have been on fire.

235
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
The two countries have been on fire.

236
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
The two countries have been on fire.

237
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
The two countries have been on fire.

238
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
The two countries have been on fire.

239
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
The two countries have been on fire.

240
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,380
Your Grace,

241
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,560
this group of arrows

242
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,700
is apparently able to

243
00:11:42,700 --> 00:12:04,460
raid the

244
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,960
Nine Paths valley.

245
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,800
How is President Huang?

246
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,880
Brother Qi, how is he now?

247
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,000
No news.

248
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,960
His Majesty is here.

249
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
How is the Empress Dowager?

250
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
We haven't heard from her yet.

251
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Your Majesty.

252
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
All of you, wait here.

253
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Get up.

254
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
What should we do?

255
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
What should we do?

256
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
It will take hours to burn the incense.

257
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Please don't be so rude.

258
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

259
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Your Majesty.

260
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Mother.

261
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Mother.

262
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
I'm here.

263
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
Thank you.

264
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Mother.

265
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Mother, this...

266
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
The Empress Dowager is...

267
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

268
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
The Empress Dowager fell asleep again.

269
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,800
When she wakes up, she will drink the

270
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,960
blood-sucking soup again.

271
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
At noon, she will drink it for the third time.

272
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
If she can drink it all,

273
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
the illness of the Empress Dowager

274
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
will be stable.

275
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Father, is the Imperial Grandmother fine?

276
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager...

277
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
God bless her.

278
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
The Empress Dowager has been transferred to her place.

279
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Enough.

280
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
In three hours,

281
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
the Imperial Court will be in a state of emergency.

282
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
You should go back and rest.

283
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Yes, Father.

284
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
I will take my leave.

285
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Your Majesty,

286
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
although the Empress Dowager is safe,

287
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
she still needs to be carefully treated.

288
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
I want to discuss with Physician Zhang

289
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
about the treatment

290
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
and leave the palace later.

291
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Leave the palace?

292
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
What for?

293
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Yuan Qing.

294
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
I'm here.

295
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Clean up the side hall.

296
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Tonight,

297
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
ask the Ninth Madam

298
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
to stay in the Empress Dowager's palace.

299
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Yes.

300
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Your Majesty,

301
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
the Empress Dowager's illness is getting better.

302
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
It's better not to

303
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
let the Ninth Madam stay in the palace.

304
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
She grew up in the Medicine King Valley.

305
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
She is afraid of the rules and rules.

306
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm afraid she will be uncomfortable

307
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
if she stays in the palace.

308
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
I'm afraid she will be uncomfortable.

309
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,960
I'm really worried about those imperial physicians.

310
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
They are very strict with their medical skills.

311
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
They just care about the Empress Dowager's physical weakness

312
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
and dare not use the medicine of Junmeng.

313
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
With the good pulse of Physician Zhang,

314
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
he can definitely help the Empress Dowager.

315
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Yuan Qing,

316
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
bring my jade tablet.

317
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Then,

318
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
ask the Ninth Madam to come back to the palace every day.

319
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Take this jade tablet.

320
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
It will be more convenient

321
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
to enter the palace in the future.

322
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

323
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
I will enter the palace every day

324
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
to pay respect to the Empress Dowager.

325
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Okay.

326
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
I will do as you say.

327
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Please send the Ninth Madam back to the palace

328
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
as soon as possible.

329
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

330
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Thank you for opening up for me today.

331
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Otherwise, I would have to

332
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
refute His Majesty again.

333
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
I'm really afraid

334
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
His Majesty will be in the palace.

335
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Then, I can't investigate

336
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
my father's case.

337
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
His Majesty is hard-hearted.

338
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
He has always been a man of his word.

339
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Today, you are pretending to be His Majesty

340
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
for the sake of the imperial physician.

341
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
I'm really afraid.

342
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
I was just worried

343
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
that Physician Zhang would be punished

344
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
for one word I said.

345
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
I forgot the different past of the past.

346
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
I was afraid that

347
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I would forget the different past of the past.

348
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
I have to be careful

349
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
in the palace.

350
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Why are you sorry about me?

352
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Remember, I'm here.

353
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
I will take care of everything.

354
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Today is also a lucky day.

355
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
The Empress Dowager's situation is really dangerous.

356
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
If we are in the dark,

357
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm afraid it will be difficult to save her.

358
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Thank you.

359
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Since you don't allow me to say sorry,

360
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
why are you saying thank you to me?

361
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
The Empress Dowager

362
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
loves me the most.

363
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Today is the New Year.

364
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
The more you save your grandmother,

365
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
how do you thank me?

366
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,960
I wish Waner a healthy heart.

367
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Thank you.

368
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
What does it say?

369
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
A handkerchief.

370
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
This is a token of love

371
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
from my father to my mother.

372
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
It can be taken

373
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
and crushed with it.

374
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
It's also my wish to protect you.

375
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
This

376
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
is also a token of love.

377
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Do you know

378
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
the person who wanted to assassinate you in Jingzhou

379
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
is in the capital?

380
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
I think the Crown Prince and Prince Cheng

381
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
are not as good as them.

382
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
You don't have to worry about this.

383
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
I'm here to protect you.

384
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
It's you.

385
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
You saved the Empress Dowager today.

386
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,960
You will be the

387
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
most important person to His Majesty.

388
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
When you walk in the palace,

389
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
remember not to interfere

390
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
in the fight between

391
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
the Noble Consort and the Empress.

392
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
You should protect yourself.

393
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
I didn't want to be the main focus of the people.

394
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
I was very careful.

395
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I also needed to be noticed by His Majesty

396
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
so that I could walk by your side.

397
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

399
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
If you are really worried,

400
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
why don't you give me a case?

401
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
With the title of the coroner,

402
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
the noble ladies of the Imperial Concubine

403
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
won't keep an eye on me.

404
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Not only the noble ladies of the Imperial Concubine,

405
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
those sons of the royal family

406
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
dare not to take your idea.

407
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
It's a good chance.

408
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
You really scared me today.

409
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Fortunately, the royal mother is so kind.

410
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Imperial Mother,

411
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
the medical skill of the Ninth Lady

412
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
is really amazing.

413
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Why haven't I heard of this person before?

414
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Can Qin Zhaoyu

415
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
mention her Ninth Sister to His Majesty?

416
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
What did you mention?

417
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Why is His Majesty so absent-minded?

418
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
He doesn't like the Ninth Lady, does he?

419
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
You are also one year old

420
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
and two years younger.

421
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
You can't be so ignorant.

422
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
I was like this

423
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
in front of Imperial Mother.

424
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
All right.

425
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
It's getting late.

426
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
You should go back and rest.

427
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
There is still a big meeting today.

428
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Imperial Mother is going to

429
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
talk to my Imperial Brother privately again.

430
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Don't think that I don't know

431
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
what Imperial Brother thinks.

432
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
He is definitely satisfied

433
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
with the Ninth Lady's

434
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
father's affection.

435
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
He also likes Sister Zhaoyu's

436
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
beauty and power.

437
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Don't talk nonsense.

438
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
What's wrong?

439
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Did Zhen'er

440
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
get you right?

441
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
In terms of talent and ability,

442
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
the Ninth Lady of the Qin family

443
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
is indeed good.

444
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
It's a pity that

445
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
she is separated from

446
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Marquis Zhongyong.

447
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
She won't be your assistant

448
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
in the future.

449
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Today, Father

450
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
looks at her differently.

451
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
No matter how different she looks,

452
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
she is still a good person.

453
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
I think

454
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
she is a good person.

455
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Today, Father

456
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
looks at her differently.

457
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
No matter how different she looks,

458
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
she is still a good person.

459
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Marquis Zhongyong is a powerful man

460
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
and has a deep foundation in the court.

461
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
If you abandon his daughter

462
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
and save the Ninth Lady,

463
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Noble Consort Song will immediately

464
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
appoint Zhaoyu as the princess consort.

465
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
By then, Marquis Zhongyong

466
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
will be able to take full advantage of

467
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Lord Cheng and Yanqi.

468
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Imperial Mother, don't worry.

469
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
I won't make any mistakes.

470
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
If you really like that Ninth Lady,

471
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
why don't you appoint her as the concubine?

472
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Zhaoyu is virtuous and generous.

473
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
She will definitely not

474
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
break your heart.

475
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Isn't it a good thing?

476
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Just one side.

477
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
I don't like her.

478
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
But Mother, since you

479
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
have appointed Zhaoyu as the princess consort,

480
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
why don't you give her the title of princess consort?

481
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Marquis Zhongyong has tried

482
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
to seduce me many times.

483
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
If you get it too easily,

484
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
you won't cherish it.

485
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
If she really becomes the princess consort,

486
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
the Qin family

487
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
will not be so easy to discipline.

488
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Enough.

489
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
You should go back and rest.

490
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
The court meeting today

491
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
cannot make any mistakes.

492
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
You must not let Lord Cheng

493
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
make any mistakes again.

494
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
I understand.

495
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Go.

496
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
If you can have Yanchi's

497
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
three-part strategy,

498
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
why would you

499
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
bother to trouble me so much?

500
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
I didn't expect

501
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Zhao Shuhua to act so quickly.

502
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
The Ninth Lady

503
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
hasn't arrived yet.

504
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
She followed me without a word.

505
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
I think she must be

506
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
aiming at His Majesty

507
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
and looking at the Ninth Lady

508
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
and taking advantage of it.

509
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
And the mother of the country.

510
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm afraid that she won't be able to

511
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
get along with the people in the Gou Lan.

512
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Today,

513
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
I'll also find a man

514
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
to give something to the Ninth Lady.

515
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
I'll see if I can make her angry.

516
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Why do you have to do this?

517
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
I'm doing this for you.

518
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Mother,

519
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
if you really want to be good to me,

520
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
you should take care of

521
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
that Feng Chenbi more.

522
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
What's wrong with Chenbi?

523
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
In the capital,

524
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
besides Qin Zhaoyu,

525
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
which other girl

526
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
can be compared with Chenbi?

527
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
If she still wants to be the Crown Princess,

528
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
she should be stupid a few times.

529
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
She should be more considerate.

530
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
While the people in the palace

531
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
are all stupid.

532
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Isn't she doing this for you?

533
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
If you don't

534
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,960
look down on the Chinese Duke,

535
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
does she need to fight for the Crown Princess?

536
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Don't forget that

537
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
only the Chinese Duke

538
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
is the most capable person

539
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
to help you fight for the Crown Prince.

540
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
Now you dislike Chenbi so much.

541
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Are you

542
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Qin Jiu Niang who loves you so much?

543
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
I'm telling you,

544
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
the Chinese Duke is the Crown Prince's son.

545
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
He won't help you

546
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
for the sake of

547
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
a concubine's niece.

548
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Even if Qin Wan

549
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
is better than the Great Luo Gold Deity,

550
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
she doesn't deserve me.

551
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
No one in the capital

552
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
deserves me.

553
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
His Majesty and the Empress

554
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
are so generous.

555
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Why isn't Sister Jiu here?

556
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,960
These rewards are for her.

557
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
My wife has been working hard

558
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
to save the Empress Dowager.

559
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
She's still asleep.

560
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
I heard from the imperial guard

561
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
that His Majesty

562
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,960
didn't allow her to be disturbed.

563
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
When we were in Jingzhou,

564
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
who would have thought

565
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Sister Jiu would be like this?

566
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
His Majesty has such a great favor for her.

567
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I'm afraid that she will

568
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
be so high that she will turn into a phoenix.

569
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
You should be flattered

570
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
for saying such nonsense.

571
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Is the Fifth Madam

572
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
on the brink of death?

573
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
She's talking nonsense.

574
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Let's make her starve for a few days

575
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
and then put out the fire.

576
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Let's copy a hundred times of women's virtue.

577
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
When she understands what the rules are,

578
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
let's get her out of the yard.

579
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Sister.

580
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Mother,

581
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Qin Xiang is having a bad mood.

582
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Why don't you

583
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
look after her for her?

584
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Yu'er is right.

585
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Qin Xiang will

586
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
call on us sooner or later.

587
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
We should get rid of her as soon as possible.

588
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
My Lord,

589
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
look.

590
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
None of them is easy to deal with.

591
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Qin Xiang is like that.

592
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Qin Wan is...

593
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Look at these things.

594
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
These are all

595
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
the rewards from the Empress and His Majesty.

596
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Qin Wan saved the Empress Dowager.

597
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
It's a great credit.

598
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
It's nothing to reward her.

599
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
This is a whole box of beads.

600
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Yu'er didn't get

601
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
anything as good as this.

602
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Can Yu'er and Qin Wan be the same?

603
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Yu'er's name hasn't been decided yet.

604
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
And Qin Wan

605
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
is the savior of the Empress Dowager.

606
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
In terms of etiquette,

607
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
the Empress should value Qin Wan more.

608
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
My Lord,

609
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
what if the Empress changes her mind?

610
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Then Yu'er and the Crown Prince's marriage...

611
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Mother,

612
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
the fact that Sister Jiu

613
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
can be treated by the Emperor and the Empress

614
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
is also the honor of our family.

615
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
And it's also the father's help.

616
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Yu'er, you know it well.

617
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Don't worry.

618
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Qin Wan has her own fortune.

619
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Anyway,

620
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
don't bother

621
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
Yu'er's position as the Consort.

622
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Brothers,

623
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
please help me put it in this room.

624
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
Madam.

625
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Where are you going?

626
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm going to treat the Empress Dowager.

627
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
The Empress is sick.

628
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
After this,

629
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
are we going to

630
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
be at the bottom of the Marquis' Mansion

631
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
and the capital?

632
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Silly girl.

633
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
You're thinking too simply.

634
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Even if they think I'm a good person,

635
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
once I start investigating the case,

636
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
I'm afraid the Emperor

637
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
will be the first to feel sorry for me.

638
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Then...

639
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
The palace is complicated.

640
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
I won't take you there.

641
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Then you have no one to serve.

642
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
What if you meet

643
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
any trouble in the palace?

644
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
These days,

645
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
I'll be with the Empress Dowager in the palace.

646
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Nothing will happen.

647
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
You should be careful, too.

648
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
Don't let anyone in our yard.

649
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Don't worry.

650
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
I won't even let a fly in.

651
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm leaving.

652
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Be careful.

653
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Yu'er,

654
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,960
I know you've been self-important since you were a child.

655
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
But today,

656
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
you've seen

657
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
the things the Empress sent.

658
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
You have to be careful

659
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
when you meet the Empress.

660
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Mother,

661
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
I'm not that kind of

662
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
woman who's greedy for wealth.

663
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Even if Qin Wan

664
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
doesn't want to seduce the Crown Prince,

665
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
what if the Crown Prince

666
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
is too fresh

667
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
and has a bad luck?

668
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
No way.

669
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Your father is going to

670
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
get along with Prince Rui and Qin Wan.

671
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Let's just

672
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
get this done quickly.

673
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Then we'll be less worried about the future.

674
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
But Yan Chi is a man of great virtue.

675
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
There are many ladies in the capital who are loyal to him.

676
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
But do you know why

677
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
no one has dared to

678
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
marry Prince Rui?

679
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
The whole Yin Xian Princess

680
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
was killed by Prince Rui.

681
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Isn't the Princess

682
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
born in the South

683
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
and died of blood clots?

684
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
These are all excuses.

685
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
I heard that Yan Chi

686
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
isn't the blood of Prince Rui.

687
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Prince Rui got angry and married a dead man.

688
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Leaving this son

689
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
is just a cover-up.

690
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Otherwise, how could it be possible

691
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
that the Princess of the First Prince just died,

692
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,960
and Prince Rui left the only son in the wall

693
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
and went to Shuoxi?

694
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
If this matter is exposed,

695
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
how can Yan Chi still be able to get married?

696
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Who dares to

697
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,960
marry his own daughter to him?

698
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Handkerchief.

699
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
This is a token of love

700
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
from my father to my mother.

701
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
It can be worn on your body

702
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
and be used to destroy the world.

703
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
I'm also the one who protects you.

704
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Prince Rui gave this jade to the Princess.

705
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
They clearly have a deep love for each other.

706
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
But how could there be such

707
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
absurd rumors in the capital?

708
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Prince Rui is very strict with Yan Chi.

709
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
If he believes the rumors

710
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
are true,

711
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
I'm afraid that they will be together immediately.

712
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
If the Western Army is going to break up,

713
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
who is the one who set up this trap

714
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
with such evil intentions?

715
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Even if the road ahead is dangerous,

716
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
Yan Chi,

717
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I should protect you this time.

718
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Your Highness.

719
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Nanny Chen,

720
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Her Highness has been out of danger.

721
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
From now on, you just need to

722
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
use the right medicine.

723
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
That's great!

724
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,960
I thank you for helping me, My Lady.

725
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Nanny, you don't have to be like this.

726
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
Nanny,

727
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
does Her Highness's waist often feel pain,

728
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
and does she often have the condition of crying?

729
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
No one was talking.

730
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,760
But the Empress Dowager thought someone was talking to her.

731
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,560
She said there was a sound in her ear.

732
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
The kite is an important thing now.

733
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,640
The ear disease can be treated slowly.

734
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,200
Good.

735
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,000
Waner.

736
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,280
The Empress Dowager's health is weak these years.

737
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,040
Why don't you take care of it together?

738
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,760
It's not about cooking.

739
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,040
It's about cooking together.

740
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,840
When the Empress Dowager can eat,

741
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,360
I'll prescribe a dieting prescription.

742
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,320
To nourish her body.

743
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,320
Don't worry.

744
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,120
The Empress Dowager hasn't reached the age of death.

745
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,480
She'll be fine after one year of recuperation.

746
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,040
Okay.

747
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,840
His Majesty is here.

748
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

749
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

750
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,520
You may rise.

751
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

752
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,240
Your Majesty.

753
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,800
The Empress Dowager woke up once again.

754
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,520
She can drink some soup.

755
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,920
Jiu Niang is indeed a good doctor.

756
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,680
Your Majesty.

757
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,160
If I leave the Empress Dowager's body to you,

758
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
will you be willing to treat her?

759
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,600
If you believe me,

760
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,160
I'll do my best.

761
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,520
Your Majesty is so scheming.

762
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,280
The Princess Royal

763
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,440
gave a granddaughter to you.

764
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,560
But she just got rewarded with something.

765
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
So she wants to treat her like a doctor.

766
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,960
I'm not afraid that the Princess Royal will be angry.

767
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,240
Jiu Niang is the precious thing

768
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,680
in the palace.

769
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,640
I don't dare to treat her badly.

770
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,400
Jiu Niang saved the Empress Dowager's life.

771
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,520
So she should be considered as a handmaiden.

772
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,480
If she can take care of the Empress Dowager's body,

773
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,720
she'll be considered as a great contribution.

774
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,280
I'll reward her with great rewards.

775
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

776
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,280
You've worked hard last night

777
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,920
when you first entered the palace.

778
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Today,

779
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,000
the palace is holding a banquet to welcome the guests.

780
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,920
You can have a banquet with Zhen and Ning.

781
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,360
I'll go to see the Empress Dowager first.

782
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,360
Jiu Niang, don't worry about the dress and the rules.

783
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,080
I still have some clothes that haven't been worn yet.

784
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,760
You two are similar in shape.

785
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,280
You can wear them after changing your clothes.

786
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

787
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,640
Xiaowan, that's great.

788
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,920
Today's banquet will have a dance competition.

789
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,840
It's much more fun than Chuxi's banquet.

790
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,760
I heard that.

791
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,000
Ning, if you dare to talk nonsense again,

792
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,840
I'll send someone to send you back to Jingzhou.

793
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,080
I dare not, Uncle.

794
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,080
Sha Bao.

795
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Sha years.

796
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:50,000
Little

797
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
lax kid.

798
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,440
The Ninth Lady of Qin's family

799
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,160
can sit with the princess

800
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,160
after she enters the palace for the second time.

801
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,600
The Ninth Lady of Qin saved my grandmother.

802
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,960
She deserves the respect of father.

803
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,280
The dragon face changes so fast.

804
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,720
It's only a night.

805
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,920
You have to show your qin to them.

806
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,000
You really forget

807
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,120
how they forced you to be a snake yesterday.

808
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,240
I don't care what they say.

809
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
I just care about eating and drinking.

810
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,320
Why hasn't Brother Qi come yet?

811
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,480
Did he

812
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,040
have a fight with Yan Li again?

813
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,680
Yan Li

814
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,640
just doesn't come at night.

815
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,240
He doesn't come on the day.

816
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,680
If he doesn't come,

817
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,680
these palace banquet won't be fragrant.

818
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,640
Come.

819
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,840
What are you looking at?

820
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
Why doesn't he come?

821
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,840
Don't force him.

822
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,240
He's like Yan Chi.

823
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,280
Although he has the highest honor,

824
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,840
he's still the most important person in the capital.

825
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,400
Wan,

826
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,120
why do I hear you

827
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,040
talking about him?

828
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,040
The longer he stays in the capital,

829
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,280
the more I can understand their difficulties.

830
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,920
You're right.

831
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,440
But

832
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,480
I'm living in the palace every day.

833
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,720
It's not easy for me, too.

834
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,760
You should contact me, too.

835
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,240
Yes.

836
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,880
I have to contact you.

837
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,800
You can't drink with Yan Li

838
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,120
all day long.

839
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,680
It's hard for you to act like a good girl here.

840
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,280
His Majesty is here.

841
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:37,640
The

842
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,520
Yuan Zhe's rule won'tująate the Qin Empire.

843
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,000
His Majesty will beodes his death!

844
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,820
Be equally young.

845
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,480
Your Majesty str Jang Ge.

846
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,920
Please get out of your pl statistical shoes.

847
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,440
Old guests

848
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Please sit down.

849
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

850
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,200
Last year, the snow in the north was so heavy.

851
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,000
I thought I would meet you all in spring.

852
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,600
I didn't expect that

853
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,600
on New Year's Day,

854
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,200
I would have a chance to meet you all.

855
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,600
Come on.

856
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Everyone,

857
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,400
let's raise a toast.

858
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,800
To the happiness of this year.

859
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,200
To the happiness of this year.

860
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,600
To the happiness of this year.

861
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
To the happiness of this year.

862
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,600
To the happiness of this year.

863
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
To the happiness of this year.

864
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,000
To the happiness of this year.

865
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
To the happiness of this year.

866
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,200
Your Majesty,

867
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,800
I heard that

868
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,000
the North and the West have a good relationship.

869
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,400
Today,

870
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
they are indeed a good match.

871
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,600
Especially, Princess Yuan Wu is so beautiful.

872
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
She is as good as Zhen Er.

873
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Although Princess Yuan Wu is beautiful,

874
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
you said that in public.

875
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,000
It's so embarrassing.

876
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Your Majesty, I appreciate it.

877
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,000
Princess Wu is lively and lovely.

878
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
She is also beautiful.

879
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,000
How can you compare her to her?

880
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,200
Although my brother is not good at words,

881
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,400
he prepared a gift for Princess.

882
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
What a coincidence.

883
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,000
I also prepared a gift for Princess.

884
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,000
Why don't we show it to Princess?

885
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Whose gift is more suitable?

886
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,200
How about it?

887
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,200
It's rare that you two have such a good relationship.

888
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,000
Let's see what kind of treasure

889
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,200
is Princess Wu's.

890
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,800
Come.

891
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,000
Everyone, please look.

892
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
This gemstone

893
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,000
is hidden in the Cang Yu Mountains of our North.

894
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,400
Its color is red like a fire.

895
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,000
It's brighter than the sun and moon.

896
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It's called the crime of cutting off the red gemstone.

897
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,200
I think

898
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I have such a unique treasure

899
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,000
that can be matched with the noble Princess Wu of Shang.

900
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
It's really hard to find

901
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
such a rare red gemstone

902
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,400
in the hands of Yuan Hong.

903
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Your Majesty, please allow me to write.

904
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
This little snow fox is very spiritual.

905
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,400
Princess only needs to wear this sacred bell for three days.

906
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,000
This little snow fox will make Princess

907
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,400
the only master in this life.

908
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,600
It will never hurt Princess.

909
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,200
Please try it on.

910
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,000
Father, mother, I want this little fox.

911
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Okay, since Zhen Er likes it,

912
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,600
then you can be the master of this fox.

913
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Thank you, father.

914
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,000
The wood is good.

915
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's good for the whole world.

916
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,000
I heard that the Crown Prince of the North

917
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,800
and the third prince of the Western Han Dynasty

918
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,600
are both the masters of the world.

919
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,200
They are all very good.

920
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,600
They are both very good.

921
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,000
They are both very good.

922
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,600
The third prince of the Western Han Dynasty

923
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,200
are both the masters of the world.

924
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,200
Please come and have a good rest.

925
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
After ten days,

926
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,800
there will be a chess competition in the South Courtyard.

927
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,400
I will send the Crown Prince of the King of Rui Yan Chi

928
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,800
to accompany you.

929
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,400
I wish you all

930
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,400
a good luck here.

931
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Your Majesty,

932
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
if I win the archery competition after ten days,

933
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,800
I will also be rewarded.

934
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,000
Of course.

935
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,400
Your Majesty,

936
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,600
if I win, I don't want anything else.

937
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
I just want

938
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,200
Young Marshal Yan to be my son-in-law.

939
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:34,600
The snow is so cold and warm in the snow.

940
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,600
If a love falls into the shadow,

941
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,600
the snow falls and the snow white.

942
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:54,600
If a love falls into the heart,

943
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,600
pain will also be returned.

944
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,600
Open your heart, love doesn't matter the deep sea.

945
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Please give me courage, let fate be open.

946
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Don't be afraid of the starlight being blocked by the night sky.

947
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:32,600
The stars will shine beyond the sky.

948
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,600
The stars are like dust,

949
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,600
but they are the colors of the stars.

950
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,600
The stars are like dust,

951
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,600
but they are the colors of the stars.

952
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,600
The stars are like dust,

953
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,600
but they are the colors of the stars.

954
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
The stars are like dust,

955
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,600
but they are the colors of the stars.

956
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
The stars are like dust,

957
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,600
but they are the colors of the stars.
