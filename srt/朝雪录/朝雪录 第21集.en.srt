00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,910
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,870
Master,

4
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,550
Prince Cheng's men are
still outside.

5
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,229
Prince Cheng

6
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,950
apparently came here for Mr. Qin.

7
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,509
Now, the victims' clothes are
mysteriously missing.

8
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,229
I'm worried that...

9
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,200
Capital Prefect,

10
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,759
Young Master Qin is an strategist of mine.

11
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,560
Please address her
as Master Wan from now on.

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,320
Yes, I got it.

13
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,670
-But now…
-Don’t worry.

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,009
I only need four hours as I said.

15
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,289
To proceed,

16
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,100
I'll have to trouble Constable Zhan
for one thing.

17
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,900
I'm at Your Highness's service.

18
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,710
Please go to the East Water Gate

19
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,630
and identify the fish vendors
who deliver fish to the restaurants

20
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,590
in the West Market.

21
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,060
Got it.

22
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,740
Didn't Master Wan say

23
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,710
the victim must've eaten in a small diner?

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,889
Why would fish vendors
bother to make deliveries to small diners?

25
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,110
Fish are fragile goods.

26
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,470
Some are inevitably damaged
during transport.

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,380
Fish vendors

28
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,579
usually keep the dead and injured fish
for themselves,

29
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,240
or sell them cheaply to small diners.

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,300
Finding the right fish vendor

31
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,350
will lead us to the diner
that purchased the fish.

32
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,350
I understand now.

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,640
But Prince Cheng...

34
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,340
Master Wan is new to the city.

35
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,700
I'll show her around first.

36
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,160
It'll only take two hours.

37
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,770
Bai Feng,

38
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,700
be our coachman.

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,190
Yes.

40
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,640
Two hours...

41
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,310
The Marquis of Zhongyong is
sparing no effort

42
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,840
to assist the Crown Prince.

43
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,260
I can't believe he'd drag you into this.

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,860
I was looking for a chance
to enter the criminal justice system.

45
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,579
What they've done suits me perfectly,

46
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,130
and has saved you much trouble.

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,329
I don't mind trouble.

48
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,510
It's just that there's a tangled net of
power players behind this matter.

49
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,790
I'm afraid the attention you get
will endanger you.

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,880
Today, you've seen
the way Prince Cheng acts.

51
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,710
You should be aware of

52
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,860
the uncontainable hostility
between him and the Crown Prince

53
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,660
You might be

54
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,630
caught in their political struggles

55
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,030
and reduced to a pawn of others'.

56
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,890
I'm not afraid.

57
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,140
Don't worry.

58
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,310
I'll be cautious.

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,190
To seek justice for the murdered women

60
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,850
and to clear
Prince Jin's and my father's names,

61
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,910
I must pursue

62
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,100
this case to the end.

63
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,420
Okay.

64
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,960
Go ahead and act as you see fit.

65
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,990
Just don't forget to keep your guard up.

66
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,390
The Emperor has granted me
approval today.

67
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,510
From now on, you can work on any cases

68
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,710
undertaken by the Ministry of Justice.

69
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,329
Thank you.

70
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,370
[Prince Yi’s Mansion]

71
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,230
Why did you bring me
to Prince Yi's residence?

72
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,910
I want you to meet someone.

73
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,840
It's also a way to lose those tails.

74
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,860
It seems desolate. How come?

75
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,850
It's a prince's mansion without a prince.

76
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,580
How can it not appear desolate?

77
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,750
Chi.

78
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,290
Why are you here so early?

79
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,620
Fix your clothes.

80
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,660
Where did you hang out last night?

81
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,970
Little Wan'er?

82
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,310
Chi, why didn't you tell me
she was coming too?

83
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,630
She might be charmed by my pretty looks.

84
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,260
You can't blame me if that happens.

85
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,580
Your Highness is worrying about nothing.

86
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,930
You're dressed like a man
shortly after your return to the capital.

87
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,400
Is it because you find
men's apparel classy,

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,000
or because you're
investigating a case again?

89
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,220
There's a spy for Yan Qi at the gate.

90
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,380
Go chase him away.

91
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,190
Why are Prince Cheng's people after you?

92
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,330
You're not working on that tricky case
for the Crown Prince, are you?

93
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,380
Cut the crap. Go get rid of that spy now.

94
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,580
I'll wait till you come back
to visit Madam.

95
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,840
You go visit her alone.

96
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
She'd rather read scriptures than see me.

97
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,080
She'd only make an exception for you.

98
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,140
I'll go deal with

99
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,170
that hateful spy.

100
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,580
Your clothes!

101
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,750
I've brought a friend to meet Madam.

102
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,950
Is she available now?

103
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,980
Madam is copying scriptures.

104
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,180
Please wait a moment.

105
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,750
Why do you all refer to
Yan Li's mother as "Madam"

106
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,080
instead of "Princess"?

107
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,690
I'll tell you later.

108
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,320
Just call her "Madam."

109
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,450
[Princess Yi]

110
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,340
Greetings, Madam.

111
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,240
I haven't seen you for over a year.

112
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,100
Now, you're looking
more and more like your father.

113
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,670
Who is this?

114
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,190
She's Qin Wan,
the ninth child of the Qin family.

115
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,520
Her father is Qin Liang.

116
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,320
Nice to meet you, Madam.

117
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,350
I didn't know about your visit,

118
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,010
so I didn't prepare any gifts.

119
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,460
I came here without notice.

120
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,990
Apologies for my rudeness.

121
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,300
This is not much of a gift,

122
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,010
but I'd like you to have it.

123
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,630
I can't accept it.

124
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,870
Chi

125
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,550
has finally brought a lady to meet me.

126
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,840
I'm very delighted.

127
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,409
Please take it.

128
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,400
Maybe it'll remind you of me
in the future.

129
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,620
Thank you, Madam.

130
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,900
During our stay in the capital,

131
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,380
we'll pay regular visits to you.

132
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,140
No need.

133
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,310
Just look after Li for me.

134
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,310
Chi,

135
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,070
if possible,

136
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,550
leave the capital soon.

137
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,400
I guess this hairpin

138
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,160
symbolizes the love
between Madam and Prince Yi.

139
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,700
Why did she give it to me,

140
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,350
instead of saving it for Yan Li?

141
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,280
Do you know about

142
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,190
the rebellion staged by Fu Chengye
20 years ago,

143
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,100
the then
Sichuan pacification commissioner?

144
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,270
The Fu family were all executed
for that reason.

145
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,400
Madam is Fu Chengye's younger sister.

146
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,260
Then Prince Yi...

147
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,140
Prince Yi

148
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,080
reported to Fu Chengye.

149
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,950
He was the inspector-general of Gongzhou,

150
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,750
named Yan Han.

151
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,220
Prince Yi was a farmer's son
who later enlisted with military forces.

152
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,480
Given his brilliant track records,

153
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
Fu Chengye valued him

154
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,650
and married his own daughter to him.

155
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,620
[Tier-one loyal warrior]

156
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,270
[Fu Residence]

157
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,390
When Prince Yi discovered
Fu Chengye's intent to start a coup,

158
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,580
Madam was already pregnant with Yan Li.

159
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,220
So, while pretending to escort Madam
to her hometown before labor,

160
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,750
he was secretly rushing to the capital
to deliver the message.

161
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,820
Later, he was informed

162
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,950
that the Imperial Guards
led by the Crown Prince

163
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,010
had been ambushed at the Storm Ridge.

164
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,580
That was the current Emperor's first time

165
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,710
to command a troop as the Crown Prince.

166
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,080
By the time he realized it was a trap,

167
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,420
he had been surrounded
by arrows dipped in tung oil.

168
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,470
Prince Yi hurried to the Storm Ridge
overnight

169
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,190
and single-handedly rescued
the Emperor from raging flames.

170
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:20,990
Regrettably,

171
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,450
the reinforcements arrived

172
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,850
only to find Prince Yi had been burned
beyond recognition.

173
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,220
Yet until his dying breath,
he had been guarding in front of

174
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,950
the severely injured Emperor.

175
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,970
The Emperor was deeply moved
by Yan Han's loyalty.

176
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,100
After ascending the throne,
His Majesty overruled all objections

177
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,500
and honored Yan as "Prince Yi"

178
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,100
in memory of his allegiance.

179
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,090
The Emperor also took Yan Li in
as his godson

180
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,280
and bestowed upon him
the imperial surname,

181
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,870
"Yan."

182
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,740
So, Yan Li is just
an honorary heir of a prince.

183
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,980
None of the capital's bigwigs

184
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,580
truly consider him
as part of the royal family.

185
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,880
Why wasn't Madam granted
the title of princess?

186
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,010
Mrs. Yan meant to join Yan Han in death,

187
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,310
but she couldn't bear the thought of

188
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,700
Yan Li becoming parentless at a young age.

189
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,670
After declining rewards and honors,

190
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,030
she started living in seclusion.

191
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,390
Fortunately, Grandmother

192
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,580
treats Yan Li like her own grandson.

193
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,550
As long as Grandmother lives,

194
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,750
nobody in the palace
would dare to openly disrespect him.

195
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,520
A lifelong commitment...

196
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,720
Madam and Prince Yi

197
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,660
really loved each other dearly.

198
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,580
I suppose this wooden hairpin contains

199
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,030
Madam's wish for us to be

200
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,850
a loving couple forever.

201
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,020
But if misfortunes befall you,

202
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,490
I'll definitely not join you in death.

203
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,400
I'll search every corner on earth

204
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,720
to hunt down

205
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,920
those who harmed you.

206
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,680
Your words...

207
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,920
have really put my mind...

208
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,100
at ease.

209
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,890
You can rest assured.

210
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,280
Even if you die,

211
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,770
I'll carry on with my life.

212
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,180
I'm assured.

213
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,380
You can rest assured too.

214
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,330
By no means I'll die before you do.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,600
Master!

216
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,480
[Capital Prefecture]

217
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,910
I misled

218
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,700
those spies
to the Maquis of Zhongyong's mansion.

219
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,450
Have the Dove Unit

220
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,740
take them for a tour around the capital,

221
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,010
so they can't get in our way.

222
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,570
Got it.

223
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,500
Your Highness,

224
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,190
Master Wan,

225
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,700
I have a small finding now.

226
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,710
The capital prefect has been waiting.

227
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,840
Please lead the way, Constable Zhang.

228
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,460
No intimate contact here.

229
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,130
I won't share a carriage with you anymore.

230
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,460
Not here?

231
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,610
Then anywhere else is fine?

232
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,290
Thank you for coming.

233
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,430
I was just wondering

234
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,670
where the perpetrator captured
these three victims,

235
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,980
since there is zero connection
among these girls,

236
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,880
and their workplaces are far from

237
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,500
where their bodies were dumped.

238
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,980
No need to rush, Capital Prefect.

239
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,270
Constable Zhan, can you

240
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,530
get us some red strings,

241
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,090
red pens

242
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,340
and pins?

243
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,610
Sure.

244
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,420
What does Your Highness need those for?

245
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,620
The murderer hasn't left a trail.

246
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,520
It means this person acts

247
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,620
with extreme caution and prudence.

248
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,700
People of this kind

249
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,030
usually commit crimes in familiar places

250
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,820
and premeditate the timing

251
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,670
and routes.

252
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,100
This perpetrator kills every half a month.

253
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,860
If he ran a tailor shop independently,

254
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,980
he wouldn't have the time

255
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,820
to look around for preys in the capital.

256
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,460
If his shop were frequently closed,

257
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,390
it would surely arouse suspicion.

258
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,200
So,

259
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,390
the three places
where he dumped the bodies

260
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,450
can tell us the possible murder site.

261
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,930
But these places
aren't close to one another.

262
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,080
Your Highness.

263
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,150
Constable Zhan,

264
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,410
please put these pins

265
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,570
onto the map,

266
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,560
where the murderer disposed of the bodies.

267
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,730
The first victim

268
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,460
was found under Yushui Bridge.

269
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,340
The second victim

270
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,070
was left in an abandoned house.

271
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,030
The third one

272
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,560
was discovered in an alley.

273
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,230
Red strings.

274
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,740
The curfew starts at 11 p.m.,

275
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,310
and is lifted at 3 a.m..

276
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,310
To avoid being spotted,

277
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,270
the murderer had to discard the bodies

278
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,150
and return home
within this period of time.

279
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,620
Besides, he couldn't use trolleys

280
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,310
or horses to transport the bodies.

281
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,980
It is hard for an average-sized adult man

282
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,700
to walk four to five li within two hours

283
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,340
while carrying a body

284
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,150
weighing about 50 kilograms.

285
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,500
Plus the time spent in resting,

286
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,390
hiding from patrols

287
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,580
and dealing with the bodies,

288
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,500
it would take at least three hours.

289
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,670
The rest of the time would be just enough
for him to go home

290
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,270
and prepare to open the shop.

291
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,090
This area is

292
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,500
no more than five li away

293
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,630
from each dump site.

294
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,990
Bai Feng,

295
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,790
take some people with you

296
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,240
and look for the shops

297
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,220
with stairways.

298
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,580
The murderer could be a tailor,

299
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,820
and his shop

300
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,950
might be rented.

301
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,030
I got it.

302
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,070
Don't just check the shops.

303
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,790
As His Highness said,

304
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,270
the perpetrator is meticulous.

305
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,980
He probably has

306
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,840
a different hideout in this area.

307
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,070
Make sure you check
every house with stairways.

308
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,700
Yes.

309
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,220
Bai Feng.

310
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,340
In just a few hours,

311
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,740
we'll hit the deadline.

312
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,580
Take this token with you.

313
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,910
Ignore today's curfew.

314
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,740
Set out now.

315
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,410
Your Highness,

316
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,460
I have found some diners

317
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,280
that sell fish porridge
in the West Market.

318
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,630
I'll go with you to the West Market

319
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,580
to interview the fish vendors.

320
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,100
Okay.

321
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,690
I want to go to the morgue

322
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,180
to see if I can find new clues
from the bodies.

323
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,910
I will accompany Master Wan.

324
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

325
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,940
If anything happens,

326
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,610
remember to use the Red Flare.

327
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,790
I'm just a lowly prostitute.

328
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,090
How am I able to afford your education?

329
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,620
Why do you have to be a boy?

330
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,270
Why are you a boy?

331
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,180
Tell me.

332
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,060
Why can't you be a girl?

333
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,859
Why...

334
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,210
Why aren't you a girl?

335
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,530
If you were a girl,

336
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,940
I could pimp you out

337
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,819
for money.

338
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,609
Why do you have to be a boy?

339
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:17,920
Why?

340
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,829
Why do you have to be a boy?

341
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,390
Get me more liquor.

342
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:04,980
Your Highness,

343
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,260
there is a message

344
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,990
from the Marquis of Zhongyong.

345
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,260
The coroner I recommended

346
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,540
has found some clues.

347
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,410
Chi is

348
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,950
hunting for the suspect.

349
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,050
What else did the marquis say?

350
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,740
His Grace

351
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,950
told Your Highness not to worry.

352
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,500
Good.

353
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,910
If this case can be solved on time,

354
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,190
the Marquis of Zhongyong
will surely be rewarded.

355
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,740
[Morgue]

356
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,850
Capital Prefect.

357
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,500
Mr. Fang.

358
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,870
Where are the three victims' bodies?

359
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,700
Their bodies?

360
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,670
Capital Prefect, didn't you just order

361
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,880
the bodies to be taken away?

362
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,440
I never gave that order.

363
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,350
What about the victims' clothes?

364
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,810
Taken away too, of course.

365
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,270
I was truly baffled.

366
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,710
It's freezing cold now.

367
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,020
The bodies could've been buried

368
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,870
after the case is closed.

369
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,350
Do you know who took the bodies away?

370
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,190
I certainly do.

371
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,060
That was the officer
who brought the bodies over

372
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,790
last time with Constable Zhan.

373
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,670
It's Prince Cheng's doing again.

374
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,980
How could this happen?

375
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,210
He took all the evidence away.

376
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,810
How are we supposed to solve the case?

377
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,990
Let's go back to the prefect's office.

378
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,720
His Highness will
definitely find new evidence.

379
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,590
Gentlemen,

380
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,920
you came early.

381
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,100
The cooking has just started.

382
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,980
In the West Market,

383
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,110
our fish porridge

384
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,430
has the most authentic local flavor.

385
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,030
Serve some side dishes first.

386
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,110
We'd like to taste

387
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,980
your famous local-flavored porridge.

388
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,310
Alright, just a moment.

389
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,750
Your Highness, do you think

390
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,970
this is where the third victim

391
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,010
last ate?

392
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,540
The third victim

393
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,810
lived outside the city.

394
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,220
She rarely came in town for procurements.

395
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,550
I bet she'd love to taste

396
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,490
the most authentic
local-flavored fish porridge.

397
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,110
Food's coming!

398
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,020
Mister,

399
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,150
look at this sachet of yours.

400
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,540
Are you getting married soon?

401
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,740
You're mistaken, sir.

402
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,260
This sachet isn't mine.

403
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,850
Previously, a young lady
came for porridge

404
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,130
and left it behind.

405
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,150
Well,

406
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,150
I thought she'd come back for it,

407
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,490
so I hung it on my waist
for it to be easily noticed.

408
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,640
Do you remember

409
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,520
what that young lady was wearing?

410
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,760
She was in...

411
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,560
ordinary ko-hemp, as I recall.

412
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,760
Your Highness,

413
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,090
the third victim

414
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,370
was exactly wearing ko-hemp clothes.

415
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,640
I-Is that young lady dead?

416
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,310
Then...

417
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,260
this sachet...

418
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,840
How...

419
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,550
should I...

420
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,870
This is a contract about the making of
a wedding dress.

421
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,470
The pickup date is precisely

422
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,320
the day of the victim's missing.

423
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,110
Shopkeeper!

424
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,020
Sir.

425
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,190
Sit down, miss.

426
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,430
Have some tea.

427
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,960
Take a rest.

428
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,460
Thank you.

429
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,450
There are only a few stitches to make.

430
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,220
The dress will be finished soon.

431
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,080
Thank you, sir.

432
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,400
How kind of you.

433
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,630
It's Jinyi Shop!

434
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,880
Bai Feng,

435
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,320
follow the map to find Jinyi Shop.

436
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,800
Catch the murderer.

437
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,190
All the physical evidence
has gone missing now,

438
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,060
so we can't afford to
lose the testimonies too.

439
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,590
Yes!

440
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,050
Prefect Zheng,

441
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,260
even if we capture the culprit as planned,

442
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,350
without physical evidence,

443
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,430
Prince Cheng can still make false claims.

444
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,740
What is there to do then?

445
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,090
I suggest you submit
a penitential memorial.

446
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,720
It's time for Master Wan to leave

447
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,370
and prepare to attend the royal banquet.

448
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,870
I'll write the memorial right away.

449
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,620
Master Wan,

450
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,630
I deeply appreciate your help.

451
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,260
Now, you need to think about
tonight's royal banquet.

452
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,320
Isn't it time for the Emperor
to meet the talent I hired?

453
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,020
Do I really have to go?

454
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,830
The Marquis of Zhongyong

455
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,690
would definitely make Qin Wan go.

456
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,780
[Capital Prefecture]

457
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,300
I'm not going.

458
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,590
It's the annual New Year's
royal gathering.

459
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,980
You've been absent from it every year.

460
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,260
This is a family reunion.

461
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,660
How could you not join us?

462
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,460
Which of those people is my family?

463
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,540
I didn't share the same surname with them

464
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,740
until 20 years ago.

465
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,410
I'd hate to be a bother.

466
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,480
I'd better spare them
from the awkwardness of having an outsider

467
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,340
like me around.

468
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,860
How are you an outsider?

469
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,720
I'm leaving now.

470
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,380
You...

471
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,840
Tomorrow morning,

472
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,460
I'll pay a New Year's visit to Madam.

473
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,190
Okay!

474
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,580
I'll be waiting for you.

475
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,960
What are you doing here?

476
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,500
Chi specially asked me
to prepare clothes and jewelry for you.

477
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,190
I also need to

478
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,430
instruct you on court etiquette
and codes of conduct.

479
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,260
You have no idea

480
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,740
how calculating and cunning

481
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,980
the capital's noble ladies are.

482
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,430
How can I send you to the lion's den

483
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,020
without giving you some tips first?

484
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,150
What do I have to fear?

485
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,670
I'll just pretend not to
understand anything,

486
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,630
being all quiet and still.

487
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,500
Let them scheme with all they can—
it'll all be useless!

488
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,870
Impressive. What a smart strategy—

489
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,980
playing dumb.

490
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,170
Ning,

491
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,460
I have only one reminder for you.

492
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,190
During the royal banquet,

493
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,870
I'll be visiting the Empress Dowager
in Funing Palace.

494
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,330
If anyone bullies you two,

495
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,590
don't hesitate to fight back.

496
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,460
The blood of resistance
runs in our family.

497
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,630
Everyone knows about
Grandmother's hot temper.

498
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,320
Chi,

499
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,460
you should be telling me

500
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,190
not to strike too hard instead.

501
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,260
Chi,

502
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,780
why didn't you ask Little Wan'er

503
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,630
what she fed you before eating it?

504
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,960
Wan offered it to me.
Did I even need to ask?

505
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,700
This pill helps him stay sober.

506
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,220
Not exactly alcohol-proof,

507
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,220
but your tolerance will skyrocket.

508
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,360
I want one too.

509
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,840
Why do you get to be a woman,

510
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,210
and I don't?

511
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,830
You're merely the daughter of
the Duke of Zhong.

512
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,730
[Yan Zhen]
[A royal princess]

513
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,700
How dare you sit next to me.

514
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,780
Who do you think you are?

515
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,050
[Feng Chenbi]

516
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,400
Maids,

517
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,020
get her a new seat.

518
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,220
His Majesty commanded Noble Consort Su
to preside over this banquet,

519
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,550
so my seating here

520
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,370
carries his imperial sanction.

521
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,150
Your Highness had better
mind your manners.

522
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,150
Otherwise,

523
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,410
you'll be a disgrace to the Empress.

524
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,000
The girl in the chief seat

525
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,600
is Princess Yan Zhen,
the Empress's daughter.

526
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,060
The girl in the secondary seat

527
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,060
is Feng Chenbi,

528
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,160
whose father, the Duke of Zhong, is
Noble Consort Su's confidant.

529
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,090
These two girls

530
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,390
are arch nemeses.

531
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,350
But whenever Qin Zhaoyu shows up,

532
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,680
they two will immediately become allies.

533
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,130
Is Feng Chenbi

534
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,410
also into the Crown Prince?

535
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,460
Not all the rivalries among noble ladies

536
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,790
throughout history are about men, right?

537
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,190
This banquet was organized
by Noble Consort Su.

538
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,660
The Empress didn't take part in it at all.

539
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,790
So, you can see

540
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,920
who's having an edge now.

541
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,910
Royal concubines fight one another
with all means

542
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,560
only for their children's sake.

543
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,490
A mother's favor elevates her son.

544
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,510
That's why Prince Cheng always has
the upper hand over the Crown Prince.

545
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,820
It is also why the Qin family
is facing many obstacles

546
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,210
in its every attempt

547
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,560
to marry a daughter into the royal family.

548
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,610
A boisterous occasion, isn't it?

549
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,340
Yes, indeed.

550
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,610
Your aunt

551
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,600
should've taken the lowest seat.

552
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,650
But the Empress likes Qin Zhaoyu a lot,

553
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,650
so your aunt could get a seat
in the middle row.

554
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,640
Speaking of which,

555
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,460
given your help to the Crown Prince
this time,

556
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,790
the Empress might treat you differently.

557
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,120
If that happens...

558
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,430
The Emperor arrives!

559
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,820
[Zhao Shuhua]
[Empress]

560
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,080
[Feng Lingsu]
[Noble Consort Su]

561
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,700
Greetings, Your Majesty!

562
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,570
The Empress Dowager
is feeling slightly unwell.

563
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,920
I'll keep you company on her behalf.

564
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,700
Everyone,

565
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,330
just make yourself at home.

566
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,500
Thank Your Majesty.

567
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,590
Rise.

568
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,420
Ning,

569
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,430
is the lady beside you

570
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,870
the Grand Princess's

571
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,390
god-granddaughter?

572
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,610
Yes, Your Majesty,

573
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,240
she is.

574
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,510
I'm Qin Wan. Greetings, Your Majesty.

575
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,930
I wish Your Majesty
longevity and wellness.

576
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,260
Forgo the formalities.

577
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,990
Thank Your Majesty.

578
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,490
The Grand Princess

579
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,570
has told me what you did

580
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,910
in Jingzhou.

581
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,990
In the letter,

582
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,590
she particularly asked me

583
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,590
to take good care of

584
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,910
her dear

585
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,050
Wan.

586
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,500
If not,

587
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,580
she'll come to the capital with her whip.

588
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,630
I am

589
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,040
very much frightened.

590
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,590
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

591
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,390
I promise I'll take good care of myself

592
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,110
and not worry the Grand Princess.

593
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,520
Don't concern about me, Your Majesty.

594
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,540
The prescription I made
for the Grand Princess

595
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,150
is nerve-soothing.

596
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,460
Her Highness

597
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,590
hasn't raised her whip for a long time.

598
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,430
Are Miss Qin's medical skills

599
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,490
really good enough

600
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
to change

601
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,020
a person's temperament?

602
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,100
Your Majesty,

603
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,840
I'm an eyewitness

604
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,350
to Wan's medical competence.

605
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,060
In Jingzhou,

606
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,390
people all refer to her
as a medical fairy.

607
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,950
What a surprise
that the Marquis of Zhongyong

608
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,950
has a medical fairy as his daughter.

609
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,020
He is a blessed father.

610
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
That's a much higher honor

611
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,520
than the hollow title
of the capital's most talented woman.

612
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,410
Women excel in different fields.

613
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,220
Why compare them with one another?

614
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,830
Be they good at arts, medicine,

615
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,260
needlework, cooking or anything,

616
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,460
they deserve respect and admiration

617
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,660
as long as they are

618
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,440
sensible women of integrity.

619
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,190
Well said.

620
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,330
I can't agree more with

621
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,670
Miss Qin's opinion.

622
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,670
Return to your seats, ladies.

623
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,800
Thank Your Majesty.

624
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,800
Why are you still out here?

625
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,260
Are you waiting for me?

626
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,280
Or are you afraid

627
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,180
that Father will ask you

628
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,780
about those women's murders?

629
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,240
Had I known you cared
so much about this case,

630
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,760
I would've asked Father
to let you handle it.

631
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,150
You are the Crown Prince
who protects the capital,

632

while I'm just the inferior Prince Cheng.

633
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,540
How could I compare myself
with Your Highness?

May Your Majesty be well in the new year.

in the new year.

I still have to make a report.

00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,590
on this New Year's Eve,

679
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,830
while the people are celebrating,

680
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,780
I can't help but

681
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,740
think of those brutally murdered girls

682
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,140
and their families.

683
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,450
It really unsettles me.

684
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,540
How can they spend
this joyous occasion happily

685
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,110
with grief and anger
weighing on their hearts?

686
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,720
The time limit has been reached.

687
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,610
Crown Prince, please give updates

688
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,430
on the investigation of this case,

689
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,230
so as to ease the people's minds.

690
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,500
Father,

691
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,890
significant progress has been made
for this case.

692
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,420
It will be solved very soon.

693
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,670
What progress?

694
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,360
I...

695
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,310
I...

696
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,950
I

697
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,940
have a report to present.

698
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,910
I'll allow it.

699
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
Your Majesty,

700
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,950
the case about the murdered girls

701
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,210
was just solved today.

702
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,950
The Crown Prince was reluctant

703
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,490
to bring it up in the royal banquet
on the New Year's Eve,

704
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,620
so I didn't dare to present the report.

705
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,820
This memorial was written
by the capital prefect

706
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,870
to state the conclusion of this case.

707
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,530
Please read it, Your Majesty.

708
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,330
The cold-blooded and brutal murderer

709
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,489
failed to take another girl's life,
thanks to the timely arrival of

710
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,020
Constable Zhan
from the capital prefecture.

711
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
This tailor

712
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,159
committed gruesome murders
out of jealousy of

713
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,760
women marrying up.

714
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,310
How astounding it is

715
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,590
to uncover

716
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,949
such a vicious murderer

717
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,710
in my reign!

718
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,150
Your Majesty,

719
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,449
this person

720
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,179
was traumatized from being abused

721
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,710
in childhood by his mother.

722
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,810
This brutal killer deserves no sympathy.

723
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,639
It has to be made clear
that his motive was purely personal

724
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,120
and unrelated to Your Majesty's reign.

725
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,350
The fact that this bizarre murder case

726
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,310
could be solved within several days

727
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,230
exactly proves

728
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,540
Your Majesty's administration
effective and reliable.

729
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,460
Good.

730
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,980
Rise and talk.

731
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,830
-Thank you, Father.
-Thank Your Majesty.

732
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,500
The Crown Prince and the capital prefect

733
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,900
have both done a good job.

734
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,140
Besides, I've noticed

735
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,330
from the capital prefect's memorial

736
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,910
that some obvious clues

737
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,500
were revealed

738
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,690
by

739
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,040
the coroner.

740
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,830
How come this talent

741
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,710
hadn't made

742
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,640
any notable achievements before?

743
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,290
Your Majesty,

744
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,860
this coroner

745
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,940
was recently recommended
by the Crown Prince's royal guardian—

746
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,710
Qin Shu,

747
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,200
the Marquis of Zhongyong.

748
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,420
Your Majesty,

749
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,980
for the wellbeing of the country,

750
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,380
I'd gladly do anything
within my capacity.

751
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,910
Mr. Qin,

752
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,320
I appreciate it.

753
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,120
Your Majesty,

754
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,910
there is

755
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,820
a memorial asking for punishment

756
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,270
awaiting your review.

757
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,040
The capital prefect

758
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,830
admits that he failed to
keep the evidence safe

759
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,690
and is now asking for punishment.

760
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,180
This...

761
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,830
The victims' clothes went missing.

762
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,620
Their bodies were destroyed.

763
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,230
I can't believe

764
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,640
the capital prefecture would make

765
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,490
such a huge mistake right under my nose!

766
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,310
I vouch for the capital prefect.

767
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,710
Every word in the memorial

768
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,840
is absolutely true.

769
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,960
In that case,

770
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,270
I'll assign you

771
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,420
to arrest those

772
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,320
who destroyed the evidence

773
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,060
and obstructed the official investigation

774
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,910
immediately.

775
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,330
Yes,

776
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,920
as Your Majesty commands.

777
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,820
Crown Prince,

778
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,060
you dealt with this matter properly

779
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,170
and meticulously.

780
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,920
As we are

781
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,400
celebrating the New Year,

782
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,430
maintaining

783
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,930
the peace and prosperity of the country is

784
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,430
indeed our priority.

785
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,980
Thank you for your praise, Father.

786
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,600
Alright.

787
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,240
Be seated then, everyone.

788
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,570
-Thank you, Father.
-Thank Your Majesty.

789
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,830
Come on,

790
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,670
raise your glasses.

791
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,430
Let us

792
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,460
toast to

793
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,230
a prosperous new year.

794
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,870
May Your Majesty be well in the new year.

795
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,920
[Empress Dowager]

796
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,090
Your Majesty!

797
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,780
Are you feeling unwell, Your Highness?

798
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,910
All this coughing is making my chest ache.

799
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,840
Shall I ask for a royal physician?

800
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,390
No need.

801
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,060
It happens every year.

802
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,840
This is the New Year's Eve.

803
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,640
I'd hate to disturb the Emperor.

804
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,300
My chest feels very tight.

805
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,690
Help me step out for some fresh air.

806
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,350
Yes.

807
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,620
Slowly.

808
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,650
Your Majesty?

809
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,630
Your Majesty?

810
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,780
Your Majesty!

811
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,840
Your Majesty!

812
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,230
Help!

813
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,540
Get the royal physicians here!

814
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,850
Go to Chongming Palace

815
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,480
to inform the Emperor now!

816
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,280
Yes.

817
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,660
Your Majesty?

818
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:56,970
Your Majesty?

819
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,650
Let the evil-repelling ritual commence!

820
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,660
The player of that general

821
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,930
must be from the Imperial Guards.

822
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,790
He has excellent martial skills.

823
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,430
Indeed.

824
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,020
Very good.

825
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,360
I, Yan Chi,

826
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,660
wish Your Majesty

827
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,990
a lifetime of wellness!

828
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,290
He...

829
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,140
He's Chi, isn't he?

830
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,020
In the blink of an eye,

831
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,100
how did you go from a real general

832
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,910
to a fake one?

833
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,820
Your Majesty,

834
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,100
the people will benefit from

835
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,020
your wisdom.

836
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,980
I stand ready to repel all evil

837
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,060
for Your Majesty,

838
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,980
as it is also my duty.

839
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,910
Good.

840
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,870
I'd love to hear that!

841
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,230
Now,

842
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,870
you're the vice minister of
the Ministry of Justice.

843
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,630
You shall

844
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,000
safeguard the country's peace for me.

845
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,590
Thank Your Majesty!

846
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,870
Alright.

847
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,790
You may rise.

848
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,920
Thank Your Majesty.

849
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,790
How

850
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,710
considerate of Chi.

851
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,840
Now that the ritual is over,

852
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,050
Empress,

853
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,270
let's go to

854
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,580
Zhenghua Gate

855
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,510
to celebrate this occasion

856
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,950
with all the commoners.

857
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,950
Yes, as Your Majesty commands.

858
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,460
Good.

859
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,460
Your Majesty!

860
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,430
Your Majesty,

861
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,280
the Empress Dowager...

862
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,740
is in critical condition!

863
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,260
How come?

864
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,540
Her Majesty suddenly fell ill.

865
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,460
Then...

866
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,180
why didn't she ask for a royal physician?

867
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,020
All the royal physicians are

868
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,430
in Funing Palace now.

869
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,660
The problem is,

870
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,230
Her Majesty can't ingest any medical soup.

871
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,060
Her Majesty is lingering

872
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,390
between life and death!

873
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,110
Prepare my carriage!

874
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,620
Little Wan'er,

875
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,750
please go check on the Empress Dowager.

876
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,950
She treats me nicely.

877
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,100
The situation is unclear now.

878
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,870
Any rash decisions could
turn us into someone else's pawns.

879
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,100
Don't worry. If possible,

880
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,560
I'll definitely help her.

881
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,170
Okay.

882
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,900
Your Majesty.

883
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:45,620
Your Majesty,

884
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,750
this is the beginning of a new year.

885
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,580
If the people

886
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,470
can't see the Emperor, the Empress
and the Crown Prince,

887
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,620
I'm afraid they'll be thrown into panic.

888
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,350
Your Majesty!

889
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,660
Your Majesty, the country's wellness
comes before anything!
