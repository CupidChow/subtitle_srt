00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Madam Jiu, can you stay in the mansion for a few days to take care of the house?

9
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I will be very grateful

10
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is something I should do

11
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Come, clean up the plum garden for Madam Jiu

12
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Everything is used to take advantage of the princess

13
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, you can go in and see

14
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
it is good

15
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
fast

16
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Madam Jiu, please sit

17
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Please sit

18
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Bring the tea

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes

20
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you for your help, your highness

21
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now I can go back to my room

22
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have Han Yue

23
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's just a defense weapon

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But you can save people

25
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Giving you is the most useful

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Han Yue's talent is light and light

27
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Since you are generous to give it to me

28
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I will not disobey Han Yue's order

29
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I heard Madam Jiu

30
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:41,640
mentioned Shen Siqing's Da Li Temple to correct the

31
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,000
I found Shen Siqing's case was really well-written and simple

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I found Shen Siqing's case was really well-written and simple

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's really a great thing

34
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's really a great thing

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Shen Yi has been a local official for many years

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There must be something unique about it

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Shen Siqing said that the prison is a place for the people to settle

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I am a man

39
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But...

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Speaking of prison

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When can I take over the case of the Marquis?

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have made an appointment with the House of Huo to meet again tomorrow

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's good

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Please forgive me for having to take care of the Princess Royal

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I will ask you another day

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I am sorry

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Please do not mind

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Master

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You mentioned Shen Yi

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Fuling's girl's face was pale

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They are not willing to talk to me

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But why are they so fond of the people they admire?

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Wan

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This time you not only helped Huo Huai Xin

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You caught Wei Wu and kept Wusha Cat

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You also helped her to get promoted

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Now she must regret that she left you and Huo Ning's marriage

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I only ask to check my body as soon as possible

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Everything else has nothing to do with me

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Huo Huai Xin has kept her body

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But I don't know when I can get rid of her

62
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Timing & subitles brought to you by 中剧独播

63
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,120
I do not need you to give up

64
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
I did not!

65
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,620
It's just that I am very tired

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
But I just can't resist her.

67
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,200
I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

68
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,360
That's all I could do for her.

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,720
I just hope I could bring her home soon.

70
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,040
Let her rest in peace.

71
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,880
That's what we Yue family think.

72
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,560
Luckily, I have Xiaowan's help.

73
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,200
Brother Zhen will find it out soon.

74
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,480
Really?

75
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,940
bundle

76
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,680
Do you know the MSG?

77
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,320
I just know some medical skills.

78
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,620
Just do something fr alma.

79
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,440
Anyway, thank you boys.

80
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,320
Love you with all my heart as always.

81
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,560
Farewell

82
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,820
Your father and your book support properly

83
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,600
It doesn't seem that he's awich

84
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,280
They are all in this world

85
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
The son find beauty, he can live a good life

86
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,200
he takes the credit from the Duke of Song

87
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,220
and is worthy

88
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,960
Maybe I just need to think and do things

89
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,440
So I don't like the people with induced scheming

90
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,600
No wonder grandma says that you live too well

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,760
It's because I need automatic

92
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,960
There are hundreds of people in the village

93
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
And there are maids and servants around to teach

94
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,160
How can such a big living person

95
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,960
die in there without knowing

96
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
My brother-in-law just went to pick up a relative

97
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,560
And he was framed on his head

98
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,960
But he doesn't even know what kind of Song Rou looks like

99
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,760
Do you think the one without a head is Song Rou?

100
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,960
No matter who he is

101
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Only the body can tell the truth

102
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,560
Comfortable

103
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,160
These two days

104
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,560
Prepare some good gifts

105
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Pick a good day to go to Qin's mansion

106
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,760
And set the wedding date of Ning'er and Jiu Niangzi

107
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,360
No, I finally got married

108
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Ning'er can't marry that bad guy

109
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,760
Go, go, go

110
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,960
The rich man's sister

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,560
That girl is not an ordinary person

112
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
Just by her ability

113
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,560
It's guaranteed to make our Huo family prosperous

114
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,360
Our days of prosperity are behind

115
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,760
Really?

116
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Trust me, this matter is settled

117
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,560
Madam, today is the wedding day

118
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,160
I'm going to the wedding hall

119
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,760
I'm going to the wedding hall

120
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,360
Madam, I'm so nervous today

121
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,160
I'm so relieved to know that the eldest princess is awake

122
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Why don't you worry at all?

123
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,960
Unprecedented worry will only make people upset

124
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,560
I only saved the eldest princess

125
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Let the Hou family owe me this favor

126
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,960
We have a chance to act according to the plan

127
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,160
This risk must be done

128
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Fortunately, the whole Hou family is good people

129
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,360
Otherwise, we won't have a good day

130
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,840
Next, I will help you

131
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,760
Ghost

132
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,960
鬼

133
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,160
Niangzi

134
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,160
It's the ghost from the pockets of theothless

135
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
There's no ghost here. Don't be afraid.

136
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
But I saw it clearly.

137
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
What you saw is not a ghost.

138
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
It's someone else.

139
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Uncle Bai, I've asked people to search the area around Mei Yuan.

140
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
But I didn't find anyone suspicious around here.

141
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Could it be Song Rou?

142
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
She likes Mei Yuan?

143
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,760
She could find the residence of Jiu Niangzi in such a short time.

144
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
She could also avoid my guards.

145
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
She must be very familiar with the mansion.

146
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Light.

147
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Did you find anything?

148
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
The man in the mirror has tried to cover the traces.

149
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Please have a look.

150
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
These flowers have been cut down.

151
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
But they all fall in the same direction.

152
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
It's obvious that the man in the mirror was very quick.

153
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
It's true.

154
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
He must have been here before.

155
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
That's why he left traces on the stage.

156
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Look.

157
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Those flowers are exactly like what Xiao Wan said.

158
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
But if it's not a ghost,

159
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
why would that man hang in the air?

160
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
And he doesn't have a head.

161
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
As long as that man has learned the art of light,

162
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
it's not difficult.

163
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Use this flower pot to stand on that stone pillar.

164
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Then use the lower part of the armor to cover your feet.

165
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
You can feel the power of the air.

166
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
When you two are frightened, you can run away.

167
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Let me do it.

168
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
It's true.

169
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
This is the name of the fake ghost.

170
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
In order to disturb people's hearts,

171
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
he made a fool of the people's ears.

172
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
You're going to the banquet tomorrow.

173
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
He chose to do it at this time.

174
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
I'm afraid he wants to scare you away.

175
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
The ninth lady wants to have a banquet.

176
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
There are only my father and my father in the mansion.

177
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,760
But only my husband and my wife and Ning'er know

178
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
how to reveal the secret.

179
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I haven't told anyone.

180
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,760
I...I might have leaked some information to Wei Yanzhi.

181
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
What did you tell her?

182
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
When we were competing, she was worried.

183
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I didn't talk about the banquet.

184
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
I said that Xiao Wan would help.

185
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
At that time, the guard of the Song family, Wei Cheng, was also there.

186
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Why are you so reckless?

187
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,760
I will send people to investigate Wei and the guard.

188
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,760
The key to this is to find the origin of this dress.

189
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Maybe we can find the person who played the ghost.

190
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,760
This dress is similar to the dead person's dress.

191
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,760
The color is bright and the fabric is new.

192
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
The wrinkles on the top are still there.

193
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
The scent of the wood has not yet disappeared.

194
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,760
It should be the new clothes that I just took out of the alley.

195
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
There is a house at the right side of the embroidery.

196
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
I don't know what it is.

197
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Madam, that house should be the Song Yanmou.

198
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Song Yanmou? Why?

199
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
I learned from the female palace maids that I used to recognize the fabric.

200
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
This dress should be red-brown.

201
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,760
It is said that nothing is not stained. Only Song Yanmou can be seen.

202
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Fuling, you have helped me a lot.

203
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
This person should be a man with six feet in height.

204
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
He will use his left hand.

205
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
I want to hear the truth.

206
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
If this person is pretending to be a ghost,

207
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,760
he should put the dress on the top of his head.

208
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,760
If it is too high, it will appear to be empty.

209
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
From the position of Fuling at the time,

210
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,760
the window frame is about one meter higher than the flower bed.

211
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
This dress is about four feet seven inches.

212
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
According to what the prince just demonstrated,

213
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,760
the dress is on top of the flower bed.

214
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,760
This man is at least five feet seven inches tall.

215
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,760
This is the reason why he could not put the dress on the bottom of his head.

216
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
What Fuling saw from the window

217
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,760
was the effect of the dress being made up.

218
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
The criminal only needs to wear night clothes in advance.

219
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Then he can hide the legs of the dress in the night.

220
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
That's right.

221
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Moreover, ordinary men are not often over six feet in height.

222
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
The criminal must have attracted attention.

223
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,760
So I infer that this person is five feet seven inches tall.

224
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
But not six feet.

225
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,760
How can we know that he is a left-handed person?

226
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,760
This is thanks to Fuling's recognition that this is Xiao Hong Sha.

227
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
What do you mean?

228
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Normal people should write with their right hand.

229
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Left hand is long and thin.

230
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Write with your left hand.

231
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
But those who use their left hand

232
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
are left-handed people.

233
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
The right hand is long and thin.

234
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
It is still the left hand that is long and thin.

235
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
The right hand is long and thin.

236
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Write with your left hand.

237
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
But those who use their left hand

238
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
are left-handed people.

239
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Write with your right hand.

240
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
But those who use their right hand

241
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
are left-handed people.

242
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Write with your right hand.

243
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
That is why my right hand is covered with ink.

244
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,760
The ink in the sleeve is the same position as the dress.

245
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
The Ninth Lady is a goddess.

246
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,760
We can ask the maid to check if this is the spare one.

247
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,760
You suspect that Song family has a ghost.

248
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,760
If it's related to them, then it's not safe.

249
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Waner, you come with me tonight.

250
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Fu Ling, pack up.

251
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,760
We can't be late. We need to block the Eastern Courtyard.

252
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
We can't let the people of Song's Mansion leave.

253
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Uncle, wait.

254
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Before we have any solid evidence,

255
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
we can't break the seal with Song's Company.

256
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,760
We should ask Huo Huai Xin to come out first.

257
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Okay.

258
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
I'll go to Huo's Mansion now.

259
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
You two separate into two groups.

260
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,760
You two will ask around in the Eastern and Western Courtyards.

261
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
After that, you send them back to their place.

262
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
You can't talk to them on the way.

263
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Yes.

264
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Hurry up.

265
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Yes.

266
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Your Highness, I've arranged everything.

267
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Marquis An Yang, Your Highness.

268
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Lord Huo, you came here late at night.

269
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Is there any clue about Rou's case?

270
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Commandant Wei, calm down.

271
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,760
There's something I need you to identify.

272
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Guards.

273
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
This is Rou's wedding dress?

274
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Lord Huo, why did you move Rou's body without the permission of Duke Song's Mansion?

275
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Commandant Wei, how can you recognize it at a glance?

276
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Rou and I traveled thousands of miles together.

277
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
We're familiar with this wedding dress.

278
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Moreover, this is the white silk that Duke Song's wife chose.

279
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,760
It's embroidered with gold thread and made of gold.

280
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Everyone in Zhou State knows it.

281
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
How can I deny it?

282
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
It's true that there are two pieces.

283
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,760
Commandant Wei, where is the other one?

284
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Of course, it's guarded by Pei's mother.

285
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
What's wrong?

286
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Where's the wedding dress?

287
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Where's Wei Yong's wedding dress?

288
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I've seen it in the

289
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
How did you do it?

290
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
How many people are there in the dress?

291
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Madam only asked me to guard the wedding dress.

292
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,760
So I'm the only one with the key.

293
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
But I never leave my body.

294
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,760
I don't know how the wedding dress disappeared.

295
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Who else can go to this warehouse?

296
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
And me.

297
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,760
I've never stepped into the warehouse since I was born.

298
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,760
I also leave the wedding dress to my servants and guards to do their own things.

299
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
I have all the responsibilities of the Song family.

300
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,760
But I didn't realize that I was lost in the wedding dress.

301
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
It's really hard to blame myself.

302
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Huo Zhifu.

303
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Yes.

304
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Take this mother down.

305
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Come on.

306
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Yes.

307
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
Please spare me.

308
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
I'm innocent.

309
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Please spare me.

310
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Wei Fuwei.

311
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
You've been guarding the wedding dress for Mrs. Song.

312
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Now you're not angry.

313
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Why don't you go?

314
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
I'm not strong enough to do this.

315
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,760
I fainted when I was doing the move with Wei Cheng.

316
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
He forbade me to go.

317
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
He listened to my post all night.

318
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
That's right.

319
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
I can testify for Wei Fuwei.

320
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Wei Fuwei and the guard.

321
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Guard, please show me your hands.

322
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Wei Fuwei, please raise your palm.

323
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Why is there a knot in the left hand of the guard?

324
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
The army is used to train with long guns.

325
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Long guns need to hold the sword with both hands.

326
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
What does the crown prince mean?

327
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
The guard is right.

329
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
He doesn't use his left hand.

330
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Wei Fuwei likes calligraphy.

331
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
I feel bad.

332
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
I'll be back tomorrow.

333
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,760
This is a habit I've been keeping for my brother since I was a child.

334
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Wei Fuwei is not feeling well.

335
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
You should go back and rest.

336
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
What about Jiayi?

337
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Don't worry.

338
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,760
I'll tell you the result of the investigation.

339
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

340
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Although the guard is suspicious,

341
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,760
I still think Wei Yanzhi is different.

342
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Their height and martial arts are both characteristic of the scene.

343
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
They have the time and conditions to do so.

344
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Your Highness, when the martial arts master is resting,

345
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,760
does he usually use his usual hand?

346
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Of course he uses his usual hand.

347
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,760
But unless the executioner is like me,

348
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
both hands are flexible.

349
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,760
In that case, you are suspicious too.

350
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
But I'm taller than six feet.

351
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
You've been in Jingzhou for many days.

352
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,760
People in the mansion have already seen your height.

353
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
They can come and go as they please.

354
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,760
If I go in, how can I leave a trace?

355
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
Is the Ninth Lady still suspicious of me?

356
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Although she values clues, she also values friendship.

357
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
You are the one who commands thousands of soldiers and horses.

358
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Of course you are not afraid of pretending to be a ghost.

359
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Don't worry, Your Highness.

360
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
These tricks won't scare me.

361
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
I will test the sword tomorrow.

362
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,760
But the Mansion of Duke Song is very resistant to testing.

363
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Huo Huaixin has always been good at martial arts.

364
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
If I test the sword tomorrow and encounter obstacles,

365
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,760
don't worry, I have my own plan.

366
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

367
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Why does she look at me like that?

368
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
I said something wrong.

369
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Brother, Xiaowan.

370
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Why are you two standing there?

371
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,760
Well, the Ninth Lady is in your care.

372
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Don't mess around.

373
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Go back and rest early.

374
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Goodbye.

375
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Brother, you don't usually treat women as if they were your own.

376
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
You should be careful.

377
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
I'm not a woman.

378
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Brother, you don't usually treat women as if they were your own.

379
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
But today, the Qu Zun sent you back in person.

380
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
The sun is really out in the west.

381
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Although the Crown Prince is very fierce,

382
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
he is very meticulous.

383
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
He is very meticulous.

384
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Meticulous?

385
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,760
We know each other for the same period.

386
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Master, the urgent letter from the capital.

387
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,760
No wonder the Song State's palace has been falling down.

388
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
I went to see His Majesty to complain about the case.

389
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,760
I really thought His Majesty's marriage was only because he wanted to see the Song State's palace.

390
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Send someone to keep an eye on it.

391
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Yes.

392
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,760
By the way, the Eagle Clan found two bodies at the mouth of the river where the evil family escaped.

393
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
The two bodies were dead.

394
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
The body was covered with stones.

395
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Judging from the clothes, it should be the couple of the evil family.

396
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Can you find out the cause of death?

397
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
There are only bones left in the body.

398
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,760
It is impossible to determine whether the body was buried in the river or after death.

399
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
What about their only daughter, Shen Wan?

400
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Shen Wan's body has not been found yet.

401
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
The whereabouts are still unknown.

402
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Whereabouts are unknown?

403
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
What a coincidence.

404
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Coincidence?

405
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Could it be that the master suspected Shen Wan of secretly killing and betraying his parents

406
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
and then escaped alone?

407
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Paifeng, I haven't found out that you are so smart.

408
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,760
I just want to make a joke to make the master happy.

409
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Don't look down on Wang Zhe.

410
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,760
The killer didn't even let go of Shen Yi's body.

411
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,760
How could he leave a weak woman alive?

412
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
I'm sorry.

413
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,760
Hide their bodies well and then send Shen Wan's painting back.

414
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
Be quick.

415
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Then we continue to investigate Shen Wan's whereabouts?

416
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Investigate.

417
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
What else?

418
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,760
There is one more thing that I don't know if I should report.

419
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Say it.

420
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Today, Mrs. Huo visited Mrs. Qin with a grand ceremony.

421
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,760
She wanted to re-sign the engagement of Mr. Huo and Mrs. Jiu.

422
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,760
No wonder Huo Ning was so interested in Mr. Jiu today.

423
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Huo Huai Xin is good at playing the role of a diamond.

424
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,760
But this Mr. Huo, he doesn't deserve it.

425
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,760
I heard that last night, Mr. Huo even reviewed the military service of the Marquis Manor.

426
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
He spent the whole night reviewing it.

427
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Without the permission of the Crown Prince and the Marquis Manor,

428
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Huo Huai Xin would never dare to do such a big thing.

429
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
I hope to find that person soon.

430
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
I still remember that I was even sick.

431
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
How can you shout and shout?

432
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
You are so rude.

433
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
My people are rude.

434
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
Don't bother Mr. Huo.

435
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Mrs. Qin Jiu.

436
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,760
You still hate me for the engagement that day?

437
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Mr. Huo, do you have the talent to cover up the situation or do you have the talent to keep the light?

438
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Why do you think that engagement is worth my appreciation?

439
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Today, you and I should not be too obvious.

440
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,760
That day, Mrs. Huo mentioned the engagement to my grandmother.

441
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
I have already returned.

442
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,760
I am here tonight to thank you for not taking the engagement that day.

443
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
No, no, no.

444
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Mr. Huo.

445
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,760
I am here to pick up the ninth lady to be the main princess's wife.

446
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
I don't want to see her again.

447
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,760
I wonder if the ninth lady is convenient.

448
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
It is very convenient.

449
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Please send the Crown Prince off.

450
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Please.

451
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
Mr. Huo has been tired all night.

452
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
You should go back and rest early.

453
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
Yes.

454
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Thank you.

455
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Mr. Huo.

456
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
After the interrogation last night,

457
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,760
there are no left-handers in the Duke and the Marquis's mansion.

458
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
They can prove innocence.

459
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
Last night, there were servants from the Marquis's mansion.

460
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,760
They can confirm that there has been a shadow of Wei Yanzhi practicing calligraphy in front of the window.

461
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
I also searched her study.

462
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
There are still some dry brush and some tape left on the table.

463
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
We can't be involved in this matter anymore.

464
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,760
If the cultivator is not patient and delaying time,

465
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,760
I am afraid that the situation will be serious and will lose a lot of clues.

466
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
After the interrogation for the Princess Royal,

467
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:31,340
we will go to the

468
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,340
I dare to criticize the great Princess Royal's savior behind her back.

469
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
Who gives you the guts?

470
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,340
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

471
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,340
We are also listening to what the Duke and the Marquis's mansion said.

472
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
The purpose is to drink up the heart of the people to learn from them.

473
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
Bai Feng!

474
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
Let them be punished by my wife.

475
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
Yes.

476
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,340
I can now confirm that the cultivator has something to do with the Duke's mansion.

477
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,340
If you said that you were playing tricks on me that night

478
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,580
to scare me away,

479
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,900
then these rumors today

480
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,100
are trying to stir up the trust of the Marquis.

481
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,500
The people of Duke Song's Mansion are so afraid of me.

482
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,300
I think there must be something wrong with my body.

483
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,820
It seems that they have already seen you as a spy.

484
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,260
Isn't it dangerous?

485
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,260
Since ancient times, evil has not suppressed good.

486
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,060
As long as the truth is revealed,

487
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,580
what can I do?

488
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,060
Your Highness, you are not.

489
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,140
I'm sorry for your loss.

490
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,100
The front is the yard of the Princess Royal.

491
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,380
You don't have to see me off.

492
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,460
My dear,

493
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,740
His Highness is still standing there looking at you.

494
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,620
I shouldn't have been so nice to him.

495
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,340
I was so careful of him for a while.

496
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,380
He didn't trust me at all.

497
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,060
My dear, I don't think he is suspecting you.

498
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,700
He...

499
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,940
Don't look back.

500
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,820
You should be careful of him.

501
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,540
When the Princess Royal's condition is stable,

502
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,460
we will leave the Marquis Mansion.

503
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,220
My dear!

504
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,540
The public should be willing to give up all that they seem to have.

505
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,860
I can trust you.

506
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,460
Take it.

507
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,020
What do you mean?

508
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,820
Just take it.

509
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,700
I won't accept it, for it's a little bitитель.

510
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,300
I once suspected をyou saved Princess Royal

511
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,180
to rob us of our wealth.

512
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,500
Now you simply accept without hesitation

513
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,020
and save Princess Royal from death for still not entirely crazy.

514
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,140
What is it to you?

515
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,180
Just take it.

516
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,620
My dear, why don't you open it first?

517
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,620
This is the first time I've seen this.

518
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,620
I've never seen it before.

519
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,620
It's so beautiful.

520
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,620
It's so beautiful.

521
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
It's so beautiful.

522
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,620
It's so beautiful.

523
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,620
This is a glove made of deer skin.

524
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,620
This glove is much better than the previous one.

525
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,620
The deer skin can even cut water.

526
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,620
Even the King of Medicine's pulse is only 7 beats.

527
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
It's just a needle.

528
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,620
The gift that the Crown Prince gave you

529
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,620
is really thoughtful.

530
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Thoughtful?

531
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
He's been working so hard on me.

532
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,620
He must have a lot of plans.

533
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,620
Could it be that he wants me to be a military doctor in the Western Region?

534
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,620
No.

535
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,620
This will affect the return to the capital.

536
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,620
I have to find a chance to refuse him.

537
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,620
Is the ninth lady satisfied with the gift?

538
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,620
The gift that the Crown Prince gave you

539
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
is exactly what I want.

540
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
I really can't bear to return it.

541
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,620
I can only accept it as a gift.

542
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,620
Thank you for giving it to me.

543
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
As long as you think it's useful.

544
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,620
Please examine it carefully.

545
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,620
Look, he really has something else against me.

546
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Father, the marriage proposal has been arranged.

547
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,620
You go in and take a shower.

548
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
I'm waiting for a good man.

549
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

550
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,620
Your Highness.

551
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,620
How could it be her?

552
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,620
It's only a few steps away.

553
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,620
It's her.

554
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
She's already gone.

555
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,620
It's not her.

556
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,620
She's not here.

557
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,620
She's not here.

558
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,620
She's not here.

559
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,620
She's not here.

560
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,620
Impossible.

561
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,620
Father, the man you mentioned is Qin Jiu?

562
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,620
How could she know the night poem?

563
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Don't be fooled by her.

564
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,620
I don't know anything.

565
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,620
Your Highness, don't blame me.

566
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,620
Don't blame me.

567
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Mr. Huo,

568
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
whether Qin Jiu really knows the night poem

569
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,620
is up to me.

570
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,620
It's okay.

571
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,620
I'll prepare the food.

572
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Please help yourself.

573
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
Fulin, the box.

574
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,620
Wait for me here.

575
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,620
Let's go.

576
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,620
Father, I don't believe it.

577
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,620
Where did Qin Jiu learn the night poem?

578
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,620
Shut up.

579
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,620
It's not important whether you believe it or not.

580
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,620
I saw it with my own eyes.

581
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
Otherwise, how could I let your mother propose?

582
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,620
I don't care what she knows.

583
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,620
Anyway, even if she kneels down to beg me,

584
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
I will never marry her.

585
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,620
If she really breaks the case of Marquis Anyang,

586
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,620
you will never be able to marry her.

587
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,620
Go back now.

588
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,620
I...

589
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
I won't go back.

590
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,620
I have to see

591
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,620
what kind of person Qin Jiu is.

592
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,620
Mr. Huo,

593
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,620
the food is ready.

594
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,620
It's ready.

595
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,620
Go.

596
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
Go.

597
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
Go.

598
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
Go.

599
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,620
Go.

600
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
Go.

601
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,620
Go.

602
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,620
Go.

603
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Go.

604
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,620
Go.

605
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,620
Go.

606
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,620
Go.

607
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620
Go.

608
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:54,440
I will Thanks

609
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,780
huh

610
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,380
uh

611
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,740

613
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,440
uh

614
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:57,940
uh

615
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,180
uh

616
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,620
uh

617
00:35:59,620 --> 00:35:59,940
uh

618
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,340
uh

619
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:00,940
uh

620
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,500
uh

621
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:01,660
uh

622
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,340
uh

623
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,260
uh

624
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,040
er

625
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,600
er

626
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,340
er

627
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,460
er

628
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,460
er

629
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,020
Okay, this...

630
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,260
No noise in the hall.

631
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,780
If anyone is not a victim, leave now.

632
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,380
Start recording.

633
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,500
Yes, I'll do it.

634
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,300
Human body aconteceu just like the way an adult wears clothes.

635
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,660
Speaking of Wireless answer,

636
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,220
why don't you tell me something?

637
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,620
Leave now, I'll…"

638
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,900
Correct.

639
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,700
Keep laughinguges in clothes.

640
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,820
Stay here...

641
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,900
Here, go.

642
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,140
Move our heads back.

643
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,940
Dad

644
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,100
τι

645
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,060
xi

646
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
ga

647
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,820
iem

648
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,700
There were onlyinga

649
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,500
cut

650
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,220
child

651
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,940
The body's entire body feels numb

652
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,380
There are obvious Autumn medicine spots on the lower abdomen

653
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,540
The waist Stephentake

654
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,900
there is a such discolored changed skin

655
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,740
Not seen others

656
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,900
The body was found in the pipe of the police station.

657
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,900
It proves that the victim was stabbed to death by someone.

658
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,900
If the victim was cut off, the blood would be spilled.

659
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,900
But the blood was very shallow and not much.

660
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,900
It means that the victim was put on the wedding dress after death.

661
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
Your highness, you're so good at speculating.

662
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,900
You mean the victim was put on the wedding dress after death?

663
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,900
Yes.

664
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
The blood in the wedding dress is a little strange.

665
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,900
It's for the eyes of the troublemaker.

666
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,900
The victim's whereabouts are different.

667
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,900
Where can it be?

668
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,900
The victim's whereabouts are different.

669
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
Where can it be?

670
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,900
It's for the eyes of the troublemaker.

671
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,900
Where can it be?

672
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,900
It's for the eyes of the troublemaker.

673
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
Where can it be?

674
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Nianca.

675
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Yes.

676
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,040
İyi dù dù.

677
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,400
Lu'Rang bullying me.

678
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,600
I'm only workers.

679
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,160
It's a white beetle,

680
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,720
colloped by theuz Farewell Wood.

681
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,360
Its notes are all around the Naz trash.

682
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,960
Is there any Naz data near Qingzhou?

683
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,720
Dominants of this valley

684
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Let me do it.

685
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
I can't do it.

686
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Follow him.

687
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Xu He, wash your body.

688
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Crush the green onion.

689
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,720
Apply it on the dead body.

690
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Use paper to apply vinegar.

691
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Cover the body for a while.

692
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Okay, I'll go prepare.

693
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Why is this?

694
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Duke Song's Mansion doesn't allow the body to be washed.

695
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,720
I can only do the body and the body.

696
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Do it more thoroughly.

697
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
See if there are any other cases.

698
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Let's go.

699
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,720
The button used by the deceased is the Danhua button of the capital.

700
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
This is very valuable.

701
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
It's loved by the ladies of the royal family.

702
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Did you ever go to the capital?

703
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Why do you know so much about the capital's style?

704
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
I've never been to the capital.

705
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,720
It's just that my uncle's annual gift

706
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,720
once gave the sisters a Danhua button.

707
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
The right hand of the deceased is soft and white.

708
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,720
The second and thumb joints of the left hand

709
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
are thick and thin.

710
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
Is Mrs. Song good at playing the zither?

711
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
I've already sent people to check.

712
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
According to the servants of Duke Song's Mansion,

713
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,720
Mrs. Song is indeed good at playing the zither.

714
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,720
There is also a famous zither in the Pei family.

715
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
Is there anything wrong?

716
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Only the zither of this year's month

717
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
will have this kind of zither.

718
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
This is the song of the headless female poet.

719
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
It's very likely to be Song Rou.

720
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
I really hope she's not Song Rou.

721
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
What is this black spot?

723
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
Chihen, before Mrs. Song married,

724
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
she may have had a private relationship with someone.

725
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:19,720
The wind and snow give me a white body

726
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:26,720
If a body of love can be like a heart

727
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,720
The pain will also be the same

728
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,720
Open your heart

729
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,720
Love does not matter the deep sea

730
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,720
Please grant me courage

731
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,720
Let fate be open

732
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Don't be afraid of the starlight

733
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,720
Be covered by the night sky

734
00:44:53,720 --> 00:45:02,720
The stars will shine outside the sky

735
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,720
The stars will shine outside the sky

736
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,720
The stars will shine outside the sky

737
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,720
The stars will shine outside the sky
