00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
His time

3
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I almost died

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I still can't hold it in

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You have done a good job

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If it were me

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I would have killed him long ago

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and made a big fire

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You won't

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You are the most cautious person I have ever seen

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You never do things you are not sure of

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But after this trip

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I am not sure of more and more things

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But because of your father

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He doesn't listen to me

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He is just trying to stop me

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now I am worried about

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Jin Wang Xiong and Shen Gong's case

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I went to the Ministry of Justice to look for their family

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But they were all blocked

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It seems that

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
it is much more complicated than we thought

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I saw Li Mu Yun

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
mention my father's identity today

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He was so shameless

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He just thought he was shameless

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He was so stubborn

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But now I remember

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If he really had no guilt

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If he really did what he should do

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If my father

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He really helped me

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Wan'er

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't think too much

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We are back

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We need to establish a good foundation in the Ministry of Justice

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You believe me

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I think one day the truth will be revealed

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We just take one step

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
One step

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Slowly

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I hope you can talk now

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When his emotions are stable

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I will ask him

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
if he remembers what happened to Consort Jin

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ok

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't think about it

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You have to rest well these days

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
When you reach the Ministry of Justice

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The place where you can comfort the people

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Come on

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Where am I?

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's started

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This way

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This way

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can't play anymore

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You come to catch me

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on, young master

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So comfortable

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Help me to hold the string

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What's going on?

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I told you to catch me

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why are you here?

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why are you crying?

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Which bastard bullied you?

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will blow him up now

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You bastard

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I thought you were dead

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why am I dead?

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
A day ago

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
A man in Fengqi House was killed

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He died very badly

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So you think that person is me?

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I have been looking for you

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I went to Fengqi House

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Prince Yi's Mansion

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I can't find you anywhere

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I heard that Brother Qi was investigating the case

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So I went there quickly

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Xiao Waner was in the night market

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
She looked like you

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
She looked like you

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Even if it's not you

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The official said that the dead were left in the fire every day

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What if it's you?

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What if you die?

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What should I do?

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If I die

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Song Zang's team

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
will let you take the top position

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ok

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Not only do I have to take the top position

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I will also help you get the points

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Ok?

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't leave, Min'er

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No one has ever

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
cared about my life and death like you

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If you really leave

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No one cares about me like this

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't worry

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I will always be your

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
best friend

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Whether it's life or death

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You will always be my best friend

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Who asked you to let me take the top position?

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Zhang Dongxuan

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Dongxuan

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Do you want to continue eating rock candy seeds

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Or wait for the execution in this dead cell?

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Just eat a meal

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,660
The

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
As long as you eat well

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I promise you will have food every day

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You are a woman

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Little prince

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am a man of my word

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You just want to see people

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
after you wash them

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You think the one who comes is a woman

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No, no

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Not only women love to see people

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Which women don't love to see people?

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And the legend goes

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The prince is not kind

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He came to the prison to tell you to wash your hands

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And then he came to see people

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's obvious that he is a man of respect

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Except for the Empress Dowager, the Emperor and King of Rui

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Only the woman he loves can make him so attentive

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Am I right?

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's true that you are a man of respect

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I have another ability

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can guess it

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You little girl

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why is your heart more poisonous than that prince?

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You still don't want to reveal your true face?

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I have been walking in the world for many years

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No one can tell

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
How did you know?

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know you need to use your ears to find people to talk

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But you can tell by your heart

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You can feel the light and shadow

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Feng Xuan, don't use this kind of hidden magic anymore

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's bad for your eyes

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It will hurt your eyes if you use it for a long time

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You know the hidden magic

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The successor of the Medicine King Valley is really capable

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Since you know that Princess Yongci is from the Medicine King Valley

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Then you should understand

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Only she can clear your name in this world

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Then you have to tell me first

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Will there be a black pattern on the crime scene in the capital's Bo Pi case?

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We haven't found the crime scene yet

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But there are few cases of throwing the body and the body

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Are there any other similar cases?

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The case before this is in accordance with the Guanyin case

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why are you looking for me when you are dead?

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Go, go

162
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wait for the dead

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Zhang Dongxuan

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You are doing something good for nothing

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But if you are killing people

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You will die in this prison

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You didn't even find the crime scene

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
How can you catch the real murderer?

169
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Besides, you are dead

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
How can you be related to Guanyin?

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You have to find a similar case

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
To be related to the old case

173
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Can we just sit and wait

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Waiting for the innocent people to continue to die?

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We not only have to investigate the case, but also kill

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Only by knowing the plan of the criminals

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Can we save the living people

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Instead of getting a single body

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Little princess

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Just ask me what you want to know

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Six years ago

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why did you get involved in the Guanyin case?

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Do you know why Shen Siqing thought I was not the real murderer?

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Because before the murder

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was almost a loser

186
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Greetings, your majesty

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Greetings, father

188
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Fine

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,620
Golden eagle Müllia

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Each has its own civilization

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,160
and see it with your own eyes?

192
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,360
Good.

193
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,040
I wonder who is Ying Chun

194
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,360
in your eyes

195
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,920
and who is Man Jing?

196
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,040
Father,

197
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,560
when I was traveling today,

198
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I saw a full garden of flowers

199
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,440
and I dared to have a feast with Hongmei.

200
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,480
I was so happy

201
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,240
that I brought my former friend's poem up

202
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,360
to make it more interesting.

203
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,680
Since the crown prince

204
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,400
has already had a good relationship with you,

205
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
the skin-peeling case

206
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,960
that must have caused people to hear

207
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,080
has been decided.

208
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,040
Brother Qi and Yongci

209
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,000
went to see it with the imperial edict.

210
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,440
Do you know where they are?

211
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm still watching.

212
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,000
Have you seen

213
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,240
the file of the skin-peeling case?

214
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,360
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

215
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
Tomorrow again?

216
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,080
What a good tomorrow!

217
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
When you were painting

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,200
the garden today,

219
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,840
and when you were painting the golden powder,

220
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,920
you found the

221
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,720
hidden secret in the file.

222
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,400
At this time, you were in Yongci

223
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,720
in the prison of the Ministry of Justice

224
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,080
to interrogate the suspect who was in charge of the case.

225
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,240
I...

226
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,280
I...

227
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,800
It was because you were the crown prince

228
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,960
that I entrusted you

229
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,240
with the security of the capital.

230
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Now, there are three

231
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,400
big cases in the city.

232
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,480
How dare you be so slack?

233
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,080
You are really the crown prince.

234
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,040
Father, please calm down.

235
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,080
I know my mistake.

236
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,960
I'm so sorry that you can't stop me.

237
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,680
Seeing you do this,

238
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,320
I'm giving you an order.

239
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,000
In the palace,

240
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,000
just be yourself

241
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,040
and stand your ground.

242
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,280
Father,

243
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,280
Father, I drunk by mistake.

244
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,320
Please give me another chance, Father.

245
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,680
I'll really help you to take the imperial function.

246
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,600
Your Highness, you're lucky!

247
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,080
You're really a master of archery!

248
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,280
You're good at archery!

249
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,600
Who do you think is better at archery?

250
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
I've never seen the Crown Prince shoot arrows before.

251
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,400
Your Highness is the best at archery.

252
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Yan Qi is the best at hiding his arrows.

253
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,440
If he doesn't move, he won't be able to guess his potential.

254
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
Your Highness, don't worry.

255
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,560
The military is always the most important.

256
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,760
Since Yan Qi has been appointed to the Ministry of Justice,

257
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,160
it won't take long for him to be in the army.

258
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,480
By then, you'll be able to take him in.

259
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,280
Your Highness, the Noble Consort has sent a message.

260
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,280
I have something important to tell you.

261
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,840
Tell them I know.

262
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,880
Tell them to stop worrying and serve my father.

263
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Yes.

264
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,680
Your Highness, I'm just worried about you.

265
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,640
His Majesty has imprisoned the Crown Prince.

266
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,200
I'm afraid that we can't keep the job of the Ministry of Justice.

267
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,720
Are you trying to make His Highness

268
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,160
take over the Crown Prince's position?

269
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,000
That position is the only position in the harem.

270
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm not that stupid.

271
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,280
My father is a wise man and he's a great man.

272
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,360
If I do something that I shouldn't have done,

273
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm afraid I'll be the first to be taken in.

274
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,000
But I'm a lowly maid.

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,440
So the one who helped the Crown Prince break the secret of the Min Nv

276
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,080
is the martial arts master.

277
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,200
No matter how capable he is,

278
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,280
he's just a woman.

279
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
If he loses his reputation,

280
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,840
he'll still be able to show himself.

281
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,280
By then, Yan Chi will naturally lose his assistant.

282
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,960
That's a good idea.

283
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,840
But remember not to act rashly.

284
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,040
Father and Old Lady are very fond of him.

285
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,440
You must find a suitable time to take action.

286
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,720
Yes.

287
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,520
The Prince of Qin...

288
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,880
Interesting.

289
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,360
Chuan'er!

290
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,880
Get out!

291
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,000
Yes.

292
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,800
Mother.

293
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,680
I've disappointed you.

294
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,880
You're the Crown Prince of a country.

295
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,120
You mustn't be so upset.

296
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,800
I'm no longer the Crown Prince of a country.

297
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Father said I'm too young to be the Crown Prince.

298
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,240
Nonsense!

299
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,560
His Majesty was just angry for a moment.

300
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,760
He never meant to waste his power.

301
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,720
Mother!

302
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,280
I've never been the one that Father thinks is the Crown Prince.

303
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,200
If it wasn't for the martial arts,

304
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
Father would have fired me long ago!

305
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,760
No ifs and buts!

306
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,400
You're the son of a legitimate official.

307
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,920
You should be the Crown Prince.

308
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,440
As long as you work hard,

309
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,040
no one can be the Crown Prince.

310
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,600
Even your father can't!

311
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,560
Mother.

312
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,000
Instead of letting Father disappoint me again,

313
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
why don't we take this opportunity to retreat?

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,600
I...

315
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,000
Did he love you?

316
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,840
I really don't like those jobs.

317
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,080
But...

318
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,840
Ever since you were born,

319
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,640
you can't decide whether you like it or not.

320
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,040
You think you can't do anything?

321
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,440
You think you can't do anything?

322
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,080
You don't like me?

323
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,680
You think you can still be a prince

324
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,080
if you don't want to be the Crown Prince?

325
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,960
Ever since the beginning,

326
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
the Crown Prince is the only one who can be fired.

327
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,360
Only death!

328
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,960
I don't want to be the Crown Prince!

329
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,480
Fine.

330
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,280
You don't want to be the Crown Prince, right?

331
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,920
Come.

332
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,160
Mother, what are you doing?

333
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,920
You killed me first.

334
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,440
Are you crazy?

335
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,520
Kill me!

336
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,120
Kill me!

337
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,480
Mother!

338
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,760
Are you crazy?

339
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,760
Mother.

340
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,200
You can't do it, right?

341
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,920
Then be a good Crown Prince.

342
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,040
Until the day you become the Crown Prince.

343
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,320
For the sake of the people,

344
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,240
you must be in that position.

345
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,280
I'll give you the order on the Fourth Day of the Fourth Year.

346
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,040
Before that,

347
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,960
His Majesty will definitely cut off your neck.

348
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,800
You can do your job well.

349
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,040
Don't make this

350
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,800
a joke.

351
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,040
I know.

352
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,840
The wound is badly damaged.

353
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,360
His blood vessels are weak.

354
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,600
His left chest has been weakened.

355
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,800
He has been injured for more than five years.

356
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,440
I already had this scar when I was arrested.

357
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,560
It's written clearly in the file.

358
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,200
But they still

359
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,360
locked me up as the murderer.

360
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
With the length and depth of the scar,

361
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,080
the left arm has been broken.

362
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,520
He can't complete

363
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,880
such a complicated killing method.

364
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,840
What if he's just planning?

365
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,640
What if the murderer is someone else?

366
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
What do you mean?

367
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,800
You used to coax me to eat and drink.

368
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
You said you wanted to turn me in.

369
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,960
Now you see my scar,

370
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,400
how can you make me have a accomplice?

371
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,280
If you're innocent, why did you pretend to be blind?

372
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,120
How can I let others believe me

373
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
and get the money if I don't pretend to be blind?

374
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,320
How can I eat and drink?

375
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,600
Then why did you go to the prison

376
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,640
and continue to look for me?

377
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,160
I can't be blind.

378
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,920
People think I'm a suspect.

379
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,240
If I can see it,

380
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,040
no one will believe me.

381
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,560
So you deceived him

382
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,520
to turn you in.

383
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,560
You're lying.

384
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,880
Shen Siqing is famous for his good reputation.

385
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,800
It's because he found that

386
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,440
there are many different points in the file

387
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
that he asked me to ask.

388
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,120
He even went to Guanyin Town to investigate.

389
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,360
He confirmed that I was telling the truth

390
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,440
and said the case was suspicious.

391
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,360
You should go and check

392
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,120
Shen Siqing's record.

393
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,200
Otherwise, don't bother me.

394
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,160
It's a pity that

395
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,000
all the records made by the provincial government

396
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,960
have been missing.

397
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,440
No one knows what he found in Guanyin Town.

398
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,400
It's not too late.

399
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,960
Why did he list your case as a case?

400
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,360
That is to say,

401
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,800
only by finding the real murderer of the Puppet case in Beijing

402
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,760
can we re-examine the Guanyin Town murder case.

403
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,040
If you can help us catch the murderer,

404
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I will clear your name.

405
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,920
Do you know

406
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,000
why I became a murderer?

407
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,040
The prefectural government said

408
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,440
the victims of the three murders in Guanyin Town

409
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,240
have been asked to be you to help them.

410
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,120
Yes.

411
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,760
How could I know

412
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,040
that it was all a big deal?

413
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,640
Five years ago,

414
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,880
I was at the side of the Taoist temple.

415
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,320
I happened to have a fight with my brothers

416
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,800
and the guests.

417
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,880
Who knew that my brother was injured

418
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,600
and had a half-bath.

419
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,200
Later, I went to visit my brother.

420
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,280
I found that his family property

421
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,680
was all taken by his brother.

422
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,320
I advised him not to think about the feelings of the chiefs.

423
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,640
But his brother

424
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,400
broke his conspiracy in my head

425
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,760
and asked me to kick him out.

426
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
How dare you hit me?

427
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,120
What are you doing?

428
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,800
I'll kill him.

429
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,560
I'll kill him.

430
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
I'll kill you.

431
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,120
A few days later,

432
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,440
my brother was thrown out of the house

433
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,560
at the gate of the grass house.

434
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
I fled from the Taoist temple

435
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,360
and moved to the countryside.

436
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,400
Your brother's death has nothing to do with you.

437
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,520
Why did you run away?

438
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,640
Did the Taoist priest

439
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,760
mention the Sword-Cutting Sect in the case?

440
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,080
Yes.

441
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,560
The chief of Guan Yin Town

442
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,680
was especially in charge of the Taoist priest.

443
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,760
No one except you

444
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,560
knows about the Sword-Cutting Sect.

445
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
That's true.

446
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,320
What's the matter with the Sword-Cutting Sect?

447
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,400
The Sword-Cutting Sect

448
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,960
is for the sake of the heaven.

449
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,480
It's for the sake of the evil.

450
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,560
The evil?

451
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,000
The one who enters the city must make a blood oath

452
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,720
and promise to eliminate all the evil people in the world.

453
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,280
It's an injustice.

454
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,480
If you want to shoot,

455
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,080
you must cut off the flesh of the heart

456
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,960
and leave with the sin of destroying the land.

457
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,880
So your chest injury

458
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,880
was caused by the shooting?

459
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,280
It's all my own sin.

460
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,680
At first, I thought

461
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,560
I could escape by cutting off this flesh.

462
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,280
But when I saw my brother's death,

463
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,800
I knew that he was targeted by the Taoist priest

464
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,960
and committed the crime of cutting off the flesh

465
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,760
and committed the crime of peeling the skin.

466
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,920
He threw his body to my doorstep

467
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
to warn me

468
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,560
not to leak the information of the Taoist priest.

469
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,240
There is only law in this world

470
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
that can punish the criminal and punish the criminal.

471
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,320
Why should the Taoist priest use his own death?

472
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,880
When I was young,

473
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
I didn't know these things.

474
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,440
Originally, my family was rich.

475
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,920
Until an outsider

476
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,120
saw my family's ink shop.

477
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,240
Many people were fighting with each other

478
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,520
and beat my father to death.

479
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
My mother was forced to

480
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,640
use a horse to show off herself.

481
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,040
But why didn't you report to the government?

482
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,920
I did.

483
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,320
I did my best to take care of the government.

484
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,520
But in the end, the government said that

485
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,960
I didn't have enough evidence.

486
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,080
They sent me a false notice.

487
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,640
Yuan Wu Er

488
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,440
has already threatened the people in the county.

489
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,400
The sky is gray and the tree is not old.

490
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,240
People who are greedy for the law

491
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,320
will be killed sooner or later.

492
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,560
Little girl,

493
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,480
you are just like Shen Si Qing.

494
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,800
What little girl?

495
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,320
You call Mr. Jiu your name.

496
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,560
At that time, Shen Si Qing

497
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,320
didn't want me to call him a teacher.

498
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,520
He wanted me to call you Mr. Jiu.

499
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,440
You should have some skills.

500
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,120
It's easy to say.

501
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,160
I think that the Prime Minister

502
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,720
is not a person who is waiting for death.

503
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,320
But why did he let that Yuan Wai Fan bite him?

504
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,640
At that time, I was already helpless.

505
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,400
I was about to escape

506
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,640
and ran into an old man.

507
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,920
He said that if I didn't run away,

508
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,400
he said that if I wanted to take revenge, I would follow him.

509
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,560
I was so angry

510
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,640
that I joined the Tian Dao Club.

511
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,880
I thought that it was a gang meeting like Cao Bang.

512
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,520
But they did want to train the killers

513
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,720
to kill people according to their own punishment.

514
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,160
The Tian Dao Club has strict rules.

515
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Except for the old man who introduced me,

516
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,000
I haven't seen anyone's real face.

517
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,240
I don't even know the exact location of the club.

518
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,800
After I came in,

519
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,400
I longed for ways to escape

520
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,480
this haunted place every day.

521
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,800
There was also a place

522
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,240
I must serve.

523
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,280
I acted in a way

524
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,040
thatИ was wrong.

525
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,240
You could not have done anything

526
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,880
with me.

527
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,560
Now youasil get everywhere

528
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,120
to still be with me.

529
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,520
I know that

530
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,720
When I saw my old man was soft-hearted,

531
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,200
he told me

532
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,440
the rule of retreating after cutting the flesh and blood.

533
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,200
But I didn't know until the day of retreat.

534
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,000
I saw my old man

535
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,720
and cut the flesh of my heart.

536
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,000
Prime Minister Zhang, you've worked hard today.

537
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,320
The Yuzu will send some sugar water later.

538
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,240
Have a good rest after drinking it.

539
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,040
Yes.

540
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:50,400
I'll respect łatory

541
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,460
thanks to you,

542
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,100
Try it.

543
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,460
It's delicious.

544
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,660
I'll buy a nail polish one from now on.

545
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,180
Okay.

546
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,020
Wait a minute.

547
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,580
Master.

548
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,340
Your Highness.

549
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,100
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,700
I want to stay at your house tonight.

551
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,220
At my place?

552
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,660
I can't go back to the palace now.

553
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,260
Now I'm going back to the House of Marquis Zhongyong.

554
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,020
I'm afraid I'll have to take another trip.

555
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,140
If I go to your place,

556
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,740
someone will be talking about it.

557
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,060
No.

558
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,020
There are two doors in our house.

559
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,060
The carriage goes straight there.

560
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,420
No one knows you're with me.

561
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,820
No way.

562
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,700
My princess is a girl.

563
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,660
How can she live in a man's house?

564
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,540
Her home is in Mount Tai.

565
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,820
She can't be harmed.

566
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,620
She's dying in Mount Tai.

567
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,460
Zha Mutou is looking for the victim's identity.

568
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,780
Please tell him

569
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,220
to investigate those who are brothers.

570
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,260
Yes.

571
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,060
And

572
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,220
bring two bowls of wontons for her when you come back.

573
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,180
Make a midnight snack.

574
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,300
Let's get going.

575
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,140
Fulin,

576
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
your house

577
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,460
is very important to her.

578
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,780
I'll go to cheer her up now.

579
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,580
He's better than me.

580
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,540
is a good thing.

581
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,340
The great event of our Fulin

582
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,460
is finally over.

583
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,180
You want me to eat a bowl of wonton?

584
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,380
That's too easy.

585
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,100
Let's go.

586
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,060
Look.

587
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,340
Your clothes are too big.

588
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,340
It's okay.

589
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,140
You look good in everything.

590
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,660
I'll make you two sets of clothes

591
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,580
to change into in the future.

592
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,380
I'll stay outside often.

593
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,060
The mansion will be in trouble.

594
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,260
Then I'll ask His Majesty to give you a house.

595
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,660
It'll be convenient for you to move in.

596
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
It's a small matter.

597
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,980
How can I bother His Majesty?

598
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,940
Actually, I've thought of a place.

599
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,780
Where is it?

600
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,820
I'll buy it for you.

601
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,140
I want to move to Uncle Qin's house.

602
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,980
It's close to my old house.

603
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,380
I can go to find my father's old mansion

604
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,100
and pay tribute to my parents.

605
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:48,860
Okay.

606
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
I'll take you there

607
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,060
to clean up the house and move in.

608
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,580
Xiaowan.

609
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,100
Brother Qin.

610
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,340
Eat.

611
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:07,780
Eat.

612
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,020
Let me see.

613
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,820
Why are you pulling me?

614
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,700
Do you know what is a good wife?

615
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,020
Of course I know.

616
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,340
I didn't tear them apart.

617
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,660
Princess.

618
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,460
Your Highness.

619
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,180
Is this for Xiaowan?

620
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,980
I'll send it to her.

621
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,860
You're going to find a wife now.

622
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,420
Why send me a meal?

623
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,180
Give it to me.

624
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,020
This...

625
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,900
I'm an orphan.

626
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,500
Three.

627
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,740
Two.

628
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,060
One.

629
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,340
Two.

630
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,020
I haven't finished my bowl of wontons.

631
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,180
That bowl of wontons is still mine.

632
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,780
I told you not to go in.

633
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,940
You didn't listen.

634
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,980
You...

635
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,100
You've been busy these days.

636
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,500
You're taking Yue Ning to Fengqi Pavilion to get married, right?

637
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,660
I can prove it.

638
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,420
I've helped you a lot today.

639
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,380
If it weren't for me,

640
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,340
I wouldn't have found the victim so quickly.

641
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,220
It's true.

642
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,620
He was so good today.

643
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,820
I said you didn't know who the victim was.

644
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,420
He took me to Fengqi Pavilion right away.

645
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,300
He asked the old man to write down all the guests that day.

646
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,460
I'm thinking about who to investigate with.

647
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,860
Bai Feng said he wanted to investigate those who were not compatible with his brothers.

648
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,780
I picked out the names at once.

649
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,300
Who is it?

650
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,180
Mr. Si from Uncle Wei Yuan's Mansion.

651
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,060
Wu Qian.

652
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Uncle Wei Yuan only has an empty shelf.

653
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,700
Where did Wu Qian get the money to go to Fengqi Pavilion?

654
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,340
Well...

655
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,260
There's no money, but there's a family.

656
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,020
Wu Qian is the eldest son of Uncle Wei Yuan.

657
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,460
Although he's the most ungrateful,

658
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,860
he's also the most ugly.

659
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,420
He first took the ancient characters,

660
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,860
and fell in love with the golden and solid seal.

661
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,460
He also took some shops.

662
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,660
He also said that

663
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,020
the third son, Wu Yu,

664
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,180
was too greedy for property.

665
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,820
It was almost a family.

666
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,660
Uncle Wei Yuan's Mansion.

667
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,180
A few days ago, a death case occurred in the capital.

668
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,060
The fourth son, Wu Qian,

669
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,860
appeared at the crime scene.

670
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,660
We ordered people to draw an image.

671
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,180
He looks very similar to the fourth son.

672
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,620
What the princess said

673
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,260
is the case of the skin peeling case that has caused a stir in the people's hearts?

674
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,260
Yes.

675
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,460
Because the body was badly damaged,

676
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,100
it was difficult to identify the identity.

677
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,220
We can only investigate from the fourth son's recent whereabouts.

678
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,500
But this matter

679
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,860
involves the rumor that you two brothers are not compatible.

680
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,980
The reason why my brother is not compatible

681
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,780
is because my brother dared to sell his family

682
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
to buy a house for his father when he was seriously ill.

683
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,100
I took my father to do housework.

684
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,380
But my mother was too scared to protect him.

685
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,260
She said she wanted to do business with gold and stone.

686
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,140
In the end,

687
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,580
the people of the ink painting studio

688
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,820
all went after the debt.

689
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,420
Not only did she not make money,

690
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,060
she also owed a hundred taels of silver.

691
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,380
The fourth son's ridiculous reputation is out there.

692
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,460
Why would the ink painting studio

693
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,020
still do business with him?

694
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,580
I never ask about his business.

695
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,260
I only ask about his business.

696
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,580
Please sit.

697
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,820
Your Highness, please ask.

698
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,220
I'll definitely answer your question.

699
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,580
Does Mr. Ning Hua know my fourth brother, Wu Qian?

700
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,700
Of course.

701
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,700
Mr. Wu Si is the regular guest of the ink painting studio.

702
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,460
That day,

703
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,700
the government asked me to draw a picture for a dead person.

704
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,660
That's right.

705
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,140
It was my fourth brother who died.

706
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,740
I want to ask you, Mr. Ning Hua.

707
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,300
Do you think my fourth brother is a trustworthy person?

708
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,060
How about saying that

709
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,060
Mr. Wu Si thinks I'm trustworthy?

710
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,340
That's why he asked me to keep the painting

711
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,660
in the house.

712
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,740
You don't have to cover for the emperor.

713
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,940
I know.

714
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,340
He often sold the painting to you secretly.

715
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,340
The other day, a man came to the house to ask for a picture.

716
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,940
He said the emperor owed a hundred taels of silver.

717
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,260
I wonder if that's true.

718
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,220
Impossible.

719
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,340
With Mr. Wu Si's confidence,

720
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,740
I've always been good at business.

721
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,980
I'm not a snake in the hole.

722
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,820
Can you ask Mr. Ning Hua

723
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,420
to invite all the men in your room

724
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,460
and ask Mr. Wu Si to recognize the person who is in charge?

725
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,380
Ask everyone to come here.

726
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,740
Come on.

727
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,740
Please.

728
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,300
Thank you.

729
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,900
There are only two painters,

730
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,420
two students and a famous painter in the shop.

731
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,340
No one was in charge that day.

732
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,380
Ning Hua.

733
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,420
Did you hire anyone else before?

734
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,380
Yes.

735
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,860
Can you tell who this person is?

736
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,500
It's him.

737
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,460
That's him.

738
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,020
Thechemist Master Wang Xing of my shop.

739
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,380
I found Hu Ying

740
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:30,060
secretly imitatedqueuing the

741
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,420
woman trace marks with her effort to be ins� суд.

742
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,300
One month ago, she was left.

743
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,980
Could it be that fourth brother said the ousted剛才燕章means

744
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,820
that her eldest brother and Wang'm Lei turf也可以叫 fait ISOE de foi wyd roar.

00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,980
The sculpting skill of the person who is willing to do it

746
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
must be good.

747
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,580
If we don't look at his luck,

748
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,180
his knife skills are really good.

749
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,900
When Wang Xin was begging for money,

750
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,460
Mr. Wu Si had an accident.

751
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,980
He had a fight with Mr. Wu Si

752
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,140
over money.

753
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,260
He is very suspicious.

754
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,300
I want this portrait

755
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,980
to make it public.

756
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,780
I'm hungry.

757
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,620
There are a lot of progress today.

758
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,700
I'll take you to a place

759
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,900
you will definitely like.

760
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,020
Although there is no smoke here,

761
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,260
the sleeping curtain is well opened.

762
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,420
Why is the sleeping curtain here opened so early?

763
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,620
There is a hot spring under the pond.

764
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,380
It can make the sleeping curtain here

765
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,620
open all the time.

766
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,340
The moon is falling.

767
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,340
The lake is warm.

768
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,340
Fall in love.

769
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,340
How many years have I been alone

770
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,340
without meeting my love?

771
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,340
Until you came to my world

772
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,340
and wrote the destiny.

773
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,340
The day you gave me

774
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,340
made me see the future.

775
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,340
When I close my eyes,

776
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,340
I find I love you a little bit.

777
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,340
How do you know everything?

778
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,340
I went to Shuoxi Junzhou when I was eight.

779
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,340
My father left me in the camp

780
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,340
and I didn't care about anything.

781
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,340
When I went to the battlefield,

782
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
no one treated me as a child.

783
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
I had to learn how to survive.

784
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,340
You must have had a hard time when you were a kid.

785
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
I was raised in the Empress Dowager's palace

786
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,340
when I was eight.

787
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,340
Although I didn't have parents to take care of me,

788
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,340
I had my grandmother's protection.

789
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,340
I had a hard time.

790
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
But I just started crying

791
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
when I went to my father's side.

792
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,340
My mother's mother said

793
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
this is my favorite place

794
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,340
when I was alive.

795
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,340
My father would come here

796
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,340
whenever he missed me.

797
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,340
Later I found out that

798
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
he often came here at night.

799
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,340
I sat here and imagined

800
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,340
how it would be like

801
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,340
to stand here

802
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,340
and imagine my mother.

803
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,340
How did your mother die?

804
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,340
My mother said that

805
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,340
there was a bloodbath

806
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,340
when she gave birth to me.

807
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,340
She passed away after a month of labor.

808
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,340
When my father was on his way back to the capital,

809
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
my mother was already in the dark

810
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,340
when he arrived at home.

811
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
According to your mother's character,

812
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
she should have been buried for months.

813
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,340
But why did she bury her body so soon?

814
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
I don't know.

815
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,340
No one has ever mentioned it.

816
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,340
It's really strange

817
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,340
to think about it.

818
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
It's not necessarily.

819
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
If King Xui's temper

820
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,340
is not right,

821
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
he will definitely blame me.

822
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,340
Finally, my father

823
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,340
took three months

824
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,340
to take care of my mother.

825
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,340
He handed me,

826
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,340
the one in the wall,

827
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
to the Empress Dowager

828
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,340
and told her to come back.

829
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,340
My mother said

830
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,340
because my father

831
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,340
couldn't see my mother one last time,

832
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
my heart seemed to be dead.

833
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,340
Maybe that's why

834
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
she was angry with me.

835
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,340
But I don't blame her.

836
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
Your mother's death has nothing to do with you.

837
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
Your father will understand one day

838
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,340
that you are the most innocent

839
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,340
and need the one he loves most.

840
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
I have you.

841
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,340
That's enough.

842
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,340
I have you.

843
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,340
You said

844
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,340
skinning,

845
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
pulling out snakes,

846
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,340
and freezing to death.

847
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
Is there a rule

848
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,340
in the Tian Dao Sect?

849
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,340
Or is it just a casual killing?

850
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,340
What?

851
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,340
The three victims

852
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,340
of Guan Yin Formation

853
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,340
have already been killed.

854
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,340
But I still can't

855
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
tell you the truth.

856
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,340
Yan Zhuang is still in Jingzhao Mansion.

857
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,340
We'll go to the mansion

858
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,340
to have a look.

859
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,340
We'll ask the whole White Shi to strengthen the patrol.

860
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
Let's go.

861
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,340
What's wrong?

862
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
You brought me here on purpose.

863
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,340
I was thinking about the case.

864
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,340
Do you think

865
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,340
I'm very uneducated?

866
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,340
I'm not such a narrow-minded person.

867
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,340
Remember,

868
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
this is your unique style.

869
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
In this world,

870
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,340
except me, Yan Chi,

871
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
no one can be compared to you.

872
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

873
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,340
You've worked hard.

874
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,340
Come on.

875
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:44,340
Why do days and nights turn around?

876
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:54,340
Yet they still light up your light.

877
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,340
Like a flower,

878
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,340
like a flower,

879
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,340
it's moving in the snow.

880
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,340
So cold,

881
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,340
so warm.

882
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,340
If a dust

883
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,340
falls into the shadow,

884
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,340
the snow will fall

885
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,340
and my whole body will be white.

886
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,340
If a deep love

887
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,340
can be engraved in my heart,

888
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,340
the pain will also be

889
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,340
the same.

890
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,340
Open your heart,

891
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,340
love doesn't matter the deep sea.

892
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,340
Please grant me courage

893
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,340
to let fate be open.

894
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,340
Don't be afraid that the starlight

895
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,340
is touched by the moonlight.

896
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,340
The stars will shine

897
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,340
beyond the sky.

898
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,340
Like dust,

899
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:17,340
it's all the colors of the stars.

900
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:25,340
The stars will shine beyond the sky.

901
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:30,340
The stars will shine beyond the sky.

902
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:36,340
The stars will shine beyond the sky.

903
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:43,340
The stars will shine beyond the sky.

904
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:49,340
The stars will shine beyond the sky.

905
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,340
The stars will shine beyond the sky.
