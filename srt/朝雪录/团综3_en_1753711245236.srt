1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
The more you order, the more discounted it is.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,640
Taobao Shangkou invites you to watch

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,680
the five-night detective of Zhao Xue Lu.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,000
You drive, I win.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,680
I'm done.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,840
I win.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,840
I'll help you.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,320
OK.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,760
I'll help him to change the car.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,440
I'll help you.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,160
She has a big net.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,040
Don't let her see it.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,640
Change it.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,760
Change it.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,520
Cut it.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Cut it.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,200
Let me see.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,320
Heaven's blessing.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,560
You're awesome.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,960
This time.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,760
OK.

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,880
You're a little bit funny.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,160
You're awesome.

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,120
OK. You're done.

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
She has a sense of achievement.

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,200
I think she's too good.

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,680
What's that?

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,720
You gave it to her on purpose.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,480
I'm your lucky charm.

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,120
You can't do this to me.

31
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,480
I'll pick.

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,240
Don't show me.

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,960
Do you want to wash it?

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm 100% sure.

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,720
As long as I draw it out of my hand,

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,840
she can definitely get it.

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,440
We won.

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,840
You two.

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,600
You draw it.

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,280
You draw it.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,440
Just show it.

42
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,560
Show it to others.

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,160
Wash it.

44
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,280
If she can draw it back,

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,960
you can't get it.

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Shen Yijie doesn't want to win.

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,280
She has a problem.

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,040
No.

49
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,520
I'm...

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,120
She wants to show it to others.

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,440
I want to be punished.

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
Her solve twist to stop Yu Zhi.

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
Make them come this side

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
and hide behind the counter.

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,760
OK.

56
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,360
Ready.

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,400
Great.

58
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,340
Completely,

59
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,080
no luck.

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,120
Team Group.

61
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,360
Diviner.

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,100
Why?

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,800
Wait to hear it now?

64
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,760
From...

65
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,680
Is it option A?

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Yes, Japan.

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,120
We have a manual here.

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,400
I have to love my old man.

69
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,040
Come on.

70
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
Feel my old man.

71
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Don't do that, Brother Qi.

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,320
Brother Qi.

73
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,880
I'll do it.

74
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,680
You're a young man.

75
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,960
We don't care about this.

76
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,520
Thank you.

77
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,240
Thank you, Sister Qi.

78
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
No, Sister Qi.

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,080
Sister Qi.

80
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,120
Sister Qi.

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,040
This must be honest.

82
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,320
Be more honest.

83
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,200
You have no choice.

84
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,600
Sister Qi.

85
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,960
Sister Qi.

86
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,920
She made it clear about me and Brother Qi.

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,280
You don't have life or death.

88
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,240
I'm glad you're together again.

89
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,720
Focus.

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,040
Think about this.

91
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,160
Jinx Xiao Will.

92
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
I thought I wanted to make friends with her.

93
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm the wrong man.

94
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,920
Jinx Xiao Will.

95
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,360
This is not the amount I want to accept.

96
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,920
I'm so happy!

97
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,360
No matter what happened,

98
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,560
the more you hate her,

99
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,480
that drama will become a production.

100
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,040
China County.

101
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,840
Some one

102
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
The winner is here.

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,560
The winner is a book.

104
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
We are a clue.

105
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,640
Oh my god.

106
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,520
Research.

107
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,680
You are so smart.

108
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,120
There are two clues, right?

109
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,160
One is a book, the other is a performance.

110
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,880
Yes.

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,880
Do we have to watch for so long?

112
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,760
Let's watch it too.

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,240
Come on.

114
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,840
Do you want to change?

115
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,680
Change.

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,080
This is really important.

117
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,840
So many words.

118
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
Reöyleasinger Nit Completely down

119
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,480
Secretly download the personal finger ignorant.

120
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,400
He just gave us all doses just now.

121
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, he did.

122
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,840
I gave it to you.

123
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
Let's take a photo together.

124
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,600
Thanks.

125
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,520
Thanks.

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,240
Cheers.

127
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,960
You go with me first.

128
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,280
No 안멕.

129
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,240
When we were in jail,

130
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,560
he was trying to attack...

131
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,280
He was trying to attack the other side.

132
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,600
He was trying to attack the other side and hug the other.

133
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,120
And we both ran away.

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,160
Bye.

135
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,480
Let's go.

136
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,720
Bye.

137
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,720
Bye.

138
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,400
Bye.

139
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,720
Bye.

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,520
Bye.

141
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,560
Please look at me.

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,400
The wolf is hugging.

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

144
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,720
I am...

145
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,280
Really?

146
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,920
You're done?

147
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm done.

148
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,200
What can you do?

149
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,080
How?

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
Mr. Chen chose you.

151
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,880
Your task is to collect the fingerprints

152
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,440
of the other four people and give them to Mr. Chen.

153
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
Except you,

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
there is one more person who is our person.

155
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,600
I know.

156
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
The other people don't know that there is a spy.

157
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
I got it.

158
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,600
I promise to complete the task.

159
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,760
I won't tell you

160
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
who my partner is.

161
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,760
Let's go to Mr. Chen's house first.

162
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,960
Let's go to Mr. Chen's house first.

163
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,680
Next...

164
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,600
Do you still need to go?

165
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,640
I...

166
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,360
You two are still in the same team?

167
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,400
I...

168
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,480
I...

169
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,200
I'll go back to eat.

170
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,320
I'll go back to the crew first.

171
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,240
Prepare for the next challenge.

172
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,920
What did I arrange for you?

173
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,680
One...

174
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,400
Two spies are starting to interact.

175
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,280
You two...

176
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,160
They were just

177
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,120
in the same place.

178
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,280
You two might have recognized each other.

179
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,760
Chen's house.

180
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,400
There are so many Chen's houses.

181
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,720
The money is enough.

182
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,640
Dad.

183
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,040
Six young talents.

184
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,560
Long time no see.

185
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,120
Sit down.

186
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,600
Hello, Mr. Chen.

187
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,160
I'm here.

188
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,400
Hello, dear people.

189
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
What did you see?

190
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,880
Did you see good news?

191
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,900
Why am I here?

192
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,000
And what kind of mission is that?

193
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,040
Let's get the mission started.

194
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,880
Yes, let's get started.

195
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,320
I bought all of your genuine necessary stuff.

196
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,920
Sure.

197
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,960
How much to drop the Noupon arrived?

198
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,960
The purpose is to invite you to join my company.

199
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,960
There are people in your company.

200
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
It's obvious.

201
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
It's him.

202
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
You don't change at all?

203
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
No.

204
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
OK.

205
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Before joining my company,

206
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,960
I need to know you more.

207
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Let's introduce ourselves.

208
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
OK?

209
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Let's start with you,

210
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I'm not in the company anymore.

211
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm the boss.

212
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Hello, everyone.

213
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
My name is...

214
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
I'm O'Long.

215
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
My name is O'Long.

216
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I joined Mr. Chen's company very early.

217
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
OK.

218
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
And then,

219
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Mr. Chen gave me a task

220
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,960
to help you complete the task.

221
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
No.

222
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
He's testing us.

223
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
It's OK.

224
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
We're very complete.

225
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
No problem.

226
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
You're the female phoenix.

227
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
He did it on purpose.

228
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Do you have any talents to show us?

229
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Sing.

230
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
I only know the time

231
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,340
that the weather is

232
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,340
I only know the time

233
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,640
My club has a unique atmosphere.

234
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,640
Say a joke.

235
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
OK.

236
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
I'm not a natural.

237
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
I wanna laugh.

238
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
I don't think I'm that good.

239
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,760
Maybe in this part,

240
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
I should be...

241
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,920
Who is it?

242
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,560
Is it you?

243
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,360
Is it you?

244
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,000
It's impossible.

245
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,880
I don't have it.

246
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,000
I've exposed it.

247
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,960
Zha Yi is the best.

248
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,520
Hello, everyone.

249
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm a person who's not very smart.

250
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,960
It's Li Fengchu.

251
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,920
Li Fengchu.

252
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,680
I'm not very smart.

253
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,840
So I don't have any plot.

254
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,240
I will definitely do my best for the boss.

255
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,880
Zha Yi.

256
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,160
I can run along the line.

257
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Show us.

258
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,720
Don't be too impulsive.

259
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,400
Let's start.

260
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,200
You look down on me.

261
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,560
No, I'm just very good.

262
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,960
It's quite touching.

263
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,760
Mr. Chen, you're surprised.

264
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,520
I should have arranged you

265
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,480
in which department.

266
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,760
The department of cultural and artistic acting.

267
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,960
Hello, boss.

268
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
I can dance.

269
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,480
Of course.

270
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,040
It's also the department of annual meeting.

271
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,480
You have to compete with me.

272
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,080
Show us.

273
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,120
Show us.

274
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,040
The boss is sitting up.

275
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,760
He's sitting straight.

276
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,200
Dance.

277
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,800
What are you doing?

278
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,840
I'm just...

279
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,480
You should choose me.

280
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,000
Dance.

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What a bad song.

282
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Okay, you should lie down.

283
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,400
Next.

284
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,120
Hello, boss.

285
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,080
I'm your younger brother.

286
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,760
I'm Chen Hongxi.

287
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,960
My talent is...

288
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,200
You can dance, too.

289
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,680
I can dance, too.

290
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,880
I can dance

291
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,960
a bit vulgar.

292
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,360
Wait.

293
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,400
I'm stuck.

294
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,320
I'll send you to the rose garden.

295
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,720
It's like a teacher's life.

296
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,120
You can be a group.

297
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,560
It's good.

298
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,520
You two are in the same department.

299
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,960
Hello, boss.

300
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,760
We just came back from abroad.

301
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,000
We have some

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,280
international skills.

303
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,920
For example...

304
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,320
I can whistle.

305
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,880
Whistle?

306
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,440
Why is it so loud?

307
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,840
I can dance.

308
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,160
I can also play the snake.

309
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,720
This is awesome.

310
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,840
Can you do it?

311
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,720
I can also combine Chinese and Western.

312
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,280
I can do the night squat.

313
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
That's enough, kid.

314
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,360
Aren't you his daughter?

315
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,400
Why do you have to show so much?

316
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,560
I'm trying hard.

317
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,120
Night squat.

318
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,400
Awesome.

319
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,200
It's touching.

320
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,400
Dad.

321
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,200
What?

322
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,840
You go first.

323
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
I don't need to be a talent.

324
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
Is it that simple?

325
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,920
Yes.

326
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,440
Okay.

327
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
Is it that simple?

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,760
Is it that simple?

329
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,520
It's like this.

330
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,480
Do you know what this brush

331
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,040
can do?

332
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,800
It can travel through time and space.

333
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,200
Do you know why I'm so rich?

334
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,520
Because I can get treasures

335
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,400
from different time and space.

336
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,480
Do you think the treasures

337
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,080
that are lost

338
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,640
are actually in my Zekong Museum?

339
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,760
Zekong Museum.

340
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,480
Time and space museum.

341
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,880
Where is the museum?

342
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,240
Is it time and space?

343
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
This is Taizhou Museum.

344
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,680
Taizhou Museum.

345
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Taizhou Museum.

346
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Taizhou Museum.

347
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
Taizhou Museum.

348
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Taizhou Museum.

349
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
Taizhou Museum.

350
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Taizhou Museum.

351
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:26,880
Stealing.

352
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,800
It's not stealing.

353
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,920
It's just a transport of cultural relics.

354
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,520
What's this?

355
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,240
What's this?

356
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
Why did you do that?

357
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
You stole it.

358
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
You stole it.

359
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,480
You stole it.

360
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,880
If I knew it was like this,

361
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
I wouldn't have gone to Huyaolong.

362
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,120
You stole it.

363
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,320
My mom wanted to give it to the country.

364
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,040
She didn't tell me that.

365
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,160
She told me that

366
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,240
she was just a transport worker.

367
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,560
Is that so?

368
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,920
We are a logistics company.

369
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,400
I was fooled.

370
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,440
If you join the company,

371
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,080
you will get a lucky money.

372
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,080
It's okay if you don't join the company.

373
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,840
Your fingerprints will also help you join.

374
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,560
If you don't know,

375
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,640
my Huyaolong and Feng Chu

376
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,680
have already got your fingerprints.

377
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,840
Why are you like this?

378
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Do you know when it happened?

379
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,640
When I was 9 years old.

380
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,800
There's more.

381
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,440
When?

382
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,480
Everyone of you took a picture.

383
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,640
The front.

384
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,000
Can I touch your hand?

385
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,640
Yes.

386
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,280
I went to the mountain.

387
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
I'm afraid I can't.

388
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
I'm afraid I can't.

389
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
I'm afraid I can't.

390
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
I'm afraid I can't.

391
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
I'm afraid I can't.

392
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm afraid I can't.

393
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
I'm afraid I can't.

394
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm afraid I can't.

395
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
I'm afraid I can't.

396
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm afraid I can't.

397
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
I'm afraid I can't.

398
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
I'm afraid I can't.

399
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
I'm afraid I can't.

400
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm afraid I can't.

401
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
I'm afraid I can't.

402
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
I'm afraid I can't.

403
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
I'm afraid I can't.

404
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
I'm afraid I can't.

405
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
I'm afraid I can't.

406
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm afraid I can't.

407
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
I'm afraid I can't.

408
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
I'm afraid I can't.

409
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
I'm afraid I can't.

410
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
I'm afraid I can't.

411
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
The power of the dragon.

412
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Who is Feng Chu?

413
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
It's him.

414
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
It's him.

415
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
It's really not me.

416
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
We are still very complete.

417
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
No problem.

418
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm not sure.

419
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
I'm not sure.

420
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
I'm not sure.

421
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I'm not sure.

422
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
I'm not sure.

423
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm not sure.

424
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I'm not sure.

425
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
I'm not sure.

426
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
I'm not sure.

427
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
It's him.

428
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,660
They were just in the

429
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,660
fortune-telling team.

430
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
You are the same as us.

431
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
What?

432
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
I think you are too close to each other.

433
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
You are too close.

434
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
They are looking at each other.

435
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Come on.

436
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Let's be fair.

437
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
A fair game.

438
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Except for me,

439
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
everyone points to

440
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
the one you like.

441
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Three.

442
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
One.

443
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Landy has three votes.

444
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Landy gets...

445
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Feng Chu is eliminated.

446
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
It's still a game.

447
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
You can't give it to him.

448
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
You can't let him win.

449
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Yes.

450
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
What's going on?

451
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Are we in the ancient times?

452
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Love Yourself

453
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,920
I said I would hand it over to the country, you know?

454
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,200
You are the last one

455
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,080
Mr. Chen chose you

456
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
I'm a bad guy

457
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,680
Then I'm going to take this double B

458
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,760
and get it back

459
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,400
So I just grabbed it

460
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,200
I didn't expect it to make everyone get through

461
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,000
But I think we can definitely find this double B

462
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,600
OK, I believe

463
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
I am double B

464
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,800
Double A, double C

465
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Let's find double B

466
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,320
Let's go

467
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,600
There's more over there

468
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,680
Stop

469
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Hello

470
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,440
Are you the six artists there?

471
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,360
Artists

472
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,240
I'm the lover

473
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,640
I'm the artist

474
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm the lover

475
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,200
Lover

476
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,840
Whose lover are you?

477
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,640
I'm

478
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,880
the lover of the American flower and the Asian sun

479
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,880
I'm the lover of the American flower and the Asian sun

480
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
You are still a young man

481
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,080
Come on

482
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,040
Give them a hug and take them away

483
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,280
Yes

484
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,560
I'll do it myself

485
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,440
I'll do it myself, thank you

486
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,080
Si Tianjian said today

487
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,880
Double B, double A, one person line

488
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,720
You are the six artists

489
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,400
Yes

490
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,080
Why are you so familiar?

491
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,960
I've seen him before

492
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,880
He is a familiar

493
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,120
Old man

494
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,520
The first round of competition

495
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,360
You start to work in the prison before you go to jail

496
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,920
You are the best

497
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,560
You did this in your previous life

498
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,920
Don't you think it's boring?

499
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,640
You feel like you are a little down in life

500
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,520
What previous life?

501
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,400
I'll count it for you later

502
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,200
What nonsense?

503
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,480
We are from the world of art

504
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,800
We know everything about your previous life

505
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,680
We are the Yuyuan family

506
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,520
The Yuyuan family is here

507
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,160
Go

508
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,520
Dad

509
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:31,120
My lord, help

510
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,120
Ok

511
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,160
Okay

512
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,000
The prince
