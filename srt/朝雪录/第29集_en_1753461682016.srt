00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,800
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
According to the news,

3
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,440
Wang Xin's trace was found in the southeast of the city.

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,080
From today,

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
all the wooden houses in this area

6
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,840
will be completely inspected.

7
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,160
The patrols will guard all the traffic lights

8
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,600
in the southeast of the city.

9
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,120
The government will also take the initiative.

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,720
Yongci and Princess Yongning

11
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,360
will assist the government to distract the traffic.

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

13
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:22,480
In addition to the teeth and teeth

14
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,600
What a handsome man.

15
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,800
He is a rich man.

16
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,200
Indeed?

17
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,740
That̶

18
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,940
that̶

19
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,560
is my matsudou.

20
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,480
Hmm?

21
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,500
Yes.

22
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,520
A tormentosed senile spirit

23
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,400
has probably been

24
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,980
armored

25
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,560
with the first incident of Polish Kemper Oucha.

26
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
There should be no problem.

27
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,400
According to the condition of the corpse

28
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
and the blood liver,

29
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,120
he was killed before we searched the tomb.

30
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,640
The assassin set up a trap here.

31
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,600
The position inside the tomb is not clear.

32
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
There are no signs of fighting or dragging around.

33
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,840
From this point of view,

34
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,160
the victim should have taken the initiative to go to this position.

35
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,080
He didn't resist or try to escape.

36
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
It means that the victim not only knew the assassin,

37
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,920
but also trusted him.

38
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,280
The crime was at midnight.

39
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,040
The assassin had set up a trap in advance

40
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,880
and drew a pattern

41
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,200
to wait for the victim to arrive.

42
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
The victim walked into the warehouse from the yard.

43
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,200
It's hard to see the pattern on the ground

44
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
and the pattern that fell off.

45
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,760
The assassin had another attention of the victim.

46
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,480
The victim didn't realize it at all

47
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
and was walking on the dead end.

48
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,360
Judging from the traces on the grain,

49
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
the person who cut the rope

50
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
should have been hiding on the grain.

51
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,760
Judging from the opening of the rope,

52
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,280
it was cut twice.

53
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,920
The assassin was afraid that the rope would be cut off

54
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,280
at the end of the tunnel,

55
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,720
so he cut it in half in advance.

56
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,920
But the flat end of the rope

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,440
was cut off with one knife.

58
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,080
It seems to have been changed by the saw.

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,640
But the marks on the saw

60
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,560
are much smaller than that of a regular saw.

61
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,240
I got it.

62
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,680
It was changed by the shameless saw of the jade carving master.

63
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,760
It can accurately control the depth of the cut.

64
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,160
You mean

65
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,760
the killer is still Wang Xian?

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,280
It can only be confirmed

67
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,400
after the face is restored.

68
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,480
Well.

69
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,320
Kill him.

70
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,080
Transfer my orders.

71
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Please forgive me.

72
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,680
The face of the deceased

73
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,240
is really cruel.

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,160
I understand.

75
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,760
It's hard for you to draw.

76
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,240
Please draw an image for the deceased.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,640
Painter Ning,

78
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,160
with your painting skills,

79
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,480
based on the face of the deceased,

80
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,680
you can draw a complete image.

81
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,520
It should be fine, right?

82
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,720
I will do my best.

83
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,680
Oh.

84
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,680
You drew only half of the face

85
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,280
of the deceased.

86
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,280
It's a pity that

87
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,480
your painting is so sad.

88
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm flattered.

89
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm not as good as my name.

90
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,880
I'll leave now.

91
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,960
Please.

92
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,840
When Ning Buyi was vomiting,

93
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,640
I saw that he didn't vomit.

94
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,640
It's just the sound of liver cancer.

95
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
I also felt that

96
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,160
when Ning Buyi first met Wu Qianhua,

97
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,160
he also had a bad liver cancer.

98
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
He had a big hand,

99
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,760
a strong hand,

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
and a strong body.

101
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,680
But the one who vomited

102
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,600
should have used his hand

103
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,880
to hold his chest and chest.

104
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,920
He didn't use his stomach to relieve his discomfort.

105
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,920
After I finished painting,

106
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,440
my face and eyes

107
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,080
would turn red because of the pressure.

108
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,120
My eyes would cry.

109
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,720
That day,

110
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,400
he looked as normal as usual.

111
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,840
His eyes were clean.

112
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,240
He was not afraid,

113
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,000
but he was a warning.

114
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,160
Ning Buyi

115
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,640
is suspicious.

116
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,240
It seems that

117
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Ning Buyi is likely to be the murderer of this case.

118
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,560
How can you use a suspicious portrait

119
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
to infer that Ning Buyi is the murderer?

120
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,360
Because the victim of this case

121
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,400
is Wang Xin,

122
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
the sculptor who has been running away for many days.

123
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,680
This muddler

124
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,640
was made by me

125
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,240
as the victim's mother.

126
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,760
It was the first time that Ning Buyi

127
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
and I met.

128
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,960
I was very worried.

129
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,160
I was worried that

130
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,120
Ning Buyi

131
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,640
would be the murderer of this case.

132
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
I was worried that

133
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,440
Ning Buyi

134
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,440
looked like me

135
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,480
when it was done by Wang Xin.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,600
It was thanks to him

137
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,440
that he wanted us to get Wang Xin.

138
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,520
The portrait was not false.

139
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,880
The late cut of the industries'aws

140
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,400
cuiork out with Wang Xin.

141
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,360
The profile

142
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,960
of Ning Buyi

143
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,920
can never find that person.

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,920
He realizes the reason

145
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
why he tried to turn Wang Xin into a person,

146
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,040
so that he knew his secret is out there.

147
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,640
and used the shamelessness of the general to change the fate.

148
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,280
He deliberately made us think

149
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,640
Wang Xin was the murderer.

150
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,640
Ning Buyi deliberately drew the face of the victim

151
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,600
to cover up the crime

152
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
in a different way from Wang Xin.

153
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,920
It's the same as the muddied picture I made.

154
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,920
It can prove

155
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,360
that he already knew the real identity of the victim.

156
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,760
Only those who are very familiar with Wang Xin

157
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
can know how to adjust

158
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,600
to make the effect of the two sides

159
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,240
of the same size.

160
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,960
If he is not the murderer,

161
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,280
how can he know that the victim is Wang Xin?

162
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,880
He even had to cover his eyes.

163
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,440
But what if Ning Buyi

164
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,520
doesn't admit that he deliberately drew the face of the victim?

165
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,240
So we still need evidence.

166
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,520
The painting table is not like the God temple.

167
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,160
Isn't this the son of the one I think of every day?

168
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
This girl is...

169
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,400
His Highness just left me for a few days.

170
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,440
He pretended not to know me.

171
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
You haven't seen me for a few days.

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,200
You're pretty again.

173
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,920
I'll go get you some wine.

174
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,040
Yanli.

175
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,680
You're so mean.

176
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,920
You let me down.

177
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,760
I'm going to smash the door of the Prince of Yi's Mansion.

178
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,040
What... What's going on?

179
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,320
You don't listen to me.

180
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,440
You hit me right after you came up.

181
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
What are you doing?

182
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,600
Keep playing.

183
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,120
Your Highness.

184
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,640
I'll be waiting for you.

185
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,640
Your Highness.

186
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,440
Why don't you go after the princess?

187
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,000
You still think I'm not good enough?

188
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,360
You hit me when I was chasing you.

189
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,880
I think the princess really cares about you.

190
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,680
If you really care about her...

191
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,760
I really care about her?

192
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,160
I don't have that much of a heart.

193
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,360
I think you have a lot of fun stuff here.

194
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,480
Pick one and give it to her.

195
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,880
Just let her know.

196
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,960
What a coincidence.

197
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
A few days ago, I received a small dagger.

198
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,040
It's a good thing that I was able to get it.

199
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,040
The princess will like it.

200
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,400
All right. I'll save it.

201
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,640
I put it in the study room at home.

202
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,160
I have some work to do in the afternoon.

203
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,520
If you don't mind,

204
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,680
why don't you go to the Han's House after dinner?

205
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,120
Go to the Han's House.

206
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay. It's a deal.

207
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,000
Bai Feng went there for me? Why?

208
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,920
After all, you are a noble person.

209
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,560
It's too risky.

210
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,280
Yes.

211
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,760
And I'm familiar with you.

212
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,360
You're kind and trustworthy.

213
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,920
No.

214
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,760
I'd rather not be blind.

215
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,360
I'm so handsome.

216
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,160
Can you pretend to be handsome?

217
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,040
I...

218
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,920
I'm not handsome.

219
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
What do you want?

220
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,320
It's all for your own good.

221
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
I want to go there myself.

222
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,800
I know what to do.

223
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,120
As for the danger, who is not dangerous?

224
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,600
You don't let me go there

225
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,400
because you're afraid that I'll steal the head of the palace?

226
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,120
Or you're like those people in the capital.

227
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,560
You look down on me.

228
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,960
If you're really afraid that I'll get into trouble,

229
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,280
Zheng Fu Yan, send more people

230
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,480
to surround that bastard's house.

231
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,720
Bai Feng, Zhan Yang,

232
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,160
you have to give me more strength.

233
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,640
Pull me out earlier.

234
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Ning Bu Yi is cold-hearted.

235
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,000
He's very anxious.

236
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
If he finds out that we're suspecting him,

237
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,120
he'll be even more brutal.

238
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,520
You must be careful.

239
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,600
The poison is small.

240
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,800
The big one is an external wound.

241
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,200
You must be careful.

242
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,680
Ying Shao?

243
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,040
No.

244
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,000
This is for you to protect yourself.

245
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,880
I can't take it.

246
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,600
Take it.

247
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,920
As long as you're alive,

248
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
no matter how serious the wound is,

249
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,480
I can cure it for you.

250
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,960
Wan Er,

251
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,600
I'm sure you're a good wife.

252
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,200
I love only you.

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,040
Ning Sacrifices...

254
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,960
Don't say a word.

255
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,640
You sound like a discount.

256
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,720
Just take it as a reminder.

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,120
As long as we

258
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,640
are good brothers forever, that's it.

259
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Let's go.

260
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Please.

261
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
It's good.

262
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
The tea is not bad.

263
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Please wait, Your Highness.

264
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,040
I'll get the dagger now.

265
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
Go ahead.

266
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,080
Why is it wet?

267
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Calm down.

268
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
It's just a small wound.

269
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
It's not a big deal.

270
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
It's just a small wound.

271
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Your Highness,

272
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,760
you can't lose the eagle hand again.

273
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Your Highness.

274
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Let's go.

275
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Go.

276
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Ning Buye.

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,280
If you keep coughing,

278
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,400
I won't be able to pretend to be dizzy.

279
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Stop.

280
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,240
You can kill me if you want.

281
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,680
But you can't steal my beauty.

282
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,560
You're waking up so fast.

283
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,080
How big of a deal can you have

284
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,480
with your small body?

285
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm just pretending to play with you.

286
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,680
I really thought I'd succeed.

287
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Stupid.

288
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,840
You thought you could die

289
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,840
with a little bit of anger?

290
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't worry.

291
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,680
I'll avoid the poison.

292
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,560
I'll use this dagger

293
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,840
to cut your body

294
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
into two halves

295
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,840
bit by bit.

296
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,600
Let you see

297
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,080
your five organs.

298
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,240
Your Highness,

299
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,120
I've never had such a weak death.

300
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
It's so satisfying.

301
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,560
You like a man who's powerful.

302
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,920
How can I help you?

303
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
How about...

304
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Ning Buye.

305
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,160
Kill me now if you have the guts.

306
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Brother Qi.

307
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Where did Yan Li go?

308
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
We're trapped.

309
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,960
Ning Buye can leave a fake secret passage.

310
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,160
But he can't leave this yard.

311
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,960
Bai Feng, keep searching.

312
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Zhan Yang, search.

313
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
Yes.

314
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,960
Yan Chi, look.

315
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
There's a secret passage.

316
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,720
Smells disgusting.

317
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,160
It smells unpleasant.

318
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,680
Ning Buye,

319
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,440
put down the dagger and kill him.

320
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,360
He'd better go to hell.

321
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Ning Buye.

322
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:36,920
근 rigid combo

323
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,640
This time for sure.

324
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,840
JavaScript

325
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,440
is about love.

326
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,860
The Heaven's

327
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,860
Daoist Society.

328
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,260
You know about the Heaven's Daoist Society?

329
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,360
Very good!

330
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,640
Very good?

331
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,140
Then you should know.

332
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,560
You...

333
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,360
You are a piece of cotton.

334
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,800
You deceived Princess Yong Ning.

335
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,260
You deserve to be punished!

336
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,800
I'm innocent!

337
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm still a pure...

338
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,320
pure, pure man.

339
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,100
I just went to the Flower Pavilion every day

340
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,700
because I was afraid of sleeping alone.

341
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,400
I have a deep love for Little Ning Ning.

342
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
We've been in love for three lives.

343
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,400
We spent the spring nights together at the Fengqi Pavilion.

344
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
You dare to talk nonsense again.

345
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Believe it or not, I'll tear your mouth off!

346
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Your Highness.

347
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Your Highness, are you all right?

348
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Yan Li!

349
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Yan Li!

350
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Yan Li!

351
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Yan Li!

352
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Yan Li!

353
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Yan Li!

354
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Oh.

355
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
Where is Yan Li?

356
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Here.

357
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,800
Here.

358
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,200
I'll chop you into pieces!

359
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,400
Stop!

360
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
I'll chop you into pieces!

361
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,200
Come here!

362
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
It's good that His Highness is alive.

363
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,200
It's not easy for him to live.

364
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:38,000
Why aren't youACrest wasnalis?

365
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,000
since when did you start to suspect me?

366
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,640
It doesn't matter when I suspected you.

367
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
If you didn't kill Wang Xin

368
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,040
for your smartness,

369
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,400
my suspicion would be only suspicion.

370
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,200
에는

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,920
He

372
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,400
committed suicide.

373
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,480
I must kill him.

374
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,440
They are both very λ哈哈

375
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,520
and game of throwback.

376
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,080
The case of Guanyin Town was also did by you?

377
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,440
It was not done clear enough at that time.

378
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,560
I should have YouTube more about many things.

379
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,640
But you started the Heavenly Professor?

380
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,060
It's all handled.

381
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,040
This must be heaven.

382
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,840
If you were going to kill me,

383
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,120
kill me.

384
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,700
But if I can survive for a few more years,

385
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,700
I will definitely kill you

386
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,400
for하기 apathy!

387
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
What crime did I commit?

388
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,840
The lives I have

389
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,840
are far more precious than the souls of His Highness

390
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,160
who died in the battle.

391
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,920
How dare you argue with the soldiers who defended the country?

392
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,880
The winner is the king, the loser is the leader.

393
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,720
From now on, you can be in the same group.

394
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,760
It's a pity.

395
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,120
He is also

396
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,840
a traitor.

397
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,760
Don't ruin his life.

398
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,160
You wanna be in my charge?

399
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,880
As the leader,

400
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,760
you have to

401
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,160
take the punishment.

402
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm afraid I'll die for no reason.

403
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,220
Let's

404
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,920
I can see your dog's eyes clearly

405
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,840
I am the heir of the first king

406
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,520
Open the door

407
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,120
Your Highness, please forgive me

408
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,560
Open the door

409
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,200
Open the door

410
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,920
Yang Li, stop

411
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,160
That person pretends to be Princess Yonglin

412
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,760
Stop him

413
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,240
Yes

414
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,320
Don't hurt him

415
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
What do you dare to say

416
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,400
Help

417
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,600
I kill you

418
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,640
It's him

419
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,000
The skin is covered with blood

420
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
Even if he doesn't shoot himself

421
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,800
He won't live for a few days

422
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,880
It seems that this is the mark of the Swordless Flower

423
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,720
No wonder Zhang Nengxuan was rejected

424
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,280
To play the trick

425
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,640
Just to cover up the existence of the Swordless Flower

426
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,520
I know I have no time

427
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,920
And I have to work hard to harm the lives of several people

428
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,240
This is the so-called

429
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,880
The so-called

430
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,200
The mask is made of wood

431
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,560
White

432
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
It was carefully made according to Ning Buyi's face

433
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,920
The wood is hard

434
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,800
Unless the fat and thin wheels are exactly the same as Ning Buyi

435
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,440
Otherwise, others can't wear it

436
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,320
And the white is also dark yellow

437
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,040
It can be seen that it has been made for a long time

438
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,360
It seems that you lost this mask

439
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,640
Only the owner of the white mask is qualified to wear

440
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,080
The other owner of the negative owner wears a silver mask

441
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,600
So to speak

442
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,400
Ning Buyi is the owner of the Tian Dao Club

443
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,840
The real murderer of the Qingcheng murder case

444
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,960
It's a dead end

445
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,640
But there are other parties who haven't been cleared

446
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Ning Buyi is dead

447
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,320
We can only strengthen the defense

448
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,480
Governor

449
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,960
Please send more people from the city

450
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,480
To catch the murderer of the Tian Dao Club

451
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,560
Yes

452
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,600
Master, princess

453
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,120
Ning Buyi's identity has been found

454
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,280
Minjiang and Qinghe are all in trouble

455
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
The court is worried about the disaster relief

456
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,480
Prince Yu personally escorted to Huzhou

457
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,760
But the Huzhou Ministry of Justice

458
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,760
Secretly investigated the vice minister and Ning Shoude

459
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,720
The corruption of the disaster relief fund

460
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,360
To the point of being unfavorable

461
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,280
Ning Shoude did not repent

462
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,120
Never admit his crime

463
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,080
Rejected the execution

464
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,520
The family property of the Famao

465
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,360
Three generations of descendants

466
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,560
Can't be discussed

467
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,240
Ning Shoude

468
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,160
Is Ning Buyi's father

469
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,640
He is a little rich man

470
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
How dare he talk about it

471
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,760
It's just because Prince Yu is the emperor's uncle

472
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,960
Dare not investigate him

473
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,320
His father is just a scapegoat

474
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,800
For the crime of corruption

475
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,320
Father and mother

476
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,720
No wonder he is innocent

477
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,840
Mother

478
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,720
Lan'er

479
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,840
I have something to tell you

480
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,000
What's wrong

481
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,400
Are you glad to remember

482
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,480
Duke Shen's Manuel

483
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:42,960
Yes

484
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,440
After thinking about the court

485
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,960
Is there a father same as

486
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,440
Ning Buyi's father is different to Duke Shen

487
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,040
Although he is not therag

488
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,920
But there are indeed obstacles

489
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Yes.

490
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Ning Buyi wanted to pursue justice.

491
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,760
He should have found a way to make Prince Yu confess his crime.

492
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,760
He shouldn't have used the lives of ordinary people to make a few mistakes.

493
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
I was wrong.

494
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
You weren't wrong. You were just too kind.

495
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
You were just a strange person.

496
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,760
It's wrong. You don't have to comfort me.

497
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,760
When I was pushing the case, I was drunk and tried to escape.

498
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,760
I didn't finish reading the case file and then I made a decision.

499
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
I even leaked my own heart to the public.

500
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
It was wrong.

501
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Zheng Fuying and Zhan Yang are not talkative.

502
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,760
But in the future, you should be careful when you talk to them.

503
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Thank you for your words.

504
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,760
I'm honored to have you as my husband.

505
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,760
I heard that the murderer has been arrested.

506
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,760
You did a good job in this case.

507
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Very good.

508
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Your Majesty, this case was successfully solved.

509
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Princess Yongci's credit is not enough.

510
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Zheng Fuying and Zheng Baishi also cooperated.

511
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Yongci's credit is not enough.

512
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Your crime should also be punished.

513
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Please explain, Your Majesty.

514
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,760
The criminal who was corrupt has been in the capital for several days.

515
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,760
He is still not released.

516
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,760
I wonder if you are ignoring my order and showing off your colors

517
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,760
or because the internal situation of the Shuoxi Army is not good enough

518
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,760
and you can't do anything about it.

519
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Your Majesty, I have found out that

520
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
there are indeed some bugs in the Shuoxi Army.

521
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
They are very strong.

522
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,760
They didn't go to court because they were searching for evidence.

523
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
But I can guarantee with my life

524
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,760
that the bugs in the Shuoxi Army are hard to find.

525
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
There are indeed some holes in the father's jade.

526
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
There are holes in the father's jade.

527
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,760
But the soldiers in the family are not loyal to the emperor.

528
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
They dare not deceive Your Majesty.

529
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Please investigate it, Your Majesty.

530
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Come on.

531
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Come up.

532
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Light this lamp for me.

533
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Yes.

534
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Your Majesty.

535
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
Your Majesty, please take back the fire book.

536
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Are you angry with me?

537
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
I dare not.

538
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Then why do you want to return the fire book to me?

539
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,760
This book is yours.

540
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Of course, you have to return it to me.

541
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,760
I just gave you the responsibility to light the lamp.

542
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,760
I didn't give the fire book to them.

543
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:17,760
But someone doesn't understand such a simple reason.

544
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Your father and I are brothers,

545
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,760
but we are also military officials.

546
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,760
If he can't get rid of the bugs in the Shuoxi Army,

547
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm afraid I can't be at ease again.

548
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
The land under the sky is not the land of the king.

549
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,760
The soldiers in charge are not the ministers of the king.

550
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I hope Your Majesty can go to Shuoxi with me

551
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
to save that corrupt person.

552
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,760
To support the emperor's power to defend the holy star.

553
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Okay.

554
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Then go.

555
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Don't let outsiders know about this.

556
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,760
As long as you and your father are of the same mind,

557
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,760
I will be at ease.

558
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

559
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Master, a letter from the other tribes.

560
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
It says the crown prince has sent the army provisions.

561
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
When we were on the border,

562
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
the commander found us checking the accounts in private.

563
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,760
He punished the soldiers and locked them up.

564
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
Father is really muddled.

565
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
He is so protective of those Shuoxi officials.

566
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Everyone would think he considered the Shuoxi Army as a police.

567
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
His Majesty was not satisfied with this.

568
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
If he doesn't hand over those corrupt officials,

569
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
His Majesty will definitely take advantage of this

570
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,760
to take over the whole Shuoxi Army.

571
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,760
I will go to Shuoxi to negotiate with Father.

572
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
You stay in the capital to take care of Waner.

573
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
If there is any mistake, you can come to me.

574
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Yes.

575
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
If Princess Yongci asks about this...

576
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Tell her I will go to investigate the military provisions.

577
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
I will be back soon.

578
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

579
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,760
Is it certain that the murderer is Ning Buyi?

580
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Ning Buyi was caught by Prince Rui

581
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
during the case.

582
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
He confessed to the case of the crime.

583
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
The evidence is clear.

584
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
Since the evidence is clear,

585
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
he was arrested and executed on the spot.

586
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Why did Zheng point out

587
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,760
that the case was not cleared at the end of the case?

588
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Because the witness Zhang Dongxuan pointed out

589
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,760
that there are other people in Tiandao who are not Ning Buyi.

590
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
And the vice chief is another person.

591
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Then, Zheng, do you have any clues

592
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,760
to find the vice chief?

593
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Not yet.

594
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Do you have any evidence to prove

595
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,760
that the vice chief is the one who ordered Ning Buyi to kill?

596
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Ning Buyi is the chief.

597
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Who can order him?

598
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Zheng,

599
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
the case documents should be solved in one case.

600
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Since the case is solved,

601
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
it should be considered a trial.

602
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Never make any more troubles

603
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,760
and make any more mysterious claims.

604
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,760
If His Majesty asks about it,

605
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
how do you want me to answer him?

606
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Do you want me to tell His Majesty

607
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
that there are still some mistakes to be made?

608
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
What do you mean, Zheng?

609
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
I mean,

610
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
there are still some mistakes to be made.

611
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
What do you mean, Zheng?

612
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,760
This case is a very important case.

613
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,760
It's a good thing for His Majesty and the people.

614
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Moreover,

615
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,760
His Majesty cares about Prince Yi very much.

616
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
If he knows that you are willing to set a trap

617
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
for the investigation,

618
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
if His Majesty blames you,

619
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
I'm afraid that

620
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,760
even Prince Rui and Princess Yongci

621
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
will be punished.

622
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
So in my opinion,

623
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
it's better to solve this case earlier

624
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
and be more stable to all parties.

625
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Well,

626
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
thank you for your advice.

627
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,760
I will re-write the documents

628
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
and submit them to His Majesty.

629
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Then I wish you two

630
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
to make new contributions in advance.

631
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Brother Li,

632
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,760
wait a minute.

633
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
Xiaowan,

634
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
come with me to the palace.

635
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Brother Ze will be here soon.

636
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Who is your brother?

637
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Prince Xie.

638
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,760
We haven't seen each other for almost ten years.

639
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
He is the third-best among the brothers.

640
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
He was the best to me when I was a kid.

641
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
The mother of the late Princess Consort and the seventh brother

642
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
was a handkerchief.

643
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
He also had a good relationship with the seventh brother.

644
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
Okay, let's go.

645
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
Prince Xie is here.

646
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Your Highness.

647
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Your Highness.

648
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
I greet you, grandmother.

649
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Okay,

650
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
no need to do these formalities.

651
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Ning,

652
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,760
help your third brother to sit down.

653
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Your Highness.

654
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
Ze,

655
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
you have been looking for a doctor outside for years.

656
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Why haven't you recovered yet?

657
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Grandmother,

658
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
don't worry.

659
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
I have recovered.

660
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,760
But my eyes

661
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
can't stand the strong light.

662
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
I have to use medicine to keep them.

663
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
Let Wan'er see it.

664
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,760
I can't ask for it.

665
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
It's because I heard that the doctor is wise

666
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,760
that I hurried back to the capital.

667
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

668
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Princess,

669
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
no need to be so formal.

670
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Thank you.

671
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
Your Highness,

672
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
don't worry.

673
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,760
I will ask Princess Yongci

674
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,760
to come to the palace to see you.

675
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Yes.

676
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Wan'er,

677
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
how is it?

678
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Your Highness, don't worry.

679
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
I will go to see her.

680
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
Yes.

681
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
I will go to see her.

682
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Yes.

683
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
I will go to see her.

684
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Yes.

685
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
I will go to see her.

686
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Yes.

687
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
I will go to see her.

688
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Yes.

689
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
I am worried

690
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,760
that the crown prince's old disease is cured.

691
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
He is only concerned about the liver and liver

692
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
to be cured.

693
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
He is also concerned about the liver and kidney

694
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
to be cured.

695
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
He is also concerned about the liver and kidney

696
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
to be cured.

697
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
He only needs to use acupuncture

698
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
and medicine to recover.

699
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
I can rest assured

700
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,760
with your words.

701
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Don't leave today.

702
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Stay in the palace for dinner.

703
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Where is Xiaoqi?

704
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
When he came back,

705
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,760
he didn't come to the palace to see me.

706
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Bai Feng said

707
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
that His Highness went out to work.

708
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
He will be back in a few days.

709
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Sister Yang Si will be here soon.

710
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
Don't waste your time.

711
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,760
By then,

712
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
you will have fun

713
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,760
with me.

714
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Yes, Your Highness.

715
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Brother Ze, have some tea.

716
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Brother Ze.

717
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Ning,

718
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
you don't have to be so careful.

719
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,760
I have been used to it for so many years.

720
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
I can take care of myself.

721
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Come here, Ning.

722
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
My herbal tea

723
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
can help you sleep well.

724
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Drink it every day.

725
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
You can sleep well after drinking it today.

726
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,760
I can't sleep well.

727
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Your Highness,

728
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
what's wrong with you today?

729
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
You have been unhappy.

730
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
If you are bored,

731
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
you can go to see Mr. Li.

732
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
What does it have to do with him?

733
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Why do I have to go to him?

734
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,760
Then why are you so worried?

735
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,760
Since you met the new prince today,

736
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,760
you have been in a bad shape.

737
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
I...

738
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Let me tell you.

739
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
Don't tell anyone.

740
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
That's the thing

741
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
I regret the most in my life.

742
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
I was six years old.

743
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
I participated in the first cave hunting.

744
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Because the crown prince and Brother Chen were both cruel,

745
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
they didn't want to take me to ride a horse.

746
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,760
I was angry

747
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
and went to the horse farm alone.

748
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
It was very windy that day.

749
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
I was lost on the way.

750
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
Brother Zhou Ze found me missing.

751
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
I was afraid of shame.

752
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,760
I didn't want others to see my mess.

753
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Brother Zhe

754
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
had to take the risk

755
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
to carry me back to the manor.

756
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
But he was hurt by the snow.

757
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
That year,

758
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
he was still a child.

759
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
What happened next?

760
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
Then,

761
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
Brother Zhe's eyes

762
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
were blind.

763
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
This prince

764
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,760
is a good man with feelings.

765
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Did his eyes gradually become blind?

766
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Or since that day,

767
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
he couldn't see anything?

768
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,760
He should have become blind since that day.

769
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,760
There's nothing he can do.

770
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
In recent years,

771
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
Brother Zhe has changed his name.

772
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,760
It seems that he hasn't recovered.

773
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Did his eyes get hurt before?

774
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
No.

775
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Did he have eyes before?

776
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
I don't think so.

777
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,760
But Brother Zhe has been weak since he was a child.

778
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
He has been watching things for a long time.

779
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
His eyes hurt.

780
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
If I hadn't been so willful,

781
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
how could he be so sick?

782
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,760
I'll pay for my own sins.

783
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,760
I want to marry him

784
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
and take good care of him for the rest of my life.

785
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
Why?

786
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
That's your fault for being so young.

787
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
Why do you want to pay it back with your life?

788
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Because no noble girl in the capital

789
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
would be willing to marry a disabled nun.

790
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Since it's my willfulness

791
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,760
that has caused Brother Zhe to lose his happiness for the rest of his life,

792
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,760
I can't just ignore it.

793
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
I have to take responsibility for him.

794
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
But marriage should be a two-way relationship.

795
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,760
You can't be together forever just because of a momentary sympathy.

796
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
I...

797
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
I'm willing to do it.

798
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
What about Yan Li?

799
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,760
That's right.

800
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
I don't know.

801
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
I think

802
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
if it weren't for me,

803
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
he would be very happy.

804
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
What else did Fulin say?

805
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
He also said that

806
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Princess You Ning has already given up.

807
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,760
If you still don't get your strength back,

808
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
no one can help you.

809
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
I was almost killed by someone.

810
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
How can I get my strength back?

811
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
I'm a simple and innocent girl.

812
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
I'm a simple and innocent girl.

813
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
She has seen it and hugged me.

814
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Now I'm sick and cold.

815
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
I don't even know where I am.

816
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
She is so cruel.

817
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,760
She has seen it and hugged me.

818
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,760
When did this happen?

819
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,760
It doesn't matter.

820
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
That's right.

821
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
It really doesn't matter.

822
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
What matters is that

823
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
Princess You Ning doesn't want to hug you anymore.

824
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Bai Feng.

825
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
But Princess Yong Ci said

826
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,760
that you should be dead when you're sick and cold.

827
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,760
You'd better take the medicine.

828
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
If you really die,

829
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
not only will you trouble Princess Yong Ci to come and check on you,

830
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,760
Princess You Ning will be more at ease

831
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,760
and run with Prince Xin.

832
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Where are you going?

833
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
She's not dead yet. She's thinking of remarrying.

834
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Take the medicine first.

835
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
Look at her.

836
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
She's pretty.

837
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
I heard that

838
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
you've been sick since you were a child.

839
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,760
Can you tell me the cause of your illness?

840
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,760
If you want to keep your eyes on the patient,

841
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
you can't hide anything from the doctor.

842
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
Otherwise, even if you have a temporary relief,

843
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
it will recur in a few days.

844
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
What do you mean?

845
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
This internal medicine

846
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
is aimed at the symptoms of the disease

847
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
in your organs.

848
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
But from the pulse,

849
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,760
there is another cause of the disease.

850
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
I have a guess

851
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,760
that can explain your pulse

852
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,760
and why you have an incurable disease.

853
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,760
It just needs your usual disease diagnosis.

854
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,760
I've forgotten about my childhood.

855
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,760
I can't tell you.

856
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
So,

857
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,760
you've known that

858
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
you've been poisoned since you were a child.

859
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
You're really a great doctor.

860
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,760
But let bygones be bygones.

861
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
If you really know that I have a double vision,

862
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
you can only say that fate is so cruel.

863
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,760
I just hope that you can try your best.

864
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Your Highness, since you've answered my question,

865
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
I'll do as you wish.

866
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
Your Highness,

867
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
you should rest early.

868
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
Bai Feng?

869
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,760
Your Highness.

870
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,760
Why hasn't His Highness come back yet?

871
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
His Majesty is in the military.

872
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,760
He has some misunderstandings with His Highness.

873
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
He can only go back to Shuoqi and deal with it.

874
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,760
Then why don't you follow him

875
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,760
and follow him on the way?

876
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,760
Your Highness, don't worry.

877
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,760
From Shuoqi to the capital,

878
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,760
you're very familiar with it.

879
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,760
It's absolutely fine.

880
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,760
You left me here

881
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,760
to protect you.

882
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,760
You'll be fine when you're safe.

883
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,760
What are you doing here so late at night?

884
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,760
There's been a commotion in Prince Jin's mansion.

885
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,760
Why does the day and night turn around

886
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,760
But still

887
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,760
I still see your light

888
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Like a flower

889
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,760
floating in the snow

890
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,760
So cold

891
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,760
I still see your face

892
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
So cold

893
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
So cold

894
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,760
So warm

895
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,760
If a love

896
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,760
falls into the haze

897
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,760
The snow falls

898
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,760
and my body is white

899
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,760
If a love

900
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,760
falls into my heart

901
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,760
The pain will also

902
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,760
be the same

903
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,760
Open your heart

904
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,760
Love is not about the deep sea

905
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
Please grant me courage

906
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,760
Let fate be in the way

907
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Don't be afraid of the starlight

908
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,760
Being covered by the moonlight

909
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,760
The stars will shine

910
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,760
beyond the sky

911
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,760
It's like dust in the dark

912
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,760
But it's the color of the stars

913
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,760
The sky is blue

914
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
The moon is bright

915
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,760
The moon is bright

916
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,760
The moon is bright

917
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
The moon is bright

918
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,760
The moon is bright

919
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,760
The moon is bright

920
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
The moon is bright

921
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,760
The moon is bright

922
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,760
The moon is bright

923
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,760
The moon is bright
