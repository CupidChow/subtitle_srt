1
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,900
You said ...

2
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,020
you cared...

3
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,220
her so obsessed about having babies?

4
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
Son,

5
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,860
as your father,

6
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,340
I'm asked to become a monk.

7
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,660
How do you know?

8
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,220
Is this blessing gospρώ knit on your tattoo?

9
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,240
They are tutorial車,

10
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
I'm going to the capital.

11
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
You're not going to stop your spirit?

12
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
His Majesty said,

13
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
when my father died,

14
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
I was the only one who could stop my spirit.

15
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
His Majesty is ridiculous.

16
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Father.

17
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Wan.

18
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Help me.

19
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Father,

20
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
he is Shen Wan.

21
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
He is the Crown Princess I have chosen.

22
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
If you have any grievances,

23
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
we will definitely speak for you.

24
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Father, you have died.

25
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Shen Wan, your daughter-in-law,

26
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
has been forced to do the surgery.

27
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
If you have any grievances,

28
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
please forgive us.

29
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Wan, we only have three hours.

30
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
We have limited time.

31
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Just tell me what you need to check.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
I want to know

33
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
if father died in the hands of the Emperor.

34
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Okay.

35
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
I will check the weapon and the method.

36
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Father has 17 wounds on his body.

37
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Left shoulder,

38
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
back, right wrist,

39
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
and right leg.

40
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Seven wounds on the body,

41
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
chest, abdomen,

42
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
and the chest.

43
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
He was stabbed in the chest

44
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,240
and was stabbed into the heart by a sharp sword.

45
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Where did father die?

46
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
He died in the campaign ground.

47
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
He died in the battle field.

48
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
This is the wound I found

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
between the Romans and the padawa men.

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,980
Olympic

51
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,200
Cl�h

52
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,240
mode

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
The

54
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,240
鲨 Substitute

55
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
at that time, father was preparing to be punished

56
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
to let theatenGER escape

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
to the rear gate.

58
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
Why shouldn't her move?

59
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,840
She's niños.

60
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,220
No reason.

61
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,240
Father.

62
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,300
Why didn't you somewhere else?

63
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,860
Father was never cautious.

64
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Why is this sword wound different from the usual one?

65
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
It's the fourth sword.

66
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
This is a special weapon that is unique to Rong Di.

67
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Because the sword is heavy and has a sharp blade,

68
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
the bow can't be shot.

69
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
It can only be used in the hand.

70
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Since they used the rope to cut the bow,

71
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,240
it's very likely that it's the sword wound.

72
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Since they used the rope, it's very likely that it's the sword wound.

73
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Since they used the rope, it's very likely that it's the sword wound.

74
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Since they used the rope to tie up my four fingers,

75
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,240
it's very likely that they used the rope to tie up my four fingers.

76
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Could it be that they want to...

77
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
It's a fake sword that they want to tie up my father

78
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
and make a new sword.

79
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
It's a fake sword that they want to tie up my father

80
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
and make a new sword.

81
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Why didn't anyone notice

82
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
that they were so bold?

83
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
When the arrow hit the heart,

84
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
my father was already dead.

85
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
I'm sorry.

89
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
General...

91
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
General!

92
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
When the killer left,

93
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
he took away the rope that tied up my father's fingers

94
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
and left the four-fingered sword.

95
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,240
It's like he wanted to let people know that it was the sword wound.

96
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Are you provoking me?

97
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I've hated you for a long time.

98
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
You've already stopped talking about it.

99
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
If I provoked you,

100
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm sure you can't protect yourself.

101
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
If it wasn't for you,

102
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
it would have been a fake sword.

103
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
The killer must have known about your weapons.

104
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
It's also familiar with your path.

105
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
If so,

106
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
the people in the Ruoxi Army are most suspicious.

107
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
It's time to reflect on our actions.

108
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Did you see the signs of the foreigners

109
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
when you were in the war?

110
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
No.

111
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
His Highness has ordered us to investigate the border.

112
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Did you see the killer's face?

113
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
No.

114
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
The bandits have run away when I arrived.

115
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
His Highness and his brothers have...

116
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
I've been following you for many years.

117
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Have you seen the enemy

118
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
use ropes to break in and break in our people?

119
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Use ropes to break in?

120
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
How did you know about this?

121
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
What do you mean?

122
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
You don't know.

123
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
After you entered the capital,

124
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
His Highness ordered the Tianshu Camp

125
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:57,120
to use a

126
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
rope to break in our people.

127
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Father, I swear that

128
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,240
no matter who killed you,

129
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
I will do my best

130
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
to fight for you

131
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
with Yanchi.

132
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
I want to see my son.

133
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Your Highness, you can't go.

134
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
I want to see...

135
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Please, Your Highness, use the rope to break in.

136
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
His Majesty has arrived.

137
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
I want to see...

138
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
Mother, what are you doing?

139
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
What are you doing?

140
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
I want to see my son.

141
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Mother.

142
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Hurry up and leave.

143
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Hurry up.

144
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Mother, listen to me.

145
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,240
I will wait for you to recover.

146
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
I will accompany you

147
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
to pay respects to His Majesty.

148
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
What do you think?

149
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
By that time,

150
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
I can only see a tomb.

151
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Don't stop me.

152
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Let me go.

153
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Mother, I have to do this.

154
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,240
I have to do this.

155
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
I am not only his brother,

156
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
but also the king of this country.

157
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
I have to do this.

158
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
I have to do this.

159
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
I have to do this.

160
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
So what?

161
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,240
I have a lot of respect for you.

162
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Since you were promoted,

163
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,240
you have been in the army for more than 20 years.

164
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Without your guidance,

165
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,240
he would never step out of the palace.

166
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
You see him as a great man.

167
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Even his descendants

168
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,240
are all your descendants.

169
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
What kind of emperor are you?

170
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,240
What kind of brother are you?

171
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
It is my fault

172
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,240
to make you so sad.

173
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
But mother,

174
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,240
the king suddenly died.

175
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,240
It will cause a riot

176
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
at the border and at the court.

177
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,020
I have to cut the

178
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,240
military power of Shuoxi

179
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,240
to make a smooth transition.

180
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
For your court,

181
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I have to step back

182
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
until I can't even see

183
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,240
my son for the last time.

184
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,240
I don't care if you don't do it.

185
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Mother!

186
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,240
Do you only love the emperor?

187
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,240
What about my son?

188
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:48,240
My son is also your son.

189
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,240
I will never forget you.

190
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,240
I will never forget you.

191
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,240
I will never forget you.

192
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,240
I will never forget you.

193
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
The King of Jin's body guard, Song Xiwen,

194
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
was killed by the King of Jin's body guard.

195
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Song Xiwen?

196
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
A man who was supposed to be imprisoned

197
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,240
in the prison

198
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
died in the prison of the King of Jin.

199
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,240
This is really strange.

200
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Your Majesty,

201
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
we have already found out about the King of Jin's case.

202
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Even if Song Xiwen was the one who died,

203
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
he was a man of great power.

204
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
If we investigate this case again,

205
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
it will be a disaster

206
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
if the old case is re-established

207
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
and the people are confused.

208
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Your Majesty,

209
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Marquis Zhongyong is right.

210
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
But the King of Jin's case

211
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
is very different from the South Division case.

212
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
If we don't investigate this case,

213
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
it will be a big problem for the people.

214
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
I think the King of Jin's case

215
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
is a big problem for the people.

216
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
I'm afraid it will be even more

217
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
a disaster for the people

218
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
to question the King of Jin's case.

219
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Li Muyun.

220
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

221
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
The case will be handled by the Court of Judicial Review.

222
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
What are you going to do about it?

223
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Your Majesty,

224
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
I think the investigation

225
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
of this case

226
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
is more important

227
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
for the people

228
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
and the peace of the court.

229
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm willing to investigate this case thoroughly

230
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
and give an explanation

231
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
to Your Majesty, the court,

232
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
and the people of the Zhou Dynasty.

233
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
The King of Jin's funeral

234
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
is held by Yan Chi, the heir.

235
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Yan Chi will be the one

236
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
who will be in charge of this case.

237
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
The Court of Judicial Review

238
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
will assist the King of Jin

239
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
in handling this case.

240
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,480
The Court of Judicial Review

241
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Why did you come back so soon?

242
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Everything is done?

243
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Heart builtirefully.

244
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,240
The sooner I come back, the more assured His Majesty will be.

245
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,040
Do you know that His Majesty has handed the case of Song Xiwen to Prince Cheng?

246
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,240
I know.

247
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Wan'er, if I lose the post of Minister of Justice

248
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,240
and fail to take the throne, will you still marry me?

249
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,240
I'll open a clinic and raise you. I'm completely willing to do so.

250
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Yanzhi, I don't want to wait any longer.

251
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,240
I'll go and beg the Empress Dowager.

252
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,240
I just don't know if you're willing to do so.

253
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Wan'er.

254
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Your Highness, Princess Yongsi.

255
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
The Empress Dowager has woken up.

256
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Thank you, Momo.

257
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Empress Dowager.

258
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

259
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
I'll take it as a yes.

260
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
Grandmother, Father has been waiting for this moment for a lifetime.

261
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,240
He's prepared for this.

262
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
I've arranged everything.

263
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Please take good care of yourself.

264
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
And take care of yourself.

265
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Empress Dowager, I'll give you the pulse.

266
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
I'm so worried.

267
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,240
It's good that you've thought it through.

268
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Grandmother, Father has been waiting for this moment for a lifetime.

269
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Before he died, he didn't get to see me.

270
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,240
I've been waiting for this moment for a lifetime.

271
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,240
I want to marry Princess Yongsi as soon as possible.

272
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
I'll tell Father.

273
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
I hope he can rest in peace.

274
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Grandmother, please help me.

275
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,240
If you marry him,

276
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
you'll be a nuisance.

277
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,240
If you get married,

278
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
you'll be in trouble.

279
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Empress Dowager, I wanted this.

280
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
But I asked Yanchi to take the initiative.

281
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
I can even do the dance.

282
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
How can I be afraid of being criticized?

283
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
As long as I'm with Yanchi,

284
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
I won't feel wronged.

285
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
I lost a son.

286
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,240
And I have a great grandson.

287
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Fine.

288
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,240
I'll let the Heavens see the day.

289
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
I'll get married for you.

290
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
I thank you, Empress Dowager.

291
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Young Mistress.

292
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Madam.

293
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Prince Chen wants to marry the Fifth Lady.

294
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Please take the betrothal gift and get ready.

295
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
We are the family of Qin.

296
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
We can't let the legitimate daughter be the concubine.

297
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Prince Chen must have misunderstood.

298
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Prince Chen especially told me that

299
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,240
the Fifth Lady is willing to be the concubine.

300
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
If you have any questions,

301
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,240
you can ask the Fifth Lady to come out and ask her face to face.

302
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
How is that possible?

303
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,240
How can the daughter of the Qin family be the concubine?

304
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
I'm willing.

305
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Don't talk nonsense.

306
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Your sister will marry the Eastern Palace soon.

307
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
You said you would be the concubine of Prince Chen.

308
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,240
How can you let the Empress, the Crown Prince, and the House of Zhongyong be the concubine?

309
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
I'm the eldest daughter of the Third House.

310
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
I'm the concubine.

311
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
What does it have to do with you?

312
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Madam.

313
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Please go back and tell Prince Chen

314
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,240
that what happened today happened suddenly.

315
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
After I understand the situation,

316
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
I will give you an answer.

317
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm unfilial.

318
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,240
I already have a family of a married couple with Prince Chen.

319
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Prince Chen said he would be good to me for the rest of his life.

320
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
I beg you to forgive me.

321
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
I will not let you go.

322
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,240
The Empress said she would be good to me for the rest of her life.

323
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
I beg you to forgive me.

324
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
You bastard!

325
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,240
Marquis, Madam Wu is now the concubine of Prince Chen.

326
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
Even if you want to teach her a lesson,

327
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
you should have some manners.

328
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Get out of here.

329
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Our House of Zhongyong doesn't have a bitch like you.

330
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
Get out of here!

331
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Wan He, let's go.

332
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
Madam Wu.

333
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
I...

334
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,240
I want to stay and serve you.

335
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Now you are betraying me too.

336
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Since you have shown your true intentions,

337
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,240
I will take my leave.

338
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Madam Wu, please.

339
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,240
I will remember all of your humiliation today.

340
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Don't ever regret taking me to the palace.

341
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,240
The King of Chu

342
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
The General is planning to attack Qi Yu.

343
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
But the brothers of Shuoxi

344
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,240
greet the Young Marshal and Princess Yongci.

345
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
You don't have to be so formal.

346
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
How is the situation in Shuoxi?

347
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,240
His Majesty ordered the Ministry of War to directly take over the military power of Shuoxi.

348
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,240
He asked the General's deputy general to leave Shuoxi.

349
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
The General's death is still unknown.

350
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,240
The brothers are not ready to obey the order.

351
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,240
They are now under pressure to disobey the military order.

352
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
The Crown Prince and Prince Cheng

353
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
have already taken advantage of the situation.

354
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
That's strange.

355
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,240
At this point,

356
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,240
the Ministry of War is just a way for us to stay safe.

357
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
At least, it can keep everyone safe.

358
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,240
As long as we are alive, the soldiers of Shuoxi will not be scattered.

359
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
I will take revenge for Father

360
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,240
as long as I have a single breath.

361
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,240
I thank the Young Marshal on behalf of the soldiers of Shuoxi.

362
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Qingqing,

363
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I should do all of this.

364
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,240
The General only wants to be a great man

365
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,240
to the people of the Great Zhou.

366
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,240
I found this when I was tidying up the General's belongings.

367
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,240
It's a precious thing for the General.

368
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,240
So I came to return it to the Young Marshal.

369
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Thank you, Sir.

370
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
This is...

372
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,240
This is the picture of the King of the Fu family.

373
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Mother's portrait.

374
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,240
It's different from the one in her study.

375
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Father and Mother

376
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,240
are just like a child.

377
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm sorry.

378
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
I'm sorry.

379
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
I'm sorry.

380
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
I'm sorry.

381
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm sorry.

382
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I'm sorry.

383
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Father and Mother are just like a child.

384
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
Why is there blood on this hairband?

385
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,240
This is the hairband that the Empress Dowager sewed for me

386
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,240
when I was eight years old.

387
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,240
I didn't know that my father kept this.

388
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
I'm sorry.

389
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm sorry.

390
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm sorry.

391
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
General.

392
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
A qualified soldier

393
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
will never throw away his own weapons on the battlefield.

394
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Pick it up.

395
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Good! Good!

396
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Good! Good!

397
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
In this battle,

398
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I've been willing to sacrifice my life

399
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
for the sake of my family.

400
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,240
I've been willing to sacrifice my life

401
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,240
for the sake of my family.

402
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,240
as the real Goddess Patis

403
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:55,240
If my tears

404
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,240
I don't yields to of you.

405
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,240
As the soul of the Aegean 21

406
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,240
I don't have a son who is afraid of death.

407
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,240
I...

408
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
I'll take my leave.

409
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,240
I've been betrayed.

410
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
How can I be free?

411
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,240
But I was born in the country.

412
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
When the court was in a crisis,

413
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,240
I was a good student.

414
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,240
I couldn't be free.

415
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
It's hard to be a good student.

416
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,240
But I've never returned to the country.

417
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,240
I'm sorry for my mother's death.

418
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,240
I hope you don't hate me.

419
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,240
I'm sorry.

420
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,240
I'm sorry.

421
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,240
I've always known that you're on guard against him.

422
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,240
But you believe me.

423
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,240
He knows your feelings.

424
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,240
He never doubted you.

425
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,240
He knows you're doing this for him.

426
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,240
To protect Shuxi.

427
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm sorry.

428
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,240
I'm sorry.

429
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,240
I'm sorry.

430
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,240
I'm sorry.

431
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,240
I'm sorry.

432
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,240
I'm sorry.

433
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,240
I'm sorry.

434
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,240
I'm sorry.

435
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,240
I'm sorry.

436
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,240
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Father.

438
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Just be heard!

439
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,640
MARY

440
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Med fabulous

441
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,960
Even a continuation of the past

442
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Spread hope.

443
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
If he finds out about this,

444
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,740
you let Song Xiwen go without permission.

445
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,240
He will take advantage of this.

446
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Shut up!

447
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,740
Song Xiwen's case has nothing to do with us.

448
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,240
They can investigate it.

449
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
It's none of our business.

450
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,240
Just be your crown prince.

451
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Father.

452
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,240
I was the one who took care of Song Xiwen's maids.

453
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
I had to take the blame.

454
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
I had to take the blame for a maid.

455
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
The maid who took Song Xiwen away

456
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,240
was Wan Xi, the maid of the empress.

457
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,240
What's the situation of Wan Xi now?

458
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
It's about the empress.

459
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,240
I dare not to take the blame without your permission.

460
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Don't be so rude in front of me.

461
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Follow my order.

462
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
Take Wan Xi away.

463
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Yes, father.

464
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
Wan Xi.

465
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
I'm here.

466
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
I will take good care of your family.

467
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
You can go now.

468
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Thank you for your kindness.

469
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,240
The King of the Heavens

470
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Do you know who is the general

471
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
who doesn't rely on military power?

472
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,240
It's only the former leader of the Heavens, Jiang Heying.

473
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,240
He said he would go back to his hometown to raise his mother.

474
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
He was a good-natured man.

475
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,240
So he recommended him to the chief of the country.

476
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
Why did he ask about this?

477
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,240
The method of killing father is similar to Tianshu Camp.

478
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Only those who are involved in the development of Tianshu Camp

479
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
can know the key to it.

480
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,240
The soldiers of Shuoxi are so disrespectful to the general.

481
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
How could they do such a treacherous thing?

482
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,240
I did it for King of Rui.

483
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,240
The wounds on his body are not fake.

484
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Jiang Heying is only promoted by the general.

485
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,240
How dare he harm the general and the Shuoxi Army?

486
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,240
If there is a man who is superior to father in power,

487
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
he is destined to be like this.

488
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
If he thinks he can protect him,

489
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,240
he can have a better future.

490
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,240
The general is so powerful

491
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,240
that he is superior to the general.

492
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Your Majesty,

493
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
he may be the new king of the future.

494
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,240
You mean the crown prince?

495
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
The father of the queen is in charge of the North.

496
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,240
There is no need to come to Shoulongshuo.

497
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
Besides, the emperor has already

498
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,240
expressed his disdain to the crown prince.

499
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Everyone knows that the emperor has sent King of Rui

500
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
to arrest the crown prince.

501
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,240
If Jiang Heying wants to make a great contribution,

502
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,240
he will choose King of Rui.

503
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
It's him.

504
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Besides, Jiang Heying is trusted by father.

505
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,240
He knows father's skills.

506
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
It's a good chance to make a good move.

507
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
And your whereabouts.

508
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Jiang Heying has a connection with the king of Rui.

509
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
He assassinated your father's master.

510
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,240
It's possible that King of Rui is Yan Qi.

511
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,240
If it's King of Rui, we still have a way to deal with it.

512
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,240
But if it's the emperor who gave the order to Jiang Heying,

513
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,240
what should we do?

514
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Whether it's the emperor or King of Rui,

515
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
we should act carefully.

516
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
The most important thing now is to protect

517
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,240
the current forces of the Shuoxi Army.

518
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
Please go back to Shuoxi

519
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
and stop the storm.

520
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,240
I will go back after I find out the truth.

521
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Yes, your majesty.

522
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm afraid that the time will come.

523
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
Are you afraid?

524
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
No.

525
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
My lady, my princess.

526
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,240
The emperor has been ordered to interrogate the princess.

527
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
The empress didn't stop him?

528
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
No.

529
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,240
It seems that Wanxi is ready to follow the king.

530
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,240
How can the empress be taken away by the king?

531
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,240
I'm just asking for a favor.

532
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,240
I wasn't sure if Song Xiwen's death had anything to do with the empress.

533
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,240
But now it seems that it's the empress.

534
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
Wanxi is so obedient.

535
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
It seems that she is determined to die.

536
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,240
I'm afraid that the king will be defeated this time.

537
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,240
I hope that she can be released.

538
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,240
I will go to the palace now.

539
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Please go back now.

540
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
I will see you tomorrow.

541
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,240
You must be tired.

542
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
All right, my lady.

543
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I will go now.

544
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
I will see you tomorrow.

545
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
I will go now.

546
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
I will see you tomorrow.

547
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,240
I will go now.

548
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
I will go now.

549
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,240
I will go now.

550
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
I will go now.

551
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,640
I don't think it's appropriate to do this.

552
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,480
If he had confessed earlier,

553
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
he would have avoided the pain of being skinned.

554
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,080
But he didn't.

555
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,280
But the confession he got

556
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,840
is definitely not true.

557
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,200
Besides, it's not compatible with the law.

558
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,560
I'm afraid you forgot.

559
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,440
This is the Dali Temple, not the Jinzhao Temple.

560
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,120
If you're not used to it,

561
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,160
the door is right there.

562
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,360
Please go ahead.

563
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,000
Your Highness.

564
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,760
Your Highness.

565
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,640
His Majesty ordered me to have a close examination with the government.

566
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,040
If someone is sentenced to death,

567
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,080
if His Majesty asks,

568
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,920
I'm afraid I can only tell the truth.

569
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,560
Your Highness.

570
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,720
Wanxi's heart is injured.

571
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,200
I'm afraid she can't take it anymore.

572
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,480
Send Wanxi back to Fengyi Palace.

573
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,000
Whether she's saved or not,

574
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,440
is up to the Empress.

575
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,120
Yes.

576
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,320
Everyone, the breast is podcasts.

577
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,840
Brother Ze.

578
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,000
venging around my grandmother's house is trongu intentionally tamedu

579
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,560
Then she'll go home and ask me to stretch the survival spirit of Répander slices

580
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,520
Don't make me suffer.

581
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,120
Your Majesty, you've been playing chess well.

582
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,720
I won three games in a row against His Majesty.

583
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,120
I'll win this game right away.

584
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,520
Your Highness, you actually won against His Majesty.

585
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,320
His Majesty is a master of chess.

586
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,720
Before I went out to look for a doctor,

587
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,320
I never won against His Majesty.

588
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,520
His Majesty is busy with court affairs.

589
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,320
Let alone playing chess,

590
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,720
he hasn't been free these years.

591
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,920
His Majesty is diligent.

592
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,320
It must be hard for him.

593
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,520
Please.

594
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,120
Xiaowan, come here.

595
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,320
If my grandmother wins the game,

596
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,120
she'll give us a lot of money.

597
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Greetings, Your Highness, Grandmother.

598
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,920
Why are you here alone?

599
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,720
Didn't Xiaoqi accompany you?

600
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
She...

601
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,520
She asked me to buy a peace-making pulse for you.

602
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,720
Xiaoqi is so thoughtful.

603
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,120
I'm tired too.

604
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,120
You should play this game some other day.

605
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
That's right.

606
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
We've been bothering you for a long time.

607
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,920
Wan'er, take care of the food.

608
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
Let Sister-in-law rest.

609
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,920
Ming'er, let's go.

610
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,520
See the Princess Dowager off.

611
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Yes.

612
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,520
What's wrong?

613
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,520
Nothing serious.

614
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,920
It's just that Song Xiwen has a secret.

615
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,320
I'd like to ask you for advice.

616
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,120
Song Xiwen?

617
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,920
Is he the guard from the Prince of Jin's manor?

618
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
Yes.

619
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,720
He's a maid of the Imperial Secretariat.

620
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
It's Wan Xi, the maid of the Empress.

621
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,120
She took Song Xiwen away.

622
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,920
Prince of Jin caught her and punished her.

623
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,520
But she didn't say anything.

624
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,720
Wan Xi served me in the palace.

625
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,520
She was loyal and was very polite.

626
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,920
If she didn't want to say anything, no one would know.

627
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,720
But it was a long story.

628
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,320
She was so serious about Wan Xi.

629
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,920
Even if she didn't say anything,

630
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,120
she was still in touch with her.

631
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,720
It's about the Prince of Jin's manor.

632
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,320
That's why I'm worried.

633
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,520
I never believed that

634
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,920
the Prince of Jin would do such a thing.

635
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,520
That's why she wanted to find out

636
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,920
what happened that night.

637
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,520
The Prince of Jin is a good boy and a good brother.

638
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,520
He's the only son of the Prince.

639
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
You should investigate this case

640
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,920
and give the Prince of Jin an explanation.

641
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,120
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

642
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:18,120
I heard that Wan Xi had a godson in the Imperial Secretariat.

643
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,520
His name is Wang Han.

644
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,120
He's a very important person.

645
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,320
Master, in order to catch him,

646
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,120
I had several men to tie him up.

647
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,520
Who is your master?

648
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,720
Who are you?

649
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,120
How could he be so scared?

650
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,520
You're from the palace

651
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,520
with a woman's voice.

652
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,320
I won't betray the Empress.

653
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,720
I don't want the money.

654
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,920
I don't want the position in the Imperial Secretariat.

655
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,120
Please let me go.

656
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,120
Let my family go.

657
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,520
Don't let him talk nonsense.

658
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,720
Just shut him up.

659
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,520
Yes.

660
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
No, no.

661
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,720
Stop talking nonsense.

662
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,120
Shut up.

663
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,920
Don't worry, Mother.

664
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,720
Once the soil is dug,

665
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,720
I'll make sure he dies without a sound.

666
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

667
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Idiot.

668
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,520
Do you really think you can live?

669
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,920
The Empress said that

670
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,720
you can't live in the Hengshu.

671
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,320
Stop!

672
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,920
Stop!

673
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,320
Stop!

674
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,520
Stop!

675
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,920
Stop!

676
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,520
Stop!

677
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,720
Stop!

678
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,320
Stop!

679
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,520
Help!

680
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,120
Don't kill him!

681
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,720
Help!

682
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,920
Help!

683
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Help!

684
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,320
The wind blows

685
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,920
like the snow

686
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,920
but it still

687
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,920
shines on you

688
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
The fragrance

689
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
is moving

690
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,920
in the snow

691
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,920
It's so cold

692
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,920
and so warm

693
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,920
If a layer of love

694
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,920
falls into the haze

695
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,120
The pain will also

696
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,120
be the same

697
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,120
Open your heart

698
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Love doesn't matter

699
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,120
I'm brave

700
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,120
Let fate

701
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,120
be my guide

702
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,120
I'm brave

703
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,120
Let fate

704
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,120
be my guide

705
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
Don't be afraid

706
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
of the stars

707
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,320
being touched by the moonlight

708
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,320
The stars will shine

709
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,320
beyond the sky

710
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
The sky is so bright

711
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
but it's still

712
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,320
the color of the stars

713
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,520
The sky is so bright

714
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,520
but it's still

715
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,520
the color of the stars

716
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,520
The sky is so bright

717
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,520
but it's still

718
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,520
the color of the stars
