00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
As you watch this long video, you'll understand why I didn't do this intro.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,020
We hope you will enjoy this one second just for fun.

3
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,500
nine']

4
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,800
if God beggars.

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,520
thank you.

6
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,800
Whoa.

7
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,000
That's it.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Punch him to him with the sword and then rush into deep danger.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,060
Over my dead body, I can hold him up once again.

10
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,720
Don't move.

11
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't understand why they kept calculation plans for Iguotou.

12
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,640
Butpes of bats slowly start to rise.

13
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
Mother!

14
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Wenxing!

15
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
The fire is burning.

16
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,640
The guardian is late.

17
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Please punish her.

18
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
The water is boiling!

19
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
The pond is boiling!

20
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
The pond?

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
The old lady is in the pond!

22
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Oh no!

23
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Cai He!

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Where is Cai He?

25
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Cai He!

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Wenxing!

27
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Hurry!

28
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Help!

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
The fire is burning!

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Help!

31
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
The fire is burning!

32
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Hurry!

33
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Help!

34
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Hurry!

35
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
The fire is burning!

36
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
The fire is burning!

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Don't just stand there!

38
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Go fetch water!

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Yes, sir!

40
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Hurry!

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Go!

42
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Save the fire!

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Over there!

44
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Sir!

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
The pond is covered with copper oil.

46
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
It's useless to fetch water!

47
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
What's the use of that?

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Hurry and think of a way!

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Yes, sir!

50
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Cai He!

51
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
I won't save anyone!

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Cai He!

53
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
I won't save anyone either!

54
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
The fire is too strong!

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
We can't get in!

56
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Qin Shouqin!

57
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
You abused my younger sister,

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
insulted my mother,

59
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
burned my father to death,

60
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,640
and ruined my family.

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
You abused my older sister,

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,640
and hurt my mother's head,

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
and my family.

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
You killed people and killed people.

65
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
You are the victim of the tiger!

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Old Madam,

67
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Buddha's words are so cruel.

68
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,640
I, Yang Shi Cai He, have been in the house for five years.

69
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,640
I only have this much blood to pay for today!

70
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,640
I want Qin An to watch the Qin family

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
and cut off their descendants.

72
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
I'd rather die than come back.

73
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Mother!

74
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Mother!

75
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Don't stop me!

76
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
My mother is still inside!

77
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Qin An!

78
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Why is Qin An still inside?

79
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
It's because Cai He tricked my mother!

80
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Save my mother!

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
She's pregnant with your child!

82
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Hurry and untie her!

83
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Cheng Er!

84
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Cheng Er!

85
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Cheng Er!

86
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Cheng Er!

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Cheng Er!

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
Cheng Er!

89
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Cheng Er!

90
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Cheng Er!

91
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Cheng Er!

92
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Cheng Er!

93
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Cheng Er!

94
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Cheng Er!

95
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Cheng Er!

96
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Cheng Er!

97
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Cheng Er!

98
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Cheng Er!

99
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Xin Lan is still inside!

100
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
She's almost giving birth!

101
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
My unborn grandson!

102
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
My grandson!

103
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
What should we do?

104
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Xin Lan!

105
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Cheng Er!

106
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
Cheng Er!

107
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Save Cheng Er!

108
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Someone, save him!

109
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Qing Wan!

110
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Someone, save him!

111
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Cheng Er!

112
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Please do it.

113
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
It's okay, don't panic.

114
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Let's save him first.

115
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
My sister-in-law is still inside.

116
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
She's still pregnant with the child.

117
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
If she doesn't come out, I'm afraid...

118
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Wan!

119
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Wan, are you okay?

120
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
I'm fine.

121
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Why are you here?

122
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
I heard that Qin's manor is on fire.

123
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Grandmother is worried sick.

124
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
She asked me to come here to see Wan.

125
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Xin Lan!

126
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
Grandmother!

127
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Grandmother!

128
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Grandmother!

129
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Hurry, hurry up.

130
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
I'll untie you.

131
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Hurry.

132
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Save Xin Lan, save the child!

133
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Xin Lan, Xin Lan?

134
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Xin Lan, how are you doing?

135
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
My stomach...

136
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
The child can't hold on anymore.

137
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Save!

138
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Save the child.

139
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
He's okay now.

140
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
My child.

141
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Grandma,

142
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
you're hurting me.

143
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,940
Okay, I'll take you away.

144
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Cheng'er!

145
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Grandma!

146
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Hurry up!

147
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Someone help!

148
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Hurry up!

149
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Hurry up!

150
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Hurry up!

151
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Come with me.

152
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Take care of her.

153
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Cheng'er!

155
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Grandma!

156
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Grandma!

157
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Grandma!

158
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
Grandma!

159
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
She's dead.

160
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Why did you do this?

161
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Why?

162
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Why?

163
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Why?

164
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Why?

165
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Why?

166
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Why?

167
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Why?

168
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Why?

169
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Why?

170
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Why?

171
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Why?

172
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Why?

173
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Why did you do this?

174
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Why do we have to ask

175
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
why between enemies?

176
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
But my wife and son are innocent.

177
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Who told them to be Qin?

178
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I avenge you.

179
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
I regret killing you.

180
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Why did you lie to me?

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Is it because

182
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
we were both fake?

183
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
We were both fake!

184
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Everything was fake.

185
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
I've been lying to you from the beginning.

186
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
In my heart,

187
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,640
you've always been my enemy's son.

188
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
I want you to see your father

189
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
turn into a rotten flesh

190
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
and go to hell with me!

191
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
No!

192
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
No!

193
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
You lied to me!

194
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
You said you loved me, right?

195
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
You loved me, right?

196
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
You loved me, right?

197
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
You said you loved me!

198
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
You said...

199
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
You said...

200
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
You said you loved me, right?

201
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
You said you loved me, right?

202
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
You said you loved me, right?

203
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
You said you loved me, right?

204
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
You said you loved me, right?

205
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
You said you loved me, right?

206
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
You said you loved me, right?

207
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
You said you loved me, right?

208
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
You said you loved me, right?

209
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
You said you loved me, right?

210
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
You said you loved me, right?

211
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
You said you loved me, right?

212
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
You said you loved me, right?

213
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
You said you loved me, right?

214
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
You said you loved me, right?

215
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
You said you loved me, right?

216
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
You said you loved me, right?

217
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
You said you loved me, right?

218
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
You said you loved me, right?

219
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
You said you loved me, right?

220
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
You said you loved me, right?

221
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
You said you loved me, right?

222
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,640
I can't hear your voice

223
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,640
I can't hear your voice

224
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,640
I can't hear your voice

225
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,640
If I have to cross the road

226
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,640
I don't need to worry about it anymore

227
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
I can't forget the regret

228
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,640
I can't forget the regret

229
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,640
I can't forget the regret

230
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Don't sigh for me

231
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
The flowers that have lost their color

232
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,640
The memories are so much like

233
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,640
The song I sang for you

234
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Sighing for the love and the dream

235
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Sighing for the whole life

236
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,640
How can't I forget

237
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,640
That one night

238
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Don't sigh for me

239
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,640
The flowers that have lost their color

240
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,640
The memories are so much like

241
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,640
The song I sang for you

242
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Sighing for the eyes, sighing for forgiveness

243
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Sighing for how much time has passed

244
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
How can't I forget

245
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,640
That one night

246
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
How can't I forget

247
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,640
That one night

248
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Young Mistress is giving birth!

249
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
A boy or a girl?

250
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
A girl!

251
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Really?

252
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Let's go and take a look!

253
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Let's go!

254
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
It's finally a boy!

255
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Shuang'er, let's go back first

256
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,640
It's not convenient to stay at Qin's house today

257
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Let's treat the Princess well another day

258
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Mother, let me see my niece

259
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Big Brother only left her a little bit of blood

260
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
What's there to see?

261
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
It's just a girl

262
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
It's not a big deal to find a niece

263
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Why is it a girl?

264
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Is the girl also a member of the Qin family?

265
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
What's wrong with these Qin family members?

266
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Sister-in-law, you heard it all

267
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
If you still have the will to die

268
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Your child will have to face this cold home alone

269
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,640
I don't know if I can grow up safely

270
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Do you really have the heart to treat her in such a cold place?

271
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I want to be a fairy

272
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,640
I will never step into this dirty place again

273
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Mother

274
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,640
I used to think that Qin Chen looked like a young man

275
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,640
I didn't expect him to do such a thing

276
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
He took three lives

277
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,640
I thought he had already wiped out the cold

278
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,640
I didn't expect him to save his wife and children in the end

279
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
The human heart is the most complicated

280
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Cai He was a victim

281
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,640
But he became a cruel and cold man in the end

282
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Qin Chen killed his wife for personal reasons

283
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,640
But he still has the heart to poison

284
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Now they are in the sea of flowers together

285
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,640
It's harder to get rid of the hatred and hatred of this life

286
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,640
The matter of the Qin family is really unthinkable

287
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,640
No wonder you two don't have time to talk to me

288
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,640
But the main criminal and the sub-criminal are both dead

289
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
This case is also settled

290
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Does Xiaowan have time to accompany me?

291
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
The Qin family is in a critical situation

292
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
It's inevitable to hurt her own self

293
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
How can I have the heart to play with you?

294
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
What are you afraid of?

295
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,640
How about you move in with me?

296
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
I can also work with you

297
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Thank you, Princess

298
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
But the Qin family is now in a critical situation

299
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I can't get you involved and be criticized

300
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
I'm not afraid

301
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Who dares to criticize you

302
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
I... I'll whip them with a whip

303
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
My lady

304
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
If Qin family is defeated in the future

305
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Have you ever thought about where to go?

306
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,640
I don't have the heart to think about it now

307
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
When I join the Ministry of Justice in the future

308
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Will you be willing to help me?

309
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
But I still wish you a feast

310
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Xiaowan can all participate

311
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
I can do whatever I can

312
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
I can also participate

313
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
I can't ask for it

314
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Great, I'm going too

315
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Come with me

316
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
You are so angry

317
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
You know how to play with me every day

318
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
How can you use your horse to ride

319
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Why are your hands so big?

320
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm sorry

321
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
My lady

322
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,640
You shouldn't have promised to go to the capital with the Crown Prince

323
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
Why not?

324
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
His Highness is about to be appointed to the Ministry of Justice

325
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I can not only do the feast

326
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I can also enter the Ministry of Justice

327
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
To find out about my father's grievances

328
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
How can I miss such a good opportunity?

329
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
But you are a woman who has not left the palace

330
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
You promised to go to the capital with a man

331
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Aren't you afraid that the Crown Prince will be suspicious?

332
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
That day I heard that the Ninth Madam mentioned

333
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Shen Yi, Shen Si Xing's Da Li Temple

334
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,640
I looked for her to read

335
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
I found that Shen Si Xing's case

336
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
It is indeed a good example

337
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
The master of the sword is really a great person

338
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,640
How do you know that the one with the Xie mask is me?

339
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,640
The Xie Zhi Shan is a woman

340
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
In this world, except you

341
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Who else will wear such a fierce mask?

342
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
I'm afraid he has already noticed

343
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Then you dare

344
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,640
I have seen the wounds on his body

345
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Most of them are the wounds left by the Shuxi Huotian

346
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
In addition to Rong Di

347
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
I think in the Zhou Dynasty

348
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
There is no law to prevent him from fighting with the dead

349
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,640
He put the micro-winded Shuxi Shaoshuai

350
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
He wants to enter the Ministry of Justice

351
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
But he keeps trying to seduce me

352
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
There must be his plans

353
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
No matter what his purpose is

354
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Since he dares to use me and is loyal to me

355
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Why should I take the money?

356
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,640
I didn't expect the noble man like the Prince of Rui

357
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
There is also a difficult problem

358
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Father was born

359
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
The relatives and relatives of Hui Ji are more than a hundred

360
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
One move is a fierce injustice

361
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Only the Crown Prince is still in the family

362
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
It's not a waste of a generation

363
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Whether he is sincere or not

364
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Since he is willing to say this

365
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
I will take his favor

366
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,640
The Crown Prince is a good person

367
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
Wife, how about we

368
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Tell the Crown Prince about the old master's grievances

369
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
No

370
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
The Crown Prince is the cousin of Prince Jin

371
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Father's grievances are closely related to the death of Prince Jin

372
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Now the Crown Prince and I can still meet each other

373
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
But the truth is still unknown

374
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Whether it is a friend or a foe

375
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,640
So whether he doubts my identity

376
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
As long as he has no evidence

377
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
We can't admit it

378
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Qin kai

379
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
And theimmability to annihilate chariots

380
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
To keep from the law of the distant island

381
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Qin chen and they are fools

382
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:24,700
with Nourosensical

383
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,080
alguma college

384
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,040
Then噯

385
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Dad is gone

386
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,280
Can you go and beg the Crown Prince

387
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,240
to leave something for the three of us to tie up?

388
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,680
Otherwise, none of you three sisters will get married.

389
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,880
How can we let this family live?

390
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,360
Why would Mother beg him?

391
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,880
It was him who caused us to die!

392
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,360
If it weren't for you,

393
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,720
how could Grandmother and Eldest Brother die so tragically?

394
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,920
Mother, when those women were begging for their lives,

395
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,000
did anyone in our family ever let them off?

396
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,160
Now, how can we have the honor to beg the money to tie us up?

397
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,440
So everyday, our Inquisition Entertainment

398
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:42,560
dried up one by one to the size of the

399
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,840
clothes that went ashore when they were under arrest.

400
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,640
Min Nv,

401
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,100
thank you in advance for the families

402
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

403
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm afraid that you will be scared.

404
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Please don't be afraid.

405
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Don't worry.

406
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,100
I will deal with her after you leave.

407
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
As for the others,

408
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I will punish whoever you want.

409
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
Mother, let's go.

410
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Let's go.

411
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Thank you, Your Highness.

412
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Please continue to take care of her.

413
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
Don't laugh.

414
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
They might see us.

415
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
I know I was wrong.

416
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
She's so cute.

417
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
Madam, the city is ready.

418
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
Mamu,

419
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
this is for the treatment of the body.

420
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Remember to let me take it on the way.

421
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
And a few prescriptions to cure the body.

422
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Just follow my instructions and take it.

423
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
Thank you for your care.

424
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
Only then can my wife let go of her worries

425
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
and lead her to a safe and sound life.

426
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,100
I thank you on behalf of my wife.

427
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
You are still very weak.

428
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
You shouldn't do this.

429
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
Let's go.

430
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Let's go.

431
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Today is the last day.

432
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
You won't leave.

433
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,100
You are forcing me to go to Qi to talk to him.

434
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
I won't do as he wishes.

435
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Madam is so cruel.

436
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Even if she hates our daughter,

437
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
she is her blood.

438
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
She doesn't even ask.

439
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
That's better.

440
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
From now on,

441
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,100
my daughter has nothing to do with this place.

442
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
You are so generous.

443
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Everything will be fine.

444
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,100
It will be hard to see you again.

445
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
You are so talented.

446
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
You deserve the best man in the world.

447
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,100
I hope you can have a good marriage and a happy marriage.

448
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Thank you.

449
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,100
I hope all women in the world can treat themselves as treasures.

450
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
You don't have to force men to love you.

451
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,100
You are right.

452
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
I think so too.

453
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,100
I feel ashamed to see you being so generous.

454
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Parents should not only give their children blood.

455
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,100
They should also be responsible for their children.

456
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,100
If you are strict with Qin,

457
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Qin will be very cruel to Qin Chen.

458
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,100
The three Qin families will not be able to live here.

459
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
If I were Cai He,

460
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,100
I would kill Qin, Liu Chun and Ji Tong.

461
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I won't involve so many people.

462
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
If I were him,

463
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,100
I would do my best to find evidence of their crimes.

464
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,100
I will use their power to make them pay for their crimes.

465
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,100
I will be the most powerful woman in the world.

466
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,100
You are so cruel.

467
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Okay, let's not talk about this.

468
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
I miss you so much.

469
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,100
Why don't you move to our house?

470
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Your aunt will be sorry for what happened.

471
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,100
I am alone in the third room.

472
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
If I go to the marquis's house,

473
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
I will be a burden to my husband.

474
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
Don't worry.

475
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
After this matter is over,

476
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,100
I will visit the Princess.

477
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Come earlier.

478
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Although you don't care,

479
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,100
my family misses you more than my grandmother.

480
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Master,

481
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
the shopkeeper is very stubborn.

482
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
He won't accept it even if he uses a lot of means.

483
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,100
Right, they seem to have a close relationship with the capital.

484
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,100
It's a pity that the hands were destroyed when they were captured.

485
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,100
The backers should be good.

486
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Let's set up the account first.

487
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,100
You want to set the tiger back to the mountain and catch a big fish?

488
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
You are smart.

489
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Yan Chi.

490
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Yan Chi.

491
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Let's calm down.

492
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,100
If your father didn't tell me about the assassination,

493
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,100
how long are you going to keep it from me?

494
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,100
Father and I have long been in the eyes of others.

495
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Why bother to involve your father?

496
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
Besides, this matter is not yet clear.

497
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Father is fine.

498
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Don't make a big deal of it.

499
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Nonsense!

500
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Father killed the enemy in the battlefield.

501
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,100
It's not your turn to protect me.

502
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Yes.

503
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
You are always a lawyer.

504
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
You have a life-long relationship with father.

505
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Of course you don't care about those trifles.

506
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,100
But, can you bear to put my grandmother in the fire?

507
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,100
I think you have guessed it.

508
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,100
The main cause of the assassination of my father and my son

509
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
is the imperial city.

510
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,100
I came back to the capital to settle this matter.

511
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,100
If I need help, I will ask for help from my uncle.

512
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,100
But, please tell father about it.

513
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Then I will tell father about it.

514
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
I will tell father about it.

515
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,100
Father, I will ask father to help me.

516
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Father, I will ask father to help me.

517
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Let him take the victory and bring chaos to the king.

518
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
It's almost the end of the year.

519
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
When are you going back to the capital?

520
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
I will do what Qingyuan Pawn Shop said.

521
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,100
After all, the emperor is going to investigate the situation in the state of Gezhou.

522
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
I have to do it.

523
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
I really don't understand.

524
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,100
You are a military officer.

525
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,100
It's not easy to enter the city.

526
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,100
Why do you have to intervene in the king's case?

527
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,100
The king died in an unclear manner.

528
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
I can't just stand by and watch.

529
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,100
I know you and the king are like brothers.

530
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,100
But the king's case involves the harem.

531
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
No one in the court speaks for him.

532
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,100
You are the crown prince of the king.

533
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,100
Do you know that if you are not careful,

534
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
you will be caught in the fire?

535
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,100
Uncle, do you know that a few months ago,

536
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,100
I sneaked into the capital to investigate the case of the king.

537
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,100
I was far away from my father, who was in Shuoxi,

538
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,100
when I was going around the capital.

539
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,100
Your father never told me about this.

540
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,100
Father still doesn't know about this.

541
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
But the two countries are thousands of miles apart.

542
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,100
How can they set up such a killing?

543
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,100
They killed my father and son at the same time.

544
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,100
I'm not afraid of the military's heart.

545
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,100
You suspect that the King's case

546
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,100
is related to the assassination of your father and son?

547
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
It's hard to say.

548
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,100
But among those who are in the military,

549
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,100
those who know that I'm close to the King

550
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
are more than a few.

551
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
But the King has decided to commit suicide for his crime.

552
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Even a high-ranking official like Shen Yi

553
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,100
has fallen into a full-fledged war.

554
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
You are in the capital to defend the prison.

555
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,100
What can you do if you are in the Ministry of Justice?

556
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
There is a saying in the military law,

557
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,100
that one who knows the enemy better than the enemy knows the enemy better.

558
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Now I have a strong foot.

559
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
I'm sure of it.

560
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
My lady.

561
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,100
The medicine for the Crown Prince is running out.

562
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,100
We are moving to the mansion where the Third Madam is staying.

563
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,100
You can buy some more on the way.

564
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,100
The Crown Prince is not a good student.

565
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,100
It's not a good idea to give him less medicine.

566
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,100
My lady, you are saving too much money.

567
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,100
It's a matter of life and death.

568
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,100
Money can be earned again, but not in vain.

569
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
What medicine do you need?

570
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Why is the Crown Prince walking without a voice?

571
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,100
I heard from the dentist that you two haven't left yet.

572
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,100
I want to see the Ninth Madam alone.

573
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Your Highness, you came for Wanxing and Yingqi?

574
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
Yingqi is a secret guard of the Ge Clan.

575
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,100
She is good at investigating and protecting people.

576
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
I'm worried that someone in Qin's mansion is not good for you.

577
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,100
I brought her in not to spy on you.

578
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,100
Your Highness, you don't have to explain.

579
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,100
Your Highness, Yingqi is with me.

580
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,100
But she just followed my orders and left.

581
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,100
It's clear that Your Highness ordered her to take me as her master.

582
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,100
I believe in your protection.

583
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
You are very smart.

584
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,100
I have a question for you.

585
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
Just say it.

586
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,100
Do you know why the whole court was betrayed

587
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,100
by the Prince of Jin?

588
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,100
Why are you talking about Lord Shen?

589
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,100
Do you know why the Prince of Jin was punished?

590
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
I have been living in the valley for a long time.

591
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,100
I know nothing about the capital.

592
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,100
The Prince of Jin is the eldest son of His Majesty.

593
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
He is pure and pure.

594
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Although his mother is not high-ranking, he is very fond of His Majesty.

595
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,100
It is said that on the feast,

596
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,100
the Prince of Jin broke into the harem

597
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,100
and killed his beloved Concubine Jin.

598
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
The palace is heavily guarded.

599
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,100
How can he break in and do such a bad thing?

600
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
That's why Shen Yi and Shen Siqing

601
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
insisted that the Prince of Jin was innocent.

602
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,100
They betrayed the court and killed the whole family.

603
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Then the Prince of Jin committed suicide in the prison.

604
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Could it be that Father knew that the Prince of Jin was not kind enough

605
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,100
and sent me to escape alone?

606
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,100
Lord Shen is a righteous and strict official.

607
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,100
He wouldn't have been innocent and helped the Prince of Jin.

608
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
I know that the Prince of Jin is a very strict person.

609
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,100
He is a man of the outside world and the inside.

610
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,100
He would never do anything that would force him to do something.

611
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,100
He would never commit suicide.

612
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Why did you tell me about this secret?

613
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,100
I treated the Prince of Jin as my brother.

614
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,100
I respected Lord Shen as my senior.

615
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
After you enter the capital,

616
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,100
please help me to help the Prince of Jin

617
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,100
to investigate the case and prove the truth.

618
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,100
Your Highness, I would like to ask you to prove it.

619
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
I am a righteous and strict official.

620
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,100
I shouldn't have been killed because of the injustice.

621
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,100
But you should know the danger in it.

622
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,100
We are of the same mind.

623
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Even if it is difficult to escape,

624
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,100
I will do my best to help you.

625
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,100
I will do my best to help you.

626
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,100
Even if it is difficult to escape,

627
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
there is no fear.

628
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Okay, I promise you.

629
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Master, did the Ninth Madam agree?

630
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,100
Of course she agreed.

631
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,100
After Ying Qi leaves, you will be in charge of the business.

632
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Okay.

633
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Who will be with you during the day?

634
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
You.

635
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
No, Master.

636
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,100
You will be tired of your subordinates.

637
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100
Don't worry, Madam.

638
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,100
The medicine in our store is top quality.

639
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Who is it?

640
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,100
It's okay.

641
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Why are you not sleeping at night?

642
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
I am doing bad things?

643
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,100
If someone else is doing bad things,

644
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
I will be so disappointed.

645
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,100
Sir, please help me to open the prescription.

646
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,100
Where is the guest's house?

647
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
I will send it to you.

648
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,100
No need. Let him go.

649
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,100
I...

650
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Yes.

651
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Doctor, please save my child!

652
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Please save my child!

653
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
Doctor! Doctor!

654
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Don't hold him like that. Put him down!

655
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
Doctor, please save my child!

656
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
If you hold him like that, he will die! Put him down!

657
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Believe me, I am a doctor.

658
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Go get some bulls.

659
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
Do you have bulls here?

660
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Whose family has bulls?

661
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
Go get some bulls!

662
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,100
I have to find some bulls. Wait for me!

663
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
Doctor!

664
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Please save my child!

665
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
This is a doctor.

666
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
It's too late to sleep.

667
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
Doctor!

668
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
There is still some heat in his chest.

669
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
There is a spring stool and pillow and quilt.

670
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Go get some more!

671
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
Fuling, go get some stools and cotton cloth.

672
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Okay.

673
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Miss, is my child still alive?

674
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
He died. He should be alive.

675
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Thank you, Miss!

676
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Thank you, Miss!

677
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
It's okay.

678
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
Doctor, put the stools in the door.

679
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
Okay.

680
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
The stool is here.

681
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
The stool you want.

682
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,100
Put the stool here.

683
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,100
Put the child on the pillow.

684
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Put the belly here.

685
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
Bai Feng, change the stool like me.

686
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Okay.

687
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
Look at this.

688
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
I don't know what's going on.

689
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
How can there be no bulls?

690
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,100
It's burnt!

691
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,100
Look!

692
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,100
It's really good!

693
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,100
It's really good!

694
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
This is really good!

695
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
I didn't get any medical treatment.

696
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Thank you!

697
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Doctor, go get some medicine for the child.

698
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
Okay.

699
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,100
Everyone, leave!

700
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
You're amazing!

701
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Amazing!

702
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,100
You are...

703
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Junior?

704
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Senior?

705
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Junior?

706
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
It's really you!

707
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Who...

708
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Who is that?

709
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
Him!

710
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
He's my wife's senior.

711
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,100
He's from the Medicine Valley. He doesn't go out much.

712
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
He only knows how to treat and save people.

713
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
He talks a lot. Your Highness, don't mind him.

714
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
Don't mind him.

715
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Senior?

716
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
Okay, go.

717
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
What are you doing?

718
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
Don't move.

719
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Senior?

720
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Senior is so nice.

721
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Give you two hours.

722
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Find out where he comes from.

723
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Yes.

724
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
Thank god you're wearing a lot of clothes.

725
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
I didn't recognize you.

726
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
I was too slow.

727
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
Or I would have been in trouble.

728
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
So, I'll have to call you

729
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
Qin Wan.

730
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
For safety reasons,

731
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
you should call me Junior.

732
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
This is about my life.

733
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
Please keep it a secret.

734
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
You haven't been out for a long time.

735
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
I didn't know you had so many problems.

736
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
You should go back to the Demon Valley.

737
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,100
You have your seniors.

738
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Why do you have to be a coroner?

739
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
With your son, you can be a great doctor.

740
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
For me,

741
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
I can treat and save people.

742
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
I can't avoid a trial

743
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
with one hand being injured, one being dead.

744
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
I can't beat you.

745
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,100
I'm not as good as you.

746
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
You don't have to regret.

747
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
You are

748
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
the ninth sister's senior?

749
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
I'm Sun Mu Qing.

750
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
You are?

751
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,100
I'm Prince Rui's son, Yan Chi.

752
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,100
You asked my junior to be a coroner.

753
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
I'm sorry.

754
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
Junior.

755
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,100
Junior.

756
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
I think this person

757
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,100
is very good at martial arts.

758
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
He has a good sense of style.

759
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,100
Maybe he can help me.

760
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
You are right.

761
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
By the way, Junior.

762
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
I heard there is a very good doctor in Jingzhou.

763
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,100
Do you know him?

764
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
It seems that

765
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
you don't know that the ninth sister

766
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,100
is the legendary doctor.

767
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,100
I'm leaving.

768
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Where are you going?

769
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,100
I'm going to travel abroad.

770
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
I don't have a famous doctor.

771
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
What?

772
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,100
I've seen your method of healing.

773
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,100
Not bad. You've improved.

774
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,100
I'm not ashamed of my name.

775
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,100
When we meet again,

776
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
we will be in a better state.

777
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,100
By the way,

778
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,100
you must wear more women's clothes.

779
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
You look very good.

780
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,100
I'm leaving.

781
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,100
I've never seen you so happy.

782
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
My senior is very kind.

783
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
He talks to me.

784
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,100
He is very generous.

785
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
If he is not polite, please don't mind.

786
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Generous?

787
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,100
So you like that kind of feeling.

788
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Of course I like it.

789
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,100
Then why don't you keep him?

790
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
I thought you weren't that kind of person.

791
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,100
Why should I keep him?

792
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,100
I'm not talking about that kind of feeling.

793
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,100
When I was studying at the Medicine Valley,

794
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
my senior never

795
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
looked down on me because I was a woman.

796
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
He didn't look down on me because I was talented.

797
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
I'm too upright and too fake.

798
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
Why do you think...

799
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,100
Men and women don't have a relationship?

800
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
I was too narrow-minded.

801
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
I hope you can forgive me.

802
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,100
You came to apologize to me?

803
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,100
I'm sincerely sorry.

804
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Then why are you laughing?

805
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,100
I heard you said

806
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
that you are very kind.

807
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
I'm so envious of you

808
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,100
for having such a friend

809
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,100
who is honest and not afraid of any punishment.

810
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
The more upright you are,

811
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
the more difficult it is to have such a friend.

812
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,100
I hope one day,

813
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
you can be so relaxed

814
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,100
in front of me.

815
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Then please

816
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
don't get in my carriage again.

817
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,100
It depends on my mood.

818
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,100
Your Highness.

819
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,100
We have already prepared everything.

820
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,100
Okay.

821
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Stop the carriage!

822
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,100
What's wrong?

823
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
The people from Zhongyong House in the capital are here.

824
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Second Young Master, this...

825
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,100
You'd better not show yourself.

826
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,100
You too.

827
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Go!

828
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Come, this way.

829
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Be careful.

830
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,100
Yes.

831
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Third Young Master, I never thought

832
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
that I could see you.

833
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Thanks to you,

834
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,100
I miss my mother.

835
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,100
Now I have a way to live.

836
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100
We have come this far.

837
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Your sister's marriage

838
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
can only be done by her uncle.

839
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
Don't worry, Madam.

840
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,100
I will take care of my sisters.

841
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100
Okay.

842
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
You mean

843
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
Shuang'er can go to the capital too?

844
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,100
Yes.

845
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,100
Greetings, Third Aunt

846
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,100
and two sisters.

847
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,100
This is Sister Jiu, right?

848
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,100
After a long separation,

849
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,100
Sister Jiu has become a big girl.

850
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,100
What are you waiting for?

851
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,100
Come and see me.

852
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,100
Greetings, Third Brother.

853
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,100
This time,

854
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,100
we are in a hurry.

855
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,100
This jade plate is very good.

856
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,100
When we come back to the capital,

857
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,100
I will make up for your loss.

858
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
Capital?

859
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Yes.

860
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,100
I came here this time

861
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,100
to take my sisters back to the capital.

862
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,100
I will take care of them.

863
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
I will take care of them.

864
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,100
I will take care of them.

865
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,100
I will take care of them.

866
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,100
I will take care of them.

867
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,100
I will take care of them.

868
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,100
I will take care of them.

869
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,100
I will take care of them.

870
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,100
I will take care of them.

871
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,100
I will take care of them.

872
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,100
I will take care of them.

873
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,100
I will take care of them.

874
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,100
I will take care of them.

875
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,100
I will take care of them.

876
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,100
I am in love

877
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,100
I am in love

878
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
I am in love

879
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,100
I am in love

880
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,100
I am in love

881
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,100
I am in love

882
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,100
I am in love

883
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,100
I am in love

884
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,100
I am in love

885
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,100
I am in love

886
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,100
I am in love

887
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
I am in love

888
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,100
I am in love

889
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,100
I am in love

890
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,100
The starlight

891
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,100
is being repainted by the moonlight

892
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,100
The stars will shine

893
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,100
beyond the sky

894
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,100
Like dust

895
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,100
but it is the color of the stars

896
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,100
Like dust

897
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,100
but it is the color of the stars

898
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
Like dust

899
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
but it is the color of the stars

900
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,100
Like dust

901
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,100
but it is the color of the stars

902
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,100
Like dust

903
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,100
but it is the color of the stars

904
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
Like dust
