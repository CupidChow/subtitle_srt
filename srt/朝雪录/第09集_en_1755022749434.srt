[Episode 9]

3
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,430
The coroner has confirmed that Ms. Yang
had given birth before,

4
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,630
but Madam Qin has never mentioned this.

5
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,250
Do you know anything about this,
Third Madam?

6
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,800
Your Highness,

7
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,370
I know nothing of this.

8
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,520
When Concubine Yang entered the household,

9
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,600
she was already over twenty years old.

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,310
But my husband favored her greatly

11
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,640
and gave her separate quarters to live in.

12
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,880
Although I am the principal wife,

13
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,030
I never even received her tea offering.

14
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,960
I only heard that...

15
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,030
she was exceedingly beautiful.

16
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,509
As for anything else,

17
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,960
I know nothing.

18
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,830
In that case,

19
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,020
we'll have to ask Master Qin An
to come in person.

20
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,990
Your Highness, please allow me to report.

21
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,870
My father

22
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,050
is gravely ill

23
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,380
and has been unconscious for two days.

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,400
Since Master Qin An is so seriously ill,

25
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,900
I should pay him a visit in person.

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,490
Prefect Huo.

27
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,850
Do you still need to investigate the well

28
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,380
in the Purple Bamboo Grove?

29
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,730
If you've finished investigating
that well,

30
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,730
my grandma wishes to seal it
as soon as possible

31
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,060
to ease people's minds.

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,550
The search concluded last night.

33
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,680
Madam Qin may handle it as she sees fit.

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,690
Thank you, Prefect Huo.

35
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,450
Leave us.

36
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,250
Your Highness.

37
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,000
Has Master Qin An awakened?

38
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,020
Not yet.

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,850
What did the doctor say?

40
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,070
My father hasn't eaten or drunk anything
for the past two days

41
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,590
and hasn't even taken any medicine.

42
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,640
No doctor can do anything about it.

43
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,930
If that's the case,

44
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,670
why not try my method?

45
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,080
I think my treatment would be just right
for Master Qin An's condition.

46
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,650
This should work.

47
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,590
Will this work?

48
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,670
This is a secret method
from the Beiyi Tribe in Shuoxi,

49
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,399
used specifically
for sudden unconsciousness.

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,209
You just need to drive this iron nail

51
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,810
through the brow into the brain
for seven days,

52
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,170
and it must not be moved during that time.

53
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,170
After seven days,

54
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,430
once the blood clot in the skull
has been drained,

55
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,280
the patient will
naturally regain consciousness.

56
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,890
Can...

57
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,000
can he survive that?

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Whether he survives,

59
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,710
we'll know in seven days
after the nail is inserted.

60
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,350
He's awake, he's awake!

61
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,200
See?

62
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,450
I told you this treatment was just right
for him.

63
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,190
Master Qin An, now that you're awake,

64
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,940
you can answer our questions properly,
right?

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,860
Be careful.

66
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,530
Officer,

67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
may I ask where His Highness is now?

68
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,610
His Highness and the Prefect have returned
to the office.

69
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,280
This is bad.

70
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,490
Wanxing,

71
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,880
go to the prefect's office
and tell His Highness

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,030
to come to
the Purple Bamboo Grove immediately.

73
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,760
Yes, My Lady.

74
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,270
My Lady,

75
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,390
I was just coming to escort you home.

76
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,320
It's about to rain.

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,110
Where's Wanxing?

78
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,030
I'll explain later.

79
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,630
First, come with me
to the Purple Bamboo Grove.

80
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,690
If Qin An hadn't confessed it himself,

81
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,480
who could have imagined this?

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,940
Constable Qi, could you
have ever imagined this?

83
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,900
Or you, General Bai?

84
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,360
Concubine Yang was, in fact,
trafficked here!

85
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,140
The Marquis of Zhongyong's own brother

86
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,290
actually engaged in human trafficking!

87
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,200
It's simply beyond belief.

88
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,810
Prefect Huo.

89
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,560
Over the past decade or more
in the surrounding counties,

90
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,960
a lot of people have been abducted
and sold!

91
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,840
And how many

92
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,990
were taken during your term of office?

93
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,080
There are so many case files here.

94
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,610
How long will it take us
to go through them all?

95
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,560
Let's start with the nearest counties.

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,900
Ms. Yang was already an adult
when she was takenâ€”

97
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,110
not someone easily hidden.

98
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,220
The location of her abduction

99
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,610
must've been near Jingzhou.

Where are the officers?

106
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,830
Who removed them all?

107
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,140
My Lady, let's find shelter
from the rain first.

108
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,560
Or you might become ill.

109
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,730
Lady Wan!

110
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:40,880
In such heavy rain,

111
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,020
what brings you here?

112
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,270
Caihe,

113
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,200
why are you here?

114
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,960
You may all return now.
Thank you for your hard work.

115
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,940
Okay.

116
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,320
Madam Qin

117
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,610
has been fretting over that ominous well
for two days.

118
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,000
As soon as Prefect Huo said
the investigation was complete,

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,880
she had me find men

120
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,960
to seal it up immediately.

121
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,520
The well's been sealed?

122
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,909
Yes, just finished.

123
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,960
And while we were at it, I also

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,080
had the men repair the well
by the flower shed,

125
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,010
so Madam Qin wouldn't have to worry about
anyone else falling in again.

126
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,200
Madam Qin can now rest easy.

127
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,470
Such a beautiful umbrella.

128
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,760
It's such a shame it's broken.

129
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,150
I remember that in our storeroom,

130
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,120
there's one with the same base color
as yours

131
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,410
but with different patterns.

132
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,610
I'll have it sent to you later, Lady Wan.

133
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,830
Thank you, Caihe.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,590
No need to be so polite with me.

135
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,850
Please hurry back now.

136
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,560
What's wrong?

137
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,240
Madam Qin had someone seal the well again.

138
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,000
So quickly?

139
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,200
Qin An has just confessed

140
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,010
that Ms. Yang was abducted
and sold to him.

141
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,070
She had indeed been married
and had children before.

142
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,560
Qin An coveted her beauty

143
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,450
and, after buying her, kept her confined
in the back quarters.

144
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,070
Until the day she threw herself into
the well,

145
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,040
she had never once left the mansion.

146
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,240
But Madam Qin,

147
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,240
knowing full well
that I'd questioned Qin An,

148
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,920
still rushed to seal the well.

149
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,600
Clearly,

150
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,340
what she's trying to cover up

151
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,860
is not Ms. Yang's death,

152
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,090
but this well itself.

153
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,409
This is a piece of palm bone discovered
during the examination.

154
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,840
Judging by the skeletal features,

155
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,179
this should be from a girl
who hadn't yet reached maturity.

156
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,470
You mean

157
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,070
there are more remains in this well?

158
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,430
But that day,

159
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,170
Bai Feng went down the well himself.

160
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,960
If there had been more remains,

161
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,160
he couldn't possibly have missed them.

162
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,960
Qin Li told me then

163
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,760
that the well in the Purple Bamboo Grove

164
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,400
was originally a water well,

165
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,900
but later somehow it dried up.

166
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Could it be

167
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,720
that someone, before Ms. Yang's suicide,

168
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,750
filled in the well

169
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,050
to cover up their evil deeds,

170
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,910
so no one would uncover the truth?

171
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,570
Outrageous.

172
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,280
I'll have the well reopened immediately

173
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,740
to re-examine its bottom.

174
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,430
Mother!

175
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,990
Something terrible has happened!

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,210
Yan Chi

177
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,860
has had that well dug open again.

178
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,650
And he's also ordered

179
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,920
our entire mansion surroundedâ€”

180
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,300
people can enter,
but no one is allowed to leave.

181
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,680
Didn't Prefect Huo say

182
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,230
the investigation
had already been completed?

183
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,720
Why...

184
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,750
Prefect Huo said

185
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,420
the coroner discovered a young girl's bone

186
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,110
during the examination.

187
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,350
Grandma!

188
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,850
This is

189
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,890
the old residence
of the Marquis of Zhongyong.

190
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,710
That Yan Chi, how dare he?

191
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,080
How dare he?

192
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
-Grandma.
-Mother,

193
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
please think of something quickly.

194
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,200
Caihe,

195
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,720
hurry and fetch my large cloak.

196
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,000
Chen,

197
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,370
tell them

198
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,990
that I've suddenly fallen seriously ill

199
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,750
and need to leave for treatment.

200
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,230
Hurry and send your father
out of the mansion.

201
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,350
Hurry!

202
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,710
Yes.

203
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,320
Yes.

204
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,230
Go quickly!

205
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,440
Mother,

206
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,610
didn't you say

207
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,320
that the Crown Prince
and the Marquis of Zhongyong

208
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,870
would protect us?

209
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,070
It's too late.

210
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,510
Too late!

211
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,400
My child,

212
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,200
if we had known this day would come,

213
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,600
we wouldn't have done it
in the first place.

214
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,420
Your Highness,

215
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,020
should we send a batch of the remains
to the morgue first?

216
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,580
Wherever the Qin family
hosts their guests,

217
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,830
that's where we'll send them.

218
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,950
Yes, Your Highness.

219
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,480
Follow me.

220
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,020
Yes, my lord.

221
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,680
-Yes.
-Yes.

222
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,540
Go rest for a while.

223
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,490
No,

224
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
I need to clean

225
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,840
all of them thoroughly.

226
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,040
[Government Office]

227
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,920
Go take a break.

228
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,560
I'm not tired.

229
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,410
Leave the rest to me.

230
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,350
They've suffered too much already.

231
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,390
I can't let anyone hurt them againâ€”

232
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,310
no one.

233
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,740
But you can't keep torturing yourself
like this.

234
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,060
If you collapse,

235
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,920
who will help rebuild their bodies?

236
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,490
â™ª If I fall like dust into the gloom â™ª

237
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,740
Who will help them find justice?

238
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,110
They need you.

239
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,210
They shouldn't have needed me.

240
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,750
They should have been alive.

241
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:38,160
â™ª The snow will cloak me
in the purest white â™ª

242
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,510
They could have been living

243
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,870
the lives they dreamed of!

244
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,350
But why?

245
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,110
â™ª If I engrave my love upon my heart â™ª

246
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,210
Why were they

247
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,750
buried at the bottom of this dark well,

248
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,450
reduced to nothing but bones?

249
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,200
How can there be

250
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,060
â™ª Even pain will feel like joy â™ª

251
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,110
such cruel people in this world,

252
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,830
such vile deeds?

253
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,320
Why?

254
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,700
â™ª I lay my heart bare â™ª

255
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,960
â™ª Love is laced with pain â™ª

256
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,450
â™ª Please give me strength again â™ª

257
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,990
â™ª Let my fate surge like a wave,
unchained â™ª

258
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,540
â™ª Don't be afraid â™ª

259
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,290
â™ª When starlight fades â™ª

260
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,410
I assure you,

261
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,500
â™ª The stars will still be shining bright â™ª

262
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,240
no matter who the culprit is

263
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
or where he is,

264
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:26,140
â™ª Beyond the reach of darkest night â™ª

265
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,870
I, Yan Chi,

266
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,140
will never let him get away
in this lifetime.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,770
â™ª I'm but a speck the stars may hide â™ª

268
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,310
â™ª Yet in their glow, I still reside â™ª

269
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,770
Alright, alright.

270
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,260
Let's go, hurry.

271
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,860
Don't let them see my face.

272
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,480
Put it on me, put it on me.

273
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,350
Cover me properly.

274
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,210
Let's go quickly.

275
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,070
Lift the sedan.

276
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,860
You don't need to follow us.

277
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,060
Go attend to Grandma.

278
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,150
[Frontal Bone; Zygomatic Bone]

279
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,520
The sludge at the bottom of the well
has been cleaned out.

280
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,380
Only some bone fragments remain.

281
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,930
Is there anything unusual

282
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,620
about the remains?

283
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,350
Girls.

284
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,750
All of them...

285
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,680
were girls.

286
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,110
Once I catch that monster,

287
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,570
I'll make him suffer a fate
worse than death.

288
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,370
That would only bring

289
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,110
momentary satisfaction.

290
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,680
What we want

291
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,180
is to seek justice for these girls
through the law.

292
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,069
Justice?

293
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,510
What is justice?

294
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,240
Even if you bring the criminal to justice,

295
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,900
they cannot come back to life.

296
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,119
What good is this so-called justice
to them now?

297
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,160
Clearing injustice and restoring names

298
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,849
serves the same noble purpose
as bringing them back to life.

299
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,250
Has Your Highness forgotten this already?

300
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,060
Prefect Huo!

301
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,400
Let Madam Qin through.

302
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,990
Prefect Huo.

303
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,270
Our Qin family
has always treated you well.

304
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,760
Why do you bring unidentified remains

305
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,880
and display them in our main hall?

306
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,630
This is deliberately

307
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,500
ruining our family's fortune.

308
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,550
How can we face others after this?

309
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,080
Prefect Huo, if you can't stand up
for our family,

310
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,110
I...

311
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,160
I'll go to the capital

312
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,160
and petition the Emperor directly!

313
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
Madam Qin,

314
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,860
this was ordered directly by His Highness.

315
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,920
I am in no position to object.

316
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,600
Besides, even if you want to petition,

317
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,680
you'll need to wait until the case
is closed to have grounds.

318
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,470
The innocent need not fear scrutiny.

319
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,050
Why make things difficult for me?

320
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,710
Who's really making things difficult
for whom?

321
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,030
You ignore the real murderer

322
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,880
of Concubine Liu and Steward Liu

323
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,680
and instead throw mud on our family name!

324
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,880
What are your true intentions?

325
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,840
Prefect Huo,

326
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,640
if you won't give our family a way out...

327
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,170
what's the point

328
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,970
of me living anymore?

329
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,500
I might as well die and be done with it!

330
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,970
Madam Qin!

331
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,180
Mother!

332
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,790
Your Highness,

333
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,920
Madam Qin and Prefect Huo are

334
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,750
arguing at the courtyard entrance.

335
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,950
Saved me the trouble.

336
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,920
Attempting to assault a court official
in full view of the publicâ€”

337
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,710
arrest her now!

338
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,790
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

339
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,070
D-Don't...

340
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,220
Your Highness, please calm down.

341
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,920
My mother was only overcome with despair.

342
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,560
She never meant to harm anyone.

343
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,890
The case remains unsolved,

344
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,150
yet Madam Qin rushes to take her own life.

345
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,550
I wonder if she's committing suicide
out of guilt

346
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,090
or just making a scene to interfere
with our investigation?

347
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,120
No, no, no.

348
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,830
Your Highness,

349
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,680
my mother was just momentarily distraught,

350
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,290
which is why she acted inappropriately.

351
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,290
I beg Your Highness's forgiveness.

352
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,350
Four murders have occurred in succession
within your family,

353
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,010
and the case of the girls in the well
is even more appalling.

354
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,290
Prefect Huo!

355
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,630
From now on,

356
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,970
without my token,

357
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,300
no one from the Qin family,
regardless of their status,

358
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,070
may leave the premises
before being questioned.

359
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,710
Violators

360
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,710
will receive 100 strokes of the cane.

361
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,740
If anyone

362
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,090
dares to obstruct official business,

363
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,750
they will be charged as an accomplice.

364
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,350
Understood, Your Highness.

365
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,660
F-Follow me.

366
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,230
Mother.

367
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,310
Madam Qin, are you hurt?

368
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,880
I'm fine.

369
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,200
Come on.

370
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,620
Mother.

371
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,990
Mother.

372
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,450
If Yan Chi

373
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,740
truly uncovers something,

374
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,210
what are we to do?

375
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,400
As long as An remains safe,

376
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,030
your third branch will be safe.

377
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,180
For Chen's sake,

378
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,560
we must protect him at all costs.

379
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,200
Officer,

380
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,020
there will be a generous reward
in the future.

381
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,270
Open the door.

382
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,780
-Constable Qi.
-Constable Qi.

383
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,590
Constable Qi.

384
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,140
Wasn't it Madam Qin who was supposed to
be seeking medical treatment outside?

385
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,670
How did it turn out to be
Master Qin An instead?

386
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,210
Put me down!

387
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,610
Chen!

388
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,650
Chen...

389
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,600
Save me, Chen...

390
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,140
Unfilial son!

391
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,810
You...

392
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,370
Prefect Huo.

393
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,070
According to the preliminary examination,

394
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,930
these girls...

395
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,450
these victims were likely

396
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,360
between the ages of 12 and 16.

397
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,830
Considering that the mud
at the bottom of the well

398
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,090
slowed down the decomposition process,

399
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,440
the time of death

400
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,150
was at least seven years ago.

401
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,430
The bone surfaces show
no fatal external injuries,

402
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,760
and the bone quality is healthy,

403
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,680
but the limbs, ribs, and finger bones

404
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,340
all show old fractures that have healed.

405
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,470
Were these girls

406
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,550
forced laborers when they were alive?

407
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,060
Why would they have so many old injuries?

408
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,460
Judging from the bone quality,

409
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,170
they were well-fed during their lifetime.

410
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,930
The injuries healed properly,

411
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,860
so definitely not from hard labor.

412
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,750
During warfare,

413
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,610
to extract intelligence from the enemy,

414
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,710
interrogators would

415
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,020
inevitably use certain methods
on prisoners.

416
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,350
But some interrogators

417
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,450
enjoy the torture itself.

418
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,710
They would,

419
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,260
after torturing, use the best medicine

420
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,990
to heal the prisoners' wounds,

421
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,500
just so the torture could begin anew.

422
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,640
Are you saying

423
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,800
they were subjected to long-term abuse

424
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,840
and, after recovering,

425
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,290
were beaten again until disabled?

426
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:33,960
I...

427
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,370
I've only seen similar cases before,

428
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,200
but their circumstances
might have been different.

429
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
You don't need to comfort me.

430
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,400
I thought

431
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,950
that, having handled countless cases,

432
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,510
I had already seen the full extent of
human wickedness.

433
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,710
But little did I know,

434
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,510
I was still so naive.

435
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,640
The evil in human hearts

436
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,030
has no limits.

437
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,700
But the human heart
holds more than evil...

438
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,940
there's also loyalty, goodness,

439
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,070
and righteousness.

440
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,860
Don't doubt yourself.

441
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,600
Didn't you abandon medicine
to become a coroner

442
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,880
precisely to use the law
as your instrument

443
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,680
to punish evil and promote good?

444
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,630
I promise you,

445
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,380
I will bring that criminal

446
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,640
to justice.

447
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,740
I will make it so

448
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,160
that these monsters

449
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,570
won't dare harm others so easily.

450
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,770
Your Highness, Miss Qin,

451
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,190
shall we continue?

452
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,810
Yes.

453
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,760
With such a heinous case
in the Qin family,

454
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,780
the Marquis of Zhongyong
will surely inquire into this.

455
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,400
Now that the case remains unclear,

456
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,840
M-Madam Qin is already being so difficult.

457
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,970
If we don't resolve this soon,

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,400
and Madam Qin...

459
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,890
falls ill from anger,

460
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,790
I fear...

461
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,240
Judging by how hard
she threw herself at you today,

462
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,330
Madam Qin

463
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,080
is probably sturdier than you.

464
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,810
Relax.

465
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,270
Her causing a scene today

466
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,510
was just a diversion

467
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,310
to help Qin An leave the mansion.

468
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,790
Could it be

469
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,960
that the person who committed
such beastly crimes

470
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,550
is Master Qin An?

471
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,050
We're only speculating.

472
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,690
We have no direct evidence.

473
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,270
But the concubines' quarters

474
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,640
are the furthest
from the Purple Bamboo Grove.

475
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,570
Eight years ago,

476
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,630
Concubine Yang chose to end her life
in the well at the Purple Bamboo Grove.

477
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,890
There must be a reason.

478
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,680
Bai Feng has gone to investigate
Concubine Yang's trafficking.

479
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,940
Let's talk about it when we have updates.

480
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,880
For now, you

481
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,100
need to rest.

482
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,610
I'll take care of everything here.

483
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,750
Miss Qin.

484
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,770
Please take a look at this small bone.

485
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,170
It doesn't match any

486
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,780
of the small bones

487
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,010
in the skeletal diagrams you've drawn.

488
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,790
It appears to be a phalanx.

489
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,390
Yes.

490
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,490
However,

491
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,960
I've compared it with
the hand and foot bones

492
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,750
of every skeleton,

493
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,550
but it doesn't match any of them.

494
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,090
Let's wait until we've excavated
all the bone fragments

495
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,360
before drawing further comparisons.

496
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,080
Okay.

497
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,610
Tomorrow, we still need to
analyze the bone coloration

498
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,030
to ascertain the cause of death.

499
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,680
Everyone, get some rest early tonight.

500
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,440
Thank you for your hard work, Miss Qin.

501
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,170
And you as well, Your Highness.

502
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:09,840
Let's go.

503
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,520
Go guard the entrance.

504
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,270
-Yes.
-Yes.

505
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,480
My Lady,

506
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,880
you must be freezing.

507
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,510
If you hadn't come out,

508
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,640
I would've rushed in to get you myself.

509
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,680
Don't just stand there.

510
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,960
Go make some ginger soup now.

511
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,640
Yes.

512
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
The autumn rain is chilly and damp.

513
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,660
Take this to stay warm.

514
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,260
I never use such things.

515
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,600
Just take it.

516
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,790
If you fall ill,

517
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,030
no one can

518
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,720
take your place.

519
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,570
Let's go, Fuling.

520
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,960
Had you not acted
with the reckless bravery of a fool,

521
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,470
dozens of valiant soldiers
from our Shuoxi Army

522
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,030
wouldn't have died in vain!

523
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,360
You're not worthy to lead
my Shuoxi soldiers.

524
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,200
[Yan Lin, Prince Rui]

525
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,020
You're not worthy to be my son!

526
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,750
Beat him!

527
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,590
Father...

528
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,600
I'm sorry.

529
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,400
I'm sorry.

530
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,160
Thank you.

531
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,240
[Grace and Purity]

532
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,650
My Lady.

533
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,030
The Second Young Master is here.

534
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,230
Please invite him in.

535
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,400
Second Young Master, please come in.

536
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,680
Wan.

537
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,270
Li,

538
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,550
this is your first time coming through
my front door by day.

539
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,670
Li, you're feeling much better now?

540
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,200
Wan, thanks to
your miraculous treatment...

541
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,640
I...

542
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,280
Fuling, you may leave us now.

543
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,200
Li, did you come to see me specifically

544
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,590
because you heard about the bodies
in the well?

545
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,620
Wan,

546
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,790
you're the most capable person
I've ever known.

547
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,640
I'll tell you everything I know.

548
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,770
I only ask that when His Highness
handles this case,

549
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,470
he might consider my contribution
in reporting it first

550
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,800
and show some leniency,

551
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,690
giving the third branch a way out.

552
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,500
But they've never treated you kindly.

553
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,960
Although Madam Qin and Third Madam
don't care about me,

554
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,280
the fact that I could grow up
without worries

555
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,810
already puts me ahead of
many other concubines' sons.

556
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,640
Besides,

557
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,640
Chen has always been good

558
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,310
to me, his disappointing younger brother.

559
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,790
Isn't Master Qin An close

560
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,160
to the Marquis of Zhongyong?

561
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,640
Why hasn't he stepped in to help?

562
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,980
It's all for show.

563
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,270
If they were truly close,

564
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,160
why would he send gifts every year
but never visit in person?

565
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,650
If the third branch truly falls,

566
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,440
the Marquis of Zhongyong won't help them.

567
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,160
Aren't you afraid they'll hold a grudge
against you?

568
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,250
They've never liked me anyway.

569
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,310
Li, you are kind at heart.

570
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,680
I'll persuade His Highness to punish
only the true culprit

571
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,140
and not implicate others.

572
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,330
Thank you, Wan.

573
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,020
No need to thank me, Li.

574
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,720
Just tell me everything you know.

575
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,780
Please have a seat.

576
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,530
Here.

577
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,120
Father...

578
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,020
no,

579
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,000
Master Qin An once had quarters

580
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,520
specifically for keeping girls
he'd purchased,

581
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,400
teaching them various talents and skills.

582
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,290
Then one day, Madam Qin suddenly

583
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,720
sealed off the quarters,

584
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,920
and those girls disappeared
without a trace.

585
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,830
You mean

586
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,640
those female corpses
at the bottom of the well

587
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,370
were...

588
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,760
I didn't know before either.

589
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,000
But one night,

590
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,200
I sneaked out to steal food.

591
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,240
When I passed through
the Purple Bamboo Grove...

592
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,310
I saw...

593
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,070
Liu Chun carrying a rolled-up straw mat.

594
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,320
The following day,

595
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,820
Madam Qin ordered

596
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,660
the quarters where the young girls
were kept to be sealed.

597
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,290
The well in the Purple Bamboo Grove

598
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,810
subsequently became dry.

599
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,280
When these things happened,

600
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,600
had Concubine Yang
already entered the household?

601
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,390
No.

602
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,440
After the quarters were sealed,

603
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,960
Master Qin An rarely came home.

604
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,380
Madam Qin had no choice

605
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,470
but to allow Concubine Yang
to enter the household.

606
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,130
Do you know why Concubine Yang
took her own life?

607
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,120
I suppose...

608
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,640
it had something to do with Concubine Liu.

609
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,140
Concubine Yang was exceedingly beautiful

610
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,460
and was once greatly favored
by Master Qin An.

611
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,390
He often painted portraits of her.

612
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,200
But she was always melancholy

613
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,060
and never tried to please him.

614
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,760
Master Qin An forbade her to leave
her quarters in a fit of anger.

615
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,750
Honey.

616
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,100
[Sunrise Grove]

617
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,690
After Concubine Liu came,

618
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,810
Concubine Yang fell further out of favor

619
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,810
but gained a certain degree of freedom.

620
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,800
After the quarters for the girls
were sealed,

621
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,550
only Liu Chun,
Master Qin An's trusted servant,

622
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,750
was allowed to enter.

623
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,030
Concubine Yang often stood outside
the quarters,

624
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,430
sometimes for half a day.

625
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,170
I used to sneak over to watch her
from afar.

626
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,960
[Sunrise Grove]

627
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,690
Did she know someone in the quarters?

628
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,630
I don't know.

629
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,219
I once secretly investigated the quarters

630
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,750
but found nothing unusual.

631
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,800
However, Concubine Yang

632
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,630
would go there every single day.

633
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,570
Concubine Liu was jealous of her beauty

634
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,179
and often made things difficult for her.

635
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,639
But she never fought back.

636
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,370
Until one day...

637
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,600
Please.

638
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,449
Please tell me.

639
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,870
Please tell me the truth.

640
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,690
I followed Concubine Yang all the way,

641
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,980
but I could only watch helplessly
as she walked into the Purple Bamboo Grove

642
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,380
and never came out again.

643
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,590
Her death caused a stir
throughout the entire household.

644
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,720
Only then did Madam Qin order

645
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,880
the dry well to be sealed
with a demon-suppressing stone.

646
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,380
Later, she even
had the quarters demolished.

647
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,690
Li, why didn't you stop Concubine Yang?

648
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,240
Because I was afraid.

649
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,110
Every time I thought of
that rolled-up straw mat,

650
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,710
my whole body would tremble.

651
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,920
I didn't even dare to go near
that bamboo grove.

652
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,250
It's not your fault, Li.

653
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,970
Wan.

654
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,640
Don't think I'm useless.

655
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,780
This is all I know.

656
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,070
Li.

657
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,430
Why were you
so concerned about Concubine Yang?

658
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,000
Because

659
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,020
she had a beautiful smile.

660
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,960
Back then, I often thought

661
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,360
that if my own mother were still alive,

662
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,070
perhaps

663
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,050
she would smile at me just as beautifully.

664
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,980
I understand.

665
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,380
Thank you for trusting me, Li.

666
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,430
Get a doctor! Get a doctor!

667
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,960
-Get a doctor for me!
-Master!

668
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,530
We can't get out!

669
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,210
Get a doctor!

670
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,680
Get me a doctor!

671
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,440
Chen!

672
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,170
Chen!

673
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,890
Help Father get an imperial physician.

674
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:31,670
Master Qin An.

675
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,960
Get an imperial physician for me!

676
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,700
Father, you're delirious from illness.

677
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,320
Where would there be an imperial physician
in Jingzhou Prefecture?

678
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,440
Besides, our mansion's gates are sealed,

679
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,770
and no one gets in or out.

680
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,050
You'll just have to endure it, Father.

681
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,410
Get back here!

682
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,250
You ungrateful child!

683
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,030
You...

684
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,690
Master Qin An!

685
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,970
Master Qin An!

686
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,480
Master Qin An. Master Qin An.

687
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
Master Qin An!

688
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,880
Master Qin An, wake up!

689
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,320
I know you love your son,

690
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,210
but I love mine too.

691
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,150
An is already in this state.

692
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,870
If he's also found guilty,

693
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,050
then our Xiang and Chen

694
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,080
will be completely ruined.

695
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,910
Things have already come to this point.

696
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,910
I am the true sinner of the Qin family!

697
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,790
Qin An's death is no great loss.

698
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,590
He's already so ill.

699
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,850
He may not have many days left.

700
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,120
For the sins my son has committed,

701
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,890
I, as his mother,
will bear the consequences.

702
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,760
Chen, remember this:

703
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,410
don't follow your father's  example.

704
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,320
I understand, Grandma.

705
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,320
[Grace and Purity]

706
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,730
Master, a message from the Eagle Squad:

707
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,130
on the night Shen Yi
and his wife were killed,

708
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,040
there was a shipwreck
downstream on the canal.

709
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,870
The following day, two young women

710
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,790
claimed their father had drowned

711
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,990
and asked nearby households
to help with funeral arrangements.

712
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,300
Afterward, they claimed
to be escorting the coffin home

713
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,160
and disappeared without a trace.

714
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,940
Just as I suspected.

715
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,550
If Medicine King Valley
had river transport,

716
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,580
I would suspect that those two young women

717
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,310
were Miss Qin and Fuling.

718
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,630
Master,

719
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,110
shall we continue our search
for Miss Shen's whereabouts?

720
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,080
No need.

721
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,000
Pull all the men off
the Shen family leads.

722
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,020
Keep a close watch on the Ministry of War

723
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,910
and catch the traitor who leaked Father's

724
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,350
border patrol route.

725
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,590
Everything else can wait
until I return to the capital.

726
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,320
Yes, Master.

727
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,600
Your Highness, why are you here?

728
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,520
We've discovered Ms. Yang's background.

729
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,870
According to records from Yang County

730
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,690
and testimonies
from the Yang family's neighbors,

731
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,520
the Yang family matriarch who went missing
10 years ago

732
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,650
matches Concubine Yang in every aspect.

733
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,880
The Yang family matriarch
was born beautiful

734
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,450
and disappeared with her daughter.

735
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,620
There were rumors at the time

736
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,840
that she had eloped with someone,
taking her daughter along.

737
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,980
If Concubine Yang was indeed
the missing Yang family matriarch,

738
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,210
then the mysterious quarters
my second brother mentioned

739
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,420
might be where her daughter
was being held captive.

740
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,880
The mysterious quarters?

741
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,860
The quarters were already torn down.

742
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,010
Also,

743
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,690
the neighbors said

744
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,370
Ms. Yang deeply loved her daughter.

745
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,400
If Qin An had used her daughter

746
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,660
to coerce her into becoming his concubine,

747
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,550
she would have had no choice
but to comply.

748
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,890
But Concubine Yang was already
in her twenties when she went out,

749
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,280
and she had her daughter with her.

750
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,690
How could she suddenly disappear

751
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,490
and then end up in Qin An's hands?

752
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,090
I'll know the answers to these questions

753
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,610
once I interrogate Qin An.

754
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,410
According to the records from Yang County,

755
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,810
the missing Yang daughter
was about 11 or 12

756
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,510
and was born with six fingers.

757
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Folk legend holds

758
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,860
that people born with six fingers

759
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,120
are blessed by heaven,

760
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,110
so many people in Yang County knew

761
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,320
about the Yang daughter's six fingers.

762
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,600
Six fingers...

763
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:34,880
I know.

764
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,880
That's a supernumerary digit
formed during pregnancy,

765
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,990
extremely rare,
less than one in a thousand.

766
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,470
Then this confirms

767
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,190
that the missing Yang family matriarch

768
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,650
is indeed Concubine Yang.

769
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,760
But among the hand bones we've found,

770
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,420
none shows any trace of
a supernumerary finger.

771
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,560
I personally supervised
the final verification of all bones,

772
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,010
so I can guarantee
that nothing was overlooked.

773
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,860
Unless

774
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,320
there's another place
where bones are hidden.

775
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,240
A dead body!

776
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,260
A dead body grabbed me!

777
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,150
-Quickly pull me up!
-A dead body?

778
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,760
There's no dead body!

779
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,510
How could there be a corpse in the well?

780
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,110
Pull her up now!

781
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,700
Hurry up.

782
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,190
Shuang wasn't mistaken.

783
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,360
The well by the flower shed is closest to
the Purple Bamboo Grove,

784
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,360
and the two wells might be connected
by an underground waterway.

785
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,960
The Purple Bamboo Grove
is on higher ground,

786
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,630
so the buried remains could very likely

787
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,980
flow through the underground waterway
to the well by the flower shed.

788
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,240
Quickly order someone to dig up the well
by the flower shed.

789
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,280
Give it to me.

790
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,200
Pull harder.

791
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,560
Guys,

792
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,430
put your backs into it!

793
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,500
Get this job done properly,

794
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,120
and you'll each get one extra tael

795
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,330
this month!

796
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,800
No,

797
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,270
two extra taels!

798
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,550
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

799
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,900
Calling them "guys"
and even using personal funds.

800
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,560
Prefect Huo really
has staked everything on it.

801
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,450
With back-to-back heinous crimes
in his jurisdiction,

802
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,320
even if only to keep his position,

803
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,150
he has to stake everything on it.

804
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,600
Put your backs into it!

805
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,190
Come on!

806
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,610
It's a... a skull.

807
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,840
Bai Feng.

808
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:49,510
Yes, sir.

809
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,450
Arrest Qin An immediately,

810
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,650
without fail.

811
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,570
Yes, sir.
