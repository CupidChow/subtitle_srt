1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,800
The Untamed

2
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
Get back to your original state.

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,200
Maidong is back.

4
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Maidong invites you to watch

5
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
the Snow-Crawling Road.

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,600
Kill!

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,000
Kill!

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,800
The Untamed

9
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,400
It's me.

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
The orphan who killed your son.

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Yan Ze.

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
How do you know?

13
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Of course it's you, you bastard.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,600
I...

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm so loyal to you.

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,200
You colluded with the rebels

17
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,800
and betrayed me.

18
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,000
As the saying goes,

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
it's not easy to be a man of your own.

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,000
Yuan Qing.

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,400
Please have some tea.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yuan Qing.

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,000
The hair I put on the tea

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,200
is the same as the one of the late princess.

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Your Majesty, you have plenty of time to enjoy it.

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Enjoy it.

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I want to see how the late princess died.

29
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
The poison of Mengdie you found

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
came from the red butterfly in the southern border.

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
It's colorless and tasteless.

32
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
You can only find it after the poison is released.

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
My poor mother.

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
She saved you from death.

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
But she became your enemy.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
My poor mother, who died of hammering.

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,600
She was killed in an instant.

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
My father went with my mother.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sure it's your destiny.

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,600
It's just a matter of time before the day of death.

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,400
Don't be too happy.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,600
I...

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,600
I have two more things to do.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,200
Wait for me.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,400
And Huaiyang Army.

46
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,800
You can go to the capital and protect the country.

47
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Your Majesty, have you forgotten?

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,600
I was the one who went to the front office to pass your order.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,000
You can't stop Huaiyang Army.

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,000
You...

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
You bastard.

52
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll kill you.

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
The traitor Yan Han.

54
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
You have such a bad ending.

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,400
It's a matter of time before the day of death.

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Yan Qing.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
Yan Qing.

58
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
How many times do you want to be punished?

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Brother.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,400
Li.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
What are you doing?

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
Why are you here?

63
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
You're here at the right time.

64
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,400
You're the one who owes the country.

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,400
You...

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,200
Li.

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
Li, go.

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,400
They...

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
They are traitors.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Hurry up.

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,400
Li.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,800
Li.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Li.

74
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Yan.

75
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Yan.

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
What are you doing?

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Li.

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Li.

79
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
Yan, are you crazy?

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
What are you doing?

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Yan Li.

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
Listen to that mouthful of yours.

83
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,800
Look at the emperor in front of you.

84
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Yuan Qing.

85
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Yuan Qing.

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
God has sent the edict.

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,600
The guilty will be punished.

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,400
I, Yan Han, the second son of the late emperor,

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,000
used Fu Chengye to attack the traitors

90
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
and take the throne.

91
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
Yuan Qing.

92
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,400
I used my twin brother Yan Huai

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
to meet him alone in the thunder.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
I killed my brother first

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,200
and destroyed the edict.

96
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,000
Then I took the throne

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
in the name of my brother.

98
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,200
I'm innocent.

99
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm the one who was killed by the heaven.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,200
I'm the one who was killed by the heaven.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,800
You're a traitor.

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
You deserve to be punished.

103
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
These are all lies.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Nonsense.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
Are they all lies?

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
He knows it best.

107
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,800
Is he the second son of the late emperor?

108
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,200
You.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
You.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The second son of the late emperor.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You didn't hear it wrong.

112
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
He's your biological father.

113
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
Yan Han, the second son of the late emperor.

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
My Li.

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,600
My Li.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Li.

117
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Father.

118
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Li.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Li.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Impossible.

121
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Impossible.

122
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,800
Then why do you think

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
he let the crown prince and Prince Cheng

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,200
take the throne?

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
It's impossible.

126
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,600
It's impossible.

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
You think

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,200
he let the crown prince and Prince Cheng

129
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
take the throne?

130
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,000
But he treats you like his own son.

131
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm Yan Han. So what?

132
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
I'm also the son of the empress dowager.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm still the son of the royal family.

134
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm Yan.

135
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
I'm the second son of the late emperor.

136
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
I'm the second son of the late emperor.

137
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,600
It's impossible.

138
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,400
Who will help me?

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,600
The heaven and earth are full of

140
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,200
the natural and natural things.

141
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,400
I'll be the first son of the late emperor.

142
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
I'll be the second son of the late emperor.

143
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
Father.

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,800
What about me and mother?

145
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you want the second son of the late emperor?

146
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Yes.

147
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Li.

148
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Why don't you ask your biological father

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
how your brother's mother died?

150
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
How did Consort Jin die?

151
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,600
How did Shen Yi die?

152
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
It's impossible.

153
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Li.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Father.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
It's all for you.

156
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,200
I don't want you to be like your father

157
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
who is in a terrible situation.

158
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Li.

159
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,000
I did all this for you.

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,200
I just want you to be a great man.

161
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
He...

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
He is not me.

163
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,400
Li.

164
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Father.

165
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
It's impossible.

166
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Li.

167
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,200
My Li.

168
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,800
You are a slave.

169
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Father.

170
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
I'll kill you.

171
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Yan Han.

172
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,400
Even your son who is dependent on the late emperor

173
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
doesn't believe your lies.

174
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,200
When you abandoned your wife and son,

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,800
did you ever think of this day?

176
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
You.

177
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,600
You are the son of the late emperor.

178
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Today, you...

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Yan Ze.

180
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,600
Yan Ze. Yan Ze. Yan Ze.

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Li, wake up.

182
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,400
Wake up, Li.

183
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,800
Wake up, Li.

184
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,800
Yan Ze. Yan Ze. Yan Ze.

185
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,800
Yan Ze. Yan Ze. Yan Ze.

186
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,800
Yan Ze. Yan Ze. Yan Ze. Yan Ze.

187
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,800
I've done what you asked.

188
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm the son of the late emperor.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,600
I'll kill you.

190
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
I'll protect you.

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,200
Let go of me.

192
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
Let go of me, Li.

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll kill you right now.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll transfer my throne to you.

195
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,400
Yuan Qing.

196
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,000
Tell me.

197
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Should I take the throne?

198
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,600
The late emperor's noble and noble

199
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,200
is the destiny of the world.

200
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,800
Yan Mo.

201
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,400
You are all the same.

202
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,800
You are the same.

203
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,000
You are right.

204
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,400
You will end up

205
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,000
with a dog's death sooner or later.

206
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,600
I want the throne

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
so that all the people

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,400
who are sick and sick

209
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,400
can be named by my parents.

210
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,200
You've helped me achieve my dream

211
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,800
and rest in peace.

212
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
There are many people

213
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
who hate the way of heaven.

214
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
I hope he won't believe anything

215
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,400
in the next life and will die for the heaven.

216
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,400
The King of Yan Mo

217
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
The King of Yan Mo

218
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
The King of Yan Mo

219
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
The King of Yan Mo

220
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
The King of Yan Mo

221
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,400
Go.

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,800
Bai Feng.

223
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,600
Go.

224
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,800
Go.

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,400
The evil hand of the Heaven's Daoist Society

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,200
Yuan Qing has been eliminated.

227
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
After today,

228
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,000
no one will know that I'm related to the Heaven's Daoist Society.

229
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,600
The world will only remember

230
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,800
that you died in the hands of Yuan Qing, the traitor of the Heaven's Daoist Society.

231
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
And Yuan Qing

232
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,800
died in the hands of your precious son.

233
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Except that your crimes will be publicized to the public,

234
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,400
all the truth

235
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,000
will be spread.

236
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,000
Li.

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
How are you?

238
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
How are you?

239
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
How are you?

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I didn't expect

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,600
that I would be with you

242
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
for the rest of my life.

243
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
I don't know

244
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
if I'll have the chance to see Little Niannian in my life.

245
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,200
When she sees me like this,

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
she will be so jealous.

247
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,400
I'll be with you.

248
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Okay.

249
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,200
I'll let you have a good taste of it.

250
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
The feeling of being helpless

251
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,800
when your family died in front of you.

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,800
The feeling of being chased after.

253
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,600
Li.

254
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Li.

255
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Yong Zi.

256
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
How is Li?

257
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,000
I can save her.

258
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Li.

259
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,000
Young Marshal, go to save the emperor.

260
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Wait.

261
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Young Master.

262
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,200
How is Brother Sui?

263
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,000
He's fine.

264
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He should have been shot.

265
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,800
Someone set fire to the place.

266
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I've killed him.

267
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Princess Consort and Princess are in the palace.

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
You protect Brother Sui.

269
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,400
I'll go save Princess Consort.

270
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,200
Yes.

271
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yan Li.

272
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Brother.

273
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,600
He's not the same Brother Sui anymore.

274
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,800
He's going to kill us.

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Brother.

276
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
My father

277
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,400
killed His Majesty

278
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,400
and your mother.

279
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
And

280
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,000
let me

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,200
face the consequences with my life.

282
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,400
He's him. You're you.

283
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
You should be ashamed of yourself.

284
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,600
I'm not ashamed of myself.

285
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
But you should live well.

286
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,000
Master.

287
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,200
The rebels are gone.

288
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,400
Take them out.

289
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,400
Yes.

290
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Be careful.

291
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,600
Come.

292
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,000
Don't blame me.

293
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,400
Take Li away.

294
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,800
Take Li away first.

295
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Come.

296
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Brother.

297
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,000
Brother.

298
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Yan Han killed our parents.

299
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,200
Why do you still want to save him?

300
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,400
His crime

301
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
is punishable by law.

302
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
We can't just let him die.

303
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,200
Law?

304
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,200
Yan Han's crime

305
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,800
is unforgivable.

306
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,600
His life is in danger.

307
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
How can the law be punished?

308
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Yuan Qing.

309
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,200
The time is not over yet.

310
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
You.

311
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,800
You're here

312
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,800
to cover your crime

313
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,600
with a gentleman's face.

314
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,800
You're so selfish.

315
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
A gentleman.

316
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
You're really thoughtful.

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,400
Yan Ze

318
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,200
used the words of the God

319
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,200
to fool people.

320
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,000
In fact, he used the Heaven's Law

321
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
to train his power

322
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,200
to seek the imperial power

323
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,800
to avenge his

324
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,400
own death.

325
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,800
I...

326
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,800
Although I'm not a good man,

327
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,400
I've been a good emperor

328
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
for years.

329
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm a good emperor

330
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,000
who loves the people.

331
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400
Loves the people?

332
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,600
You did everything

333
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
to prove that the Empress Dowager

334
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,800
was wrong to abandon you.

335
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,000
You abandoned your wife

336
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
and brother

337
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
to satisfy your ambition

338
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,200
to serve the country.

339
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,400
You killed your own family.

340
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,600
You're the most vicious

341
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,800
and vicious villain in the world.

342
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,200
You...

343
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,600
Stop it.

344
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,400
You...

345
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,000
What gentleman?

346
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
What vicious villain?

347
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,400
You're just a couple.

348
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,400
No matter what kind of love you have,

349
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,200
you're just criminals

350
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,600
who kill people.

351
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,800
The one I killed

352
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
is also a criminal.

353
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,200
They're the ones who deserve to die.

354
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,200
I told you

355
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,200
that they deserve to die.

356
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
It's not your turn.

357
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
You can't use this as an excuse

358
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,000
to vent your guilt.

359
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,800
Think about your parents.

360
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
Think about our mother.

361
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Do you still want to save Yan Han,

362
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,000
who's a criminal,

363
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,400
and help the evil?

364
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,400
Yan Han must die.

365
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,600
Yes.

366
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,400
Master!

367
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,900
soRn

368
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,200
Why did you

369
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,800
kill my mother?

370
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Who are you?

371
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Who are you?

372
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Don't come over.

373
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Get out of my way.

374
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Get out of my way.

375
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Don't come over.

376
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Don't come over.

377
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Stop pretending.

378
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Come with me to the Zichen Hall

379
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
to expose that person's true face.

380
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

381
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
I...

382
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Stop pretending to be crazy.

383
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Stop pretending to be crazy.

384
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Do you think I've been

385
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
afraid of you all these years?

386
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
I just don't want to be

387
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
your enemy.

388
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Your sword

389
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
caused my daughter to die.

390
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
What happened to her?

391
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
When you worshiped

392
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
the traitor every day,

393
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
have you ever thought about

394
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
what happened to you?

395
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,400
What happened to the traitor?

396
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Don't you want to

397
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
pretend to be a good-looking man?

398
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
If he hadn't been guarding you,

399
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
you would have dragged him to bed.

400
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Do you think all the women

401
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
are as self-righteous as you?

402
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Since the traitor was found,

403
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
it wasn't His Majesty.

404
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
I've been planning

405
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
to save His Majesty's blood

406
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
and make a great achievement.

407
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
What about you?

408
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
You've been full of

409
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
your own power and wealth.

410
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Your son died in his hands.

411
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
You still pretend to be crazy

412
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
and live in the world.

413
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
How could there be

414
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
a mother like you in this world?

415
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
I didn't kill my daughter.

416
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Why should I die with her?

417
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Is it wrong for me to live?

418
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
All these years,

419
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
she has always treated me

420
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
as a hidden grass.

421
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
She has never even

422
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
taken off her clothes when she was lying beside me.

423
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
For Qi,

424
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
I've been lying beside a fake man

425
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
and guarding him for more than ten years.

426
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
What else do you want me to do?

427
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,400
For His Majesty's blood,

428
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
you raised your son

429
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
so weak and incompetent

430
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
just to make him a puppet.

431
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
You can be the regent's empress dowager.

432
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
All you did

433
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
was for yourself.

434
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Shut up!

435
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
The empress has killed someone.

436
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
The empress has killed someone.

437
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Remember this day.

438
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
I'll take the throne for the late emperor.

439
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
If you want me to die,

440
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
don't even think about living.

441
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,400
I'll take the throne for the late emperor.

442
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Who would have thought that

443
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Zhu Lan Daxue would be in control again?

444
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
It's a pity that my talented son

445
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
is in this imperial court

446
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
and has nowhere to hide.

447
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Let's go.

448
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Don't move.

449
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Where are you going?

450
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
My defeat today

451
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
is to be an injustice to the heaven

452
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
and let a mediocre person like you

453
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
live a good life.

454
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
But I'm not a man.

455
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
You don't deserve to be laughed at.

456
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
You colluded with the rebels and betrayed the master.

457
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
How dare you say that our government is doing well?

458
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Our government is doing well.

459
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Even the money of the old lady

460
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
was collected by us.

461
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
I'm not as good as you as an official.

462
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
You are not as good as me as a man.

463
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Take him away.

464
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Yes.

465
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I...

466
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
You...

467
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
You

468
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
don't

469
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
hurt Li'er.

470
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Li'er is my brother.

471
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
He is the biological brother of the bloodline.

472
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
I don't deserve to be laughed at.

473
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
I don't deserve to be

474
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
humiliated by you

475
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
and hurt your father.

476
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I'm sorry.

477
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
I'm sorry.

478
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
The death of the late emperor,

479
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Consort Jin,

480
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Prince Jin

481
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
and Duke Shen

482
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
are all my fault.

483
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
You can regret it.

484
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
I...

485
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,400
If you weren't

486
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
put into the prison,

487
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
these things wouldn't have happened.

488
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
My parents would still be alive.

489
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Your parents?

490
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
You are...

491
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,400
My father is the son of the Minister of Rites, Shen Yi.

492
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm sorry.

493
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
My father and brother are hiding their weapons

494
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
to cover up your killing of Consort Jin.

495
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
You didn't know about it.

496
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
You didn't want to cause a stir in the court.

497
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
But you killed the loyal subjects

498
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
who saw you as the Lord of the Ming Dynasty.

499
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,400
It's my fault.

500
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
It's my fault.

501
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
My fault.

502
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
It's my fault.

503
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
My fault.

504
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I...

505
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
I was right.

506
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I was right.

507
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
I was right.

508
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
I was right.

509
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
I was right.

510
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I was right.

511
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
I was right.

512
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
I was right.

513
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
I was right.

514
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
I was right.

515
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
I was right.

516
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I was right.

517
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
I was right.

518
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I was right.

519
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
I was right.

520
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
I was right.

521
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
I was right.

522
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
I was right.

523
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
I was right.

524
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
I was right.

525
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
I was right.

526
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I was right.

527
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
I was right.

528
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
I was right.

529
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
I was right.

530
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
I was right.

531
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
I was right.

532
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
I was right.

533
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
I was right.

534
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
I was right.

535
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
I was right.

536
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
I was right.

537
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
I was right.

538
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
I was right.

539
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
I was right.

540
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
I was right.

541
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
I was right.

542
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
I was right.

543
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
I was right.

544
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
I was right.

545
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
I was right.

546
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
I was right.

547
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
I was right.

548
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
I was right.

549
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
I was right.

550
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
I was right.

551
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
I was right.

552
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
I was right.

553
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
I was right.

554
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
I was right.

555
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
I was right.

556
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I was right.

557
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
I was right.

558
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
I was right.

559
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
I was right.

560
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I was right.

561
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
I was right.

562
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
I was right.

563
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
I was right.

564
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
I was right.

565
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
I was right.

566
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
I was right.

567
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
I was right.

568
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
I was right.

569
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I was right.

570
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
No...

571
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
No...

572
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
No...

573
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
No...

574
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
No...

575
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
no.

576
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
What's this?

577
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,400
Maybe not !

578
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
But what's the matter with that?

579
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
I'm not only a mother,

580
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
but also the Empress Dowager of the State.

581
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
She's diligent and polite.

582
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
She has a thunderous method.

583
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,400
She's more suitable to be the emperor than Huai'er.

584
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,400
I thought if she could really be the Emperor,

585
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
it would be a good chance to pass her throne to Che'er.

586
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
It's a good chance.

587
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Who knows that a step is a step.

588
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
You're right.

589
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
The imperial family's rules are wrong.

590
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,400
I'm wrong on Han'er.

591
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,400
First, I shouldn't have been too soft-hearted and let her live.

592
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Second, I shouldn't have lied to myself

593
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
after she came back to the palace.

594
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
I was wrong from the beginning.

595
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Don't blame yourself, Grandmother.

596
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
If you don't make these two mistakes,

597
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
we won't have Yanli and Suige.

598
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,400
I let Suige inherit the throne

599
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,400
for the sake of the country.

600
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,400
You two won't blame Grandmother

601
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
for making such a decision, right?

602
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Sun'er and Li have never thought about that position.

603
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Not only have no grudges,

604
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
but they are also serious.

605
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
I only want Wan'er to be the only one

606
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,400
to be more familiar with the position.

607
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Okay.

608
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,400
You two help me for a few more years.

609
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,400
I will fulfill your wishes.

610
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Sit.

611
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
How is it?

612
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Is the Empress Dowager doing well?

613
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Although Grandmother still has a pain in her heart,

614
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
she has recovered from it.

615
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
She will be better and better.

616
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
That's good.

617
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
With you two accompanying me,

618
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Grandmother can go back to my Jinzhou with peace of mind.

619
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Why is Grandmother looking for you?

620
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
I'm here to see you.

621
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
I'm here to see you.

622
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
I'm here to see you.

623
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
I'm here to see you.

624
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Why is Grandmother leaving so soon?

625
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Wan'er and I haven't served you well yet.

626
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
You don't have to serve me.

627
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
It's the most important thing

628
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,400
to treat Wan'er well.

629
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Grandmother.

630
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Thank you.

631
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
For what?

632
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,400
You saved my life twice.

633
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
I haven't thanked you yet.

634
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Actually, from the beginning,

635
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
I had the heart of Panfu.

636
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
But Grandmother has always been sincere to me.

637
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
She never has a half of the talent.

638
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Grandmother doesn't like to hear that.

639
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
What is Panfu?

640
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Panfu is called Panfu

641
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
because of the pretense and the trick.

642
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
You are so kind

643
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
with your own ability.

644
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Grandmother loves you.

645
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,400
This is the fate of our ancestors.

646
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,400
No matter you are Qin Wan or Shen Wan,

647
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
you will always be

648
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,400
the granddaughter that I love most.

649
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Grandmother.

650
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
It's okay.

651
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Slowly, I am trying to get you.

652
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
I can't stop thinking about you.

653
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
My hand.

654
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
The story is not over yet.

655
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
I can't stop crying.

656
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I will leave Wan'er to you.

657
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Remember.

658
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
I haven't run away from you.

659
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
If you dare to let my Wan'er

660
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
suffer a little bit,

661
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,400
I will appear in front of you at any time.

662
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
I will teach you a lesson.

663
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,400
If my grandmother comes back to the capital,

664
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
I am afraid that I won't have the chance.

665
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Wan'er.

666
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Go.

667
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
The late emperor's edict.

668
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
The son of the emperor, Yan Sui,

669
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
is the empress of the heaven.

670
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
He is filial to the emperor.

671
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
After the unification of the four cities,

672
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
the emperor is in charge of the country.

673
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
He is under the order of the heaven

674
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
and is responsible for the great cause.

675
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,400
I hereby declare to the world

676
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
that the emperor is the emperor.

677
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
I hereby declare to the world

678
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
that the emperor is the emperor.

679
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
Yan Chi, the king of Rui,

680
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
is noble and noble.

681
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
He is filial to the people.

682
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
He is the one who can control the chaos.

683
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
He is the one who can protect the city and save the late emperor.

684
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
He is the one who can do the best in the official affairs.

685
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
He is the one who is the regent.

686
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
He is the one who can assist the four armies

687
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
and help the people.

688
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
He is the one who can save the country.

689
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Yang Shen.

690
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Thank you, your majesty.

691
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
The Ming Dynasty

692
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
You came back to Jingzheng

693
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
you should take good care of grandma

694
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
and yourself.

695
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Forget all the past

696
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
and people.

697
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Don't worry.

698
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
I won't put myself in a difficult situation.

699
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Yan Ze lost his life

700
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
because of his own evil.

701
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
I don't owe him anything.

702
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
It only takes me some time

703
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
to figure out what kind of life I want.

704
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
That's the best thing to think.

705
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
Can you help me burn something?

706
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Who are you burning it for?

707
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
If you don't come down, the boat will leave.

708
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Coming.

709
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
Coming.

710
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Little girl, I'm coming.

711
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
So it's you.

712
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
I've been treating Yan Li as my sister since I was a child.

713
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
You have to treat her well.

714
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Sister?

715
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,400
You can slap her face, but you can't slap the flowers.

716
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Otherwise, she will cry.

717
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Brother Qi, don't worry.

718
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Just for the sake of her face,

719
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I will let her go.

720
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
While she's young and beautiful, get married.

721
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Otherwise, you'll lose your beauty.

722
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I have something on my face.

723
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Xiaowan is right.

724
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
You can't lose your beauty.

725
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Don't worry.

726
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
My beauty is eternal.

727
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
Do we need to get married as soon as possible?

728
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
Of course.

729
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
We're leaving.

730
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Is the date fixed?

731
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
No.

732
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Don't talk nonsense.

733
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
You've been nagging.

734
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
You've denied it after asking about marriage.

735
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Do you believe I'll send you to the book store?

736
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
No.

737
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
The date is fixed.

738
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
You can wait for the wedding wine.

739
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,400
The boat is leaving.

740
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,400
I've been through the storm alone for many years.

741
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,400
I've never met this love.

742
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:34,400
I know you came to my world and wrote down your wish.

743
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,400
The day you gave me is a good day.

744
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Let the future have a picture.

745
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:51,400
When I close my eyes, I realize I love you.

746
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:04,020
Get of

747
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,840
question your leader.

748
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:40,660
Keep in mind to

749
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,700
never trust in girls like you.

750
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,880
Who makes noise out of

751
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,240
The one who is innocent will be happy for three years.

752
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,280
The one who is forbidden to teach will be released.

753
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,680
If there is a person who beat the body of the victim,

754
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,800
he will be kept for three thousand miles.

755
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,920
If there is a person who killed the rich and the poor,

756
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,960
he will be executed.

757
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,320
The new law has been approved by His Majesty.

758
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,440
He will be executed immediately.

759
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,120
Anyone who has solved the case

760
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,280
will be executed in public.

761
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,600
Good.

762
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,080
Good.

763
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:17,960
Great.

764

Wake us up.

779
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,400
Get the gun.

780
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,480
Yes.

781
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,880
Anotheracie hairdo?

782
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,560
Yes. Let's leave.

783
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,760
Like a flower,

784
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,160
moving in the snow.

785
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,640
So cold,

786
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,920
so warm.

787
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,960
If I fall in love,

788
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,520
I'll fall into the shadow.

789
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,760
The snow falls,

790
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,160
and my whole body is white.

791
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,800
If I fall in love,

792
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,120
I'll fall into the starry sky.

793
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:33,080
The pain will also be the same.

794
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,080
Open your heart,

795
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,480
love doesn't matter the deep sea.

796
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,920
Please give me courage,

797
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,440
let fate be in the way.

798
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,840
Don't be afraid of the starlight,

799
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,120
the moon will not leave the sky.

800
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,640
The stars will shine

801
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:04,640
beyond the sky.

802
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,640
I'm like dust,

803
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,720
but I'm the color of the starry sky.

804
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,160
I'm like dust,

805
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,680
but I'm the color of the starry sky.

806
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,600
The stars will shine beyond the sky.

807
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,080

810
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,080
The stars will shine beyond the sky.

811
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,840
The stars will shine beyond the sky.

812
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:52,520
