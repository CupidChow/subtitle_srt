It's okay

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hai Feng

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You guys take the old lady back to rest

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hurry up

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Help her

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Slow down

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Xiaorou

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Impossible

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Impossible

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How could this be?

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I thought I had told you

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How could this be?

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's you

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You are the only one who is loyal to me

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You killed Xiaorou

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ridiculous

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I was married to you because I wanted to show my respect to you

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I have never seen a bride

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wife

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hurry up

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let me see

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You are the one who is loyal to me

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How dare you ask me?

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You are a good bride and you died in the wedding

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you here to be loyal or to die?

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I grew up with Song Rou

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How could I hurt her?

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It must be because you are not satisfied with this marriage

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's why you killed my sister

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's not satisfied with?

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you are not satisfied with me

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How could you go out of the city to marry me?

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Enough

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Bai Feng

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Tell the guards of Black Armor Division and Anyang Mansion to guard this place

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No one is allowed to move around

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Xiaorou has not married into Anyang Mansion yet

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Behind her should be the Song Mansion

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to take her back to the capital

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Guards

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wei Fuwei

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Song Niang is the wife of the Duke of Anyang Mansion

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The date of the emperor's marriage is fixed

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The Duke of Anyang Mansion will seek justice for her

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All Song family members stay together

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No one is allowed to leave the Duke of Anyang Mansion without permission

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How dare you

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There is no such thing as I do not do it

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Take her away

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Go

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The bride died on the way to the Song family

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The Song family is the most suspicious

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The young general of the Shuoxi Army is really smart

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wife, go quickly

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They will find out later

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This may be my chance to break the trap

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Xiaorou

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I am useless

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can't protect you

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I can't even take you home

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If I knew I would be in danger

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I shouldn't have sent you here

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Father

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Jiang'er

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Go to see your grandmother first

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She must be very worried about you

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Father

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I really didn't do anything

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I know you are wronged

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Before Shang Wei is released

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I have to protect the reputation of the Duke of Anyang Mansion

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I want to let you rest at home for a few days

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I want to go out

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Father

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What happened?

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Guests want to go but dare not

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They are asking around

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You arrange a carriage

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Send all the guests from the west door to leave

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Just say that today is an emergency

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Our Duke of Anyang Mansion will be on the way to the gate one day

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Father

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The bride is the crown prince's wife

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's really heart-breaking to see such a tyrant

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This matter concerns the two families

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you for your concern

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Find out the truth as soon as possible

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't worry, my lord

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I will find out the truth

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Please take in the salary

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will cooperate with the investigation later

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Father

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You think I am a criminal?

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I was ordered by Duke Song to send my daughter to her family

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
She was safe all the way

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why did she die in the capital?

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's clear that Yue family is trying to harm her

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I misunderstood

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will do everything I can to find out the truth

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Father

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Find out the truth as soon as possible

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't miss any of them

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Please go back to your mansion

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
All the guests, stand up

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Follow me

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hurry up

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hurry up

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hurry up

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Your highness

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You are just in time

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's not good to stay here for long

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Please arrange a banquet as soon as possible

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Your highness

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I have arranged a banquet

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's not good to stay here for long

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Please arrange a banquet as soon as possible

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why didn't the magistrate investigate the wedding and body first?

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If he ruins the evidence, he will be blamed

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What a fool

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
My lady, don't worry about it

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If the princess knows that you are a girl

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And you believe in martial arts, what will you do?

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then no one will support us

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If we solve the case

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It will be good for both me and An Yan's mansion

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't worry

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Master

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Bai Feng

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Tell the black armor guards to search

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Anyone who is around the wall of the wedding hall

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And who is interested in the case

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They will be disbanded

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But no one is allowed to hurt them

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Surround here

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Black armor guards, listen to my order

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Prepare to go to the wedding

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Black armor guards, listen to my order

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Prepare to go to the wedding

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I fell...

156
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,500
How unusual.

157
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,720
You'd regret to see blood Cl Pictured paint los from Eat dead

158
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,500
Blood stains must be on Guard Patio

159
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:29,560
Butorie blood on the

160
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I'm afraid that someone has been forged.

161
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
You guys, send the corpse to the courier station first.

162
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Then, carry the sedan to the government office.

163
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
No!

164
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Lady Qin Jiu?

165
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Why are you here?

166
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Brothers, the corpse and the corpse cannot be moved.

167
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
We have to wait until the banquet is over before we can move it.

168
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,500
The government has not yet decided on the situation.

169
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
We have to wait until the banquet is over before we can move it.

170
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
The government has decided on the situation.

171
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
You are a woman.

172
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Stop being so rude. Leave now.

173
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
If we don't have the banquet,

174
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
we will have to move the corpse and the sedan.

175
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
The body cannot be destroyed.

176
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
I wonder if you are willing to take the responsibility?

177
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Lady Qin Jiu,

178
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
as a woman of the Gui family,

179
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
don't you know what is the respect and respect?

180
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
You are so strict with the officials.

181
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
Aren't you afraid of being ridiculed?

182
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
I didn't expect that Mr. Huo would be so rude.

183
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
I didn't expect that Mr. Huo would be so rude.

184
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I didn't expect that Mr. Huo would be so rude.

185
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
No wonder he has been studying with the magistrate for so long.

186
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
But he still doesn't know how to read the book.

187
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
So the magistrate is a talented teacher

188
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
who raised you as his daughter.

189
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
You!

190
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Who is laughing?

191
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
I can't laugh. I didn't laugh.

192
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Shut up!

193
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Qin Jiu, I know

194
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
that you still care about our family's divorce.

195
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
that you still care about our family's divorce.

196
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
But the more you are entangled with me,

197
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
the more I can't turn back.

198
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
You'd better give up on it.

199
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I'm relieved

200
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
to hear Mr. Huo say so.

201
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Luckily, you don't want to turn back.

202
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Otherwise, I really have no face to face the magistrate.

203
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Let's go.

204
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
You!

205
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
He left.

206
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
What did he find out?

207
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
What are you doing?

208
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Where is the cart?

209
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Take this thing away quickly. Hurry up!

210
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
No one can come near the General's army.

211
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I...

212
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
It's okay.

213
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Mr. Huo.

214
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm Huo Ning.

215
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
I'm here to see you.

216
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Mr. Huo is the one who is responsible for the banquet?

217
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Jiayan just ordered me to take this sedan and body

218
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
back to the government office and the courier station.

219
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
There are also the official and the coroner to conduct the banquet.

220
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
The local county

221
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
always has this kind of banquet.

222
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
I think so.

223
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
What if the confession and the banquet are not right?

224
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
What about the court?

225
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Of course, the confession is the main thing.

226
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
The banquet...

227
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
The banquet is not guaranteed.

228
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
The Black Armor Guard will escort you to the government office and the courier station.

229
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Be careful on the way.

230
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Don't lose or miss any items.

231
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Before the banquet,

232
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
you all stay there.

233
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Yes!

234
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Let's go!

235
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Honey,

236
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
you'd better not interfere in that case.

237
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
It's lucky that the Black Armor Guard didn't find us.

238
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
If they catch us,

239
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
what if they find out who you really are?

240
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Since you've saved the First Princess,

241
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
we can go to beg her and escort her to the capital.

242
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Father,

243
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
you are so wise.

244
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I've seen everything in the capital.

245
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
I've seen the truth.

246
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
But I'm not sure if it's true.

247
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
But you have medical skills.

248
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
As long as we can save more ladies in the capital,

249
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
we can...

250
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
There are not so many ladies who are sick on the street.

251
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Since I found out that my father was killed by the black magic,

252
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
I've realized what I should do.

253
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
I want the First Princess

254
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
to trust my medical skills

255
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
and my martial arts skills.

256
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
She should recommend me

257
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
as a soldier.

258
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
But you are a woman.

259
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
How can you ask a woman to be a soldier?

260
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
So what?

261
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
I want to be the first female warrior

262
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
who can make men feel ashamed.

263
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
But...

264
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
The Wu Tou Xiniang case

265
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
involves the palace's men.

266
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
We can't offend anyone.

267
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
What if Duke Song of the Song Dynasty

268
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
is not satisfied with your tea party?

269
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I don't need everyone to be satisfied.

270
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
I can't make everyone satisfied with the execution.

271
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
I just need the First Princess to trust me.

272
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Father has taught me

273
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
the art of tea party.

274
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I must use my own skills

275
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
to clear my parents' name.

276
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
I will make the people who killed them

277
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
and the Second Uncle Qin

278
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
confess their crimes.

279
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Whoever gives me this chance, I will make them satisfied.

280
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I will listen to you.

281
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I'm not afraid of anything.

282
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
How's the investigation?

283
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Is Qin Wan really the maid of the Second House?

284
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Yes. According to the informant,

285
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
the second house's maid is the only daughter of Qin Wan.

286
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
She was born with a severe illness.

287
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
After she died at the age of 6, she was sent to the Medicine King's Valley for treatment.

288
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
She went to the country to return home after the war.

289
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
She came here clearly. It's not appropriate.

290
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
The Medicine King's Valley only has plain clothes for the people.

291
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
It forbids the leak of news of the illness.

292
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Our nail can't be put in.

293
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Why did she stay there for more than ten years?

294
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
It's said that the maid of Qin

295
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
was a devoted servant who was obsessed with the art of tea.

296
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
She often sent medicine to the people.

297
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
The room is well-known.

298
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
She is close to the Medicine King's daughter.

299
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
The daughter of a friend can live here.

300
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I didn't expect that

301
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
the ambitious Zhong Yong Hong

302
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
has a brother who is a real man.

303
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Although the name of Zhong Yong Hong's mansion is not separated,

304
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Qin Liang and Lin Liangfang are not close.

305
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
But the Qin An and Zhong Yong Hong

306
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
that Mrs. Ji gave birth to are more close.

307
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
What about Qin Liang?

308
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
How's his ship?

309
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
There is more than one way from the Medicine King's Valley to Jingzhou.

310
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Our men are investigating Shen Yi's whereabouts.

311
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
If we send more men,

312
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
it will affect the progress of the Prince of Jing's case.

313
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Only Shen Yi

314
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
can prove that

315
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Consort Jin was not killed by the Prince of Jing.

316
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I don't believe that someone like her

317
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
can do stupid things to escape from crime.

318
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
I will do my best to investigate Shen Yi's whereabouts.

319
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Fire and death are both obvious.

320
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
As for this Qin Wan,

321
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
I will investigate it myself.

322
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
The maid of Qin is the savior of the Princess Royal.

323
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Why do you investigate her all of a sudden?

324
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
To use her.

325
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
If she is innocent,

326
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
she will become an assistant to the Prince of Jing's case.

327
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
But you believe that

328
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
a lonely girl who has lived in the valley for a long time

329
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
can travel thousands of miles to return to her hometown.

330
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
She has been abandoned by her family, but she still has her love.

331
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
She was just observing the Lady of the Marquis of Anyang.

332
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I'm afraid she has other intentions.

333
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
I have to use her.

334
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Do you want to use her

335
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
or to guard against her?

336
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Why do you care so much?

337
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
What are you doing?

338
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
You are interested in her.

339
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
No, no, no. I don't like

340
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
a girl who is picky.

341
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
I don't like her.

342
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Take the military report.

343
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Yes.

344
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Sister Wu, Sister Liu.

345
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
What are you doing here?

346
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Don't you know that people will be angry when they see you?

347
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
I don't know what you mean by that.

348
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Sister Jiu.

349
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Although Sister Liu is a concubine,

350
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
she is also your sister.

351
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
How can you talk to your elder sister like that?

352
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
I only respect the self-respecting person.

353
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
It has nothing to do with the enemy.

354
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Don't pretend to be stupid.

355
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
You really don't know that Lady of the Marquis of Anyang

356
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
is a concubine.

357
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
If you didn't make her unhappy when you came back,

358
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
how could you cancel the wedding that day?

359
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Now, Sister Wu and Brother Huo's marriage

360
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
is also empty.

361
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
You have embarrassed our daughter.

362
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Sister Liu,

363
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
you can't say that again.

364
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
If others hear it,

365
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
they will think that our daughter

366
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
likes to steal other people's wives and husbands.

367
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
You are so ungrateful.

368
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Who are you talking about?

369
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm not talking about you.

370
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
You are not the first concubine of the Marquis of Anyang.

371
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
You think you can do anything

372
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
just because you have a second concubine?

373
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
How long can you be the second concubine

374
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
of a sick old lady?

375
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
If the Marquis of Anyang dies,

376
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
I will...

377
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
How dare you!

378
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Who dares to talk about this again?

379
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Open your mouth!

380
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
You are so ungrateful.

381
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Who dares to disrespect my grandmother?

382
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Who are you?

383
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
How dare you curse her under the bright sun?

384
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
I dare not.

385
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I was just in a hurry.

386
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I said something wrong.

387
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Since you can't talk,

388
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
what's the use of your tongue?

389
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Cut off her tongue.

390
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Please forgive me, Princess.

391
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Please spare me.

392
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I will never do it again.

393
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Grandma, please save me.

394
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Please calm down, Princess Youning.

395
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
It's my fault.

396
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I didn't teach her well.

397
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
That's why I gave her this kind of daughter.

398
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
She is a daughter of a traitor.

399
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Please forgive her.

400
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
She is young and ignorant.

401
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Please forgive her.

402
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
I will punish her severely according to the family law.

403
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
I will be filial.

404
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Please have mercy on her.

405
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
How should we punish her?

406
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
She is a traitor.

407
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
She is disrespectful to her ancestors.

408
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
She will be sentenced to 80 years in prison.

409
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
She will be sentenced to 2 months in prison.

410
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
If she is sentenced to 80 years, she will die.

411
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
She will be sentenced to 20 years.

412
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Thank you, Princess.

413
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Take her out.

414
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Mother!

415
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Mother, please save me.

416
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Sister Wu, please listen to me.

417
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
Mother!

418
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Sister Wu!

419
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Mother!

420
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Xie Jun.

421
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Grandma is waiting for you to get treated.

422
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
It's getting late.

423
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Let's go.

424
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Mother, let's go.

425
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Why is grandmother sleeping so soundly?

426
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Is something wrong?

427
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,500
She will recover after 19 days.

428
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,500
But it's not a good sign.

429
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Didn't you say that

430
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
as long as grandmother gets through the 7-day crisis,

431
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
she will be less dangerous?

432
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Princess Royal is very kind.

433
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
She will be able to get through the 7-day crisis.

434
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Is it that dangerous?

435
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Princess Royal is very sick.

436
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
She died yesterday.

437
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
She was scared to death.

438
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Her blood and blood were all over the place.

439
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
She is very sick.

440
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Grandma has been sleeping for almost a night.

441
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500
She will be very sad if Song Rou dies.

442
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
She will be worried that Duke Song will be in trouble

443
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
and will lose her life.

444
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
The reputation of Marquis of Anyang will be ruined

445
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
if she is still alive.

446
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
She will be in trouble if she dies.

447
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
She is very kind.

448
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
If the Princess Royal's heart is not out,

449
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
it will be hard to cure her long-term illness.

450
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
But the House of Zhi just took over the case.

451
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
The price will be lower.

452
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,500
How can I survive?

453
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
What are you doing? Get up.

454
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Princess Rong Bing,

455
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I am also good at martial arts.

456
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I hope that the House of Zhi can solve this case

457
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
and help the Princess Royal to solve this problem.

458
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Martial arts?

459
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
It means...

460
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
It means that the deceased will die.

461
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
It will determine the cause of death and the time of death.

462
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
It will help us to catch the real murderer.

463
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Are you afraid that I will do martial arts

464
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
and get the bad luck?

465
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
No.

466
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
You are too powerful.

467
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
If it is bad luck,

468
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
we are from a military family.

469
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500
We are not born to be killed by the blood of the dead.

470
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
I just didn't expect that

471
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
you are a weak doctor.

472
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
How can you do this?

473
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
In my heart,

474
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
the medical skills and martial arts skills

475
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
are all about curing the sick and curing the sick.

476
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
One is curing the illness of the body.

477
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
The other is curing the illness of the human heart.

478
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
The human heart?

479
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
I don't understand what you are talking about.

480
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
But I think you are too good.

481
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Then can you introduce me to the Princess?

482
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Don't talk about introducing.

483
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
I will go with you.

484
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Wan...

485
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Wan.

486
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Wan.

487
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
I like it.

488
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Brother.

489
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
You are a grown-up.

490
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
You still don't know how to walk?

491
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
I don't.

492
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

493
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
I heard that you are good at watching the banquet.

494
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,500
I wonder how your medical skills are compared to yours.

495
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
I have never compared myself to myself.

496
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
I don't know how good or bad I am.

497
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
You don't know your ability.

498
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,500
How can I hand over the important case of the official relationship to you?

499
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
According to the heart of the doctor,

500
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
the Princess is sick.

501
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
I want to make her feel at ease as soon as possible.

502
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
I also have a private heart.

503
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Compared to the little doctor,

504
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
I want to be a coroner.

505
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
This time,

506
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
it's a rare opportunity for me to enter the industry.

507
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
So compared to the illness of the body,

508
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
you are more willing to treat the illness of the human heart.

509
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,500
I just think that the sentence you said is very powerful.

510
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
That's why I told Brother Qi.

511
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Yes.

512
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
The doctor can only save the body.

513
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,500
And the martial arts skills can eliminate the evil and only destroy the dragon.

514
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Just with your words,

515
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
I will help you.

516
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
But I need you to show your face.

517
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Don't embarrass me.

518
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
My brother is like this.

519
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Why can't you talk to him?

520
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Go. I don't want to argue with him.

521
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

522
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Greetings, Princess Yongning.

523
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
You don't have to be so polite.

524
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
This lady seems to have seen her yesterday.

525
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
This is the ninth lady of Qin's mansion, Qin Wan.

526
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Ah.

527
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Greetings, Your Excellency.

528
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
So it's the ninth lady of Qin's mansion.

529
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
The ninth lady has a lot of good things about the new case.

530
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
I hope I can help you.

531
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Ninth lady,

532
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
since you have seen the Lord of the Chess House,

533
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
why don't you just say it?

534
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Yongning.

535
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Have you found the dead person's head?

536
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Not yet.

537
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Have you checked the body?

538
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
I sent people to search thoroughly three times.

539
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
I have torn the wedding sedan chair into wood strips.

540
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
I haven't found the head's head.

541
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Lord Hua,

542
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
can you allow me to see the body of the coroner?

543
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
The body is a official document.

544
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Not everyone can see it.

545
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
It doesn't matter.

546
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Show him.

547
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Yes.

548
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Why is there no record of the body on the wedding sedan chair?

549
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Why did you check the body

550
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
before you found the head?

551
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
The dead person is Song Rou, the bride.

552
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Who else would it be if the bride wasn't Song Rou?

553
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Maybe it's the stepdaughter of Duke Song's family

554
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
who was sent here.

555
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Maybe it's the headless lady

556
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
who was sent here to disturb people.

557
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
There is no evidence to prove it.

558
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,500
The dead person is the only daughter of Duke Song's family, Song Rou.

559
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
The only daughter of Duke Song's family is confirmed.

560
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
How can you confirm it?

561
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
How can there be any difference?

562
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Before we caught the coroner,

563
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
all the Song family members who were related to the dead

564
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
were suspected and the confession was not credible.

565
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
To confirm the identity of the dead,

566
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Lord Hua, please examine the body as soon as possible.

567
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Ordinary people are not willing to examine the body.

568
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
Moreover, the identity of the dead is precious.

569
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
How can the coroner's suggestion be poisoned?

570
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
The coroner's suggestion is

571
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,500
but the autopsy is the spring of death.

572
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
The spring of death is the source of the body.

573
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
If someone is so hasty to cut the case,

574
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
aren't you afraid that the case will be charged?

575
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
This...

576
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
You...

577
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
You are just saying whatever you want.

578
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Your Highness, I have been an official for many years.

579
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
I have never been charged.

580
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
You are worrying too much.

581
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
This is not what you mean.

582
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
I do mean it.

583
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
You don't have to say anything for me.

584
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
The case of the execution of the imperial jade

585
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
is not for women to talk about.

586
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
You are too kind.

587
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
The criminal law has been said that

588
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500
the body of the dead is more likely to be cut off.

589
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Lord Shen Yi has been in the Dali Temple

590
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,500
to verify the evidence of the autopsy.

591
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Now, he has not confirmed the identity of the dead.

592
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
You have to make a hasty judgment.

593
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Shen Yi, that is a criminal.

594
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
He has been sentenced to death.

595
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
You treat such an unfaithful person as an example.

596
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
It's too...

597
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
It's not worth it.

598
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
I am a woman of the house.

599
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
I don't know the changes of the court.

600
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
I just know that

601
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
the Dali Temple's witness Xu Yue Lu

602
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
is the heart of Lord Shen Yi.

603
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
He has also been promoted to

604
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
the chief officer of the county

605
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
as a criminal.

606
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
I think

607
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
you have been to the temple.

608
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
So what?

609
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I can't bear to see the execution of the imperial jade.

610
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I am afraid that

611
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
the death of the dead will not be a good thing.

612
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500
I can't bear to see the execution of the imperial jade.

613
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500
I am afraid that you are kind and you are playing tricks.

614
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
If you don't blame me for being rude,

615
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
I am willing to help you

616
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,500
to find out the cause of the death.

617
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Can you really do it?

618
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
The ninth lady has the name of a doctor.

619
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
It's not difficult to find out the cause of death.

620
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
If there is no other way,

621
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
why not let her try?

622
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
There is a case of a death.

623
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
She can try it.

624
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
If she can really do it,

625
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
I will let her investigate the case.

626
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Chief Xu Wu,

627
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Lin Da Xing was killed by the head of the palace.

628
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Why did you only examine the body of the dead

629
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
and not find out if the body was damaged?

630
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
It is assumed that the dead died in the emergency.

631
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
Xu He has a lot of experience in the industry.

632
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,500
I have never complained about the body until now.

633
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
You don't know how to complain.

634
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
You don't know how to do it.

635
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Didn't you tell me that

636
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
I don't need to learn like you?

637
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
The process of fighting for the sake of the military

638
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,500
is exactly the same as the examination of the coroner.

639
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Without a fatal injury, there must be an emergency.

640
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Is there no need to complain?

641
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Since the dead died in an emergency,

642
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
where is the disease?

643
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
I am a magistrate.

644
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
How can I know?

645
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
You really don't need to know this.

646
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Since I have to investigate the cause of death,

647
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
I will be responsible for it.

648
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
How to investigate?

649
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
I will personally check the body.

650
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
What?

651
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Episode 5

652
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
What are these using for?

653
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Blossoms and abilities and urged the water

654
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:24,500
for removing odor,

655
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,480
It was a shelter.

656
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,400
Take one for Nanny Fu.

657
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,700
["C viktigt laker."Q irrigate wheat, but do not dischargeiva just step on dry grass. Take a hand." bots infra-locum nuturera soiling.]

658
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,540
Did you leave protection in them?

659
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,640
It's freshwater sowed.

660
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,640
When you throw the fire, you will hurt your hand.

661
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
When you throw the fire, you can't go out.

662
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Let's go.

663
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
I...

664
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
You two can leave now.

665
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,640
Xu He, remember every word I said.

666
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Yes.

667
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Xu He, remember every word I said.

668
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Yes.

669
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Remember, the deceased Lin Da Xin,

670
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,640
about 5 to 6 inches in length,

671
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
full of swollen body,

672
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
and a black blood clot in the middle of the lip.

673
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
The body was cut off.

674
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
The eyes were protruding,

675
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
and the lips were slightly open.

676
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
There was a black blood clot in the middle of the lips.

677
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
In the body, there was a worm.

678
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
About 5 days.

679
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
The wound is damaged, and the blood is clear.

680
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,640
On the left chest, there is a round black blood clot.

681
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,640
When you take out the sword, you will be able to see the way.

682
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Remember.

683
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Why did he use water to wash the body?

684
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
Fuling, Fuling, come here.

685
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
Hurry up.

686
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
The kid is hurt.

687
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,640
Sir Hua, did the wine really open the body's belly?

688
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
What's in the belly?

689
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
Alright, alright. I won't ask.

690
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
You spit it out.

691
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Did the water come out of the body?

692
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,640
Why did you block it?

693
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,640
Even Xu Wu did it like this.

694
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
What did Xiao Er do?

695
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Stop looking.

696
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
It's wrong.

697
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
Grab the sword.

698
00:35:33,640 --> 00:36:00,440
heart is broken,

699
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,340
I found him died,

700
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,540
XI25,

701
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,220
Go out and vomit.

702
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,860
How long has the crown prince been here?

703
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,860
He's been here.

704
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,180
Oh no.

705
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,300
He was testing me just now.

706
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,020
Is he suspecting me?

707
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,140
Why did he wipe his sweat just now?

708
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,660
He won't misunderstand, right?

709
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,260
Your Highness.

710
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,900
I don't want others to know

711
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,220
what I do in the morning.

712
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,820
Please keep it a secret for me.

713
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,660
Okay.

714
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,180
Jiu Niang.

715
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,700
Xiaoman.

716
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,620
Thank you.

717
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,460
I've found out that

718
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,900
the victim Lin Da Xing

719
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,180
was hit by a round object

720
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,300
on his left chest.

721
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,660
His heart was broken.

722
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Your Highness, don't misunderstand.

723
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,860
I've written the autopsy report.

724
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,020
Mr. Huo.

725
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,300
If we send someone to search Wei Wu's house now,

726
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,540
we should find a weapon

727
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,380
that has the same wound as his chest.

728
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,220
But the weapon should be wrapped in cotton cloth.

729
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,700
So there are no obvious wounds

730
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,420
when we first saw it.

731
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,100
It was revealed after the victim was injured.

732
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,540
I'll go to find someone to search.

733
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,300
Wait.

734
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,820
If it weren't for your help,

735
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,860
the suspect would have escaped.

736
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,500
Please

737
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,940
send the autopsy report

738
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,380
so that you won't be blamed for anything.

739
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,380
You're right.

740
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

741
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,260
Don't mention it.

742
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,380
Don't stand on ceremony.

743
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,340
Because the person

744
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,300
who left the seal

745
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,180
was Yin Zhen,

746
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,140
I'm Navنا's mother.

747
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,540
With my many troubles 왔 many deaths.

748
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,520
He says

749
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
he will always protect Xiao Tian.

750
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,920
And he likes him dearly.

751
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,680
Though your parents

752
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,340
ignore Ding Sheng,

753
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,500
their pride

754
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,860
is even greater than Xiao Tong's.

755
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,000
�면

756
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,020
because he is with him

757
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,660
even when he's far away.

758
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,260
Wan is so powerful

759
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,660
How about inviting her to be the coroner?

760
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,660
How do you feel, Lord Huo?

761
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,660
It's my honor to be the first to be the first

762
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,260
I'll send someone to capture Wei's family now

763
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,660
I'll leave first

764
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
I'm not as lucky as you

765
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,660
I won't let you down tonight

766
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,660
What about me? What can I do?

767
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Think about it

768
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,660
What are you thinking about?

769
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:51,660
Wife, do you trust the crown prince too much?

770
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,660
I don't trust him, I need his help

771
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,660
But he is the current emperor's nephew

772
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
If he knows your identity, then...

773
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,660
I'm always careful in front of him

774
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,660
He should not see any flaws

775
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,660
Besides, who said that the one who did it this morning

776
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Must be the daughter of the Shen family

777
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,660
Then this is a good thing

778
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,660
Yes, in our current situation

779
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,660
The more the better, the stronger the better

780
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,660

781
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,660

00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
Find me all the books of Shen Yi

783
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Why do you need those books?

784
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,660
I want to find out his true identity from his residence

785
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,660
I know why he is so respectful

786
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,660
And he is so interested in the prison

787
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,660
He, he, he, he

788
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,660
The fourth he is the ninth wife, right?

789
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,660
Are you interested in the ninth wife?

790
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Bai Feng, the moon is so beautiful tonight

791
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,660

The Marquis's house is investigating

804
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,660
Grandma, Xiaowan said that you are most worried and tired now

805

If the emperor asks about our An Yang and the Marquis's house

811
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Who can take responsibility?

812
