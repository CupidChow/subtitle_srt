1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
Well,

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,120
What are you doing?

4
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,480
How dare you kill me?

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
Yanzhi.

6
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,520
Yanzhi.

7
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,040
What are you doing?

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,920
You dare not.

9
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,920
You dare not.

10
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
How dare you?

11
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,360
Yanzhi, you dare not.

12
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,000
No. No.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Go.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Go.

15
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Yanzhi.

16
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
I won't let you die.

17
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
Why did you take the risk alone?

18
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,200
There is a command list in front of me.

19
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,440
I suspect Yanqi did it.

20
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,960
So I wanted to see what she was up to.

21
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,040
I didn't expect

22
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
she would be more bold and shameless than I thought.

23
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,160
Did they hurt you?

24
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,360
Do you think I'm innocent?

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,520
Of course not.

26
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,640
I think I didn't protect you well

27
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,880
that you were hurt.

28
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,480
Wan'er.

29
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
You don't have to think about anything now.

30
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,280
Just wait to be my bride.

31
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,920
I will pay back

32
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,240
the humiliation of Qin's clan.

33
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,640
I will pay back.

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,920
Your Highness.

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,760
Your Highness.

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,440
You...

37
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,160
What's wrong with you?

38
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,560
Are you hurt?

39
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,280
Why are you here?

40
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,560
You didn't come back for a night.

41
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,280
The Noble Consort was worried about you.

42
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
I thought

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
you might have been up

44
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,960
hunting at night.

45
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,440
I was afraid you might be in danger.

46
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,920
So I came to you.

47
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,160
You are...

48
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
Your Highness.

49
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

50
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,120
It turns out that Yanqi and Feng Chenbi

51
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,720
have been in love for a long time.

52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,160
I won't disturb you.

53
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,120
Let's go.

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,400
Your Highness.

55
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,680
You did that on purpose.

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,560
Your Highness.

57
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:17,120
Were you true to

58
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,840
my love?

59
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
Then, were you true

60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,640
to the Crown Prince too?

61
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,480
But

62
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,240
that you'd cut your hair off.

63
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,080
I would definitely take thatÃ­chat with me.

64
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,760
Fenchenbi,

65
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,760
stop pretending in front of me.

66
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
I know more clearly

67
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,700
what temperament

68
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,700
you have for Hua Pipi than you do.

69
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,880
I don't want your heart.

70
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,580
Why do you worry about my heart?

71
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,320
I just dumb MomENTO

72
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,920
Even if there's a chance to enter the Eastern Palace and become the Empress,

73
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,120
what's wrong with that?

74
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,920
Don't play this trick on me.

75
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Tell me.

76
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
Who sent you here?

77
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,120
Tell me!

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,320
No one!

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,320
You Feng family...

80
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
Seriously...

81
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
Your Highness.

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
As long as you marry me as the main concubine,

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,320
there are many things that we Feng family can do for you.

84
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,720
Anyway, I don't like Qin Zhaoyun.

85
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,320
You don't like the Crown Prince.

86
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
And that Yan Chi.

87
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,320
How can you fight them alone?

88
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,520
We can work together to deal with them.

89
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,120
There's only one.

90
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
There's only one Crown Prince.

91
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,120
Feng Chenbi really wants to be the Princess Consort.

92
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Your Highness.

93
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Your Highness.

94
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,320
I, Qin Xiang, greet Your Highness.

95
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,720
Your surname is Qin?

96
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,720
Then you and Qin Wan...

97
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,920
I dare not hide it from Your Highness.

98
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,520
I am Princess Yongci's Fifth Sister.

99
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:11,000
The Crown Prince's

100
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,320
You came here in the morning

101
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
to let your grandmother

102
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
taste your fried fish?

103
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Grandmother,

104
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,320
you're so ignorant.

105
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
This fish is called peach blossom fish.

106
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,120
It's only available when the peach blossoms bloom every year.

107
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,320
And it's the most delicious.

108
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,320
You hunt every year.

109
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,120
I've never heard of peach blossom fish.

110
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,320
This fish was caught by yourself.

111
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,320
Grandmother, if you like it,

112
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,920
I'll use it every year to show you my respect.

113
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,120
Show me your respect?

114
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,520
Not because of the fight with Qi yesterday?

115
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,520
Why bother you with this little thing?

116
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,120
Besides, I didn't really hurt him.

117
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,520
Then why are you so affectionate?

118
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Tell me the truth.

119
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,120
If you don't tell me the truth,

120
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,720
I won't eat your fried fish.

121
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,520
Then I'll tell you the truth.

122
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,320
I sincerely ask to marry Princess Yongci

123
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,720
to be the Crown Prince's concubine.

124
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,720
I hope you can agree to the marriage.

125
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,920
I mentioned the engagement to you the other day.

126
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,520
You rejected the idea.

127
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,120
Why do you beg Yongci today?

128
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,920
I dare not hide it from you.

129
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
Princess Yongci is addicted to the drug.

130
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,320
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

131
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm really a little impatient.

132
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,920
That's true.

133
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,520
But I asked Yongci to choose the engagement by himself.

134
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,920
You asked grandmother to grant you the engagement.

135
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,120
You should let her nod.

136
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,120
Otherwise, people will say that you're lying to her.

137
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
Grandmother.

138
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,520
Don't play tricks on me.

139
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,120
With your eyes,

140
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,320
can't you see that I've been in love with her?

141
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,120
If so,

142
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,120
I want to ask you.

143
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,120
Yongci is not an ordinary woman.

144
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,520
Can you guarantee that you won't betray her?

145
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
I, Yan Chi, swear here.

146
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,120
If I betray her,

147
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,520
I will never be worthy of being a member of the Yan family.

148
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,120
You're right.

149
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,920
Think it over after you make your decision.

150
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,620
Just once.

151
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
You can ask your brother to be in charge.

152
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,320
I'll see.

153
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,720
If you keep saying it,

154
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
he will be so severe,

155
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,120
he won't be able to live.

156
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,720
Father,

157
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Brother.

158
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,920
Brother.

159
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Your brother.

160
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm sorry for my father's mistake.

161
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,160
What mistake?

162
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,480
How?

163
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,600
The prince and the prince's son

164
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,640
fought for the treasure.

165
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
Tell them

166
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,680
where is the dignity of our family?

167
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,280
The imperial concubine is here.

168
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,400
Your Majesty.

169
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,480
Your Majesty.

170
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Your Majesty.

171
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,280
There is only one son in my family.

172
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,400
He died in an unknown way.

173
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,640
Please investigate it thoroughly.

174
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,000
Please help me.

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,200
The sword is blind.

176
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,440
How can I investigate it?

177
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,720
Then investigate the hunter.

178
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,960
Arrest them.

179
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,240
Ask them one by one.

180
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,840
You will find out the truth.

181
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,160
You are just fooling around.

182
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,640
I'm also a hunter.

183
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,760
It's inevitable that

184
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,000
I get hurt when hunting.

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,920
How can you and your Feng family

186
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,480
have a son?

187
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,800
You want to arrest me,

188
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,600
the prince and the prince's son

189
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
and interrogate them?

190
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,520
Enough.

191
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,400
It's just an accident.

192
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,600
Don't make any more trouble.

193
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,240
The result of the calculation

194
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,680
of the Sword of Qin has come out.

195
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,720
The eldest daughter of the Chinese arch enemy

196
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
and Qi Er

197
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,320
are a match made in heaven.

198
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,280
Impossible.

199
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,080
Impossible.

200
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm sure that...

201
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,840
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

202
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,480
The name of the sword was sent by Noble Consort Su

203
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,400
to the Sword of Qin.

204
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,560
You didn't kill anyone on the way.

205
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,760
There must be no mistake.

206
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,000
You and Lady Feng are very close.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,040
The crown prince knows it.

208
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,160
You don't admit it now.

209
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,840
How can I make you

210
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,160
to confess it?

211
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,040
I think that

212
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
the Prince of Cheng is not

213
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,800
a traitor who is looking for the Qin.

214
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,880
I will obey your order.

215
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,840
Good.

216
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,280
Since you agree,

217
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,600
I will give the crown prince and you

218
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,440
the order to get married.

219
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,920
You can get married soon.

220
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

221
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,800
Thank you, father.

222
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,680
Good.

223
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,360
You two get up.

224
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,200
Report.

225
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,960
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager has been sent.

226
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,120
Please play the music.

227
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,680
Good.

228
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,360
Good.

229
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,880
The Empress Dowager has also

230
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,640
arranged for my marriage.

231
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,800
Now, the palace is really

232
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,880
full of joy.

233
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,040
Good.

234
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,040
Sister Wu, you are hurt.

235
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,440
No.

236
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
No.

237
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,440
I just saw it.

238
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,240
Who did this?

239
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,040
Let's go find the nanny.

240
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,640
You don't need to care about my business.

241
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,840
If you dare to tell others,

242
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,640
don't blame me for not telling you.

243
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,240
Sister Wu.

244
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,040
Shut up.

245
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,640
Sister Wu.

246
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,040
Sister Wu.

247
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Sister Wu.

248
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Sister Wu.

249
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Sister Wu.

250
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Sister Wu.

251
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,240
I didn't expect

252
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,640
His Majesty would

253
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,440
let go of last night so easily.

254
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040
So what if he didn't let go?

255
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,840
Yan Qi is the culprit.

256
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,440
He wouldn't tell.

257
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,040
Feng Chenbi wouldn't tell either.

258
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
His Majesty

259
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,640
wouldn't find trouble on his own.

260
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,440
I think he wouldn't

261
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,840
be so afraid

262
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,240
of the feeling of

263
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,840
being forced to report.

264
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
I always feel

265
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,440
that he has a bigger plot.

266
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,240
I also have this concern.

267
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,440
Do you know

268
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,840
why Yan Qi didn't go to the old fort?

269
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
For the crown prince?

270
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,640
No.

271
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,840
What he wants

272
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,440
is the main force of the army

273
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,840
and the army.

274
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Liangzhou.

275
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,040
Ruoxi is the main force.

276
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,640
The black hand behind the food and clothing corruption case?

277
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,440
It's very likely that it's him.

278
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
It's also possible that it's the Crown Prince.

279
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,440
It's also possible

280
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,840
that it's His Majesty.

281
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,040
It's also possible

282
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
that it's His Majesty.

283
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,240
His Majesty wants the Shuoxi Army.

284
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,840
And my nephew

285
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
has touched His Majesty's counter-force.

286
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,240
Although I used the food and clothing corruption case

287
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,840
to defend His Majesty

288
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,240
and defend my father,

289
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,040
it's not a long-term plan.

290
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,840
Why don't you know

291
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,040
that you are doing this

292
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,840
to protect him and the Shuoxi Army?

293
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,440
He doesn't understand.

294
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,840
But in his heart,

295
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,040
a general should use his military power to defend the court.

296
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,240
And my plan

297
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,640
is just to play tricks.

298
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,040
In His Majesty's eyes,

299
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,240
I'm the altar that my father placed in the capital.

300
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,040
In his eyes,

301
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,440
I'm the son of the traitor who is greedy and afraid of death.

302
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,840
Don't interfere in the Prince Jin case anymore.

303
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Why?

304
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,040
Li Muyun has already doubted

305
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,640
the missing body of Prince Jin in the mansion.

306
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,240
But he didn't stop me from continuing to investigate.

307
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
I suspect that he found out my fault in the four seasons.

308
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
If His Majesty knows

309
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,240
that you are trying to turn the Prince Jin's case upside down,

310
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,040
I'm afraid that you will be in a more dangerous situation.

311
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Then I can't let you risk your life.

312
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,840
Besides, the Empress Dowager has already granted us the marriage.

313
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
From now on, we are husband and wife.

314
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,440
We can't be in a relationship anymore.

315
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,640
Wan'er, the road ahead is dangerous.

316
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,240
Are you willing to come with me?

317
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
I'm willing.

318
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm willing.

319
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,440
Summon the Zhao Yu of Qin,

320
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,040
Chen Bi of Feng,

321
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,640
Princess Yongci, please go ahead and listen to the decree.

322
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,200
I'm here to follow Empress Dowager's decree.

323
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,280
The daughter of the Marquis of Zhongyong, Qin Shu,

324
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,720
Zhao Yu of the Qin family,

325
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,560
her surname is Duanshu,

326
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,320
she is skilled in the imperial study.

327
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,920
Empress Dowager's decree is very clear.

328
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,280
She has specially appointed Crown Prince Yan Che

329
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,800
as the Crown Princess.

330
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,760
The daughter of the Marquis of Zhongyong, Feng Bingyi,

331
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,240
Feng Shi Chenbi,

332
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,840
she is well-known and well-respected.

333
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,640
She has specially appointed Prince Chen Yanqi

334
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,400
as the Princess Consort.

335
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,360
The daughter of the Marquis of Anyang, Yue Qiong,

336
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,040
Princess Yongci, Qin Wan,

337
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,480
she is well-educated and well-educated.

338
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,120
She has specially appointed

339
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,920
Crown Prince Yan Chi as the Princess Consort.

340
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,520
She is well-educated and well-respected.

341
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,240
That's all.

342
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

343
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,040
All wine is braised with tomato paste.

344
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,600
Steamed's here.

345
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,240
Find a seat.

346
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,220
How beautiful this place is!

347
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,760
Let's have a look over there.

348
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,000
The flowers are so pretty.

349
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,640
Yes.

350
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,480
Sister Wu, stop drinking.

351
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,680
Drinking is a serious crime.

352
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,920
Madam.

353
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
What if we make a big deal

354
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,600
to the House of Zhongyong

355
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
and Uncle and Aunt

356
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,800
will swallow us?

357
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,680
You're afraid of them.

358
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm not.

359
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,160
But one day,

360
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,840
I'll fly on the branch and draw a phoenix.

361
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,720
They'll kneel down to me.

362
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,920
Sister Wu, don't talk nonsense.

363
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,960
We need to have a leader to draw a phoenix.

364
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,320
Those princes are under His Majesty's control.

365
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,480
The officials are watching.

366
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,000
You can't reach anyone.

367
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,480
But don't think about...

368
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,800
Sister Wu.

369
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,440
Sister Wu.

370
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,680
Prince of Rui is a parrot.

371
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,760
Let's go.

372
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Let's go and have a look.

373
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,400
Brother Qi, is this a feast?

374
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,160
Aunt.

375
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,160
I'll have a feast.

376
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Please marry me

377
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,840
with your granddaughter Qin Wan.

378
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,560
Yes.

379
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,920
The Empress Dowager has given her decree, right?

380
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,400
What else can I say?

381
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,800
It's a big battle.

382
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,480
It's not easy.

383
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
With your sincerity,

384
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,280
fine.

385
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,120
I'll accept you as

386
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,440
my daughter-in-law.

387
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,600
Thank you, Aunt.

388
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,880
Your Majesty.

389
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm very happy

390
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
about this marriage.

391
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
It's good to be happy.

392
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,920
It's good to be happy.

393
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,880
If you're happy,

394
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I can

395
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,960
explain to Prince of Rui.

396
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

397
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,600
Report!

398
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,120
Your Majesty.

399
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,280
Your Majesty.

400
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,280
Your Majesty.

401
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,080
How dare you be so reckless?

402
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,760
Your Majesty.

403
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,520
Father.

404
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,440
stack up.

405
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,720
Father, sit down quickly.

406
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,400
Your Majesty.

407
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,400
What's wrong?

408
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,220
Your Majesty.

409
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,040
Mother.

410
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,040
Mother, get up.

411
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Do not look!

412
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,640
Your Majesty.

413
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,120
Your Majesty.

414
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:10,860
Your Majesty.

415
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,720
Get up, Your Majesty.

416
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,200
Your Majesty.

417
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,120
IGG Twitter

418
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,800
Mother.

419
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,720
What happens now?

420
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Hurry, help the Empress Dowager to go back to her room to rest.

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Hurry.

422
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Slow down, Huo Zong.

423
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This...

424
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yanxi.

425
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yan Qing, what happened?

426
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's...

427
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
King of Rui...

428
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
King of Rui's brother.

429
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
My brother...

430
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
is dead.

431
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
My King of Rui's brother.

432
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
King of Rui's brother.

433
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
My king...

434
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
is dead.

435
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
My King of Rui's brother.

436
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yanchi.

437
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yanchi.

438
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I am your Princess Consort.

439
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
No matter what happens,

440
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'll face it with you.

441
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,760
Remember it.

442
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,560
Will masters Has quit?

443
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,920
She will be fine.

444
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,960
Here comes His Majesty.

445
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,360
Alright, no need to be so formal.

446
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,440
How is the Empress Dowager?

447
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,880
Grandmother has not eaten any medicine

448
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,240
since she was born.

449
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,680
Yong Ze,

450
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,480
can you prove the Empress Dowager's innocence?

451
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
The Empress Dowager is still in the middle of the baby.

452
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,240
It's too dangerous to prove her innocence.

453
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,000
We can only use the medicine to cure her.

454
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,960
Wait outside the tent.

455
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,360
I'll go in and have a look.

456
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

457
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Greetings, Mother.

458
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,160
Mother,

459
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,560
I'm here to give you the medicine.

460
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,200
Mother,

461
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,200
you're so kind.

462
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,120
How can I be at ease?

463
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,920
Mother,

464
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,640
if the emperor leaves,

465
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,000
will you abandon me?

466
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,320
I'm

467
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,960
your biological son.

468
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,280
Bring Ling'er back to me.

469
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Don't worry, Mother.

470
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,600
I've ordered the groom to leave

471
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,520
and take the emperor back to the capital.

472
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,120
Mother.

473
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,720
Your Majesty,

474
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,720
you must keep your body.

475
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,680
Don't worry, Sister-in-law.

476
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,440
I'm here to take care of you.

477
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,520
You should go back and rest.

478
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,920
Thank you, Aunt.

479
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,840
Mother,

480
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,720
have a good rest.

481
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,400
I'll take my leave.

482
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,720
The End

483
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,200
Don't be afraid.

484
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,880
I'll be fine.

485
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,320
Ling'er,

486
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,920
spend more time

487
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,360
with me.

488
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,560
Yes.

489
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
Your Majesty.

490
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,480
Leave musicianså¿

491
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,760
to me.

492
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,240
Rong Jinzhen

493
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,760
will give you everything one- derechos that you ask to go through.

494
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,800
Your Majesty,

495
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,640
don't be nervous.

496
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,560
You have all department in the world now.

497
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,560
We're good to see that

498
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,640
you should be prepared to go though all hardships.

499
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,000
Damn foreigner.

500
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,600
You won't be able to go through any hardships.

501
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Are you okay?

502
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Where is Hang Zimeng?

503
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
I'm here.

504
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
I'll be fine.

505
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
I have to go and see my father's spirit wine.

506
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,720
I'll be following you.

507
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Go.

508
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
I'll wait for you to come back.

509
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Retreat!

510
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Retreat!

511
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Yan Chi,

512
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,720
now it's my turn to protect you.

513
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
I'll let everyone who hurts you

514
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
be punished.

515
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Bai Feng,

516
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,720
go to Yichuang directly after you return to the capital.

517
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
I want to protect Yan Shang.

518
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Yes.

519
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
You two,

520
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
come a little higher.

521
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Yes.

522
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Move faster.

523
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Bring these over.

524
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Yes.

525
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Princess, the medicine is ready.

526
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
I've made the medicine.

527
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Put the medicine in the bones.

528
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Clean up the body.

529
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Yes.

530
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Add three cups of wine and five cups of vinegar.

531
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
If you want to say something,

532
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
just say it.

533
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
I'll do it.

534
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
I'll do it.

535
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
I'll do it.

536
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
I'll do it.

537
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
If you want to say something,

538
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
just say it.

539
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Let me see.

540
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Retreat!

541
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Retreat!

542
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Retreat!

543
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Retreat!

544
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Retreat!

545
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Retreat!

546
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Father,

547
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
no king has allowed military power to run away.

548
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
His Majesty wants his army,

549
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
not the private army of King of Rui's Mansion.

550
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Now the battle of the Chuwei in the capital is fierce.

551
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
The army of Shuoxi is divided.

552
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
As long as you return to the capital with me,

553
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
as long as you don't see the heart of Yi Yu again,

554
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
you can protect the army of Shuoxi

555
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
from being trampled by the evil.

556
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Shut up!

557
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
His Majesty and I are blood brothers.

558
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
I'm not a traitor.

559
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm not a traitor.

560
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
His Majesty is a blood brother of Yi Mu's compatriot.

561
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
How can he talk about military power?

562
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Before His Majesty's expedition,

563
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
he entrusted Shuoxi to me.

564
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
He entrusted me

565
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
with the place of his father.

566
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
His Majesty has always been wise and kind.

567
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
He trusts me as if he were his own.

568
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
No matter how others provoke me,

569
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
as long as His Majesty

570
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
doesn't take back the tiger tally for one day,

571
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
I'll be there for him for one day.

572
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
But father,

573
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
people's hearts will change.

574
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
If His Majesty really doesn't trust you,

575
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
why don't you check the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Revenue first

576
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
and let me return to the Shuoxi Army

577
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
to investigate the corruption?

578
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Father,

579
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
I've seen it clearly in the capital these days.

580
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
His Majesty is thoughtful

581
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
and wise.

582
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Even the Empress Dowager and the Crown Prince

583
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
are alerted.

584
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Let alone you, his brother.

585
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
After so many years,

586
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
he is no longer the new emperor

587
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
who has just ascended the throne.

588
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Good.

589
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
His Majesty ordered you to investigate.

590
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
You can do it.

591
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Father has been a man of his word

592
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
and never gave up on his duty.

593
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
The military life of the Shuoxi Army

594
00:33:52,720 --> 00:34:08,700
can't be destroyed by a few

595
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
so go back to the capital as soon as possible.

596
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,700
Father,

597
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,700
it's not about investigating.

598
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
It's about His Majesty's heart of suspicion.

599
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
If you take advantage of military provisions

600
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
and go back to the capital with me to hand over the tiger tally,

601
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
His Majesty will investigate the corruption.

602
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,700
Shuoxi Army,

603
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
even without you,

604
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,700
there will be a new commander.

605
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Now the time is right.

606
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
It's the time for Rong Di to attack everywhere.

607
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Once he knows that

608
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
the Shuoxi Army has changed the commander,

609
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
the border will be occupied again.

610
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Father once

611
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
made a vow to the new emperor.

612
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,700
Rong Di didn't go to the capital for a day.

613
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,700
I will not leave Shuoxi for a day.

614
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,700
In the end,

615
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
I can't be that betrayer.

616
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,700
But father,

617
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
don't worry.

618
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
When father goes to the capital to meet the emperor,

619
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,700
I will return the tiger tally to His Majesty.

620
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Father,

621
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,700
now, no matter the emperor, the crown prince or the prince,

622
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
they all have the power to take advantage of Shuoxi Army.

623
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,700
The assassination of you and my father and son

624
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
must be one of them.

625
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Now His Majesty

626
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
values military power and is eager to defend the border.

627
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,700
But the provisions and provisions

628
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
are not as good as the crown prince and the prince.

629
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,700
Once the war starts again,

630
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,700
Shuoxi Army will be defeated by the enemy.

631
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
If you insist on your vow,

632
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,700
we will die in vain.

633
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,700
I will go back to the capital

634
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
as I have to suffer the punishment.

635
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,700
If the general dies in a battle,

636
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
it will be our destiny

637
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,700
for a day.

638
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
But why?

639
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
Why do you let me

640
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,700
and soldiers who have been with you

641
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,700
die in vain for your vow?

642
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,700
It's not destiny.

643
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,700
It's stupidity.

644
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,700
Get out!

645
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,700
I don't have a son like you

646
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
who is afraid of death.

647
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Father,

648
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
whether you like it or not,

649
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
you have to go home with me.

650
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Father.

651
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,700
Shuoxui!

652
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
Shuoxui!

653
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Shuoxui!

654
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,700
Shuoxui!

655
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,700
We can take out the body.

656
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
What's the smell?

657
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,700
What's the smell?

658
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,700
You want to vomit?

659
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,700
Yes.

660
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Officer Zhang, I'll tell you.

661
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Okay.

662
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Li Siqing,

663
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
this is where the princess fought.

664
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Princess.

665
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,700
May I ask

666
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
if this book

667
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,700
belongs to someone?

668
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
I read it in the book.

669
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Officer Zhan, remember.

670
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,700
There is a piece of purple-red blood

671
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,700
in the back of the dead's brain

672
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
which should have been beaten by a shielding machine.

673
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
The dead has a left and right hip.

674
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,700
The third and fourth joints of the left rib.

675
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,700
The left hand has ten thousand bones.

676
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
The right leg has a mirror bone.

677
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,700
There are red-red blood and blood stains

678
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
on the knees of the legs.

679
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
It must have been beaten by many people

680
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
and abused for a long time.

681
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,700
The right arm has a bone.

682
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,700
There are red-red blood and blood stains.

683
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,700
It should have been beaten by a big machine.

684
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
When fighting with people,

685
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
the power of the opponent is greatly increased.

686
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,700
Or it's caused by

687
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,700
turning over and down the horse and holding the ground.

688
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,700
But from the scars alone,

689
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
it can't prove the identity of the dead.

690
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
Except for the wounds of the dead,

691
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,700
the length of the dead's legs is also different.

692
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
The left and right joints of the dead are curved inward.

693
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,700
So when standing,

694
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
the right leg will seem to be a little longer than the left leg.

695
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,700
When the dead walks,

696
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
the left and right shoulders will swing up and down.

697
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,700
The dead's lower body is stable.

698
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
Usually,

699
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
the left leg is strong and the right leg is active.

700
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
It seems that

701
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,700
the dead is not an ordinary bandit or protector.

702
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
It should be the escort master

703
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
or the guard who has seriously practiced martial arts.

704
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
The dead is buried in the Prince Jin's mansion.

705
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
It's not random.

706
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
Zheng Fuying and Li Siqing

707
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
can follow the servants or guards of the Prince Jin's mansion

708
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,700
to find clues.

709
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
The files of the Prince Jin's mansion's rescuers

710
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
are all in Dali Temple.

711
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Li Siqing is going to trouble us.

712
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,700
But why

713
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
do we have to find out from Prince Jin's rescuers?

714
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,700
The Prince Qi's mansion was sealed for more than a year.

715
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,700
The time of the dead's death

716
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
is about a year.

717
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
It should have been buried in the backyard

718
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
when the Prince Qi's mansion was sealed.

719
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
The guards of the Prince Jin's mansion are all related.

720
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
Officer Zhang,

721
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
send the body back to the courier station.

722
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
When interrogation is done,

723
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
we will be the witnesses.

724
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
Princess,

725
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
there is a

726
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
scoundrel

727
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
who is a member of the Prince Jin's family.

728
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
His name is Song Xiwen.

729
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,700
But if

730
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
he is the body,

731
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
I'm afraid

732
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
the three of us can take the responsibility.

733
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
Why?

734
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,700
Because Song Xiwen

735
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
should have been

736
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
in the Imperial City Department.

737
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
The Imperial City Department?

738
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,700
Is it a place where the Imperial Palace is closed?

739
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Yes.

740
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
So why did he

741
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
escape from the Imperial City Department?

742
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Who killed him?

743
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
If we investigate,

744
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
I'm afraid we will involve many people.

745
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Since Song Xiwen is a guard of the Prince Jin's mansion,

746
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
why would he

747
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
escape from the Imperial City Department?

748
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
What crime did he commit?

749
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
Actually...

750
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
This is a crime.

751
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,700
I'm sorry.

752
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
I believe you know

753
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
that the more you hide it,

754
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
the more you will be exposed.

755
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,700
The more you hide it,

756
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
the more you will be exposed.

757
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Since the body is in a place

758
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,700
that shouldn't be,

759
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
we should report it to the Emperor.

760
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,700
Yes.

761
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
You are right.

762
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
We will do our best.

763
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
Thank you.

764
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
No need.

765
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
We will go to the Imperial City Department.

766
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Please.

767
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Yan Chi.

768
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
I finally found the place

769
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
where the Prince Jin's mansion is.

770
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
You must return safely.

771
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,700
Hurry.

772
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Your Majesty.

773
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
Prince Jin has sent

774
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
Prince Jin's spirit uncle to the capital.

775
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
Yan Chi

776
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,700
and Song Hai'an

777
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,700
were there when you summoned them.

778
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Prince Jin

779
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,700
is about to

780
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,700
leave the capital.

781
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,700
I'm afraid

782
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
that they will be in danger.

783
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
I'm afraid

784
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
that they will be in danger.

785
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,700
I'm afraid

786
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
that the Prince Jin

787
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
will only hand over

788
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
the Tiger Tally of Shuoxi Army

789
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
to His Majesty.

790
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,700
There's nothing else.

791
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,700
He finally returned.

792
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,700
He's back.

793
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,700
He's back.

794
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,700

00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,700
He's back.

800
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
He's back.

801
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,700
He's back.

802
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,700
He's back.

803
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,700
He's back.

804
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,700
He's back.

805
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,700
He's back.

806
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
He's back.

807
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,700
He's back.

808
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,700
He's back.

809
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,700
He's back.

810
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,700
He's back.

811
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,700
He's back.

812
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,700
He's back.

813
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,700
He's back.

814
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,700
He's back.

815
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,700
He's back.

816
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,700
He's back.

817
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,700
He's back.

818
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,700
He's back.

819
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,700
He's back.

820
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,700
He's back.

821
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,700
He's back.

822
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,700
He's back.

823
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,700
He's back.

824
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,700
He's back.

825
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,700
He's back.

826
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,700
He's back.

827
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,700
He's back.

828
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,700
He's back.

829
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,700
