Not the you.

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,080
Mister.

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,580
Give my daughter to you.

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,580
Let's go!

7
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:45,960
Be here until death!

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Make it quick!

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,000
Go!

00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,620
Please!

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,880
Should be arrested and promoted!

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,460
Quick!

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,120
Go!

Not scared?

Dad!

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,080
Be careful

00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,480
Here

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,960
There

Never offending

00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,280
Well,Dad,

30
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,980
It contains that

31
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,220
and even killed Uncle Qin and our family.

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,220
How could I not avenge my blood and my grief?

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,900
From now on, I am no longer Shen Wan.

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,500
I am now Uncle Qin's daughter, Qin Wan.

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,940
I will find a way to find out the truth

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,940
and seek justice for you.

37
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,940
The

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,940

The

The

41

The

42
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,940
Madam He, what do you mean by this?

43
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,940
Madam Qin,

44
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
it's all our fault for not being sensible when we were young

45
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,940
and for being so courteous with the Second Madam

46
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,940
and getting married to a family of a daughter.

47
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,940
Madam, can you make a decision

48
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,940
to cancel our engagement?

49
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,940
You really have been putting me in a difficult position.

50
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,900
Although we have not been separated from each other,

51
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
as the stepmother,

52
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,900
I can't interfere in the family affairs of the Second Madam.

53
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Yes.

54
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
Madam, you know

55
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,900
that I am not the only one who is related to Uncle Qin.

56
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
He has not been home for so many years.

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
I can't decide

58
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,900
on his daughter's marriage.

59
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
But the Second Madam died early.

60
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,900
The Ninth Madam has been raised in the Medicine King Valley.

61
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
I have been calling him for so many years.

62
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
I still don't know

63
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,860
what kind of temperament he has.

64
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,860
Madam, don't worry.

65
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,860
When Second Master returns,

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,860
I will discuss with him seriously

67
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,860
about the cancellation of our engagement.

68
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Our Zhongyong Marquis' Mansion

69
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,860
will not ruin

70
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,860
the marriage of our young people

71
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,860
because of a child's words.

72
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,860
This...

73
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Grandmother,

74
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,860
I have something to report.

75
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,860
What?

76
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,860
I have a question.

77
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,860
Why did you come back?

78
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,860
Why did he come back?

79
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
Qin Wan, the granddaughter,

80
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,860
greets Grandmother.

81
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,860
I, Fulin, greets Madam.

82
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Madam.

83
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
Mother,

84
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Fulin is the maid that serves the Ninth Lady.

85
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,860
I saw her

86
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
and raised my head.

87
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
Are you really the Ninth Lady?

88
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,820
Grandmother,

89
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
I am really Waner.

90
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
This is my father's seal.

91
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,820
Please have a look.

92
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
Cai He.

93
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Ini .

94
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Take this.

95
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,780
Yesterday I went back,

96
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
today I am back.

97
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
But now...

98
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,780
Grandmother had an accident on her way home.

99
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,380
Grandmother, this is really Second Uncle's private property.

100
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,780
You said that this is only a few years ago.

101
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,780
How come it's gone?

102
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,780
Oh, my poor son.

103
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,780
Old Madam, since there is something wrong at home,

104
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,280
then we won't disturb you anymore.

105
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,380
This jade pendant is not yours.

106
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,380
I'll take my leave.

107
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,980
This...

108
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,580
Hurry and send this jade pendant back.

109
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,580
This marriage cannot be postponed.

110
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,580
Hurry.

111
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,380
My poor son.

112
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,380
How can you just get married right away?

113
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,180
You're really not giving us any respect.

114
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,380
Madam! Madam!

115
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,380
Old Madam, my wife fainted!

116
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,780
Hurry and get a doctor!

117
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,780
Madam! Madam!

118
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,180
Madam, you scared me to death.

119
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,980
I thought you really fainted.

120
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,380
How can I end this without pretending to be fainted?

121
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,780
How did you come back so late?

122
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,180
Once you fainted, I was caught and asked by Old Madam.

123
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,180
What did they ask?

124
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,180
It's just that we made up that trick.

125
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,780
Replying to Old Madam,

126
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,180
the medicine valley's divine doctor said that Madam's body has already recovered.

127
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Second Master wanted to take Madam to the soul-sacrifice group.

128
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,580
But he didn't think that he would meet a storm on the way and the boat would turn.

129
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,380
Second Master was dragged away by a wave to save Madam.

130
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,580
When Madam woke up,

131
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,580
Second Master's body was already gone.

132
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,180
Madam had no choice but to ask someone to help save him.

133
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,380
She had to endure the pain and the hunger to come back.

134
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,980
Fortunately, Second Master and they are not close.

135
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
They haven't seen Madam for many years.

136
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,580
Otherwise, it would be hard to protect them.

137
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,380
That's good. Tell me, what's going on with that engagement?

138
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,980
That was fixed by our Madam before she died.

139
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,980
At that time, Sir Huo was just a little immortal.

140
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,780
They must have wanted to use this marriage to get married to the Marquis of the Qin family.

141
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,580
Later, Second Master took Madam to the soul-sacrifice group to treat her.

142
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,980
After she passed away last year, Second Master was too sad and didn't inform the Qin family.

143
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,180
Now that Sir Huo has become the Governor of the Qin family,

144
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,780
they must not be interested in this marriage.

145
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,780
What a group of betrayers.

146
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
That's even better.

147
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,380
Without this marriage, we can plan better in the future.

148
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,180
But if we get rejected and the Qin family is humiliated,

149
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Madam won't dare to offend the House of Huo.

150
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,180
She will use me to vent her anger.

151
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,780
You must be careful in the future.

152
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,780
Don't worry, Madam. I was sold to the Qin family since I was little.

153
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,380
I have experience in dealing with them.

154
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,180
Yesterday, I was at the place where Buddha was worshiped.

155
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,580
I am here in Puan. I have no records.

156
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,780
Yesterday, I was at the place where Buddha was worshiped.

157
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,580
I am here in Puan. I have no records.

158
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,780
Madam Chenyin thought I was bad-tempered.

159
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,780
She deliberately did this magic.

160
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,980
How could Madam do this?

161
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,180
This is too much.

162
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
What are you doing?

163
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,180
Madam ordered me to discuss with the House of Huo.

164
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,980
She wants to sell me out.

165
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,580
I will be in charge of the house.

166
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,580
It's not your turn to do anything.

167
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,180
You just entered the house for a few hours.

168
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,980
You dare to say what I said?

169
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,180
Do you still think of your elders?

170
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,780
I dare not. Please calm down.

171
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,580
I have travelled thousands of miles with you.

172
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,180
I have been ungrateful to you.

173
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,580
Please forgive me for the sake of her young and ignorant.

174
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,380
Please forgive her this time.

175
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,180
I am wrong. I dare not speak nonsense.

176
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,380
Please forgive me.

177
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,180
Madam, the magic has just begun.

178
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,780
It's not urgent to deal with them now.

179
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,180
Why don't we talk about it later?

180
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,980
Fine.

181
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
You have done a great service to the house.

182
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,980
I will spare you this time.

183
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,580
Jiu Jian'er was taught by the servants.

184
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,580
From today on, you will be in the house

185
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,580
praying for your parents.

186
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,380
Xue Yue Li will be here for a year.

187
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,580
When you are ready,

188
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,580
you can come out to see her.

189
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,580
Thank you for your kindness, grandmother.

190
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,580
It's all my fault.

191
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,780
It's fine. It's not your fault.

192
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,580
If Madam wants to punish me,

193
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,580
she has a reason.

194
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,580
Fuling, Madam Jiu is my best friend in the Medicine King Valley.

195
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,780
I am like her.

196
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,580
I see you as a sister, not a servant.

197
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,180
So you don't have to call yourself a servant in front of me.

198
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
Madam.

199
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,980
But without Yue Li,

200
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,980
how can we live this year?

201
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,580
Don't worry.

202
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,580
Madam will not starve to death

203
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
even for her good name.

204
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,180
Uncle, you and my parents

205
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,580
told me not to take revenge.

206
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,780
But to kill your real brother,

207
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,580
I couldn't live in peace.

208
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,380
Please forgive me for taking advantage of my sister's life.

209
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,580
I was too reckless.

210
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,380
Master, don't worry.

211
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,580
I will listen to you and take good care of Madam.

212
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,580
I will never leave.

213
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,580
The End

214
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,780
Your brother, Zhong Yonghou,

215
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,380
is now in the capital.

216
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,780
He is very important to the Crown Prince.

217
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,180
You should walk with him more often.

218
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,580
Find a position for Chen.

219
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,380
Don't be a fool in the backyard all day.

220
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,380
Brother, how can you talk to me like that?

221
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,180
Although they are all the same father,

222
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,580
they are the legitimate son of the original master.

223
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,380
I was born in the right time.

224
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,580
I'm not like them.

225
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Mother.

226
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,980
So what?

227
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,380
Eight taels of silver.

228
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,580
Then she should call me mother.

229
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,180
This house is not

230
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,780
still dependent on you to support the family.

231
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,380
Don't be so angry all day.

232
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,980
No one knows you are raised by the Ji family.

233
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,780
The child is so big.

234
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,980
Why are you so disheveled?

235
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,580
Father, don't make grandmother angry.

236
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,380
Listen to grandmother's arrangement.

237
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,980
Go away.

238
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,780
Madam, Madam Jiu is here to greet you.

239
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,380
I won't see her.

240
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,580
Madam, today is the second master's death day.

241
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,180
Madam Jiu went to worship early in the morning and just came back.

242
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,980
You should see her.

243
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,180
Madam, you come.

244
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Just...

246
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,780
Aunt ballet attire.

247
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,180
When I graduated in junior high,

248
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,780
I also had followers in Kardashian and socialness.

249
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,980
But you failed in the third master.

250
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,180
Your father is so stubborn.

251
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,280
He is not this type of old man but you're doing this to yourself.

252
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,180
Launch theуд is useless.

253
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,180
Let's become Taylor-ka leftovers.

254
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,380
Didn't you find the witness to prove that he killed Consort Jin?

255
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
Why did he kill himself?

256
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,620
It's still that...

257
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,260
Da Li Si Qing was...

258
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,460
Shen Yi's doing it.

259
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,980
Mother, I heard that

260
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,100
the murder weapon of Prince Jin

261
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,900
was also hidden by him.

262
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,660
If it wasn't for his disciple called Li Mu Yun,

263
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,020
who was making the report,

264
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,500
he and Prince Jin

265
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,620
would have been in cahoots.

266
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,300
Shen Si Qing

267
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,820
is known as Shen Qing Tian.

268
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,900
He's a famous officer who committed a crime.

269
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,500
How could he help Prince Jin

270
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,980
to commit such a crime?

271
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,460
It's really unbelievable.

272
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,300
What do you know about official matters?

273
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,540
If Shen Yi is an officer,

274
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,620
why would he run away with his family?

275
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,660
I heard that His Majesty

276
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,660
was angry because he escaped for the crime.

277
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,100
He was so angry that he killed himself.

278
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,420
But it's useless to run away.

279
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,100
I heard that he met with a big storm.

280
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,580
The whole family died.

281
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,700
What Shen Qing Tian?

282
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,140
I don't know how many people

283
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,460
he met with.

284
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,460
This is the most honorable and the most glorious thing.

285
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,340
There's no such thing as a big storm.

286
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,780
Shen Yi was just thinking.

287
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,060
He did some good things

288
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,660
and did something that made him famous.

289
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,740
He's just a regular officer.

290
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,660
After all, he's a famous officer.

291
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,540
Mother, you're right.

292
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,100
What are you doing?

293
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,060
What are you doing?

294
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,220
My father would never collude with Prince Jin.

295
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,980
Who framed him?

296
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,420
Was it Lin Mu Yun or...

297
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,500
Why did His Majesty trust people?

298
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,620
Why did Prince Jin kill himself?

299
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,740
What's the reason?

300
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,700
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,420
No. I have to go into the capital.

302
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,020
I have to go into the capital immediately.

303
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,660
Old Madam is tired.

304
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,260
I'll call someone to take us back.

305
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,820
It's rare to be so free.

306
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,100
If His Lordship knows about this,

307
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,260
I won't go out again.

308
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,140
Think about it.

309
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,820
I'll go with His Lordship to the capital.

310
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,300
Old Madam.

311
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,260
Old Madam.

312
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,660
Old Madam, what's wrong?

313
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,380
Old Madam, wake up.

314
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,900
This young lady, go and get a doctor for me.

315
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,620
Old Madam.

316
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,180
Young lady, you should hurry and send a message to your family.

317
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,100
Old Madam.

318
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,860
It can't be.

319
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,900
My old madam was fine just now.

320
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,380
Please find a doctor for me.

321
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,900
Old Madam.

322
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,580
Put her on Pingtang Island.

323
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,820
Hurry.

324
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,340
Your old madam has old-age phlegm.

325
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,100
She was seriously ill half a year ago.

326
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,620
Her body is weak.

327
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,860
Her tongue is rough.

328
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,740
Her pulse is weak.

329
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,460
She's a phlegm doctor with old age.

330
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,740
Yes.

331
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,700
Remember my method.

332
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,620
Call for the doctor right away.

333
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,020
Yes, okay.

334
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,500
Give me a pen.

335
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,820
Carry on.

336
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,020
Prepare a funeral for the old lady within a day.

337
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,820
Thank you.

338
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,660
My lady, where have you been?

339
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,940
I told sister Cai and me that you lost your purse and went to look for it.

340
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,780
The old lady was so angry when she saw you this morning.

341
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,260
She punished you for being grounded again.

342
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,620
Fulin, I'm not a Qin Wan.

343
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,340
My lady, you can't say that again.

344
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,580
My father didn't collude with the King of Jin.

345
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,180
And he didn't escape for the crime.

346
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,740
He and my mother were killed by someone.

347
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,020
I saw it with my own eyes.

348
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,220
I know that.

349
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,220
Mr. Shen is a good official who is always on the watch.

350
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,620
So those who slander him and frame him up will not end well.

351
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,180
I'm going to the capital.

352
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,380
Find my parents' body.

353
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,460
To clear their name.

354
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,860
Okay.

355
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,140
I'll go to beg the old lady.

356
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,620
Let her let us go to the capital.

357
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,500
She won't let us leave.

358
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,380
I'll figure it out myself.

359
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,060
But I can't take you to the capital.

360
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,180
My father and King of Jin's case are more serious than I thought.

361
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,740
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

362
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,340
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

363
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,140
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

364
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,340
Sister Wan'er, you'd better stay here.

365
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,140
Sister Wan'er, since I came to the valley of medicine,

366
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,900
you taught me how to take care of the ninth lady.

367
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,820
After the death of the ninth lady,

368
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,020
you helped me stay by my side.

369
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,620
I know that I'm not capable enough.

370
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,100
I can't do you a favor.

371
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,260
But I can stay with you.

372
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,820
I can take care of you.

373
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,300
And I swore in front of Mr. Shen.

374
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,060
I'll go to the capital to find you even if I have to leave.

375
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,900
Get up.

376
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,900
Didn't we agree to never cry again?

377
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,660
I promise you.

378
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,940
We'll never be apart in this life.

379
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,140
Let's go.

380
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,980
Grandmother, these fabrics are good.

381
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,140
But they're still not as good as the one you're wearing.

382
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,780
The gold dragon sands.

383
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,340
You know how to choose.

384
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,900
That's the one that was bestowed by the Marquis of Zhongyong.

385
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,860
It's the same as the one in our three rooms.

386
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,380
You're the one who can choose.

387
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,140
I'll go.

388
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,900
Grandmother.

389
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,500
Marquis Anyang is the most noble family in the whole Jinzhou.

390
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,900
It's rare to invite us for the wedding banquet.

391
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,540
You're dressed better

392
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,420
to make our family look more glorious.

393
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,620
I don't understand your little mind.

394
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,700
Forget it.

395
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,780
Let your mother sew some beautiful dresses.

396
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,860
You must dress well.

397
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,260
You're being too bold.

398
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,260
If you can get the princess's approval,

399
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,180
you'll be able to get a good marriage.

400
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,860
Xiang, thank grandmother.

401
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,460
Thank you, grandmother.

402
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,460
You're so nice to me.

403
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,900
I don't understand you.

404
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Madam.

405
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,020
Princess Yongning from Marquis Anyang's mansion is here to visit you.

406
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,060
Come in, please.

407
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
Come in.

408
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Greetings, Princess Yongning.

409
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,260
Madam, please get up.

410
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,460
You don't have to stand up.

411
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,060
Madam, please sit down.

412
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,260
Princess, please.

413
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,860
Princess Yongning, what brings you here today?

414
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
Lv Xiu.

415
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
I, Lv Xiu,

416
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,060
am here to thank you for saving my life.

417
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,660
Jiu Yatao?

418
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,460
Come here.

419
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
It's okay.

420
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,460
I'll do it myself.

421
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
I'll do it myself.

422
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
I'll do it myself.

423
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
I'll do it myself.

424
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,460
I'll do it myself.

425
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,460
I'll do it myself.

426
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,460
I'll do it myself.

427
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
I'll do it myself.

428
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
I'll do it myself.

429
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
I'll do it myself.

430
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,460
Give me one.

431
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Jiu Niangzi.

432
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
Jiu Niangzi.

433
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
Come here.

434
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,860
Go to the room in your clothes.

435
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,660
Princess Yongning from Marquis Anyang's mansion

436
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,860
is here to thank you for saving her life.

437
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,060
Princess Yongning?

438
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,460
I haven't saved any princess.

439
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,860
A few days ago, did you treat Madam Weiwei on the street?

440
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,860
That old lady is the old woman of Marquis Anyang's mansion.

441
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,260
The eldest princess.

442
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,460
Princess Yongning is the granddaughter of the eldest princess.

443
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,860
She brought her grandmother to the mansion to thank her.

444
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,260
You two, stop working.

445
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Come and take Jiu Niangzi's water bucket.

446
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
Hurry.

447
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,460
Please take a step first, Miss Cai He.

448
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,060
I'll be there soon.

449
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,060
Yes.

450
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,060
Madam, you saved the eldest princess.

451
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
She's His Majesty's aunt.

452
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,660
I just thought she was rich.

453
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,460
I never thought her status was so high.

454
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,460
In this way, we can go back to the capital soon.

455
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,460
Then go change your clothes.

456
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,660
No.

457
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,460
I'll wear this.

458
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,460
I want to show Princess Yongning

459
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,460
how I'm doing in the Qin's Mansion.

460
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
Greetings, Grandmother.

461
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,860
She's wearing so shabby.

462
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,860
She really embarrassed the Qin's Mansion.

463
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,460
Xiaojiu, why are you so late?

464
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,860
Hurry and greet Princess Yongning.

465
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,260
No need to be so polite.

466
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,860
Does Jiu Niangzi still remember her?

467
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
It's you.

468
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,260
I'm the eldest princess.

469
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260
It's you.

470
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Is your old madam still in good health?

471
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
I'm glad that you're in time.

472
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,860
My eldest princess is much better.

473
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,860
I came to thank you.

474
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,860
What medical skills does she know?

475
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,860
It's just a coincidence.

476
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,860
Jiu Niangzi, I never saw you

477
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,860
mention what happened that day.

478
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
Look.

479
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,860
Miss Lv Xiu has been looking for you for days.

480
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,860
It's enough that she's right.

481
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,860
Jiu Niangzi, come with me.

482
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,860
My grandmother is waiting for you to get her checked.

483
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Since the princess came to see me in person,

484
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,460
you must serve the eldest princess well.

485
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,660
You mustn't cause any trouble.

486
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,860
Princess, I also want to go and greet the eldest princess.

487
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,060
Why are you going?

488
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,660
My grandmother doesn't know you.

489
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
I...

490
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,260
Jiu Niangzi, please.

491
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,260
Mother.

492
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Okay.

493
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,660
What are you looking at, princess?

494
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,060
You're so young.

495
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,060
I've never seen such a young doctor.

496
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
I'm still learning medical skills.

497
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,060
I'm not an adult.

498
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,260
Moreover, I grew up in the Medicine King Valley.

499
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,860
I have the same education and training.

500
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,260
I naturally have different knowledge.

501
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,260
So you're a genius in medical skills?

502
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
Just in time!

503
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,260
I'm a genius in martial arts.

504
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,860
My father said that if I were a boy,

505
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
I would definitely be able to fight the evil spirits.

506
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
I'm not a child anymore.

507
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,060
If I were a girl, I would definitely be much stronger than my brothers.

508
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,460
My father often said that I'm a girl.

509
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,460
Otherwise, I would be the pillar of the country.

510
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Then we are geniuses.

511
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,260
We're geniuses!

512
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
We finally met the cause.

513
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,860
You haven't paid yet.

514
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,460
Your Highness, you can't take it.

515
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,860
Get lost!

516
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
Your Highness, you're bullying me.

517
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,060
Your Highness, there are old people here waiting for money to buy medicine.

518
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,060
Your Highness, what's wrong with you?

519
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,660
You're bullying me. Get lost!

520
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,260
Get lost!

521
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,460
Your Highness, come down.

522
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
The Shu Qi Army is here!

523
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,260
Get lost!

524
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,260
It looks like the soldiers of Shan Mo battlefield.

525
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,060
They're all so fierce.

526
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,860
They're different from the soldiers of Ge Zhou.

527
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,060
They're the black armor of the Shu Qi Army.

528
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,260
The Shu Qi Army fought in the battle of Xiu Fen.

529
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:09,520
They're the enemies of the

530
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,020
Stop!

531
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,460
Who are you?

532
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,460
The Shu Qi Army rules.

533
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,660
The place where they come from is the place where the people are.

534
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,460
The one who breaks the rules will be beheaded.

535
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,860
The money that was stolen will be used as a means of profit.

536
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,260
The one who breaks the rules will be beheaded.

537
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,460
Beheaded?

538
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,860
You're a soldier of the Shu Qi Army. How is that related to the soldiers of Jin Zhou?

539
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,460
You're a traitor.

540
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,260
If you don't obey the order, you'll be beheaded.

541
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,860
How dare you!

542
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,260
You deserve to be bullied by the people.

543
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,860
Give his body to the chief of the army.

544
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,460
Tell him that if he doesn't manage his own army well,

545
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
I, Yan Chi, will take care of it for him.

546
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,860
Yes!

547
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,860
My lord.

548
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,660
Thank you, my lord.

549
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,860
This is the young general of the Shu Qi Army?

550
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,860
My cousin, the legendary warrior, Yan Chi.

551
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,060
He entered the army at the age of ten.

552
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,860
He's been working hard since he was fifteen.

553
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,260
How is he? Isn't he great?

554
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,060
He's really great.

555
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,660
Thank you, my lord.

556
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,460
Old Madam.

557
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,260
Old Madam, the Crown Prince is back.

558
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,260
Grand Aunt Gu,

559
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Xiao Qi greets you.

560
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,060
Old Huan Tong, you're still not getting any younger.

561
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,060
Come here.

562
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,260
I'm not getting any younger.

563
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,460
I'm not getting any younger.

564
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,660
I'm not getting any younger.

565
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,060
Come here.

566
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,260
The Shu Qi Army has a lot of military affairs.

567
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,860
How can your father be at ease to let you come here?

568
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,260
Then, Grand Aunt Gu will guess.

569
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,260
You must have sneaked here, right?

570
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,460
You really can't hide anything from me.

571
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,660
Father and I had some differences in military affairs.

572
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,060
I couldn't get over it and came back.

573
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,460
Your father hit you again?

574
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,260
Why does your father not understand?

575
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,060
Father and son are laughing.

576
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,460
I'm used to it.

577
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,260
It's just your mother died too early.

578
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,860
Your father only has you as his son to accompany him.

579
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,460
You're just seeing him being lonely for the rest of his life.

580
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,660
Give him some space.

581
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,860
He doesn't need me to give him space.

582
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,060
In his heart, I'm afraid that my son

583
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,860
is not even as good as the Shu Qi Army.

584
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,260
Brother Qi!

585
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,060
It's been years since we last met. You're getting more and more arrogant.

586
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,260
In the world, that's called being decisive and decisive.

587
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,660
You're very dangerous.

588
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,260
Grand Aunt.

589
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,060
You've grown so tall.

590
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,260
Let Brother Qi see if your teeth are growing.

591
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,460
Don't call me a toothless.

592
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,860
My teeth have already grown.

593
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,260
Brother Qi, why are you leaving?

594
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,060
You look down on me.

595
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,060
I think this lady is a bit familiar.

596
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,860
This is the Ninth Lady of the Qin family. How can you recognize her?

597
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,260
Greetings, First Princess.

598
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,460
You are the Ninth Lady of the Qin family?

599
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,860
Come here.

600
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,660
Little Fairy,

601
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,660
Little Fairy,

602
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,460
stay away from them.

603
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Don't let those two monkeys hurt you.

604
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,660
A few days ago, I made a mistake on the street.

605
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,060
Fortunately, you were there to help me.

606
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,460
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to see her grandmother.

607
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,260
You saved her on the street.

608
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,260
May I ask where you are?

609
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,260
I grew up in the Medicine Valley.

610
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,660
The medicine valley is full of medical patients. They all work for me.

611
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,860
So, my grandmother called you Little Fairy.

612
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,260
Xiao Qi,

613
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,460
how long can you accompany me to Jingzhou?

614
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,660
Don't worry, Grandmother.

615
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,060
I will definitely have a good meal and drink at my cousin's wedding.

616
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,460
That's right.

617
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,660
By the way, Little Fairy,

618
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,860
you must come to my great-grandson's wedding.

619
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,460
I will send you an invitation.

620
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,860
Thank you, First Princess.

621
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,460
It's just that I haven't been able to see my father for three years.

622
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,060
We are a family of generals.

623
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,260
I don't mind.

624
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,660
Just treat it as you talking to me.

625
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,660
We will close the door and eat and drink.

626
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,660
Okay, I will listen to you.

627
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,860
But you have to listen to me today.

628
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,460
It's getting late. I should be giving you acupuncture.

629
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,460
Okay.

630
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,460
I will go out with Brother Qi to practice.

631
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,660
I still have to accompany Grandmother.

632
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,860
When you are giving acupuncture, you must not let the others be there.

633
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,660
Do you hear me? Let's go.

634
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,060
I...

635
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,860
Madam!

636
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,060
Madam, look! I got new clothes!

637
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,660
This is great! I don't need to wear a real dress anymore.

638
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,660
This room is too big.

639
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,260
Madam, why are you unhappy?

640
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,460
It sounds like the Qing Lan House is the best house in the Qin Manor.

641
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,660
But it's ours now. It's like a dream.

642
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
These are not mine.

643
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,060
What's there to be happy about?

644
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,860
Ninth Girl!

645
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,660
Ninth Girl!

646
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,660
Third Madam.

647
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,060
Ninth Madam!

648
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
Ninth Girl, how is it?

649
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,460
This house is very nice.

650
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,060
Thank you, Third Madam.

651
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,860
Call me Third Aunt.

652
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,660
Third Aunt.

653
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,460
Look at our Ninth Girl.

654
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,660
Her voice is so sweet.

655
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,260
Her appearance and body shape are the best in Jingzhou.

656
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,660
No wonder the Eldest Princess likes you so much.

657
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Your Third Aunt and I are busy all year

658
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,260
with our work.

659
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,460
We forgot to bring you all these things.

660
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,260
Look. Do you like them?

661
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,260
I don't need that much. Keep it.

662
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,060
Change it.

663
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,860
When you're dressed up tomorrow,

664
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,260
the Eldest Princess will be happy.

665
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,660
Thank you, Third Aunt.

666
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,860
We're a family. Don't be so formal.

667
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,260
Okay. I won't bother you with your work.

668
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
Come. Come. Come. Come. You all come with me.

669
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,060
Put all these over there.

670
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,860
Put them here.

671
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,460
Yes. Yes. Put them there.

672
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,260
This child is so nice.

673
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,060
The Ninth Girl

674
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,860
Greetings, Your Highness.

675
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,060
Greetings, Aunt.

676
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,460
Greetings, Your Highness.

677
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,260
Xiaoqi, you're not sitting in the front hall.

678
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,860
Why did you come here?

679
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,660
Look. You've made the girl so close.

680
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,860
It's my first time meeting the Ninth Girl.

681
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,860
Why do you seem to be afraid of me?

682
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,460
I saw that you were very skilled in martial arts.

683
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,860
You have a strict duty. I'm very proud of you.

684
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,860
I'm a fierce soldier.

685
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,860
I only fight against my enemies. I won't hurt innocent people.

686
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,460
Thank you for protecting Wei State.

687
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,260
May you be safe.

688
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,260
Enough. Enough.

689
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,860
You, go sit in the front hall.

690
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,660
Okay? You two are here.

691
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,060
You're so polite. I'm so tired.

692
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,060
The Song family's team hasn't arrived yet. Let me sit with you.

693
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,060
Why hasn't it arrived yet?

694
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,060
It's past the auspicious time. I'm not at ease.

695
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,860
Go. Go. Go. Go outside and take a look.

696
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,660
Go. Go. Go and take a look.

697
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,660
Yes, Aunt Gu.

698
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,260
Girl, come.

699
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,060
Sit.

700
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,260
I say, you are a child.

701
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,260
You are obviously a straightforward person.

702
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,260
But why are you so worried?

703
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,860
How did you know?

704
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,460
I'm already at such a young age. If I had known better,

705
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,260
wouldn't I have lived in vain?

706
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,860
Actually, what kind of life do you have in the Qin family?

707
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,660
When I was looking for you, I already asked around.

708
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,860
No wonder you were so straightforward.

709
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,060
Fortunately, we have a fate.

710
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:46,060
From now on, I can protect you as much as I can.

711
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:51,460
So that you won't look like an old woman.

712
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,260
You'll be happy.

713
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
Thank you, Princess Royal.

714
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,660
With your words, no matter how much I feel wronged,

715
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,060
I'll be able to smile and leave.

716
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,860
Father, I was ordered to welcome you.

717
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,260
I'm returning safely.

718
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,060
I, Wei Yanzhi, was ordered by Duke of Song to send you off.

719
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,660
I've already safely arrived.

720
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,260
You've worked hard on your journey.

721
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,660
Jia'er, you've also worked hard.

722
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,260
The bride is here.

723
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,660
Please, Prince.

724
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,460
Please, Prince.

725
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,060
The bride has arrived.

726
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,660
Please, Prince.

727
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
Please, Madam.

728
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,460
он

729
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,460
Welcome my son to is your'.

730
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,060
Peace would wholehearted and enthalpy gone.

731
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,380
His smell and kindness was fully Freemansh.

732
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,260
Please, Madam.

733
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:24,820
Finally.

734
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,120
The time has come.

735
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,460
Crown prince, please lead the Sundian Flower premorium.

736
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:30,260
So cold, so warm

737
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:37,260
If a dust falls into the shadow

738
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:44,260
The wind and snow fall, and my body is white

739
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:51,260
If a deep love is engraved in my heart

740
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:57,260
The pain will also be painfully love

741
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Open your heart, love doesn't matter the deep sea

742
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:11,260
Please grant me courage, let fate be open

743
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Don't be afraid of the starlight being covered by the night sky

744
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:26,260
The stars will shine beyond the sky

745
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:38,260
Like dust, but the color of the starlight

746
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:57,260
The sky is dark, the moon is bright

747
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:05,260
The moon is bright, the moon is bright

748
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:13,260
The moon is bright, the moon is bright
