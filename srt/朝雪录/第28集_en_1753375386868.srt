00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Xiao Wang, that was so scary.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,400
I heard from Yan Li that that Minister Li is really hard to deal with.

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,600
If he comes to the Emperor and slaps you,

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,000
you won't be able to walk freely in the Ministry of Justice anymore.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,800
Let's just force him to do it.

8
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
I should be more cautious.

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,000
I can't drag you and Yan Li into danger anymore.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In the past, I was used to being alone.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I didn't think about others too much.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,800
From now on, I can't drag you into danger anymore.

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,400
How can I be dragged into danger so easily?

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,600
Moreover, I am willing to be dragged into danger.

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
But I feel bad.

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Xiao Wang, since the first day I met you,

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,600
I knew that you are different from other women.

18
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I only wish that you never need to be so arrogant.

19
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000
You should always be forward.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,600
If you are afraid that you will get me involved,

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
you will really let me down.

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
I can say this.

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,000
I am really a friend that is hard to find in the world.

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Ning'er, actually,

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,200
I am not Qin Wan.

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,400
I am Shen Yi's daughter, Shen Wan.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
You...

28
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,200
Then, Brother Qi...

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
He already knew.

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,200
You...

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
I hid my identity to help my father fulfill his wish.

32
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
Are you crazy?

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,400
Can you say something like that?

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Because you are sincere to me,

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
I don't want to sell you.

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,400
Then, I don't want to know such a big secret.

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,200
It is very tiring to keep a secret.

38
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Moreover, what you smile has nothing to do with me.

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,800
If you change your surname, are you not you anymore?

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
I am still me.

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
The first time you knew me, it was me.

42
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,600
That's enough.

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,400
I will pretend that I never heard of this.

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
From now on, what should we do, what should we do?

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,600
For the sake of...

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,800
Your father is a good official.

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,200
I won't hide my grudge from you for telling me this secret.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Then, Yan Li...

49
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
You can't tell him.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,200
What if he gets drunk and accidentally tells it?

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,400
Then, I will tell you another secret.

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,600
Actually, I am older than you.

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Qin Xiao Wan Er!

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
You...

55
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,600
You kept me busy for so long!

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,000
What's wrong with you?

57
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,400
The Ministry of War wants to put the responsibility on those who are in the transport division.

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,800
Prince Cheng is handling the Ministry of War.

59
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
This is mostly his idea.

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
Immediately send a message to the Ge Clan.

61
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,400
Check the army of Shuoxi.

62
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
Who is the person who has a relationship with the Department of Transport in the northwest?

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,600
It's not easy to find a scapegoat to get there.

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,000
Master, you suspect that there is a mole in the Shuoxi Army?

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,800
If there is no mole,

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
how can we transport the grain of the Shuoxi Army

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,600
with those transport division?

68
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,200
Then, do you want to tell the Prince about this?

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Father treats all the soldiers in the village as brothers.

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,600
If I tell him that I want to investigate the Shuoxi Army,

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
do you think he will believe me or scold me?

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,200
I will do my best to protect the city.

73
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
Master.

74
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,000
Go.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
For the sake of the brothers of the Shuoxi Army

76
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,200
and the people of the border,

77
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
do what we should do.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
Yes.

79
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,600
Hu Dequan is responsible for the army and the army.

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,200
He usually lives in the backyard to guard the military drill.

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,000
I never thought that he would be frozen in the military drill.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
Has anyone been frozen in the scene?

83
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
No.

84
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
After the previous owner of the prison found the dead,

85
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,600
he reported the case immediately.

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,200
No one entered during that time.

87
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
When you came,

88
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,200
the first door of the military drill was opened.

89
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Yes.

90
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Hurry up. Put this footprint in.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,600
Is this the footprint of the deceased?

92
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
No.

93
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,200
According to the clothes of the deceased and the soil marks of the blood,

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,400
the murderer should have dragged the deceased in when he was killed outside.

95
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,600
The first door was opened for a long time.

96
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,400
The ice at the door melted into water.

97
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,000
So the soil of the blood became mud.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,800
The footprints were left along the way.

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
But because he dragged the deceased in with his legs,

100
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,600
the footprints were wiped off by the dead body.

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,800
By then, the mud on the feet of the murderer was gone.

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,400
After he put the dead down,

103
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,000
for some reason,

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,400
the dead body was covered with footprints.

105
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,200
The murderer could not find it.

106
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,600
After that, the murderer took off his shoes

107
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
and left the border with his feet.

108
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:35,200
Because the meeting

109
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
didn't go well,

110
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Jinbei's decibel story was exposed.

111
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
It's indeed arranged according to the seven-fold hell bamboo layer.

112
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,200
Princess, but...

113
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
I haven't seen the black and unripe flower pattern.

114
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
Close the gate.

115
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,400
Close the gate!

116
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
The death of Han Bing

117
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
was punished by Six-Face.

118
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Who did this?

119
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Ni'er, go check with Yan Li

120
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
to find out the relationship between the deceased and his friends.

121
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Yes.

122
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
What on earth is going on?

123
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
What's going on?

124
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
What's going on?

125
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
What's going on?

126
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
What's going on?

127
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
What's going on?

128
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,800
Hey, wait for me!

129
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,200
Manager,

130
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,000
your restaurant is dead.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm afraid it's hard to do business in the future.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Who says it's not?

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,800
Hu Dequan was protecting people when he was alive.

134
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,600
He even got me into trouble when he died.

135
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
If I knew it,

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
I shouldn't have taken him in at that time.

137
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,400
According to the manager,

138
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
isn't Hu Dequan a good person?

139
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,000
Hu Dequan was the buyer of the restaurant.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,800
He was honest in the past.

141
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,600
He was in debt.

142
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,400
He sold his only daughter to a brothel.

143
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,000
But he still didn't know how to take care of her.

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He not only lost all his daughter's money,

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
but also got hit by the butchers.

146
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,200
He almost couldn't live anymore, so he came to beg me.

147
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I felt sorry for him, so I took him in.

148
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,200
I took care of the ice in the restaurant.

149
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,000
Manager, do you know

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
which brothel did Hu Dequan sell his daughter to?

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
It seems to be Fengqi Restaurant.

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
Princess, no.

153
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
It's okay. This is the powder that was burnt by the Manchurian leaves.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
You can buy it at the regular drugstore.

155
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Manchurian leaves?

156
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
You mean the murderer

157
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
put the victim in the ice

158
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
and frozen him to death?

159
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,800
The victim's smile is the proof.

160
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
Before being frozen to death,

161
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
the blood vessels in the body run slowly.

162
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
It's easy to have a good illusion to avoid the pain of the body.

163
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,000
So most people who were frozen to death have smiles.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,600
The victim was wearing an inner shirt.

165
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
When he was confused, he was about to wake up.

166
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
At his place,

167
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,600
we can find evidence of burning Manchurian leaves.

168
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
Yes.

169
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
The powder is in the lamp.

170
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,400
Xiaowan.

171
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
We found that Hu Dequan

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
sold his daughter to Fengqi Restaurant.

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,600
The place where the first victim drank wine was Fengqi Restaurant.

174
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
The second victim, Zhao Jiaxu, was also Fengqi Restaurant.

175
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
This one is also Fengqi Restaurant. We found it.

176
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,200
We finally found the connection between the victims.

177
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
What's wrong, Xiaowan?

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Did you get cold in the ice?

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,800
I don't think so.

180
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,200
Maybe I'm too anxious to drink.

181
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

182
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Brother.

183
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
Brother Qi.

184
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
You... What are you doing?

185
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:49,460
I'm just a

186
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,600
Young man.

187
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,800
Not bad. You have a bright future.

188
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you, Your Highness. I should...

189
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Not bad. Not bad.

190
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,400
What are you looking at?

191
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
What's wrong?

192
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,400
Your eyes are straight.

193
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,000
You look like a wolf.

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
I don't.

195
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,600
Close your eyes. Turn around.

196
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,800
What should I look at and what shouldn't?

197
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,600
Do you understand?

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,400
Here.

199
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,200
I gave you this when I was in the grassland.

200
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,400
I gave you this as a gift.

201
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,800
I tried it. It works really well.

202
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Here.

203
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,800
How's the investigation going?

204
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
I've investigated everything you wanted.

205
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,600
If you don't want me to investigate,

206
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
I'll find out sooner or later.

207
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,400
You don't have to worry.

208
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,400
I told you about my real identity.

209
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,000
I know.

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,400
Close your eyes and sleep.

211
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,800
You'll get better after sweating.

212
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,000
Here.

213
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,020
The

214
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,600
You're finally awake.

215
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Are you feeling better?

216
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Come on.

217
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Everyone's been waiting for a long time.

218
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,400
Let's go.

219
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,000
They're like Ying Qi.

220
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
They're all from the military.

221
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,200
If you need anything,

222
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,000
you can leave it to them.

223
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Thank you for your hard work.

224
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
Please teach us more in the future.

225
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay.

226
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Let's go.

227
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
Xiaowan, I've found a guest room.

228
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,600
You can't give it to anyone else.

229
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,000
What guest room?

230
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's the room I left for my good sisters.

231
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,400
What about mine?

232
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
What does it have to do with you?

233
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,600
Xiaowan is not feeling well.

234
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
Hurry up and work for me.

235
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Where are you going?

236
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Of course, we're going to Fengqi House.

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
We'll take care of it.

238
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Don't worry about the tea house.

239
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,400
Let's go.

240
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
Sister Qi, wait for me.

241
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Remember to come to my house.

242
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,200
Go in.

243
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,000
Mr. Zhang, you're here too.

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
If you don't mind,

245
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,000
you can call me Mr. Zhang.

246
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,800
You should be called Mr. Zhang.

247
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm thinking of picking you up tomorrow.

248
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,400
Thank you for your good choice, Your Highness.

249
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,800
I'm the one who has to leave this place.

250
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
He lives in the front yard.

251
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
No one else knows about it.

252
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Without your token,

253
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
he can't leave this place.

254
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,400
I heard that

255
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,000
a cold soldier has appeared today.

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
I'll go back to my room

257
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
and think about it.

258
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,600
About my case.

259
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,200
In case someone says that

260
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,600
I'm a crook who is a fraud.

261
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
What are you doing?

262
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
You want me?

263
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
Little Ning Ning.

264
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Being a coward is not good.

265
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Didn't you see them?

266
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I was so scared.

267
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
What should we do?

268
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
Give me a chance.

269
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Come on.

270
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Please sit down.

271
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Sit down.

272
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Look.

273
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
What is this?

274
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Gold.

275
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Do you want it?

276
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Yes.

277
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
If you do as I say,

278
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
these gold will belong to someone.

279
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Stand up.

280
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Yes.

281
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
First question.

282
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Who knows Mr. Wu Jia Si?

283
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Step forward.

284
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I know him.

285
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I know him.

286
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm warning you.

287
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Who pretend to know him.

288
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
The consequence is that he will be whipped.

289
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
That's right.

290
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Second question.

291
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Who knows Zhao Jia Xu?

292
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Step forward.

293
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
The person who gave the peach blossom to the person who knows him.

294
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Yes.

295
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I know him.

296
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I know him too.

297
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Very good.

298
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Last question.

299
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Who knows Hu De Quan?

300
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Step forward.

301
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Others, go first.

302
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
You three stay.

303
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Go first.

304
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Go.

305
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Let's talk about who else has asked about these three.

306
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
This was originally a high wall.

307
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
My father and uncle Jin became friends in the desert.

308
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
He changed the wall of flowers.

309
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
He also opened a foot door to get in touch.

310
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
They are all the comfort of the Ge Clan.

311
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I thought

312
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
this house has been demolished.

313
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
The demolished house can also be sold.

314
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
The palace is beautiful.

315
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
This house is flat.

316
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
No one can see this place.

317
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Plus the security.

318
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,600
I can buy this house in the name of the bank.

319
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Cry if you want to.

325
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Don't hold back your grievances.

326
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm so happy.

327
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I'm not wronged.

328
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
I dreamed of this tree in the carriage.

329
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
When I was young,

330
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I didn't want to be a female palace.

331
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
I ran to this tree.

332
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I was so angry that my mother

333
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
stood on the tree with a ring.

334
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
It's a beautiful thing to love your mother

335
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
and punish her.

336
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
If you were alive,

337
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
you would be like my mother.

338
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
When she loves you,

339
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
she would like to put you in her heart.

340
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
You're naughty.

341
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
I wish I could beat you up.

342
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I went to Dali Temple today.

343
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I saw the security of my father and Prince Jin.

344
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
I know what crimes they have committed to my father.

345
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
They have also spilled so much dirty water on Prince Jin.

346
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
No matter how hard we try this time,

347
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
we will win.

348
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Did you see any problems on the security?

349
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
The security records...

350
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Prince Jin admitted that

351
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
he killed Jin Fei in the wine.

352
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
But his confession

353
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
just recorded the insinuation

354
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
of Prince Jin when he was interrogated.

355
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
The security also said that

356
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Prince Jin held a dagger

357
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
and stood on Jin Fei's handkerchief.

358
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
How could a person who was drunk

359
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
and committed such a vicious crime

360
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
stand on the same place?

361
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Did you see anything suspicious

362
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
in the case of Shen Gong?

363
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
The records on the security records

364
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
show that my father hid the evidence of Prince Jin's case.

365
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,600
But there is no evidence on the security records.

366
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Just like Prince Jin,

367
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
my father admitted that

368
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
they were also innocent.

369
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Li Muyun must have touched

370
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
those two files.

371
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
My father and Prince Jin

372
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
would never do such a thing.

373
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
I'm afraid that Li Muyun

374
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
set up a trap.

375
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
If he found out

376
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
that you touched

377
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
the security records of Shen Gong and Prince Jin,

378
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
and reported to His Majesty,

379
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
I'm afraid

380
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
I can only

381
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
let you off the hook.

382
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
I was too anxious.

383
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Li Muyun was so deliberate

384
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
just to test him?

385
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm afraid he still wants to find

386
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
the person who wants to turn the case for Prince Jin

387
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
and kill him.

388
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
I'll keep my eyes on the case

389
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
to avoid disturbing the situation.

390
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Just bear with it.

391
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
We're getting closer to the truth.

392
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Your Highness.

393
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
I have no idea

394
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
what's going on between them.

395
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Your Highness,

396
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
there must be something wrong with Li Muyun.

397
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
This is the real truth.

398
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Are you okay?

399
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
It's so painful.

400
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
I'm dying.

401
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
I don't know

402
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
if he will fall down.

403
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Don't say any more.

404
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
It's your fault.

405
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
My ass hurts.

406
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Put me down.

407
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Okay.

408
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,600
I wanted to do a fishing in the princess's yard.

409
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,720
But I didn't expect that

410
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,600
she couldn't bear the weight of two people.

411
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,040
So I just fell back.

412
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,080
It's two people.

413
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,440
Princess.

414
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,200
It's all your fault. Why did you say it so clearly?

415
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,920
Waner.

416
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,400
Go to see Fulin first.

417
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,360
I'll go to see Fulin first.

418
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,480
I'll rest early tonight.

419
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,960
Leave these things

420
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,400
to the butler tomorrow.

421
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,040
Then you and General Bai should go back early.

422
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,000
Don't worry about me.

423
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,400
Go with Fulin.

424
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Not bad.

425
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,240
You don't tell me your idea.

426
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,280
Master.

427
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,920
You've sent the princess away.

428
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
I should have some ideas

429
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,000
to coax my own wife, right?

430
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,040
If I can't coax my wife,

431
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,120
your wife may not be your wife.

432
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,840
What do you mean?

433
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,880
Did the princess say something to master?

434
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,800
Master, don't be angry.

435
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,120
If I have any ideas,

436
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,440
I'll tell master first.

437
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,640
Move.

438
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,680
I said move.

439
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,880
Let me go. I'm Zhang Dongxuan.

440
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,440
I have something to tell Princess Youci.

441
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,520
Master Wu,

442
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,080
no one is allowed to enter the inner palace.

443
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Let him go.

444
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,360
Where did you burn the princess?

445
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,040
You don't know who did it.

446
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,880
If you hurt me,

447
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,160
I'll see how you can treat Princess Youci.

448
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,200
Stop talking nonsense.

449
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,720
Why do you want to see the princess?

450
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,800
This is the Angel's law

451
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
that I summarized

452
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,120
according to the three fates of Guanyin Town.

453
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,920
I didn't expect you to have this ability.

454
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
People's lives are in the hands of God.

455
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
Your Highness,

456
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,640
stop talking nonsense.

457
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,840
According to my speculation,

458
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,080
there will be a fourth execution tonight.

459
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,720
Tonight is the fourth execution.

460
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,680
It's one more time than Guanyin Town.

461
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,440
Yes.

462
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,960
This is the fourth execution.

463
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,240
It's the fourth execution.

464
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,440
It's the fourth execution.

465
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,560
It's the fourth execution.

466
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,280
Yes.

467
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,920
This is calculated according to

468
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,160
the situation of the head of the Heaven Dao Club,

469
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,080
Zhang Faji and the Angel's law.

470
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,840
But I can't guarantee

471
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,880
whether the calculation is accurate.

472
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,480
According to the Angel's law,

473
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,880
I have scheduled seven days.

474
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,360
Tonight should be

475
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,760
the fifth execution.

476
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,960
If you believe it,

477
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,000
you have to send someone to prepare it.

478
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,800
If you don't believe it,

479
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,080
just pretend I didn't say it.

480
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,400
I don't know if there will be a death case.

481
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,560
I don't know where it is.

482
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,000
Only by searching the night,

483
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,880
can we find the fire early.

484
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,360
If there is a fire,

485
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,720
save the person as the medicine.

486
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Yes.

487
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,920
Let's go.

488
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Let's go.

489
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Hurry up.

490
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,920
It's early in the morning.

491
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,240
There is no sign of the east.

492
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Yes.

493
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Where is that?

494
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,440
That's the jade street of the east.

495
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,400
The Qi Gang's soldiers

496
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,760
get the fire team to hiçac mom.

497
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,320
He is on the run.

498
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Why is it like this?

499
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Impossible.

500
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Impossible.

501
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
Waner.

502
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Yanqi.

503
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
Yanqi.

504
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Yanqi.

505
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Yanqi.

506
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Yanqi.

507
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Waner.

508
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Did you have a nightmare?

509
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,520
I saw you in danger.

510
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
I was so scared.

511
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,360
We are really connected.

512
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
What happened?

513
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,200
The Star of Prowess appeared.

514
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,120
Look at what's inside.

515
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
It's so scary.

516
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,600
What's going on?

517
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Chuan.

518
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Chuan.

519
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,720
Chuan, I'm here.

520
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,680
Chuan.

521
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Madam.

522
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Chuan.

523
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,400
Madam, calm down.

524
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,880
Chuan.

525
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,120
She is the mother of the victim.

526
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,480
The perpetrator only used the fuel around the victim.

527
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,600
So the fire did not spread quickly.

528
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,320
It's a pity that I was late.

529
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
I couldn't save her.

530
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
Chuan.

531
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
It's so scary.

532
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Manager Wang is so careful.

533
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Why would he let the fire go?

534
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Go back to the hotel.

535
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Yes.

536
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Could it be related to the recent killing cases?

537
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Impossible.

538
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,520
I heard that the Star of Prowess only kills bad people.

539
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
Manager Wang is so kind.

540
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
How could he do such a thing?

541
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
You know the face but not the heart.

542
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
But...

543
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,120
Only we know the inside of these cases.

544
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
How can these people know?

545
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,120
These victims are the so-called bad people.

546
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Because the people of the Heaven Dao Club know it.

547
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,840
They should have released the news of the victim in advance.

548
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Then they set a flag to fight against the Heaven.

549
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,840
If someone in the capital uses the presence of the Heaven Dao Club

550
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
to eliminate the Ghost and instigate the Holy Immortal,

551
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,840
I'm afraid the capital will also be in a stormy situation.

552
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
But there are too few clues now.

553
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,840
I don't know when we can catch the perpetrator.

554
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
It's okay.

555
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
I'm just guessing.

556
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Things may not turn out that way.

557
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,840
You just need to concentrate and find clues.

558
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Leave the rest to me.

559
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840
Okay.

560
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,840
The suspect in the military food case is being escorted back to the capital.

561
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,840
I may stay in the Ministry of War for a long time.

562
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
I'll let Bai Feng follow you.

563
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
No.

564
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
The military food case is not simple.

565
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
You need someone to use you.

566
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
I have Yan Lin and Ning Er. That's enough.

567
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Water.

568
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Here.

569
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Give me a bite too.

570
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,840
You...

571
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
What's wrong with me?

572
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
I...

573
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
I...

574
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Don't disgust me.

575
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,840
What did you do to me?

576
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,840
Did you try to get me out of prison?

577
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
You're trying to do something evil.

578
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,840
Who the hell is the evil one?

579
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Here.

580
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
I'll drink this.

581
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
I'll drink this.

582
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
I'll drink this.

583
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
From now on,

584
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:46,840
there will be a legend of our Yongli detective.

585
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Cheers!

586
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
What Yongli?

587
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
You want to call it Yong...

588
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Buli.

589
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
Buli?

590
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Okay.

591
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
I'll drink it.

592
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
It's Yong Buli.

593
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,840
If you don't drink it, it's Yongli.

594
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
Okay.

595
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Cheers!

596
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
Cheers!

597
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Cheers!

598
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Here.

599
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Here.

600
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Lin.

601
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Listen to me.

602
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Actually,

603
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
except for Xiaowan,

604
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,840
you're the smartest person in the world.

605
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Of course.

606
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
I know that.

607
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
Also,

608
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
when I'm with you,

609
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,840
it's the happiest time of my life.

610
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Do you want to consider

611
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,840
marrying me?

612
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
I feel so bad.

613
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Help me to get rid of it.

614
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
Yongli?

615
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
I can even think of such a bad name.

616
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
I'm drunk.

617
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,840
You really don't remember anything?

618
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
What do I remember?

619
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,840
I remember the medicine I was dizzy with yesterday.

620
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Don't think that

621
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
you can lie to me

622
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
if I don't remember anything.

623
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
I can't even see the sand.

624
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
What's the use of lying to you?

625
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I'm already like this.

626
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
I'm the one who's lost.

627
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Stop talking nonsense.

628
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
You're taking advantage of me.

629
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
I'll go back to the palace with you

630
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
to see the Empress Dowager and the Princess.

631
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Tell them that you and I stayed out last night

632
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
and asked the elders to give us a good lesson.

633
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
If you dare to say a word,

634
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
you'll be punished.

635
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Xiaowan, if you ask about last night,

636
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
just say that

637
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,840
we were investigating last night.

638
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Did you hear that?

639
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
I heard it.

640
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,840
And also,

641
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
you must forget everything

642
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
about last night.

643
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Don't even think about it again.

644
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Xiao Ning,

645
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
what you said is wrong.

646
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
If I really forget it,

647
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
there's nothing to think about.

648
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
If I don't allow you to think about it,

649
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
then you don't need to forget it.

650
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,840
You two had a good time last night.

651
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Why don't you pay the money last night?

652
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Here.

653
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Here's the money.

654
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Where's the money?

655
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Here.

656
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Princess.

657
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Princess.

658
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
This is a smoke bomb.

659
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
I've finished the inspection.

660
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,840
The victim's hands are covered with a layer of environmental protection.

661
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
From the top of his head,

662
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
to his feet,

663
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
he's badly injured.

664
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
We can't tell if he used the powder.

665
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
But there's no sign of struggle.

666
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,840
And his lungs are a little bit swollen.

667
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
I think

668
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
the victim was already unconscious

669
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
before the fire.

670
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840
The smoke was probably the cause of the death.

671
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
He was badly injured.

672
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
And on his back

673
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
and on the bed,

674
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
he found a little bit of water.

675
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
It's probably the red powder

676
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
that was left after the burning of the pig's skin.

677
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Princess,

678
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
did I miss anything?

679
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Uncle Fang did a good job.

680
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,840
I'm flattered.

681
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
Princess,

682
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
I'll tell you the truth.

683
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
I've been reading this for more than ten years.

684
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
It's really nothing.

685
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Until I met you,

686
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
I knew that this night

687
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
could save lives

688
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
and return the world to justice.

689
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
I have no regrets in this life.

690
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Thank you.

691
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,840
The End

692
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
It hurts!

693
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
You two

694
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
are a prince and a princess.

695
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
You even fought with others for some money.

696
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
Do you know how to write the last two words?

697
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Lower your voice.

698
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
You're more shameless if others hear you.

699
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
What's wrong?

700
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Nothing.

701
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
They two

702
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
are both pious,

703
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,840
and I don't believe that they are a couple.

704
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Did you find any clues

705
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
in Fengqi Pavilion?

706
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Correct!

707
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Very important clues.

708
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
I know three victims.

709
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,840
And I've asked the girls in Fengqi Pavilion

710
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
about the victims' news.

711
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
The one who was fired from the painting studio

712
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
by the ink artist, Wang Xin.

713
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
With the music of the sculptor,

714
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,840
how could Wang Xin have the money to go to Fengqi Pavilion?

715
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Waner,

716
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,040
is to make money.

717
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,280
They're here to make money.

718
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,040
The ladies spread rumors

719
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,560
to coax those Erde phone charge

720
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,480
as Human rights holder to send stamps

721
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,500
and cross-dressingiku or something.

722
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,600
After their traders make money,

723
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,440
they will give the ladies

724
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,680
some benefits.

725
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,040
Now that everyone has money.

726
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,740
You know

727
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,400
the costs of your money.

728
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,480
I?

729
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,640
I'm not an idiot

730
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,280
to spend money to learn things

731
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,120
anyway.

732
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,720
You really have the nerve to say it.

733
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,400
If you hadn't spent all the money,

734
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,120
I wouldn't have had to do this to the person who made the mistake.

735
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,840
Princess Yuan Ning, Your Highness,

736
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,760
the news you got is very useful.

737
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,600
But

738
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,480
I was too greedy and drunk on time.

739
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,320
I almost made a mistake and made a mistake.

740
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,520
If there's another time,

741
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,160
I won't allow you to follow me to investigate the case.

742
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,120
Do you remember?

743
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,240
Yes.

744
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,640
When I go to the Ministry of War,

745
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,520
I have to protect Wan Er.

746
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,720
Don't worry.

747
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,960
With me and Xiao Ning Ning here,

748
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,760
Wan Er will definitely be fine.

749
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,200
I'll go with them later

750
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,680
to see Wang Shou Chang's mother.

751
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Okay.

752
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,720
Xiao Wan Er,

753
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,680
how did you know we were drunk last night?

754
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,800
If you weren't drunk,

755
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,400
how could she have your scent?

756
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,800
I didn't say that.

757
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,560
To be honest,

758
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,200
Cheng Er was very naughty when he was young.

759
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,320
When he was eight years old,

760
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,600
he burned an abandoned house

761
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,960
because of the fire.

762
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,400
But he didn't expect

763
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,320
that an old beggar was hiding in the house and shouting.

764
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,960
When he heard the sound of the scream,

765
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,920
he knew that someone was in the house.

766
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,720
But because the fire was too big,

767
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,800
he wanted to go in and save someone.

768
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,600
But he was afraid.

769
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,600
He felt sorry for the old beggar who was brought to life.

770
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,280
He was so guilty.

771
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,960
Did anyone else know about this?

772
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,880
I don't think so.

773
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,280
But Chang Er was always guilty.

774
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,800
He became more and more silent.

775
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,440
He usually talked to the jade carving master

776
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,080
named Wang Xin of the dyeing studio

777
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,080
to say a few more words.

778
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,080
He really shouldn't have died.

779
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Wang Shouchang's death is a mistake.

780
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,280
He is not a real criminal.

781
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,880
He is a person who wants to destroy the country.

782
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,400
He was murdered.

783
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,480
He shouldn't have done that.

784
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,480
The way of the human heart is the way of the human heart.

785
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,200
If the human heart is biased,

786
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,680
the way of the human heart is biased.

787
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
I don't know how many people are left in the way of the human heart.

788
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,280
If everyone is as cruel as Wang Xin,

789
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,480
the capital will be a hell.

790
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,960
I just want to report to you and the princess.

791
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,360
According to the time calculated before,

792
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,360
I have roughly calculated

793
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,360
the direction of the seven cases corresponding to the crime.

794
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,360
How did you calculate it?

795
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,960
Si Nan?

796
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,960
Yes.

797
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,360
Do you know the heart-shaking?

798
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,440
The heart-shaking is the heart-shaking.

799
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,640
The heart-shaking is the heart-shaking of the seven North Star.

800
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,440
I combined the time of the four cases

801
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,640
and found that the location and the direction of the case

802
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,040
are exactly the same as the direction of the seven North Star.

803
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,640
I have marked the direction

804
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,640
of the remaining three cases on the jade head.

805
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,560
I will hold Si Nan in my hand

806
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,640
and let her go.

807
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Great.

808
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,120
According to the time calculated before,

809
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,520
the next case will be the hell of the ten deserts.

810
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,120
We can find the ten deserts

811
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,920
according to the location map.

812
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,320
I will contact the snow camp

813
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
and build a defense in this location.

814
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,920
The snow camp is here.

815
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,200
Go.

816
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,000
Go.

817
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,600
Go.

818
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,200
Open up, love is not afraid of the deep sea

819
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,600
Please grant me courage

820
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,200
Let fate open up

821
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,600
Don't be afraid of the starlight

822
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,000
The tears are not dry

823
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,400
The stars will shine

824
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,080
Beyond the sky

825
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,880
It's like dust

826
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,480
But it's the color of the star

827
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,680
The star is shining

828
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,680
The star is shining

829
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,680
The star is shining

830
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,680
The star is shining

831
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,680
The star is shining

832
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,680
The star is shining

833
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,680
The star is shining

834
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,680
The star is shining
