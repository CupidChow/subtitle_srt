Episode 2

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Wan

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You have waited for a long time

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's wrong?

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Something wrong?

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Brother Qi

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Can you pay attention to this?

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I can't see

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can't see

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm leaving

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Crazy girl

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's good to be like this

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Every time I see her

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I feel envious

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I feel envious when I see you

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is a tigress

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't talk nonsense

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's go back and talk

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Go back?

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We have to wait for the time to talk

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ok, ok, ok

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You say

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If I and my mother die in one place

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't know how to open my eyes and how to open my eyes

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In order to take revenge

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Will I be on the same path as her?

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You won't

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I know you sympathize with the fate of your mother

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But what she wants is a good revenge

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What you want is a world without grudges

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No matter how much you hate

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can't kill people

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You are right

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The ancestors have their own laws and rules

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I hope my mother's loyalty can help her to save her life

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't worry

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
His Majesty has not broken the big case of the imperial family

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He has been in a bad mood

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If Wang Zhizhou can break this case before he dies

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The benefits he gets will be great

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He won't miss this opportunity

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Wang Zhizhou, let me go

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't want anything

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I can't run anymore

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You won't do anything good even if you die

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You killed your own son

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've cleaned up the mess

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I feel good

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You are so kind

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Brother Xie, let's go

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll wait for you outside

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's hard to say goodbye

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What is your plan for the future?

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Wang Zhizhou returned my dowry

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I helped my father manage the inn before he died

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This money is enough for my inn

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
To support us

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Princess, sister Jiu

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We can go now

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We can go now

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm going to the mountain

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to the golden honey

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm going to the golden honey

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Brother

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you thinking about the capital?

69
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm going to the capital tomorrow

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I want to go home to pay respects to my parents

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Ok

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
After I go to the palace to pay respects

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll pick you up at the mansion the day after tomorrow

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You can't go

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I want to tell you this

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We can't be like this anymore

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You don't have to worry about the future

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He doesn't dare to hurt you

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm going to the capital

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm going to the capital

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm going to the capital

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm going to the capital

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,040
She is afraid oh

84
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,520
Bai Zhao

85
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,080
You don't have to worry about her

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
She can't harm you

87
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,080
What if she uses me to threaten you for looking after the crown prince?

88
00:06:48,080 --> 00:07:00,560
Qi AnponeINGSI planned a

89
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,080
Zheng Yonghe is also an adult in my name

90
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,320
I should just be your servant, Mr. Jiu.

91
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,040
Alright.

92
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,600
As long as it can make you feel at ease,

93
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
I will do it.

94
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,440
But I will not let you be manipulated.

95
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,200
No one can do that.

96
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,400
Then I beg you, Your Highness,

97
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,640
to help Mr. Jiu to make the capital a better place.

98
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,800
I will.

99
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,320
Y 도  Sing a song

100
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,880
I, Qin Shu, greet you, Your Highness.

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,400
What is Your Highness worrying about?

102
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
Vice Minister Zheng, you tell me.

103
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
Zhong Yonghong is not an outsider.

104
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
Yes.

105
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,320
Just before the imperial jade, Prince Cheng asked His Majesty about the progress of the case.

106
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,680
Yan Yujian kept blaming His Highness for not doing his job well.

107
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,200
His Majesty looked very embarrassed.

108
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,640
Yan Qi is a sinister villain.

109
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,000
He kept provoking my father's dissatisfaction.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,840
He is so shameless.

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,640
Please calm down, Your Highness.

112
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,480
Although Prince Cheng has offended Your Highness,

113
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,320
His Majesty still doesn't dare to be so righteous.

114
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,560
It's not a big deal.

115
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,480
If Your Highness can solve this case,

116
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,560
Prince Cheng will be very happy.

117
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,280
But His Majesty's wife is getting married in the year.

118
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,520
We have no clue about the date of the wedding.

119
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,040
If it doesn't work,

120
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,400
we can only find a scapegoat to solve this case.

121
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,120
Your Highness, no.

122
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,600
Although it can solve the problem,

123
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,800
if Prince Cheng finds out,

124
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,120
it will put you in a bigger danger.

125
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,560
What do you think?

126
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,720
Do you think I can humiliate Yan Qi in the Chuxi banquet?

127
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,280
Your Highness, I have a suggestion.

128
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,840
He is good at martial arts.

129
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,360
He is good at pushing.

130
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,520
The case of Jingzhou and Yuzhou

131
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
can be solved.

132
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,640
He is a great man.

133
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,400
Where is he now?

134
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,080
If he is really useful, I won't treat him badly.

135
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
He will arrive in Beijing tomorrow.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
Where is he?

137
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
I will go to the Ministry of Personnel immediately.

138
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,840
Wait.

139
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,840
Don't worry, Your Highness.

140
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,480
He is not a official.

141
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,280
And he has a special status.

142
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,040
We need to see him.

143
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,280
We must keep it a secret.

144
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,960
If Prince Cheng finds out,

145
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,800
he will definitely do something.

146
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,680
Don't worry, Your Highness.

147
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,440
I will be very cautious.

148
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,640
Yeah.

149
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,520
Madam, the city gate is in front.

150
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,000
We really go back to the capital.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,760
From today onwards,

152
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,800
there is no more way back.

153
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,560
Situ Jingmin

154
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,200
Where do you pick them up from?

155
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,840
I work in the affects and rains Hook worry

156
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,040
Do you like it?

157
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
Yes

158
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,120
Are you going to the palace?

159
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,520
To the mansion

160
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,160
It's not OK

161
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,920
You won't let others see you

162
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,760
I told you

163
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,840
I will go see Yue Ning

164
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,080
You are going to the firm

165
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
I'm not a good girl.

166
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Alright.

167
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,260
You should be extra careful in the mansion.

168
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,180
Don't be wronged by them.

169
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,880
Bring your own food and drink.

170
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Don't worry.

171
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,380
I won't let myself suffer.

172
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,380
There are many people at the gate.

173
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,380
You should go.

174
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Go.

175
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Wait for me.

176
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,080
The crown prince treats his wife so well.

177
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,280
I will learn to treat her well.

178
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Go.

179
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,080
Ming, I can't walk around with you.

180
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
After I enter the capital, I will leave Wan to you.

181
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,580
Wan is my sister.

182
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
When you become my sister-in-law,

183
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,080
you can ask me to take care of her.

184
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Your wife is only Wan.

185
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Brother, you should leave her to me.

186
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,080
I promise I will treat her well.

187
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,080
Don't think about that.

188
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
When I come back,

189
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,580
your fun and eating days will be over.

190
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
I...

191
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,580
Father, mother.

192
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,580
No need.

193
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,080
I greet you and your mother.

194
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
How is it?

195
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Are you tired?

196
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
I'm not tired.

197
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Don't worry.

198
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
Is everything going well?

199
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,080
Yes, father.

200
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
I brought all three sisters back.

201
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Good.

202
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,080
This is sister 5, sister 6, and sister 9.

203
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,080
You are Qin Wan?

204
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,080
I greet you, uncle.

205
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,580
When I saw you,

206
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,080
you were still a little boy.

207
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,580
You have become a big girl.

208
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Sister 5 and sister 6

209
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,080
are getting more and more outstanding.

210
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
Thank you, uncle.

211
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,580
Thank you, aunt.

212
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
You are hungry, right?

213
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,080
Let's have a meal first.

214
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,580
We can talk while eating.

215
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
Let's go.

216
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,580
It's been a long journey.

217
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
I'm not tired.

218
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,580
Normally, there is only one girl in the house.

219
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,080
You all come.

220
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,580
The house will be lively in the future.

221
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,580
Mother, you have already had lunch.

222
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,080
Why hasn't Yu'er come back yet?

223
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,080
Today, the Empress called for you.

224
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,580
She went to the palace to serve the noble lady.

225
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Although sister 9 grew up in the Medicine King Valley,

226
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,580
she didn't break the rules.

227
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Uncle,

228
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,580
my daughter is weak.

229
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,080
I never blame my daughter for practicing female skills.

230
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,580
Only the rules.

231
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,580
My daughter must be taught by the teacher if she is wrong.

232
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
My second brother is like that.

233
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:24,820
Although he is not good at

234
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
being straight,

235
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,580
he is big.

236
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,080
If he começa to paint again,

237
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,580
he can be as weak as the eight stones.

238
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,200
If one day our father get sick,

239
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
he can take back ourosed.

240
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
How could he be so like you?

241
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,080
You nonsuc r check if I don't becautied you.

242
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,080
I must learn from you for you to learn from me.

243
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,620
Anyway,

244
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,120
see you then.

245
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
Where are you going?

246
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,620
It comes my way.

247
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
My Don't say that.

248
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,580
Come on.

249
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,580
Sit down.

250
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,180
Hurry

251
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,080
and sit.

252
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,460
Nailed it.

253
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:53,580
Nailed it.

254
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,080
Didn't you?"

255
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,820
Nailed it.

256
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
It's rare for you to come to the capital.

257
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
The new year is coming.

258
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,820
I'll let you three take a walk around.

259
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Really?

260
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Of course.

261
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
The city is more lively than the capital.

262
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
But you and your sisters are back.

263
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
Father, mother.

264
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
It's been a long journey.

265
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,820
Are these the sisters and Jiu from Jingzhou?

266
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
Yu'er, this is your fifth sister.

267
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
And sixth sister and Jiu.

268
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Greetings, sisters.

269
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
Jiu.

270
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
Greetings, father.

271
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Greetings, mother.

272
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Greetings, mother.

273
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Jiu.

274
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Greetings, eighth sister.

275
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
I was the youngest.

276
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
Now that you're here, someone calls me sister.

277
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Look how happy Yu'er is.

278
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
Did you have dinner in the palace this late?

279
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
Yes.

280
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
I happened to meet the Crown Prince and greet the Empress.

281
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
The Empress left me a meal.

282
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,820
I was in a hurry to see my sisters, so I came back.

283
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
Your sisters have been tired from the journey.

284
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
You should go back and rest.

285
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
You're thoughtful.

286
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,820
From now on, this is your home.

287
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
If you need food or clothes,

288
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
just tell your aunt.

289
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Let's go.

290
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Father.

291
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,820
His Majesty has been angry with the Crown Prince again.

292
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Don't worry about it.

293
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Don't ask about the Crown Prince.

294
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
But...

295
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,820
If you want to be the future Crown Princess,

296
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
you can't leave any evidence.

297
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
I understand.

298
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
The three sisters will be closer in the future.

299
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Especially Jiu.

300
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
I understand.

301
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,820
She just entered the Marquis' mansion today.

302
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
She's very easy-going and good at handling things.

303
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,820
She's like a gentleman.

304
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
You need to send someone to take care of Qin Xiang and Qin Shuang.

305
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
The case of Qin An is very serious.

306
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
If the Crown Prince didn't say what he wanted to say,

307
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,820
I'm afraid I'll be accused of being unruly.

308
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,820
We can't have any more scandals in the Marquis' mansion.

309
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
I understand.

310
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
But what about Yan Chi and Jiu?

311
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,820
It's not as simple as you think.

312
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,820
The father and son of King of Rui are not willing to fight.

313
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,820
How can they help the Crown Prince for the marriage?

314
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,820
Besides, as Yan Chi,

315
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,820
his marriage must be over the Crown Prince.

316
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,820
If we interfere,

317
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
His Majesty will be suspicious.

318
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
Yes.

319
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Since Yan Chi hasn't arrived yet,

320
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,820
he is defending Yan Biao with you.

321
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Let's wait and see how he feels about Jiu.

322
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Just do as he says.

323
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Yes.

324
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,820
Lately, the King of Rui has been quite busy with his work.

325
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,580
His Majesty has been busy with his work.

326
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,220
He is very worried.

327
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,900
Noble Consort Su,

328
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,860
your mother and son are all in favor of the harem.

329
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,540
It's hard for the Empress and the Crown Prince.

330
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,420
In the future,

331
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,660
you must not do anything like that again.

332
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,500
I know my mistake.

333
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,540
I have recommended the Crown Prince to Jiujian.

334
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,660
If he can solve the Crown Prince's urgent problem,

335
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,140
the House of Marquis of Zhongyong

336
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,380
will be a step closer to the Crown Prince.

337
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,620
Jiujian's future may not be as good as Yu'er's.

338
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,260
Father, you are considering

339
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,620
to let Jiu sister be the Crown Prince's concubine.

340
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,260
But Yu'er loves the Crown Prince so much.

341
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,460
Can you keep the position of the Marquis?

342
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,780
The position of the nobility in this dynasty

343
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,500
must be achieved by great merit.

344
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,260
I gave up my seat to be the lossor.

345
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,380
If I failed to have the same merit

346
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,300
as working for you,

347
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,660
how could you keep the job in this inhospitable country?

348
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,820
I williesta in mind definitely.

349
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,640
Alarmy

350
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,580
You can ask someone to find you when you come back

351
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,180
My lady

352
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,380
Do you know what Baniangzi went to do today?

353
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,980
I heard from the little girl in the mansion

354
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,180
She will choose the crown princess

355
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,820
Baniangzi is the Baniangzi in our mansion

356
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:45,820
If you want, you can do it

357
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
It's a good thing for the mansion

358
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Baniangzi is pretty

359
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,820
But if my lady dresses up

360
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
She must be prettier than her

361
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,820
If this is spread out, it will cause trouble

362
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
Don't talk nonsense

363
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
I know

364
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
I just want to make you happy

365
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
I just want to have a rest

366
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,820
It's heavy

367
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
Why don't you go back to your room?

368
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
Be careful of cold

369
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
I think the view is very good

370
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
So I want to go out

371
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
What are you doing here?

372
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
I come to ask you to go to the study

373
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
I have something important to discuss with you

374
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
Mo Yi

375
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,820
My lady

376
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,820
Yu'er, take a break

377
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Wait a moment, mother

378
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
I will talk to you after I finish this

379
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
Your handwriting is good

380
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,820
Even the emperor praises it

381
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,820
What can this court do?

382
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
A day's work is indispensable

383
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,820
Yu'er

384
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,820
Did the empress give you the right information today?

385
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
Today, the lady of the Feng family is also here

386
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,820
The empress is very precious

387
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,820
I can't say anything

388
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,820
You mean the legitimate daughter of the Chinese palace

389
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
Feng Chenbi

390
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,820
She is very popular with the position of the crown princess

391
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Mother, don't worry

392
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,820
Father is the minister of the Ministry of Personnel

393
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,820
And the crown prince

394
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,820
I am the son of the crown prince

395
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Father is the minister of the Ministry of Personnel

396
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
And the crown prince

397
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
In terms of the court's background

398
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
The loyalty to the crown prince

399
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,820
The empress knows whose daughter is the best choice

400
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,820
But now our family

401
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,820
Not only you are a girl

402
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,820
Even your father

403
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,820
The appearance of the ninth wife

404
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
All praise

405
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,820
The teacher called to the study

406
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
What if the crown prince sees it?

407
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,820
Do you think I can't beat the ninth sister?

408
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,820
Silly child

409
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
Why would mother think so?

410
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,820
Just that the selection of the concubines is not fixed

411
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,820
I'm not at ease

412
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,820
The ninth sister is very outstanding

413
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,820
The first talented daughter in the capital

414
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,820
It's definitely not a name

415
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,820
The crown prince and I have a clear mind

416
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Mother is afraid that she will take the daughter

417
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,820
She is now the adopted daughter of Marquis Anyang

418
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
And the eldest princess is her guest

419
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
Mother

420
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,820
There are countless families in the capital

421
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,820
If we see ourselves

422
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,820
It will be the end

423
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,820
I understand father's intention

424
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,820
You just take good care of the ninth sister and them

425
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,820
In the future, it will also be good for my brother

426
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,820
I'm afraid

427
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,820
He saw a higher high

428
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,820
I have a different idea

429
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
Mother assured

430
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,820
If there is that day

431
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
I will not be taken for granted

432
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,820
This is all the accounts and books that the elders of the tribe have collected

433
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,820
The industries of the second house are also on it

434
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,820
See if there is a gap

435
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,820
Thanks to Uncle Zhao, my children can return to the capital

436
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,820
These industries should also be managed by Uncle

437
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
Nonsense

438
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,820
This is a relic left by your parents

439
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,820
I should keep it for you

440
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,820
Just your father was not good at customs

441
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
There are not many industries to be managed

442
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,820
But when you get married

443
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Uncle and aunt will make up for you

444
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Father, the ninth sister just came back

445
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,820
What are you doing for the dowry?

446
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,820
Like getting married in a hurry

447
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Don't misunderstand

448
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,820
I don't mean what your brother said

449
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,820
Then Waner will be honest

450
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
That's right

451
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,820
Sit down

452
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
Sit down

453
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
Unfortunately

454
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,820
My brother has been a doctor all his life

455
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,820
Didn't see your current sword skills

456
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,820
I left early

457
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
It's really disappointing

458
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,820
Father heard that the ninth sister is not only good at medicine

459
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,820
Also help the government to break the tree case

460
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,820
There are people who are just envious of Uncle's second step

461
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,820
About the case

462
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,820
About the third uncle

463
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,820
I haven't asked uncle for forgiveness yet

464
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,820
Qin'an is a crime that has to be done

465
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,820
What does it have to do with you

466
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,820
Uncle still has to thank you

467
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
In time

468
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,820
For the Qin clan

469
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
Eliminated this

470
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,820
The victim of the loss of virtue

471
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
Just didn't expect you

472
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,820
Weak and fresh

473
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,820
Facing so many dead bones and remains

474
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,820
There is no fear at all

475
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,820
Of course I was afraid at first

476
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,820
But I read a lot

477
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
Also understand

478
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,820
People die like lights out

479
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,820
The heart is not yet

480
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
It's a fantasy

481
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,820
Of course I'm not afraid

482
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,820
Your firm heart

483
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,820
It's really hard for men to speak

484
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
So

485
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
Uncle has an unkind heart

486
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,820
I hope you can be lucky

487
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,820
Uncle, please give orders

488
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,820
Since the beginning of the month

489
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,820
Many women have been killed in Beijing

490
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,820
The killer has not been caught yet

491
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,820
This case is about the safety of the people

492
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,820
Uncle made the decision without permission

493
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,820
I recommended you to the government

494
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,820
I don't know if you are willing

495
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,820
Help the government to make a decision

496
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
Waner is willing to do everything

497
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,820
Help the government to return the people's peace

498
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
Good good

499
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,820
Please get up

500
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,820
Good

501
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
Lord Chen

502
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,820
The nails in our Jinzhao Prefecture

503
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,820
Have dealt with those evidence

504
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Zhongyong's mansion

505
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,820
What's the matter?

506
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
Except for the young master Qin Yan

507
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
I came back to Beijing today

508
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,820
No one has entered or left

509
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,820
According to the two days in Chuxi

510
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Qin Shu's old man is so honest

511
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,820
Waiting for the disease

512
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,820
Zheng Fuying has no clue

513
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,820
Don't talk about two days

514
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
Even if it's a long-term problem

515
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,820
They can't find out the cause

516
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,820
Zhong Yonghou

517
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,820
The future of the family

518
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,820
All on that wretched man

519
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,820
To save him

520
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,820
I'm afraid it's a crime to find someone to make up for it

521
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,820
Can do it

522
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
These days, watch the mansion

523
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,820
If they really dare to act in danger

524
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,820
Just for me

525
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,820
One net gold

526
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,680
The

527
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,820
If you can't hold it, don't think about it

528
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,820
I allow you to go back

529
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,820
No need

530
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,820
This Jingzhou and Yuzhou's case is well done

531
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,820
I thought you had a good potential

532
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,820
I didn't expect it to be a stinky blood

533
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,820
I'm thinking about how to do my job every day

534
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,820
I don't have any free time to think about this shit

535
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,820
He said this is a bad thing

536
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,820
In front of me

537
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,820
Only you dare to answer this half

538
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,820
You really think about it

539
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,820
Just go to the Ministry of Justice

540
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,820
Yes

541
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,820
Then in the future, there will be no young general

542
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,820
Don't regret

543
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,820
Good men can make achievements wherever they are

544
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,820
If uncle Huang really loves me

545
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,820
Why don't you arrange me a high-ranking official position

546
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,820
Let me have the freedom to take care of the matter

547
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,820
By the time my father is angry, I have something to say

548
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,820
You and your father fight

549
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,820
And involve me

550
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,820
OK, now the Empress Dowager is old

551
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,820
If you want to stay in Beijing, go with her

552
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,820
I allow you to do little things

553
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,820
Thank you, Your Majesty

554
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,820
Go

555
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,820
The government has already taken care of many things

556
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,820
Thank you, Minister Zhang

557
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
Ninth brother

558
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,820
This is the government of the Jingzhao Prefecture

559
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,820
Greetings, sir

560
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,820
I am very grateful to be able to get the help of Mr. Qin Jiu

561
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,820
Please

562
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,820
Minister, this is the old Minister of Defense of the Wuzhou Bank

563
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,820
He is the first person to do the initial inspection of this case

564
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,820
Minister Fang

565
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
Yes

566
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,820
One and a half months ago, I found the first word

567
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,820
Half a month later, I found the second body.

568
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,820
Half a month ago, I found the third body.

569
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,820
You're the first victim.

570
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,820
When did you find the first victim?

571
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,820
Under the bridge, the South of the city.

572
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,820
The victim lived in the South.

573
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,820
His family reported the death.

574
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,820
He went out to buy vinegar.

575
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Was there a ladder under the bridge?

576
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,820
No.

577
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,620
Then, the river beside the jade water

578
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,020
can only be the place where the perpetrators threw the body.

579
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,620
The place where the victim was killed is somewhere else.

580
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,220
How can it be possible?

581
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,020
According to the wounds on the victim's neck

582
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,820
and the bleeding points on the eye,

583
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,820
it can be said that the victim was really killed by someone who blocked the neck.

584
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,620
But the back of the victim's leg,

585
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,220
the back of the small leg,

586
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,620
and the foot,

587
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,420
there are large amounts of wrong wounds.

588
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,420
But there are no bleeding points.

589
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,620
It means that

590
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,220
the victim was dragged from the stairs after he died.

591
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,220
Since the river is not on the stairs,

592
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,220
where did these wounds come from?

593
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,620
The second victim was found in a abandoned house in the southwest.

594
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,820
Close the door and close the window.

595
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,620
The fire-proof room is here.

596
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,620
After he sent the brother to the south of the city to eat dinner,

597
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
he disappeared.

598
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,620
The next day, his brother reported to the police.

599
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,220
Two days later, he was found to be poisoned.

600
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,820
Because these two victims had nothing to do with each other,

601
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,620
we didn't expect that it would be just one case.

602
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,220
Until half a month later,

603
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,420
the third victim lived in a good village outside the city.

604
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,020
On the day of the incident, he was supposed to go to the west market to buy a year's worth of goods.

605
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,820
Wake up.

606
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,420
But he didn't wake up.

607
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,020
It's killing!

608
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,820
It's killing!

609
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,620
This你的 tenim!!!!!!!!

610
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,420
During the incident at a moment ago,

611
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,420
several healthcare struggles were owned by his disciplinedłe fried pig Shepherd.

612
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,920
Three young men on the crag.

613
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,820
Such a manhood,

614
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,620
his wife, his father, and son.

615
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,420
All of these marked the beginning of a happy and healthful journey.

616
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,020
I've been thinking about it.

617
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,020
But I haven't found anything.

618
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,420
The third body is not too bad.

619
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,420
I might be able to find some clues from the funeral.

620
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,420
Zheng Fu Yan, I want to test this body.

621
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,420
Test?

622
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:00,420
The Third Body

623
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,020
Greetings, Your Highness.

624
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,420
Your Highness, what are you doing?

625
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
Your Highness, the front hall is over there.

626
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,420
Not here.

627
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,220
Why is it you, Mr. Qin?

628
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,420
I thought you were a fugitive.

629
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

630
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,820
This is the main examination room of the Jin Zhao Manor.

631
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,420
How can there be a fugitive here?

632
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,820
Zheng Fu Yan, if I remember correctly,

633
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,420
there is no such person in the Jin Zhao Manor.

634
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,820
I remember correctly.

635
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,020
Mr. Jiu is my man.

636
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,420
Old Seven? But this case is very important.

637
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,620
Even if he is your man, he can't just go to the main office

638
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,020
I don't know.

639
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,020
I will be officially in the Ministry of Justice in the following year.

640
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,620
His Majesty asked me to help Zheng Fu Yan with the case.

641
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,220
And Mr. Jiu is the one His Majesty told me to invite.

642
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,220
He is the master of the five masters I invited.

643
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,820
Enter the Ministry of Justice?

644
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,020
So that's how it is.

645
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,220
The Seventh Brother has always been known as General Changsheng.

646
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,220
The Crown Prince is helped by you.

647
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
He must be like a tiger.

648
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,820
It seems that this case should be solved as soon as possible.

649
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,620
His Majesty asked me to help Zheng Fu Yan with the case.

650
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,220
Not the Crown Prince.

651
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,420
Helping Zheng Fu Yan is a task.

652
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,420
Helping the Crown Prince is a private matter between us.

653
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,220
If we get confused,

654
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,420
I'm afraid I won't be able to explain to His Majesty.

655
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,820
It seems that the Seventh Brother is really confused by the fugitive in the manor.

656
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,420
Just now, the guards saw it.

657
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,020
They found a young man with a similar figure to the fugitive.

658
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,620
That's why they came after us.

659
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,420
It's all a misunderstanding.

660
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,420
Mr. Jiu, don't blame me.

661
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,620
Since we've made it clear, the Seventh Brother will leave first.

662
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
You don't have any work, right?

663
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
Together?

664
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,620
I...

665
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,220
Seventh Brother, the Seventh Brother and I are on our way back to the capital.

666
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,420
We have a lot to do.

667
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,620
I've already arranged to treat him to a meal tonight.

668
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,220
Mr. Qin, why don't you wait for me at the restaurant?

669
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,020
Okay, I'll go right now.

670
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,420
That's good.

671
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,620
Next time, come visit my manor.

672
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,220
You and I should also get together.

673
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,420
Okay.

674
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,820
Let's go. Let's go look for him somewhere else.

675
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,420
I don't believe that a mere thief can turn the tables.

676
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,420
Let's go.

677
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,220
Thank you for your help, Your Highness.

678
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,620
With your help, this case is saved.

679
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,820
Since Mr. Jiu is the one who helped, the case can be solved in a few days.

680
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,620
Vice Minister Zheng, the case of Jingzhou and Yuzhou

681
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,220
was investigated by Mr. Jiu.

682
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,020
That's really a blessing from heaven.

683
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,620
I have discovered something. Please come with me.

684
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,820
Please.

685
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,220
This is the orange seed and fish I discovered in the victim's stomach.

686
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,220
The victim must have eaten the orange and fish for the last meal.

687
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,820
The food usually takes about two hours to digest in the stomach.

688
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,220
Although the fish has already turned into a pulp, it still has a little bit of the remaining.

689
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:39,620
It can be seen that the victim's last meal is about an hour and a half away from death.

690
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Smart.

691
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,820
But what did the victim eat in the end?

692
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,820
What did it do to us?

693
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,620
Vice Minister Zhan said that the victim lived in a good village outside the city.

694
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,820
He was determined to go to the Western City to buy annual goods.

695
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,820
He must have a meal in the Western City.

696
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,420
Although the orange is common, there are also fish in the inner part of the capital.

697
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,020
Even if there are, it is expensive.

698
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,220
Only the merchants and the rich will go back to the factory.

699
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,020
But the victim wears normal clothes and has a normal family background.

700
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,820
He will also choose a small restaurant to have a meal.

701
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,420
But the Western City can sell fresh fish.

702
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,020
The victim is not allowed to eat in the restaurant.

703
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,620
But the Western City can sell fresh fish.

704
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
But from this start,

705
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,620
we can find the victim's restaurant.

706
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Then we can deduce the scope of his action based on the time of digestion.

707
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,420
I accept it.

708
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,020
This is bad.

709
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,420
Mr. Qin, the third victim's clothes are gone.

710
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,420
They are gone.

711
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,020
This is not right.

712
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,220
When I was in the house,

713
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,420
I did put these clothes in the bamboo basket and sent them here.

714
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,020
Did you see the victim's clothes when you first saw them?

715
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,420
That means I didn't see them.

716
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,620
The clothes of these three people are all gone.

717
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,420
Only the clothes that are not attached to the body.

718
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:06,020
The murderer usually has a special taste in women's clothing.

719
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,620
What do you mean?

720
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,420
Does Mr. Zheng know about his wife's clothing habits?

721
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,020
How would I know about this kind of woman?

722
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,820
I don't mean anything else.

723
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Please look at this.

724
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,020
Although the texture of these clothes is very ordinary,

725
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,020
the stitches are very particular.

726
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,220
The bandages are not damaged.

727
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,220
It can be seen that the murderer is very familiar with women's clothing habits.

728
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,820
That's why he doesn't pull the stitches and stitches.

729
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,620
He wears the women's clothes.

730
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,020
How can a normal man do this?

731
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,020
Mr. Zheng doesn't know about his wife's clothing habits.

732
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,020
But the murderer can wear the clothes of the three victims,

733
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,820
from the middle to the outer clothes.

734
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,820
How can he only show one small dress?

735
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,420
Zhan Yang, Fang Bo, go and check it immediately.

736
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,620
Who sent the body?

737
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,620
Yes.

738
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,020
This is about the murderer's privacy.

739
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,220
It's not going to be public.

740
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
It's hard to find clues.

741
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,820
There's one more thing.

742
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,620
This is the black pain relief cream I found on the third victim.

743
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,020
The victim's nails are very neat.

744
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,620
It can be seen that there are no pain relief creams on the body.

745
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,020
If the pain relief cream was applied before the victim was killed,

746
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,820
it would be removed in time.

747
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,620
Only when the victim was killed, the pain relief cream was caught by the murderer.

748
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,820
Then it will be left in the nail hole.

749
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,220
Only those who work in the winter will change the pain relief cream.

750
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,020
The murderer can afford to buy this pain relief cream.

751
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,820
It means he not only cares about his income,

752
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,420
but also values his hands.

753
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,220
He's not a normal farmer or a blacksmith.

754
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,220
He should be someone who can eat with delicate skills.

755
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,220
If he can afford this pain relief cream,

756
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,420
there must be someone with delicate skills who has his own shop.

757
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,420
According to the same pattern on the first and third victims,

758
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,420
I suspect that the murderer should be in the same room with stairs.

759
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,420
The murderer hid his body to drag the victim up and down the stairs.

760
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,820
He will leave the room after nightfall.

761
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,820
The only person who knows how to serve and earn a lot

762
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,020
can use the house and shop to set up the crime scene.

763
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,420
The three victims are all in the same room.

764
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,620
It means that the only one can do it.

765
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,620
Although the murderer knows how to treat the victim,

766
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,020
it's impossible for the murderer to handle the case alone.

767
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,820
It's hard to avoid the victim.

768
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,020
It's possible that...

769
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,220
The crime scene...

770
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,220
Thank you for your advice.

771
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,620
I'll check it right away.

772
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,220
Wait.

773
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,620
There are many shops in the west.

774
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,020
There are many crime scenes.

775
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
The three victims are all in the same room.

776
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,620
There's only one day left before the deadline.

777
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,820
Mr. Zheng, how can we find out the truth?

778
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,620
Do you have any other way?

779
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,220
I can only find the clue from the result of the autopsy.

780
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,620
I didn't find out the murderer.

781
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,420
I finally have the clue but I don't have time.

782
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,220
Do you have any map of the capital?

783
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,620
The map is in the house.

784
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,020
If you need it, you can take it.

785
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,620
You don't have to go back.

786
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,420
Give me two hours to find the murderer.

787
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,420
Are you serious?

788
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,820
I'm the one who found out the murderer.

789
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,820
I'll get the car and go back to the house.

790
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,820
I can't, I can't get there.

791
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,620
Go back!

792
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,620
I'm sorry

793
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,140
But you want to be a maid?

794
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,940
Shopkeeper

795
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,100
These silver coins are enough to make a set of maids

796
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
These are too little

797
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,480
But my mother only has one daughter

798
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,980
She wants me to be a nun

799
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,860
Please help

800
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,180
Shopkeeper

801
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200

803
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,620
