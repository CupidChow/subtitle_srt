00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,520
Father, mother, Yu'er is back.

3
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,760
Yu'er, Yu'er, my Yu'er.

4
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,640
You're finally back.

5
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,480
I've been asking for you to contact me.

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
I just had a chance to leave the palace.

7
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
I can't stay long.

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
I have something important to discuss with father.

9
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,880
Mother, go back to your room and rest.

10
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,240
Mother, stay with Yu'er.

11
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,040
Yan'er, send your mother back.

12
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,240
I'll wait for you outside the door.

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,360
Mother.

14
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,280
This is the letter from the Empress to General Zhao.

15
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,400
Please send it to the Northern Army as soon as possible.

16
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,440
What happened?

17
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,040
The Crown Prince was eager to defend mother.

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
He was against His Majesty.

19
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,880
Father.

20
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,040
Okay.

21
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,760
I'll send your brother to send it to him.

22
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,040
Mother said

23
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,040
she wanted to save the Crown Prince's life

24
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,880
and protect the future.

25
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
I know it very well.

26
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,120
I'll go back to the palace first.

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,280
Yu'er.

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,120
You must accompany the Crown Prince

29
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,800
to the Zongzheng Temple to pray.

30
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,880
I'll be there

31
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,560
as long as he's there.

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,080
Okay.

33
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,120
You go.

34
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,200
After everything is arranged,

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,320
I'll send someone to give you the news.

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,840
Yu'er.

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,080
Thank you, father.

38
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,560
See His Majesty off.

39
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,240
I'll go.

40
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Cui Ge.

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,920
Are you still afraid of your father?

42
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,800
Can you tell me

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,840
what you're afraid of?

44
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,640
Father is very angry.

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,680
Will mother and brother die?

46
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,200
Come.

47
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,080
Cui Ge, don't be afraid.

48
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,640
The Empress and the Crown Prince

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,240
just did something wrong.

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,640
Your father just won't let them

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,360
be the Empress and the Crown Prince.

52
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
If only people didn't die.

53
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,840
If people die,

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,880
they won't talk anymore.

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,640
They won't move.

56
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,280
Just like my mother.

57
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,560
Consort Qin is an immortal.

58
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,480
She'll go back

59
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,800
when she grows up.

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,880
People can't be revived.

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,680
They won't go back to heaven.

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
You don't have to comfort me.

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,760
Cui Ge.

64
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,680
Xiaowan.

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
Why is the Crown Prince

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,880
locked up in the Zongzheng Temple?

67
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,440
He's so elegant.

68
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,640
How could he be so careless?

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,000
It's not something we should ask.

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,160
Right.

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,720
Don't ask about us.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Cui Ge, don't learn from me.

73
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,840
Have you seen the Empress Dowager?

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
No.

75
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,680
Third Brother asked me to invite you

76
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,080
and Brother Qi to his mansion.

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,160
He said he wanted to ask you something.

78
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,280
Ask us?

79
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,000
Didn't he ask me to treat him?

80
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Third Brother asked you

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,520
to take us to his hometown.

82
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,400
Your Highness, they're here.

83
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm sorry to bother you

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,040
with the new marriage banquet.

85
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,480
Qi Lang, you won't blame me, will you?

86
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,880
I'm just kidding.

87
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,200
Have you got better eyes?

88
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
Thanks to Yongci's old wisdom,

89
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,280
I've got better eyes.

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,760
But I can only look at the light

91
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,720
when it's dark.

92
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,160
Why did you ask me to take you to your hometown?

93
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,360
If you have a concubine,

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
you should report to the government first.

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,080
It's a private matter

96
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,600
of the new mansion.

97
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,200
Before we find out the truth,

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,200
please keep the secret

99
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
for me and Qi Lang.

100
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,720
Of course.

101
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,560
Mother,

102
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,560
I have brought your younger brother

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,880
and younger sister to visit you.

104
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,880
Did you

105
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,200
trust me more?

106
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,500
Over the years,

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,080
I've done my best

108
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,360
to protect Your Highness's body.

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,560
But leaves can only fall from my eyes

110
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,640
that I'm drenched in tears.

111
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm not afraid of death.

112
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,360
You want me to

113
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
kill my wife.

114
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,960
Why?

115
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,160
Because I want to know

116
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,200
why my mother died.

117
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,000
Please help me.

118
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,200
You don't have to.

119
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,080
I'll do it with all my strength.

120
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,200
But

121
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
it's hard to avoid

122
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,920
the death of the investigation.

123
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,960
You'd better avoid it.

124
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,480
It's okay.

125
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,880
It's my personal decision.

126
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,960
I'll be honest with you.

127
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,160
The truth

128
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,400
is my only fear.

129
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,480
I'll be honest with you

130
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
in the heaven.

131
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,040
Besides,

132
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,800
I'm afraid you don't know

133
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,760
that I've been learning to cure the drug

134
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,880
with you before I left the palace.

135
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
I've been with you for half a century.

136
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,520
I've been waiting for the chance to live and die.

137
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,240
I won't mind the consequences.

138
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm honored to be with you.

139
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,280
I'm honored.

140
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
I'll do my best

141
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,640
to save you from the death.

142
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,840
Thank you, sister.

143
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,600
Put on во";

144
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,640
A 24-hour old man

145
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,040
is waiting for your arrival.

146
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,120
Make some time for reasoning on it.

147
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,200
But

148
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
has the answer been found out

149
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,320
by this old man?

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:08,600
Why he was

151
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
hiding can't be buffeted can be Sleep.

152
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,680
The child is light.

153
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,760
The bone is large and small.

154
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,360
The bone is sharp and sharp.

155
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
The side of the arm is flat and the front of the ear is thin.

156
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,200
The bone is short and wide.

157
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,680
The body is round.

158
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,160
The body is still intact.

159
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,360
The marks of the birth are obvious.

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,160
Third Brother.

161
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,200
When the Princess died,

162
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,520
but the flowers are in full bloom.

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,080
You suspect the late Princess's death.

164
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
What's the meaning of her death?

165
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
That day,

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,960
Mother went into the palace

167
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,200
to send the medicine she made for the Empress.

168
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,680
She came back to the mansion after the morning prayer.

169
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,360
When she entered the palace,

170
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,360
she locked herself in the bedroom.

171
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,800
I was worried

172
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,560
so I sneaked in to see her.

173
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,360
After I heard from her,

174
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,640
she came back to her room.

175
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,360
She lacked my sister's flourish,

176
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,440
run away and escaped from the palace and got hurt by the sword.

177
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,080
Since then,

178
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:19,960
she has effectively

179
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,520
tamed myself with her succeed.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
She pierced through the bless of my love

181
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,880
and taught me

182
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,400
the teachings of love.

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,600
After,

184
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,280
I became a mother

185
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,120
and married someone out of no where.

186
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,600
To know the ins and outs of people,

187
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,560
I didn't recognize him.

188
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,120
The imperial physician came.

189
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,280
But my mother

190
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,000
didn't have any signs of being poisoned.

191
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,640
But since then,

192
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,760
my body

193
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,880
and my eyes

194
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,600
have been getting worse.

195
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Has the imperial physician checked the tea?

196
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
The imperial physician said

197
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
it wasn't poisoned.

198
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,320
How could he check these common things?

199
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:33,960
The imperial physician

200
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,160
checked the ingredients.

201
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,640
I think

202
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,680
that's enough to say good-bye to YuanTo

203
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,000
This initial color

204
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,840
is too abstract

205
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,160
Use mine

206
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,520
No

207
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,100
Use mine

208
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,660
1 year later

209
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,000
Princess, you really were poisoned.

210
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,020
After my red Laughter and於

211
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
The door is finally open.

212
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Thank you for your order.

213
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
This incense is very fragrant.

214
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
It's not easy to use.

215
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
It's made of Chen Shui incense, Ding incense,

216
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
and Qiangwei water-tree.

217
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
That's right.

218
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,160
This incense is called the anti-spirit plum.

219
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
It's Xianci's favorite incense.

220
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
If you like it,

221
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
I'll make some more for you.

222
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Brother, you can't overdo it.

223
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
When Xianci was a child,

224
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
she taught me to make incense and taste it.

225
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
Now, every time I make incense,

226
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
she's like my mother.

227
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
She's by my side.

228
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
You still have the memory of my mother.

229
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
You've been through a lot.

230
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Qi Lang,

231
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
have you ever doubted

232
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
the cause of Lingtang's death?

233
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
What do you mean?

234
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
My mother died less than seven days ago.

235
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
My mother died of a bloodbath

236
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
due to birth.

237
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,160
They were close friends before they died.

238
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
They almost died at the same time.

239
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
It's too coincidental.

240
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
The Empress Dowager and her father

241
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
never mentioned this to me.

242
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Back then, my uncle

243
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
handed over the 100-day-old you to the Empress Dowager.

244
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
He went to Shuoxi alone.

245
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Rumors spread in the capital.

246
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
He said that my uncle thought

247
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
you weren't his bloodline,

248
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
so he went back to Shuoxi

249
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
in a fit of rage.

250
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
If it weren't for the manipulation,

251
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
how could there be such a consistent rumor?

252
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Yanzhi,

253
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
rumors only point to the wise.

254
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
These lowly people

255
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
are not willing to give up

256
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
in front of my loyal and brave father.

257
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Brother,

258
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
what you're saying now

259
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
is that my mother was framed.

260
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I have no doubt

261
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
and no evidence.

262
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Please help me

263
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
to find out the truth

264
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
for all the reasons.

265
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Zange, since you suspect

266
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
the death of the two princesses for many years,

267
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
can you find out the motive

268
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
of the star-seeking man?

269
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Since Xianyan went with my mother,

270
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
I'm a weak and blind

271
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
and idle imperial family.

272
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
No matter how much I have doubts and grudges,

273
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
I can't do anything

274
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
to help.

275
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
If Qilang and my sister

276
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
can help me to solve the problem,

277
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm very grateful.

278
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Yanzhi,

279
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
women are like ghosts.

280
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Even if they don't use poison,

281
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
there are many ways

282
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
to cure people.

283
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
My mother has been dead for many years.

284
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
It's hard for me to find out

285
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
the reason why I'm now in the dark.

286
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
If it's really like what Zange said,

287
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
why don't you investigate it

288
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
with the princess?

289
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
In case my mother

290
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
will be in a coma.

291
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Do you know

292
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
who the princess

293
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
sent the medicine to

294
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
when she came to the palace?

295
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
It's His Majesty.

296
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,160
His Majesty was seriously injured.

297
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
If it wasn't for the princess,

298
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
he might not be alive.

299
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
It means

300
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
the person who poisoned my mother

301
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
might not only be the empress

302
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
but also His Majesty.

303
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I don't understand it either.

304
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
In theory,

305
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
the princess

306
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
saved His Majesty.

307
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
What reason does His Majesty and the empress

308
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
have to kill her?

309
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Maybe it's because

310
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
the prince of the late king

311
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
had a close relationship with the court.

312
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
His Majesty was seriously injured

313
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
and wanted to stabilize the power.

314
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
That's not right.

315
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
Why would he do that

316
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
to the princess?

317
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Forget it.

318
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
There are too few clues.

319
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
I can't find anything.

320
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Too many things

321
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
are related to the palace.

322
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Why don't we investigate

323
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
the case of the late king first?

324
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Today,

325
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
Sui Ge

326
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
mentioned the death of Consort Jin.

327
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
I think she has a different

328
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
mind from before.

329
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
She seems to have remembered something

330
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
but she dared not to say it.

331
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
These days,

332
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
I want to go into the palace

333
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
to accompany the empress dowager

334
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
and Sui Ge.

335
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
When these things happen,

336
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
they feel the most uncomfortable.

337
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
There is one more thing.

338
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
The Jiang He Ying who killed my father

339
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
is indeed Yan Qi's man.

340
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Yan Qi has been sending him

341
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
money to pay for his death.

342
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
In the past,

343
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
His Majesty allowed him to go back to his hometown

344
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
and serve as the general.

345
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
It seems that Yan Qi

346
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
was behind all this.

347
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
You are so cruel.

348
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Even if he doesn't remember

349
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
your friendship with his brother,

350
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Prince Rui is still his uncle.

351
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
The Tian family has no father and son.

352
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Let alone the imperial edict.

353
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I don't think so.

354
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Don't say that it's a shame.

355
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
But

356
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
is it Prince Chen who made the decision

357
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
or His Majesty's order

358
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
that Wu Zong has no idea about it?

359
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
If it's really His Majesty's order,

360
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
we can't move him for a while.

361
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
We have to think of a way

362
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
to make Yan Qi lose his mind.

363
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Don't worry, Chen Jian.

364
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
I have a plan.

365
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Now he is in a good position.

366
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
It's a matter of ambition.

367
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
He will use Wang Han's political son

368
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
to fight against the bandits

369
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
and kill the Crown Prince.

370
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
As long as he dares to do it,

371
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
it will be my end.

372
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Your Highness.

373
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
This is the soup

374
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
that I just made.

375
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
You can eat it while it's hot.

376
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
I can't drink it.

377
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Leave it here.

378
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Then I'll eat it later.

379
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Okay.

380
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Mother also specifically told me

381
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
to give you some medicine

382
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
according to the order.

383
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
You went to see Mother?

384
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Yes.

385
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Mother, you're not treated by the guest, right?

386
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Mother is a person with a sharp mind.

387
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Now the Empress Dowager is in charge of the affairs.

388
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
No one dares to

389
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
control Mother's efforts.

390
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Mother,

391
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
I hope that the Crown Prince can calm down.

392
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
In a few days,

393
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
someone will completely

394
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
resolve the crisis for us.

395
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
I have entrusted Father

396
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
to send Mother's operation

397
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
to the Imperial Army.

398
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Your Highness,

399
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
I'm sorry.

400
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Thank you, Zhao Yun.

401
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
As long as you're well,

402
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I will do my best

403
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
to help you.

404
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I've been boiling the sweet soup

405
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
that His Majesty made

406
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
for two hours.

407
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
I'm waiting for His Majesty

408
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
to come over tonight.

409
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
I've finally got it.

410
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Why is the sweet soup

411
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,160
made so light?

412
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
It would be better

413
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
if it was sweeter.

414
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
It's too sweet.

415
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
It's too sweet.

416
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I'm afraid that

417
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
my appearance will be damaged.

418
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
My dear,

419
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
you've always been

420
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
the most beautiful girl in the palace.

421
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Your Majesty, you praise me so much.

422
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
I'm happy

423
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
that I'm dead

424
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
right away.

425
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm a little tired today.

426
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Let's

427
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
get some rest.

428
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Your Highness, Your Highness.

429
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
It's time to get up.

430
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
The people in the prison are at the door.

431
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Uncle is here to pick us up.

432
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Change your clothes.

433
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
We should go now.

434
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Okay.

435
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Zhao Yuan,

436
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
why haven't you changed your clothes?

437
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Your Highness, I'm not leaving.

438
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
I've never ridden a horse

439
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
or rode a horse before.

440
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
I can't run fast.

441
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
It's your burden to follow me.

442
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
It's good for me

443
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
to stay and

444
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
delay for a while.

445
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
It's always good to be able to delay.

446
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
No.

447
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
It's too dangerous to stay.

448
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Come with me.

449
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Your Highness,

450
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
I'm the eldest daughter

451
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
of Zhong Yong Hong's Mansion.

452
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
They won't do anything to me.

453
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Your Highness, let's go.

454
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Let's go.

455
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
I said that I can get out of the prison safely.

456
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
I will definitely come to pick you up.

457
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Let's go.

458
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Greetings, Your Highness.

459
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
It's too dangerous.

460
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
I can only wrong you.

461
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
how is it?

462
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
The Crown Prince has joined with the jin yin characters

463
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
and left the prison smoothly.

464
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
The Crown Prince captured the sealing

465
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
for the Crown Prince.

466
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
That's great.

467
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
What should we do next?

468
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
First,

469
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
let's just guard outside the比^^

470
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
field.

471
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Where will the yin be then?

472
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,960
Onlyler

473
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,200
Qing şeyi

474
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
is in the usual place.

475
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Why is she in yin?

476
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,960
the Imperial Household Department will be in a state of chaos.

477
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,800
Since the Crown Prince is in a state of trouble,

478
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,200
Your Highness the Empress, you should try to find a way to avoid it.

479
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,480
If the eunuch sees this,

480
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,680
His Majesty will come to question him.

481
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,120
I'd like to see

482
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,080
what he looks like.

483
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
The Imperial Household Department

484
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
The Imperial Household Department

485
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
The Imperial Household Department

486
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
The Imperial Household Department

487
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
The Imperial Household Department

488
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
The Imperial Household Department

489
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
The Imperial Household Department

490
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
The Imperial Household Department

491
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
The Imperial Household Department

492
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
The Imperial Household Department

493
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
The Imperial Household Department

494
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
The Imperial Household Department

495
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
The Imperial Household Department

496
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
The Imperial Household Department

497
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
The Imperial Household Department

498
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
A flood is obviously about to come!

499
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Come! Hurry!

500
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Look up a way to shed your tears!

501
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
A flood is likely to come!

502
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Yunqing!

503
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Where is there water?

504
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,360
Your Majesty, burn 55

505
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,140
This is a non 호iał

506
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,080
This is a non-tow Dunhuang

507
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,640
This is a non-tow Dunhuang

508
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,200
Your Majesty!

509
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,480
be on Berknow's social media.

510
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,160
Your Majesty!

511
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,580
Hold on, Your Majesty!

512
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,860
Father.

513
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,980
except for the second prince's

514
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
injury.

515
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,980
How are they?

516
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,980
The second prince's wife is fine.

517
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,980
But the second prince...

518
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,980
I don't know where he is.

519
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,980
I didn't find any body or body at the fire.

520
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,980
This is absurd.

521
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,980
He attacked the main place

522
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,980
and walked into the water.

523
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
The second prince in the circle

524
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,980
disappeared?

525
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
Don't worry, father.

526
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
I've found out

527
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
that the fire started by the second prince's bedroom.

528
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
But the second prince isn't here.

529
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
I can't ask about the second prince's wife.

530
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
But I think

531
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
the second prince's disappearance

532
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
must be related to the water.

533
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
We should ask someone to check the names of the people

534
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
according to the official list of the Zongzheng Temple.

535
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
How dare you set fire to the Zongzheng Temple?

536
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
How dare you put your name

537
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
on the list?

538
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I'm stupid.

539
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
Qi.

540
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
Yes, your majesty.

541
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,540
Do you think

542
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,540
the second prince's disappearance

543
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,540
is related to the water

544
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,540
in the Zongzheng Temple?

545
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,540
I didn't go to the fire.

546
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,540
I dare not make any guess.

547
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,540
But I think

548
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,540
the second prince's disappearance is not to be spread.

549
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,540
I'm willing to go immediately

550
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,540
to find the second prince.

551
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,540
It's not normal

552
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,540
to sneak into the Zongzheng Temple at night.

553
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
You should take Yongci

554
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
to the Zongzheng Temple to investigate.

555
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
You don't have to

556
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
find the real murderer behind the fire.

557
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
As for

558
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
the matter of finding Che,

559
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
leave it to the king of Cheng.

560
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Yes, your majesty.

561
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
You can go now.

562
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Come on, get up.

563
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Thank you, father.

564
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
I got a report.

565
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
Zhao State

566
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
has a team

567
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
guarding outside the capital.

568
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
I'm afraid

569
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
the second prince

570
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
will be killed.

571
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
I'm afraid

572
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
you will be fooled by the Zhao State

573
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
and commit a treason.

574
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
I order you

575
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
to stop them.

576
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
If he really gets suspicious,

577
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
don't blame me

578
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
for not being aware of your request.

579
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
I'm willing to

580
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
share your worries.

581
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
You're very good.

582
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Now

583
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
you're the only prince

584
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
who can be used by an adult.

585
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
If Che doesn't want to die,

586
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
you must

587
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
sacrifice your own safety.

588
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Father, you're so kind.

589
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
I will

590
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
not let you down.

591
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Go.

592
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
I'm leaving.

593
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
Your majesty.

594
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Your majesty,

595
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm sorry.

596
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,880
I hate to see you die.

597
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Your majesty.

598
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
Your majesty.

599
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Your majesty.

600
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Your majesty,

601
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
your majesty,

602
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
please be careful.

603
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Your majesty,

604
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
please let me go.

605
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,320
Only we are here.

606
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,120
We never sent the imperial guards.

607
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,920
I see.

608
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,800
You may leave.

609
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,040
Yes.

610
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,360
What's wrong?

611
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,960
According to the rules,

612
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,160
the imperial guards should be

613
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,720
at least three in the imperial court.

614
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,600
But there's no imperial guard here.

615
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
It's abnormal.

616
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,960
The imperial guards are under His Majesty's command.

617
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,320
Maybe

618
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,400
His Majesty wants to

619
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,680
let the second prince live.

620
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,040
If His Majesty really wants to do that,

621
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,440
he could just

622
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,440
make Yan Che a commoner.

623
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,440
He's a popular man.

624
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,080
Why would he be trapped here?

625
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,920
He won't let anyone go

626
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,160
and he won't kill anyone.

627
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,520
His Majesty

628
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,920
is doing this to his own people.

629
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,360
The Imperial Guard

630
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,200
This should be the fire station.

631
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,520
There's no trap here.

632
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,600
It shows that the bamboo stand

633
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,760
isn't placed here.

634
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
It's left here

635
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,320
after someone lit it up.

636
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,160
The kitchen is outside.

637
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,120
It's not far from here.

638
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,920
The second prince

639
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,200
shouldn't be here before the fire.

640
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,600
What if the person who lit it up

641
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,360
is the second prince's wife?

642
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,960
The woman of Qin will come out

643
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,360
and confess to the traitor.

644
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,840
Why would she come here

645
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,600
if she didn't go to the second prince?

646
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,520
Because I know

647
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,080
that I'm a man of my word.

648
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,320
You didn't dare to come out.

649
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,200
What's wrong?

650
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,040
Are you ashamed?

651
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,040
You're shameless.

652
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,800
Your Highness, you're being too kind.

653
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,320
Even if the second prince is trapped,

654
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
I'm still your second sister-in-law.

655
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,440
You should respect me.

656
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,720
Second sister-in-law?

657
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,920
Are you qualified?

658
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,120
You lit the fire to help the second prince escape.

659
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,720
You're only qualified to call yourself the woman of Qin.

660
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,160
You said I lit the fire

661
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,440
to help the second prince escape.

662
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
I'm not qualified.

663
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,520
I'm not qualified.

664
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Your Highness, do you have any evidence?

665
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,760
My words are the evidence.

666
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,840
Tell me.

667
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,720
Where did the second prince escape to?

668
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
I was frightened.

669
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,120
I don't remember anything.

670
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,360
Then I'll let the maids of the Imperial City Bureau

671
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
think about it for you.

672
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,760
Come on. Tie her up.

673
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,600
Yes.

674
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,480
And put on a hat.

675
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
You're shameless.

676
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,880
Your Majesty,

677
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,840
Lakרי wants the second prince back.

678
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,760
Brother,

679
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,600
they just chased o Actually here and released the second prince.

680
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,200
Are you a man?

681
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,920
I don't feel good about it.

682
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,360
You're going to kill me?

683
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,760
Baby.

684
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,960
Also,

685
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,800
if you kill Jin Bakup,

686
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,800
not only will you spare my life,

687
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,600
but I will also spare Jin Shi's for planted in her body.

688
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,480
Think carefully.

689
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,720
If you kill me personally,

690
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,640
father won't let you go.

691
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,560
Your royal hogpets

692
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,480
and your consort

693
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,560
will follow me to the grave

694
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,440
The Command wish must come true.

695
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,120
won't you help?

696
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,720
Princess.

697
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,880
Bobby Yan,

698
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:20,680
It's literally official Wen H戎ysi Feng

699
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,100
Do you have any mention can Flag

700
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
I'll do my best.

701
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,720
I've tried this fire.

702
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
You're trying to let go of the fire

703
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
just to let the second prince

704
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
escape from it.

705
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,720
This can't be hidden.

706
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Even if it's not me,

707
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
someone else will come to check.

708
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
It's not hard to get the conclusion

709
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
that the person is in danger.

710
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Did you think about the consequences

711
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
before you did it?

712
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
I did.

713
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
So what?

714
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
If King of Rui is in danger,

715
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
what will you do?

716
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
If you can use your life

717
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
to fight for his life,

718
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
will you do it?

719
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Yes.

720
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
So,

721
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
I will never tell you

722
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
where he is.

723
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
I didn't want to live.

724
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Xia Yu is still a filial son.

725
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
He's under His Majesty's control.

726
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
If we want to punish you,

727
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
we wouldn't have

728
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
tied you up in the hands of the King of Cheng.

729
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
But you know,

730
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
you can't handle this punishment alone.

731
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
If His Majesty wants to find out,

732
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,720
the whole family will be in danger.

733
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
I know.

734
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,720
But I really can't bear to see him

735
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
being trapped here.

736
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Even if we are willing to do it,

737
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
and we are cruel,

738
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
the King of Cheng will never let us go.

739
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
I have no choice.

740
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
But I'm not decisive enough.

741
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
If I were to set myself on fire,

742
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
I wouldn't have my parents and brother in danger.

743
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
I'm sorry.

744
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Sister Jiu,

745
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
I'm begging you.

746
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
As long as you're willing to help,

747
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
we can keep the House of Zhongyong.

748
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I'm begging you

749
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
to wait another hour.

750
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
When the Second Prince

751
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
leaves the capital safely,

752
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
you can tell His Majesty the truth.

753
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
I'm begging you.

754
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Please stand up.

755
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
Sister Jiu, you don't have to beg me.

756
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Even for my father's sake,

757
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
I won't stand aside.

758
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
Besides,

759
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,720
you're a victim to me.

760
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
I'll do my best

761
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
to protect you and your mother.

762
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
But my father and brother

763
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
are entangled with the Crown Prince.

764
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
I'm afraid I can't protect them.

765
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
The reader must know

766
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,720
that my father chose to help the Crown Prince.

767
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
He should have been punished for it.

768
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Fine.

769
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
I was too impulsive

770
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
and I was too harsh on you.

771
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,720
I shouldn't have done that.

772
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,720
I'm here to give you a gift.

773
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Please stand up.

774
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Let's forget about the past.

775
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,720
As long as there are no more misunderstandings in the future.

776
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Yan Li.

777
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,720
Brother Xi, what's wrong?

778
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Did His Majesty mention

779
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
the second prince's escape?

780
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
No.

781
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
His Majesty has been handling the affairs all morning.

782
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
He has been blaming the second prince.

783
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Maybe he wants to hide something

784
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
so that the court won't be suspicious.

785
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
The Bureau of Justice is a big company.

786
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
If we don't find out the truth,

787
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
it will be suspicious.

788
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
His Majesty might not know it.

789
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Maybe His Majesty wants to show

790
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
the power of the Heaven.

791
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
He won't let us know

792
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
what he wants to do.

793
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
The second prince is still alive.

794
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
No matter how he shows the power of the Heaven,

795
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
he won't use it to make a mistake.

796
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
That's not necessarily true.

797
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
He has a bad eye.

798
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
He is not good at eating.

799
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
He is always laughing.

800
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
He is dragging me and Ning Ning to the trouble.

801
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Isn't it to show

802
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
that he is too good to be changed?

803
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Maybe it's because I can't see it.

804
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
So I'm not afraid.

805
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
I'm not afraid.

806
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
You are as pure as a bird.

807
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
I didn't hear your footsteps.

808
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Why are you here?

809
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
I wanted to ask about the water.

810
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
I heard what you said.

811
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
I don't want to

812
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
cause trouble.

813
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
I've never been here.

814
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,720
Then I've never seen you.

815
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Brother Qi.

816
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
I'll keep it a secret

817
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
if you get beaten up by me

818
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
when you were a kid.

819
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
If I didn't have bad eyes,

820
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
I would run faster

821
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
than you when you cause trouble.

822
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Really?

823
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Of course.

824
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Of course.

825
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Brother Qi.

826
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Look.

827
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
This is me.

828
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
This is me.

829
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Three hands.

830
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Why are you as tall as me?

831
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
I want to be taller than you.

832
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Let's fly.

833
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Fly.

834
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Brother Qi.

835
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Come with me.

836
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Come with me.

837
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
It's here.

838
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Look.

839
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
Your Majesty.

840
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
The criminal Zhao family

841
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
should go to the imperial palace.

842
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
In the past,

843
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,720
His Majesty appointed me as the empress.

844
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Unless I was appointed

845
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
as the empress

846
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
and the empress

847
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
I would still be the most

848
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,720
noble woman in the world.

849
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
I'm afraid

850
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
you can't be the empress.

851
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm a noble woman.

852
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
The empress is still alive.

853
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,720
You're not the most

854
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,720
noble woman in the world.

855
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Now

856
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
your brother

857
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,720
led the North Army to the capital without permission

858
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
and colluded with you.

859
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
He helped the second prince escape.

860
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
How can you still have the face

861
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
to be the empress?

862
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
My brother

863
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,720
has been in charge of the North Army for many years.

864
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,720
He has never lost his loyalty to the country.

865
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
Everything I do

866
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,720
is for the sake of the royal family

867
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
and the bloodline of the royal family.

868
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
I can't be a concubine.

869
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Why should I not be the empress?

870
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
A weak and incompetent

871
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,720
prince who is not willing to be the emperor

872
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,720
is not worthy of the title of the empress.

873
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Even if the bloodline is pure,

874
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,720
if you

875
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
know your place,

876
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
you should ask for your leave.

877
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
I will ensure that your mother and son

878
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
are safe.

879
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,720
Otherwise,

880
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
don't blame me

881
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,720
for not thinking about the love between husband and wife.

882
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Love between husband and wife?

883
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
What kind of love between husband and wife?

884
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
I can't let you

885
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,720
be the emperor for so many years.

886
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Do you think

887
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
that as long as you ensure that your place is safe,

888
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,720
the North Army will support you

889
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
and your useless son

890
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
will take my country?

891
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
You are really smart.

892
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Zhao Shuhua

893
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
you don't even think about

894
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,720
why the defense of the Zongzheng Temple is so relaxed

895
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
and can make your useless son

896
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,720
so simple and smooth.

897
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
What did you do?

898
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,720
I promised my mother

899
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
to spare Liu Yanche's life.

900
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
If she doesn't run away,

901
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
fine.

902
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
As long as mother is alive,

903
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
I

904
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
won't let her be hurt.

905
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
It's a pity

906
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
that she escaped.

907
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,720
She doesn't want me to hide.

908
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
Then I have to let her

909
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
be in the dark.

910
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
I will kill you.

911
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
You

912
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
You are a traitor.

913
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
You are a traitor.

914
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
Let her go.

915
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
Let her go.

916
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
After taking all the orders,

917
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,720
you will not see this Fengyi Palace

918
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,720
for half a day.

919
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,720
Guangliang.

920
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Don't go.

921
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,720
Come back.

922
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Come back.

923
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,720
Yanche.

924
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
Yanche.

925
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
Yanche.

926
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,720
Yanche.

927
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,720
Yanche.

928
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,720
Yanche.

929
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,720
Yanche.

930
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
Yanche.

931
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
Yanche.

932
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,720
Yanche.

933
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Yanche.

934
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,720
Yanche.

935
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
Yanche.

936
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
Yanche.

937
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
Yanche.

938
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Yanche.

939
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,720
Yanche.

940
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Yanche.

941
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
Yanche.

942
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,720
Yanche.

943
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
Yanche.

944
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
Yanche.

945
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,720
Yanche.

946
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,720
Yanche.

947
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,720
Yanche.

948
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
Yanche.

949
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
Yanche.

950
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
