00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,930
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,520
Little Wan'er.

4
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,990
You must have waited for a long time.

5
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,170
What's wrong?

6
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,180
It didn't go well?

7
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,100
Chi,

8
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,460
can you please behave yourself?

9
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,060
Keep your hands to yourself.

10
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,610
I can't see.

11
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,100
I can't see.

12
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,570
I'm leaving now.

13
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,960
Crazy girl.

14
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,729
Ning is best this way.

15
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,470
Every time I see her,

16
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,920
I feel envious.

17
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,910
I feel envious when I see you.

18
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,980
This is the prefect's office.

19
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,980
Watch your words.

20
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,790
Then we'll talk when we get back.

21
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,720
When we get back?

22
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,640
Even then, wait till we have free time.

23
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,850
Alright, alright.

24
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,260
Tell me,

25
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,420
if I were Qing—

26
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,230
no medical skills,
no forensic knowledge—

27
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,690
and tried to take revenge,

28
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,480
would I have ended up like her?

29
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,780
You wouldn't.

30
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,040
I know you sympathize with her.

31
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,880
But what she sought

32
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,360
was vengeance for evil.

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,800
What you want is
a world without injustice.

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,460
Even with the deepest hatred,

35
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,740
you could never bring yourself to kill.

36
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,130
You're right.

37
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,600
Our ancestors set the laws

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,030
based on reason and principle.

39
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,840
I hope Qing's loyalty
and righteousness

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,300
can help her keep her life.

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,210
Don't worry.

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,640
His Majesty has been troubled
by the gold heist case

43
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,970
that's still unsolved.

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,530
If Governor Wang solves this case
before his retirement,

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,690
the rewards he'll receive

46
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,390
will benefit his family
for three generations.

47
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,650
He won't let this opportunity slip away.

48
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,950
Governor Wang,

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,420
please let me go!

50
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,579
I don't want anything anymore!

51
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,100
Pang Fuliang,

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,420
you're causing trouble even in death!

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,030
You'll have no son to tend your grave.

54
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,579
All the scum have been dealt with.

55
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,630
Does it feel satisfying?

56
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,579
Absolutely.

57
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,140
Chi,

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,540
let's go.

59
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,210
I'll wait for you outside.

60
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,230
This may be goodbye for good.

61
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,860
What are your plans, Madam?

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,760
Governor Wang returned my dowry in full.

63
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,400
Before marriage,
I helped my father run an inn.

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,520
This money is enough to open an inn

65
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,810
for us to make a living.

66
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,220
Your Highness,

67
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,250
Wan,

68
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,200
we're good to go.

Are you thinking about the capital?

76
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,860
We'll arrive tomorrow.

77
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,450
I want to visit my parents' graves first.

78
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,820
Alright.

79
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,280
After I report to the court,

80
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
I'll go pick you up

81
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,030
the day after tomorrow.

82
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,160
No.

83
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,659
I was about to talk to you about that.

84
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,720
Once we're back in the capital,

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,500
we can't go on like this anymore.

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,270
Don't worry about
the Marquis of Zhongyong.

87
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,730
He wouldn't dare harm you.

88
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,260
What if he uses me to pressure you

89
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,990
into serving the Crown Prince?

90
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,850
Qin Yan saw you risk your life to save me.

91
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,890
He knows how you feel about me.

92
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,270
The Marquis of Zhongyong
is my elder in name.

93
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,409
If he uses my future as a bargaining chip…

94
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,409
He wouldn't dare.

95
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,540
Even so, we need to vindicate
Prince Jin and my father.

96
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,410
We can't afford any new complications.

97
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,610
At least in public,

98
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,410
I should only be your strategist—

99
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,210
Master Wan.

100
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Alright then.

101
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,030
As long as it puts your mind at ease,

102
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,360
I'll certainly comply.

103
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,870
But I'll never let you be pushed around.

104
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,140
Not by anyone.

105
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,300
Then Your Highness, please help me

106
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,620
make a name for myself in the capital.

107
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,710
Of course.

108
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,909
[Yan Che, the Crown Prince]

109
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,010
I, Qin Shu,
pay my respects to Your Highness.

110
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,080
[Qin Shu, the Marquis of Zhongyong]
[Zheng Baishi, the capital prefect]

111
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,820
Your Highness,

112
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,400
what troubles you?

113
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,270
Capital Prefect, go ahead.

114
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,220
The Marquis of Zhongyong

115
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,280
isn't an outsider.

116
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,280
Yes.

117
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,670
Just now, before His Majesty,

118
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,310
Prince Cheng openly questioned me

119
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,260
about the girls' case

120
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,140
and repeatedly implied that
His Highness has mishandled it.

121
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,200
His Majesty looked very displeased.

122
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,520
Yan Qi is such a conniving rat.

123
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,790
He keeps turning Father against me.

124
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,740
How shameless.

125
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,730
Your Highness, please calm down.

126
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,370
Though Prince Cheng
has acted against you again and again,

127
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,190
His Majesty's trust in you hasn't changed,

128
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,070
so he's no real threat.

129
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,550
If you can bring this case
to a successful close,

130
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,860
then no matter how hard
Prince Cheng schemes,

131
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,460
he won't be able to do a thing.

132
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,390
But His Majesty wants the case
solved by the end of the year.

133
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,120
New Year's Eve is approaching,

134
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,740
yet we still have no leads.

135
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,930
If all else fails…

136
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,050
we'll have to find a scapegoat

137
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,180
to break the deadlock first.

138
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:09,960
Your Highness,

139
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,760
don't do that.

140
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,670
It might offer temporary relief,

141
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,820
but if Prince Cheng found out,

142
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,080
it could land you in even deeper trouble.

143
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,500
Then what do you suggest?

144
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,340
Am I supposed
to let Yan Qi humiliate me

145
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,670
in front of everyone
at the New Year's banquet?

146
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,530
Your Highness,

147
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,310
I'd like to recommend someone.

148
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,710
This person has brilliant forensic skills

149
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,340
and is highly adept at deduction.

150
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,500
The murder cases in Jingzhou and Yuzhou

151
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,820
were successfully solved

152
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,480
thanks to his contributions.

153
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,980
Where is this person now?

154
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
If he's truly useful,

155
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,010
I'll reward him generously.

156
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,950
He'll arrive in the capital tomorrow.

157
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,050
Where is he currently employed?

158
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,310
I'll have him transferred over now.

159
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,820
Hold on.

160
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,820
Capital Prefect, don't rush.

161
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,150
This person is not a government official.

162
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,270
And due to his special background,

163
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,440
we'll need

164
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,030
to keep this operation under wraps.

165
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,220
This must be handled with extreme care.

166
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,680
If Prince Cheng finds out,

167
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,350
he's bound to interfere.

168
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,670
Rest assured, Your Highness.

169
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,450
I'll proceed with the utmost caution.

170
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,140
My Lady, the city gates are just ahead.

171
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,000
We're really back in the capital.

172
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,590
From today on,

173
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,100
there's no turning back for us.

174
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,090
Where did you pick it?

175
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,400
On a hill.

176
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,480
Do you like it?

177
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,660
Yes.

178
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,550
Are you headed to the palace?

179
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,810
I'll take you
to the Marquis Mansion first.

180
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,670
No.

181
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,670
If someone saw you,

182
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,050
how would you explain it?

183
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,960
I'll just say

184
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,320
I was escorting Yue Ning.

185
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,360
She's returning
to the Grand Princess's residence.

186
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,070
Alright then.

187
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,670
Be careful at the Marquis Mansion.

188
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,270
Don't compromise yourself for them.

189
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,980
Keep the Red Flare and eagle whistle
with you at all times.

190
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,890
Don't worry.
I won't let myself be taken advantage of.

191
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,370
There are too many eyes here.

192
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,370
You should go now.

193
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,220
Pass.

194
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,640
Wait for me.

195
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,980
His Highness treats you so well.

196
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,370
I'll learn to treat him well too.

197
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,980
Ning,

198
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,040
I should avoid
being involved with the Qin family.

199
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,100
Once we're in the capital,

200
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,070
I'm entrusting Wan to your care.

201
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,740
Little Wan'er is basically my sister now.

202
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,690
Chi, you don't get to entrust her to me

203
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,620
unless you're my brother-in-law.

204
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,120
My wife

205
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,080
can only be Wan and no one else.

206
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,810
Chi,

207
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,430
it'd be better
if you let me take care of her.

208
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,140
I promise I'll make sure
Wan enjoys herself.

209
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,090
Don't get any ideas.

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,030
Now that I'm back,

211
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,500
your days of partying and fooling around

212
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,580
are over.

213
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,530
I...

214
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,550
[Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion]

215
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,820
Father,

216
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,560
Mother.

217
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,370
No need.

218
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,150
Greetings, Father, Mother.

219
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,860
How was it?

220
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,190
You must be exhausted from the journey.

221
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,030
I'm not tired.

222
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,230
Don't worry, Mother.

223
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Did everything go smoothly?

224
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,190
Yes.

225
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,880
Father,

226
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,620
I've brought all three of my cousins back.

227
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,190
Good.

228
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,270
This one is Xiang.

229
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,300
This is Shuang.

230
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,120
And this

231
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,020
is Wan.

232
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,100
So you're Qin Wan?

233
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,970
Greetings, Uncle.

234
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,740
When I last saw you,

235
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,370
you were just a little girl
babbling baby talk.

236
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,360
And look at you now, all grown up.

237
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,790
Xiang and Shuang

238
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,130
have both turned into fine young women.

239
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,160
-Thank you for your compliment.
-Thank you, Aunt.

240
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,850
[Hu, the Marquis of Zhongyong's wife]

241
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,080
You must be hungry.

242
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,330
Let's head inside for a meal

243
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,190
and catch up over food.

244
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,700
Come.

245
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,750
Let's go.

246
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,910
You must be tired.

247
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,840
I'm not tired, Mother.

248
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,950
[Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion]

249
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,980
Usually, Yu is the only girl in the house,

250
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,270
but now that you're all here,

251
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,580
the place is going to feel so lively.

252
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,610
Mother,

253
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,090
we've already had lunch.

254
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,330
Why isn't Yu back yet?

255
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,620
The Empress summoned her today,

256
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,700
so she went into the palace.

257
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,100
Wan,

258
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,110
though you grew up
in the Medicine King Valley,

259
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,110
you've been taught proper manners.

260
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,310
Uncle,

261
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,550
because of my poor health,

262
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,430
my late father never pushed me
to learn needlework and the like.

263
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,960
But when it came to manners,

264
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,030
even the slightest misstep
would earn me a scolding.

265
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,830
That's just how my brother was.

266
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,140
Easygoing and carefree most days,

267
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,740
but he was always strict
about manners and conduct.

268
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,490
That's why

269
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,190
you've turned out
to be such a fine young woman.

270
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,320
Yes, indeed.

271
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,840
It's a pity that

272
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,820
you don't look anything like your father.

273
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,630
You're right, Aunt.

274
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,700
I've wondered
if I take after my late mother.

275
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,720
But she passed so early.

276
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,220
I never got the chance to see her.

277
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,470
Aunt, do you still remember

278
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,080
what my mother looked like?

279
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,130
How could I ever forget?

280
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,980
Look.

281
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,870
Your eyebrows and eyes

282
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,840
are exactly like hers.

283
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,070
She was such a gentle
and thoughtful woman.

284
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,700
If only

285
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,160
she had been in better health.

286
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,390
Let's not talk about those sad things.

287
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,240
Wan,

288
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,010
have a seat.

289
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,980
Sit down.

290
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,800
It's not often
you girls come to the capital.

291
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,100
The New Year is
just around the corner.

292
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,510
By then, let Yan

293
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,270
give you a tour.

294
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,380
Really?

295
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,520
Of course.

296
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,090
The markets here are far livelier
than those in Jingzhou.

297
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,630
Are Yan and the girls back?

298
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,510
[Qin Zhaoyu, the legitimate daughter
of the Marquis of Zhongyong]

299
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,580
Greetings, Father, Mother.

300
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,670
You've had a long journey, Yan.

301
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,430
Are these

302
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,960
the two cousins from Jingzhou and Wan?

303
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,190
Yu,

304
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,790
this is Xiang.

305
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,930
This is Shuang.

306
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,820
And this is Wan.

307
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,690
Greetings, Xiang, Shuang.

308
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,340
Wan.

309
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,600
Greetings, Yu.

310
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,460
I used to be
the youngest one in the family.

311
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,810
Now that you're here,

312
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,010
finally, someone is younger than me.

313
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,930
Look how happy Yu is.

314
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,280
You're back so late.

315
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,780
Did you eat in the palace?

316
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,470
I did.

317
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,620
It happened that

318
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,070
the Crown Prince
came to greet the Empress today,

319
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,870
so Her Majesty kept me for lunch.

320
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,100
I had to say I was in a hurry
to see my cousins

321
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,760
before she agreed to let me go.

322
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,700
Wan and the others
have been traveling nonstop.

323
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,620
They must be tired.

324
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,350
They should get some rest soon.

325
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,170
Dear, you're always so thoughtful.

326
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,790
From now on,

327
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,930
this is your home.

328
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,870
If you ever need anything,

329
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,270
feel free

330
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,670
to tell your aunt.

331
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,680
Let's go.

332
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,470
Father.

333
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,920
His Majesty lost his temper
with the Crown Prince again today.

334
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,040
Stay

335
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,980
out of this.

336
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,980
Don't ask the Crown Prince about it.

337
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,790
But...

338
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,670
If you truly wish
to become the Crown Princess,

339
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,000
you mustn't appear to meddle in politics.

340
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,360
I understand.

341
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,220
You should get close
to your three cousins,

342
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,260
especially Wan.

343
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,040
I understand.

344
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,400
When she arrived earlier,

345
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,829
she was so poised

346
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,980
and tactful,

347
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,579
reminding me

348
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,190
of her father's gentlemanly grace.

349
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,150
Keep a close eye
on Qin Xiang and Qin Shuang.

350
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,950
Qin An's case

351
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,869
caused a huge stir at court.

352
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:26,980
If the Crown Prince hadn't
spoken in my defense before His Majesty,

353
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,220
I might've been blamed

354
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,550
for failing to keep my household in order.

355
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,660
The Qin family must not be involved

356
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,150
in any more scandals.

357
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,350
I understand.

358
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,000
Should we help move things forward
between Yan Chi and Wan?

359
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,200
It's not as simple as you think.

360
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,060
Prince Rui and his son have always
kept out of power struggles.

361
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,110
They won't openly
side with the Crown Prince

362
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,110
just for a marriage.

363
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,700
Besides,

364
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,920
with Yan Chi's status,

365
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,020
his marriage

366
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,220
would need His Majesty's approval.

367
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,940
If we interfere,

368
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,120
His Majesty will become suspicious.

369
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,870
Yes.

370
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,350
This time,

371
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,390
Yan Chi parted ways with you

372
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,020
before even entering the capital

373
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,150
to avoid suspicion.

374
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,900
As for how he really feels about Wan,

375
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,610
let's wait and see.

376
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,720
Just go with the flow.

377
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes.

378
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,990
Lately,

379
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,980
Prince Cheng has been

380
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,020
handling matters decisively

381
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,740
and has won favor with His Majesty.

382
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Noble Consort Su

383
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,440
rose in status thanks to her son

384
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
and became His Majesty's favorite.

385
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,590
The Empress and Crown Prince are
in a tough spot now.

386
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,300
Make sure

387
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,190
there's no repeat of what happened

388
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,430
with Liu Renli.

389
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,840
I know I was wrong, Father.

390
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,700
I've recommended Wan

391
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,410
to the Crown Prince.

392
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,640
If she can help him out of this crisis,

393
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,370
the Qin family's standing

394
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,950
in his eyes

395
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,480
will rise even higher.

396
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,160
And Wan's future may not be

397
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,950
any less promising than Yu's.

398
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,490
Father, are you thinking of

399
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,030
making Wan
the Crown Prince's concubine?

400
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,190
But Yu truly loves the Crown Prince.

401
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,400
Will true love secure the marquisate?

402
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,730
In our dynasty, noble titles

403
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,630
cannot be inherited
without great achievements.

404
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,910
It took

405
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,060
all I had to become

406
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,590
the Minister of Personnel.

407
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,060
If we don't prove our worth
by supporting the future emperor,

408
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,720
how will you

409
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,820
hold on to the family legacy?

410
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,750
I'll keep that in mind, Father.

411
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,990
My Lady,

412
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,770
are you thinking about your parents?

413
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,780
My home was just over there.

414
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,940
I wonder

415
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,040
where my parents' remains are now.

416
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,540
Now that we've returned,

417
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,900
we can start
searching for them bit by bit.

418
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,150
My Lady, do you know why Lady Yu

419
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,570
went to the palace today?

420
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,080
I heard from a maid that

421
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,190
the Crown Princess will be selected
after the New Year.

422
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:36,910
It's very likely

423
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,690
to be Lady Yu.

424
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,490
If Yu

425
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,870
is willing,

426
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,990
it would be her dream come true.

427
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,170
It's good news for the Qin family too.

428
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,080
Lady Yu is quite pretty,

429
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,290
but honestly,

430
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,190
if you dress up,

431
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,050
you'll be even prettier than her.

432
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,280
Words like that can stir up trouble.

433
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,070
Don't say that again.

434
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,460
Got it.

435
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,390
I was just trying to make you smile.

436
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,970
It's getting late and chilly.

437
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,640
Why aren't you resting in your room, Wan?

438
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,770
You may catch a cold.

439
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,070
The courtyard looked so lovely.

440
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,790
I just wanted to take a walk.

441
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,430
Cousin Yan, what brings you here?

442
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,610
I came to invite you to the outer study.

443
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,710
Father has important matters
to discuss with you.

444
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,260
Moyi.

445
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,360
Madam.

446
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,670
Yu, take a break.

447
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,220
Just a moment, Mother.

448
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,350
I'll join you after I finish this page.

449
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,020
Even His Majesty

450
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,150
has praised your calligraphy.

451
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,620
You don't have to practice every day.

452
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,700
Every day's practice

453
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,950
matters.

454
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,590
Yu,

455
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,460
did the Empress

456
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,610
say anything definite today?

457
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,150
Miss Feng was there too.

458
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,870
The Empress is dignified.

459
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,000
She didn't say much.

460
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,110
You mean Feng Chenbi, the legitimate
daughter of the Duke of Zhong?

461
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,040
She's clearly coveting
the Crown Princess's title.

462
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,830
Don't worry, Mother.

463
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
Father is the Minister of Personnel

464
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,570
and also the Crown Prince's mentor.

465
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,870
In terms of influence at court

466
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,670
and loyalty to the Crown Prince,

467
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,980
the Empress knows whose daughter

468
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,740
is the best choice.

469
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,200
But right now,

470
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,740
you're no longer

471
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,390
the only girl in this family.

472
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,720
Even your father

473
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,700
praised Wan's looks and bearing

474
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,460
after meeting her.

475
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,650
He called her to the outer study just now.

476
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,060
If the Crown Prince sees her…

477
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,620
Do you think I can't compare to Wan?

478
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,120
Silly girl,

479
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,610
how would I think that?

480
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,620
It's just that the selection
keeps getting delayed,

481
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,860
and it makes me uneasy.

482
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,260
Wan is certainly outstanding,

483
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,190
but my reputation
as the capital's most talented lady

484
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,670
is well-deserved.

485
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,220
The Crown Prince and I were
childhood friends.

486
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,670
Mother, there's no need to fear
she'll take what's mine.

487
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,960
She's the foster daughter
of the Marquis of Anyang now

488
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,500
and backed by the Grand Princess.

489
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,300
Mother,

490
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,850
the capital is full of noble families.

491
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,300
If we start doubting ourselves over this,

492
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,220
we've already lost the upper hand.

493
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,020
I understand Father's intentions.

494
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,280
Just take good care of Wan and the others.

495
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,900
It'll be good for my brother's future too.

496
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,190
I'm worried that

497
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,110
she'll try to reach higher

498
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,980
after meeting someone more powerful.

499
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,180
Don't worry, Mother.

500
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,090
If that day ever comes,

501
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,350
I won't let her have her way.

502
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,760
These are

503
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,460
all kinds of ledgers and deeds,

504
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,910
reviewed by the elders of the family.

505
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,950
The second branch's properties

506
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,210
are listed on them too.

507
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,130
Check if anything is missing.

508
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,950
Uncle, it was thanks to your help
that I could return to the capital.

509
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,110
These properties

510
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,640
should rightfully be managed by you.

511
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,530
Nonsense.

512
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,150
They were left to you by your parents.

513
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,680
Naturally, you should be the one
to keep them.

514
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,810
It's just that

515
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,500
your father was never one
for worldly affairs,

516
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,230
so he didn't leave much behind.

517
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,020
When you get married,

518
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,590
your aunt and I will add to your dowry.

519
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,300
Father,

520
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,140
Wan just got back.

521
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,980
Why are you talking about her dowry?

522
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,870
It sounds like
you can't wait to marry her off.

523
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,270
Don't get the wrong idea.

524
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,070
That's not what I meant at all.

525
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,460
Then I'll gratefully accept them, Uncle.

526
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,580
That's more like it.

527
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,350
Sit, sit.

528
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,510
What a shame.

529
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,130
Your father was so devoted to medicine.

530
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,810
He passed away before he could see

531
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,800
what you've achieved.

532
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,850
It's such a pity.

533
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,220
Father's heard that
you're not only skilled in medicine

534
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,360
but also helped solve several major cases.

535
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,460
He's truly glad your father has someone
to carry on his legacy.

536
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,660
Regarding the cases,

537
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,500
I haven't yet apologized to you

538
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,340
for what happened with Uncle An.

539
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
Qin An got what he deserved.

540
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,540
It has nothing to do with you.

541
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,340
If anything, I should thank you.

542
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,830
Before it was too late,

543
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,870
you stepped in

544
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,420
and rid the Qin family
of that disgraceful, immoral scumbag.

545
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,030
What surprised me most

546
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,630
was how you, a delicate girl,

547
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,630
faced all those corpses and remains

548
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,380
without flinching.

549
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,670
I was scared at first, of course.

550
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,060
But the more I saw,

551
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,540
the more I realized—

552
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,150
death is simply a flame going out.

553
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,390
The fear we feel

554
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,520
is just an illusion.

555
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,460
Naturally, I'm not afraid anymore.

556
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,220
Your strong character

557
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,390
puts most men to shame.

558
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,150
In that case,

559
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,930
I want to ask you

560
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,430
for a favor.

561
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,640
Anything you say.

562
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,280
For the past few months,

563
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,500
several women

564
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,060
in the capital
have been raped and murdered.

565
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,570
The killer has yet to be caught.

566
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,790
This case concerns the safety
of all in the capital.

567
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,150
I took the liberty

568
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,440
of recommending you
to the capital prefect.

569
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,290
I wonder if you're willing

570
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,790
to assist the authorities in this case?

571
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,260
I'm willing to do whatever I can

572
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
to help bring peace back to the people.

573
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,320
Good, good.

574
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,180
Please rise.

575
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,350
Very well.

576
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,120
[Prince Cheng's Mansion]

577
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,040
Your Highness,

578
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,120
our men at the capital prefecture

579
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,460
[Yan Qi, Prince Cheng]

580
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,920
have disposed of the exhibits.

581
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,110
Any movement

582
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,760
from the Qin family?

583
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,830
Young Master Qin Yan returned
with his cousins today.

584
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,760
No other visitors other than them.

585
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,380
Only two days left till New Year's Eve.

586
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,680
I don't believe
that old fox Qin Shu would just be

587
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,690
a sitting duck.

588
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,680
The capital prefect has no leads at all.

589
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Forget two days—

590
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,700
even if they had
until the Lantern Festival,

591
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,310
they'd still come up empty.

592
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,700
The Marquis of Zhongyong

593
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,290
has staked his entire family's future

594
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,530
on that worthless fool.

595
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,880
To protect him,

596
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,870
he may even stoop so low

597
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,170
as to frame someone.

598
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,740
Keep a close eye on the Qin family.

599
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,420
If they dare make a risky move,

600
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,430
I'll take advantage of it

601
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,840
to wipe them all out in one blow.

602
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,980
Yes.

603
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,090
[Yan Huai, the Emperor]

604
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,770
No need to push yourself too hard.

605
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,570
I

606
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,350
allow you to take back your piece.

607
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:10,920
No need.

608
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,220
You handled those cases
in Jingzhou and Yuzhou well.

609
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,880
I thought you'd finally
learned to think ahead.

610
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,680
But clearly,

611
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,430
you're still a lousy player.

612
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,370
I spend every day
thinking about how to do my job right.

613
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,560
How would I have time

614
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,770
to think about this silly game?

615
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,890
He calls this a silly game.

616
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,440
You're the only one

617
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,780
who dares

618
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,080
talk to me like that.

619
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,980
Have you really decided

620
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,430
to join the Ministry of Justice?

621
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,230
Yes.

622
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,280
That means from now on,

623
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,700
Shuoxi will no longer
have a young marshal.

624
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,080
Will you regret it?

625
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,540
A capable man can make his mark anywhere.

626
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,670
If Your Majesty truly cares for me,

627
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,670
could you give me a high-ranking post

628
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,700
with the freedom to recruit my own people?

629
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,140
That way, if my father scolds me,

630
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,270
I can defend myself.

631
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,540
You want to drag me into the fight

632
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,890
between you and your father?

633
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,090
Fine.

634
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,640
The Empress Dowager is
getting on in years.

635
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,220
If you're willing to stay in the capital

636
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,550
and spend more time with her,

637
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,990
I'll do you

638
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
this small favor.

639
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

640
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,390
The capital prefect has been waiting.

641
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,150
[Morgue]

642
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,980
Thank you, Constable Zhan.

643
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,310
Wan,

644
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,680
this is Capital Prefect Zheng.

645
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,040
Greetings, my lord.

646
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,260
Mr. Qin Wan, I'm deeply grateful

647
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,780
to have your help.

648
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,060
Please.

649
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,400
Capital Prefect.

650
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,390
This is Mr. Fang,
the head of the coroner's guild.

651
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,590
He performed the initial examination.

652
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,350
Mr. Fang.

653
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,820
The postmortem report.

654
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,460
The first body was found
a month and a half ago.

655
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,590
The second was discovered two weeks later.

656
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,740
And the third,

657
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,600
just two weeks ago.

658
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,920
Where was the first victim found?

659
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,060
Beside the bridge pier at the Yushui River
in the south of the city.

660
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,980
She lived in the southern district.

661
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,500
When her family reported it, they said

662
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,540
she went out the night before
to buy vinegar

663
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,680
and never returned.

664
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,680
Are there steps
by the bridge at the Yushui River?

665
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,280
No.

666
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,120
Then that means

667
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,610
the riverbank

668
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,670
was only where her body was dumped.

669
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,440
She must have been killed somewhere else.

670
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,160
What makes you say that?

671
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,030
Based on the bruising on her neck

672
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,830
and the petechial hemorrhaging
in her eyes,

673
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,870
it's clear that

674
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,740
she was strangled

675
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,950
and died from asphyxiation.

676
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,530
But the backs of her hips,

677
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,160
the backs of her calves,

678
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,610
and her heels

679
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,430
all show large areas of bruising

680
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,360
without any signs of bleeding.

681
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,430
That suggests

682
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,920
she was dragged down
some steps after death.

683
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,330
There are no steps by the Yushui River,

684
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,390
so where did she get

685
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,630
these injuries?

686
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,210
The second victim

687
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,870
was found in an abandoned house

688
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,610
in the southwest.

689
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,720
Lock your doors and windows.

690
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,840
Watch out for fire and thieves.

691
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,270
After delivering dinner to her brother,
who was working

692
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,500
in the southern district,

693
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,570
she disappeared.

694
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,530
Her brother reported her missing
the next day,

695
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,600
and two days later,

696
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,330
her body was discovered.

697
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,870
Because the two victims had no connection,

698
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,130
we didn't see their deaths

699
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,240
as one case.

700
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,840
Two weeks later,

701
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,500
the third victim was found.

702
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,430
She lived in the Hao Village
outside the city.

703
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,000
That day, she went to the West Market
to buy New Year's goods.

704
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,720
Wake up.

705
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,880
But unfortunately…

706
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,830
Someone died!

707
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,910
Someone died!

708
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,270
One detail
doesn't match the postmortem report.

709
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,199
Based on injuries to the private parts,

710
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,659
it appears all three women

711
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,920
were sexually assaulted after death.

712
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,690
What?

713
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:18,810
Pardon me,

714
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,690
but how can you be certain

715
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,989
it happened after and not before death?

716
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,980
Just like the dragging marks
on the first two bodies,

717
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,310
there were tears in the genital area

718
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,460
but no bleeding.

719
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,600
The third body hasn't
decayed too much yet.

720
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,190
I might be able to find more clues

721
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,590
by examining the organs.

722
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,699
Capital Prefect,

723
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,469
I need to perform an autopsy.

724
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,139
An autopsy?

725
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,440
[Precision in Every Detail]

726
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,080
Greetings, Your Highness.

727
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,390
-Your Highness, what are you doing?
-You…

728
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,790
The main hall is that way.

729
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,150
Not here.

730
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,870
It's you, Young Master Qin.

731
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,200
I thought it was my runaway servant.

732
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,450
Greetings, Your Highness.

733
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,580
This is a restricted area for postmortems.

734
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,190
Why has someone unrelated been allowed in?

735
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Capital Prefect,

736
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,040
if I'm not mistaken,

737
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,650
this man

738
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,060
isn't registered with your office.

739
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,140
You're not mistaken, Qi.

740
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,620
Master Wan is with me.

741
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,790
Chi?

742
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,350
This case is of great importance.

743
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,550
Even if he's with you,

744
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,660
he can't just walk into a restricted area.

745
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,820
Qi, you may not know—

746
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,850
after the New Year,

747
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,020
I'll officially join
the Ministry of Justice.

748
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,750
His Majesty personally allowed me
to help the capital prefect with the case.

749
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,710
He's also

750
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,980
allowed me to bring Master Wan in

751
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,830
as a forensic expert.

752
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,150
Joining the Ministry of Justice?

753
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,080
I see.

754
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,220
Chi, you've been known
as the invincible commander.

755
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,080
You'll surely be

756
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,100
a great help to the Crown Prince.

757
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,650
Looks like this case will be
cracked in no time.

758
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,840
His Majesty allowed me

759
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,610
to assist the capital prefect
with the case,

760
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,180
not to help the Crown Prince.

761
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,350
Assisting the capital prefect is
an official duty.

762
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,180
Helping the Crown Prince

763
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,980
is a family matter.

764
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,150
If official and private matters
get mixed up,

765
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,350
even I would have a hard time
explaining it to His Majesty.

766
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,670
Looks like that runaway servant

767
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,900
really got to me.

768
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,370
The guards mistook a young lad

769
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,660
with a similar build

770
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,550
for the runaway

771
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,120
and ran after him.

772
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,420
It was all a misunderstanding.

773
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,390
Master Wan,

774
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,000
don't take offense.

775
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,070
Since everything's cleared up,

776
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,680
I'll take my leave now.

777
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,140
Young Master Qin,
you're not on duty, are you?

778
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,540
Shall we leave together?

779
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,620
I...

780
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,190
Qi.

781
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,160
Young Master Qin was a great help to me

782
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,580
on my way back to the capital.

783
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,840
I've promised to buy him drinks tonight.

784
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,790
Young Master Qin,

785
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,280
why don't you
head to the restaurant first?

786
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,870
Alright.

787
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,100
I'll go now.

788
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,540
Alright.

789
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,340
Come by my place another day.

790
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,370
It's time we had a proper chat.

791
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,910
Sure.

792
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,390
Let's go look somewhere else.

793
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,090
I don't believe a small-time nobody

794
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,990
can stir up so much trouble.

795
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:46,700
Let's go.

796
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,290
Thank you for your help, Your Highness.

797
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,440
With your support,

798
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,830
this case might be solved.

799
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,160
With Master Wan's help,

800
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,620
the case will be solved very soon.

801
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
Capital Prefect,

802
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,640
the cases in Jingzhou and Yuzhou

803
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,300
were all solved by Master Wan.

804
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,040
Heaven finally smiles upon us!

805
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,730
I've just made a discovery.

806
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,680
Please, Capital Prefect,
review it with me.

807
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,880
Please, please.

808
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,230
[Postmortem Report]

809
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,590
I found orange seeds and fish

810
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,280
in the victim's stomach.

811
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,610
Her last meal

812
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,690
must have included oranges and fish.

813
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,750
Typically, food takes about four hours

814
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,150
to digest in the stomach.

815
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,350
While the fish has mostly broken down,

816
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,860
there are still visible remnants.

817
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,660
So

818
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,100
she had her last meal

819
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,230
roughly three hours

820
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,660
before death.

821
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,090
Impressive. Very impressive.

822
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,020
But what does knowing her last meal

823
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,060
have to do with solving the case?

824
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,190
Constable Zhan said

825
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,980
the victim lived
in the Hao Village outside the city

826
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,180
and had planned to go to the West Market
for New Year's goods.

827
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,290
She would've likely eaten
at the West Market.

828
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,650
Oranges are common,

829
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,310
but fresh fish

830
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,720
is rare this far inland.

831
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,830
And even if available,

832
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,150
it's very expensive

833
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,580
and mostly found in wealthy households
or high-end restaurants.

834
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,100
But the victim wore ordinary clothes

835
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,430
and was of modest means.

836
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,930
So she likely ate at an affordable eatery.

837
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,350
But at the West Market,

838
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,540
there aren't many eateries
that serve fresh fish.

839
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
We can start there

840
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,290
to locate the eatery where she ate

841
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,040
and then use the digestion time

842
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,370
to estimate where she might've gone next.

843
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,630
Thank you for the guidance.

844
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,020
Bad news.

845
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,810
Young Master Qin,

846
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,250
the third victim's clothes are missing.

847
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,450
How's that possible?

848
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,830
That's not right.

849
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,020
During the initial examination
at the prefect's office,

850
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,430
I personally

851
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,790
placed all the belongings into the basket

852
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,390
and had them sent here with the bodies.

853
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,830
Mr. Fang, did you see their undergarments

854
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,690
during the initial examination?

855
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,020
Now that you mention it,

856
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,190
no.

857
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,650
All three victims

858
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,620
had their outer and inner garments,

859
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,820
but their undergarments were missing.

860
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,040
The killer

861
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,780
likely has a fetish

862
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,080
for women's clothing.

863
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,280
What do you mean by that?

864
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,470
Capital Prefect,

865
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,330
are you familiar
with your wife's dressing habits?

866
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,060
How would I know something like that?

867
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,530
I meant no offense.

868
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,910
Please take a look.

869
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,140
These clothes
are made of ordinary fabric,

870
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,350
but the stitching is exquisite.

871
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,390
The fastenings and ties are
completely intact.

872
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,580
This suggests the killer

873
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,080
was so familiar with women's clothing

874
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,830
that he could redress the victims fully

875
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,580
without damaging
a single thread or fastening.

876
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,100
That's not something
just any man could manage.

877
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,060
Capital Prefect, you don't know
your wife's dressing habits

878
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,100
after spending so many years with her.

879
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,350
Yet this killer

880
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,980
managed to put on every piece of clothing

881
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,910
for the three victims,

882
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,770
except for their undergarments.

883
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,070
Zhan Yang, Mr. Fang,

884
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,290
go find out

885
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,030
who transported the bodies.

886
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,910
Yes.

887
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,020
This involves the killer's private fetish,

888
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,310
which he certainly
wouldn't display publicly.

889
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,170
It'll be difficult to find clues.

890
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,850
One more thing.

891
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,750
This is the black frostbite ointment

892
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,430
I found on the third victim.

893
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,710
Her nails were neatly trimmed,

894
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,790
so she cared about cleanliness.

895
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,610
And she had no signs
of frostbite herself.

896
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,730
If she had

897
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,100
gotten this ointment on her
before being attacked,

898
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,830
she would've cleaned it off right away.

899
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,140
It could only have ended up
under her nails

900
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,670
if she scratched the killer

901
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,270
when fighting back.

902
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,230
Only people
who work with their hands in the winter

903
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,560
suffer from frostbite.

904
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,180
The killer could afford it

905
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,020
and was willing to spend money on it,

906
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,790
which means he not only
has a decent income

907
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,120
but also takes very good care
of his hands.

908
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,740
That rules out ordinary farmers

909
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,700
or blacksmiths.

910
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,120
He likely makes a living
with fine craftsmanship.

911
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,180
Someone who can afford this ointment

912
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,660
and possesses fine skills

913
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,190
must also have his own shop.

914
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,500
Based on the same drag marks

915
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,020
on the first and third victims,

916
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,580
I suspect the murders

917
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,020
all took place

918
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,660
in a building with stairs.

919
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,960
The killer likely dragged the bodies

920
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,090
up and down the stairs to hide them

921
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,190
before dumping them at night.

922
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,830
A craftsman who knows women's clothing,
earns a decent living,

923
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,300
has both a home and a shop

924
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,600
where he could commit three murders…

925
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,880
The killer

926
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,290
killed the three victims
in the same building,

927
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,890
so he's likely living alone.

928
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,690
Though a jeweler

929
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,580
would also know women's clothing,

930
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,200
no jewelry shop or gold store

931
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,800
could possibly be run by one person.

932
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,630
It'd be too hard to avoid being seen.

933
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,940
So he's very likely…

934
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,170
-a tailor.
-A tailor.

935
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,180
Thank you for pointing me
in the right direction.

936
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,910
I'll look into it immediately.

937
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,910
Wait.

938
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,560
There are many tailor shops

939
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,620
at the West Market.

940
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,040
And the three dumping sites are different.

941
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,610
There's only one day left
before the deadline.

942
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,540
Capital Prefect,

943
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,870
where do you even begin?

944
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,990
Young Master Qin, do you have any ideas?

945
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,870
All I can do is find clues

946
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,870
from the autopsy.

947
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,810
Tracking the killer isn't
my area of expertise.

948
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,560
Now that we finally have a lead,

949
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,020
we don't have the time to run it down.

950
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,230
Do you have a map of the capital?

951
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,990
The map is stored at the prefect's office.

952
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,210
If you need it,

953
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,100
feel free to get it.

954
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,530
Don't lose hope, Capital Prefect.

955
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,760
Give me the capital map

956
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,650
and four hours.

957
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,370
I'll find the crime scene.

958
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,100
You mean that?

959
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,580
Catching killers

960
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,500
is my specialty.

961
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,610
I'll have a carriage prepared

962
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,010
and return
to the prefect's office at once.

963
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,680
[Jinyi Clothing Store]

964
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,950
Sir.

965
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,610
Are you here for a wedding dress?

966
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,890
Sir.

967
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,840
Is this enough money for a wedding dress?

968
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,960
This isn't nearly enough.

969
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,360
But I'm my mother's only daughter.

970
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,870
She wants me
to have a proper, beautiful wedding.

971
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,810
Please,

972
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,720
do me a favor.

973
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,040
Sir?

974
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,940
Come and get measured.
