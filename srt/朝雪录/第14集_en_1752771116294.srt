5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yan Chi is so fond of Qin Jiu

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No wonder Marquis Yang accepted her as his adopted daughter

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So it makes sense

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you think Qin Jiu has feelings for Yan Chi?

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Jiu Niangzi is not a narrow-minded person

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I can't see it at the moment

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yan Chi is very powerful in the army

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He is close to the Crown Prince and Prince Chen

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If we can let Yan Chi and our marquis go closer by playing the zither

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Crown Prince's reputation will be over the Prince Chen

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But Yan Chi is always very particular

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He is not affectionate

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Jiu Niangzi is not

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I know

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's not make a decision now

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's talk about it after we go back to the capital

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How do you feel about the ladies on the way here?

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I think the fifth lady is the best among the three ladies

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So it's a bit complicated

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So it's not enough

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sixth lady's speech is not smooth

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm afraid it's not important

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But the nine ladies' thinking

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm afraid no one can solve the problem in the capital

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So you think the zither is better than the jade?

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The eighth lady is too smooth

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm afraid she's better than the ninth lady in the city

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You mean father should put the zither in front of the jade?

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The ninth lady is good

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But the relationship between the second and the marquis

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If the ninth lady enters the palace

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm afraid she won't be able to solve the problem

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If she enters the palace

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm afraid she won't miss the marquis

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Qin Jiu is like a double sword

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Good use

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Can kill demons and demons

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Not good use

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can easily turn yourself over

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But she is Qin after all

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No matter how you control it

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You have to be one with the marquis

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
One loss is one loss

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But in the future, you must be careful

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Never let Qin Jiu and our marquis

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Separate

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I understand

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Drinking medicine

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why haven't they come back yet?

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Will they be on the way?

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't worry

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't ask

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't know where they are now

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Look, I've already heated the medicine twice

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If they don't come back, I can't do anything

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Anyway, little sister, don't blame me

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Then I'll go find him

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What are you doing?

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm here to see you

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why are you back so late?

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you come back later

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Little sister should let me and you take a bath

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Come back

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't worry, I'm fine

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, drink medicine

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Master, I'm fine

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If the target of the cultivator is really big brother

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
After he murdered the little pine

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a violent thing

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm afraid he can't wait

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Will directly hit the big brother

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then I'll go guard

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Just rely on the materials sent by the surname

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's not necessarily that you can keep your wish

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's just your legs and feet are tired

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's the use of going?

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Big brother is even more helpless

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He can't even protect himself

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Besides, sister-in-law is still sick

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't worry

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have received the message

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The black armor is already at the foot of the mountain

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It will arrive in two hours

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let me and Bai Feng go to watch these two hours

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You haven't recovered yet

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It was hard enough just now

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't be hurt again

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Correct

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But it's just a thief

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We are still afraid

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Mr. Jiu said no

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Correct

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't worry

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We are just going to check the terrain

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Help them arrange some people

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You go to find Yue Ning

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We will come back after lunch

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Won't be too hard

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Correct

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I promise not to hurt

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Promise

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He wants to climb high

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Just let him climb

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you care about him

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I am his sister

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Can't watch him suffer

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm talking about the people who are in danger

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What are you talking about?

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's your good sister Qin Xiang

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
She climbed up to the Bai family

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Last night, sister Wu sneaked out

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This morning, I found a jade butterfly in her makeup

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I suspect she went to see Mr. Bai

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Are you sure that jade butterfly was sent by Mr. Bai?

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That butterfly is very high

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's not something ordinary people can have

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Moreover, sister Wu is very tall

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
In this prairie

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Except for Mr. Bai and Mr. Yan

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Who else can he fall in love with?

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I will take the jade butterfly this time

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sister Jiu

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you think Mr. Bai is sincere to sister Wu?

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Whether sincere or not

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
With the background of the Bai family

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Mr. Bai's marriage

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm afraid it's hard to make it yourself

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Men and women meet alone

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Only not good for Qin Xiang

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Then you go to persuade him

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He only has feelings for you

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He won't listen to me

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now this prairie is not safe

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You and him don't want to go around

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We have to leave without permission

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
When we catch the murderer

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We will set off immediately

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
During this period

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You just don't let him do it

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's good to destroy your own future

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I can only do this

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This place is high

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Arrange two more people to guard

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Master

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Jiu Niang is not here

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let me help you

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No need

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My leg is broken

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't believe you are okay

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What?

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Then I'll give you a eye-catching wound

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No no no

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The sound should be from the pharmacy

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll go and see

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't go first

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's dangerous

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's okay, I will be careful

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You go back to the room and watch Qin Xiang

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't go out

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Fulin stays

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If brother comes to me

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let him go to the pharmacy as soon as possible

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Mother, be careful

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Sister Jiu is so powerful

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Have you seen the murderer?

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Not yet

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I heard the sound

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm afraid the murderer will be ruthless

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I went out to watch the scene

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He ran away in the middle of the night

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Bai Feng has gone after him

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I didn't see anyone when I arrived

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Bai Feng has gone after him

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No one won when I arrived

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Xiang

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Stop talking

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Han Zhen

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't wait

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't wait

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't wait for what

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't wait for what

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Should be able to save a life

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Steward Dong

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He said don't wait

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What do you mean

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Dacheng is about to recover

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I was going to go home to get married in a few days

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What he meant

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Should be letting his fiancee not wait for him

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't be sad

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He only needs to rest for a while

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Just get married a few days later

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Thanks to the magic of the nine-woman-sister

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Dacheng has regained a life

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Master

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I can't let him run away

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But the traces are going to the west

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If it's normal

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That kid can't run away

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
West

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The west is the inn

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
All the female guests live there

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Wuji

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You must not be confused

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Bai family is a big family

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you know your father's reputation

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I won't let you in

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:20,540
Qin Lang is still a

220
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
You are a virgin

221
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,540
Some things are natural

222
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,540
OK OK OK

223
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,540
I am a virgin

224
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
I am a virgin

225
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
I am a virgin

226
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,540
I am a virgin

227
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
I am a virgin

228
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,540
I am a virgin

229
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
I can't care about your virginity

230
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Help

231
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Help

232
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
Sister Wu was caught

233
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,540
If Sun Hao Yue doesn't go to see her

234
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
She will kill Sister Wu

235
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,540
Uncle Dong, go to the police

236
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
OK, go

237
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,540
Sun Hao Yue

238
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
How many people are still dying because of you

239
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,540
Sun Hao Yue

240
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,540
Do you dare to come to see me

241
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,540
I will let you die

242
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,540
My sister has nothing to do with Sun Hao Yue

243
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,540
You let her go

244
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
I don't care

245
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,540
The murderer has a death wish

246
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
Don't go there rashly

247
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,540
I will go to stabilize her

248
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,540
I will go

249
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,540
You all stay away from her

250
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,540
In case she is in danger

251
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,540
And hurt Wuji

252
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,540
I will use this string for a while

253
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Don't worry

254
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
I am right next to you

255
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,540
Don't come over

256
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,540
If you dare to come near, I will kill her

257
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,540
OK

258
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,540
Don't be excited

259
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,540
I will go with you

260
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,540
I am a woman

261
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
She won't be wary of me

262
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
It's okay

263
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,540
I will go

264
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Be careful

265
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
I heard that you came

266
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,540
I haven't seen you

267
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,540
I will leave you to take care of sister Wu

268
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
I will protect my own people

269
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,540
Sun Hao Yue

270
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
Sun Hao Yue

271
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
I will kill you if you don't come out

272
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Sister, save me

273
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,540
Where is Sun Hao Yue

274
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,540
She will come soon

275
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
My sister is in your hands

276
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
Can you let her sit down

277
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,540
and rest first

278
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
No

279
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,540
Sun Hao Yue doesn't stand in front of me

280
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,540
She doesn't want to leave me

281
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,540
You should work hard to open your eyes

282
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,540
Why did you get rid of your grudge with Sun Shen Yi

283
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
And make you hate her so much

284
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,540
I don't deserve her

285
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,540
She killed my daughter

286
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,540
I can't marry her

287
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,540
I will let her die

288
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,540
It's hard to be a man who gives black hair to a white-haired man

289
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,540
But medical skills are not a fairy

290
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,540
Not everyone can save me

291
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
If I can save your daughter

292
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,540
She won't be afraid of medicine

293
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,540
Shut up

294
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
If it wasn't for her

295
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,540
My daughter wouldn't die

296
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,540
My daughter wouldn't have walked since she was born

297
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,540
But she is my only blood

298
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,540
My father and I worked hard to cure her

299
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
When we sent her here

300
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
She was fine

301
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,540
But when we saw her again

302
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,540
She was lying in the coffin

303
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,540
Her mother ran away

304
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,540
I was so sad

305
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,540
To see her again

306
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,540
I dug up the coffin and saw her chest

307
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,540
She was stabbed in the chest

308
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,540
She killed my daughter

309
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,540
Sun Hao Yue

310
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,540
Sun

311
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,540
Nonsense

312
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,540
Your daughter was taken to see a doctor

313
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,540
Her body was broken and she couldn't live for long

314
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
Our young master didn't want her to suffer anymore

315
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,540
So he left her here to be treated

316
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,540
Shut up

317
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
You want her to die

318
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
I'm the one you hate

319
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
I shouldn't have done that to her

320
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
She is loyal to you

321
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,540
She is a dog in the garden

322
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,540
She deserves to die

323
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,540
Since I'm here

324
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,540
You let this girl go

325
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
Hold on

326
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Are you okay?

327
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,540
Mr. Bai

328
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,540
You are finally here

329
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Are you scared?

330
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
I'm fine

331
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
You are so scared

332
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,540
I'm fine

333
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,540
I'm fine

334
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
I'm fine

335
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
I'm fine

336
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
Are you scared?

337
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,540
This is the tea for you

338
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
Thank you

339
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
Thank you for saving my sister

340
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,540
If you hadn't saved her

341
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
She would have been in danger

342
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
I shouldn't have let her die

343
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,540
If I had, I would have been in danger

344
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
You are so good at swordplay

345
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,540
Why didn't you avoid the poison?

346
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
You could have saved her life

347
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
I was too reckless

348
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
When I saw Xuan

349
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
When I saw the blood of the fifth lady

350
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540
I felt hot in my head

351
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
I didn't think twice before I did it

352
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
I'm so ashamed

353
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
I see

354
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,540
Everyone

355
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,540
About the murderer

356
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,540
If you have any doubts

357
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
You can ask Dong Shu

358
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
Your highness

359
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Mr. Qin

360
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
The maid can't leave you

361
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,540
I'll leave now

362
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,540
Come

363
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Two people died in a row

364
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
It's like no one is here

365
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
All the great people in the world

366
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,540
Are so ungrateful

367
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
You

368
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,540
Who are you talking about?

369
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,540
No one

370
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,540
Your highness

371
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,540
The murderer has been captured

372
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,540
We will leave for the capital tomorrow

373
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
Mr. Qin

374
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,540
It's hard to walk on the snowy mountain road

375
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,540
You should stay longer

376
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,540
I'll escort you back to the capital after I finish the case

377
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
My fifth sister was so scared today

378
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
She was a woman

379
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
I'm afraid I'll let you down

380
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,540
I'll leave now

381
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,540
My daughter was cut off and sewed on her chest

382
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,540
I want to go to the plum forest

383
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
My fifth sister said

384
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,540
She only thought of Mr. Bai at the critical moment

385
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
She won't fall in love with Mr. Bai, right?

386
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
Yes

387
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
After the hero saves the beauty

388
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
He should marry her

389
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,540
Your highness

390
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,540
How can you say that?

391
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,540
It's written in the script

392
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,540
Besides, you are a human too

393
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Right? Xiaoman

394
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
What did you say?

395
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
What's wrong with you?

396
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
You've been in a daze since the beginning

397
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Do you remember where the wild beasts are buried?

398
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,540
Yes

399
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,540
I remember

400
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
Take me to see

401
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
Go

402
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,540
It's scary

403
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,540
I dare not to see

404
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,540
Right here

405
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,540
There were many wild beasts

406
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
They should be buried under the tree

407
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
It's not a heartache

408
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,540
It's not buried here

409
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Xiaowan

410
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Why do you have to find those beasts?

411
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,540
I want to see how they died

412
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,540
Go to the storeroom and get me a chisel

413
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,540
Okay

414
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
Let's go

415
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,540
I think it's here

416
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,540
Give me the name.

417
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,420
Wuji.

418
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,780
You are the most eager to enter the capital.

419
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,180
Compared with the famous young master of the capital,

420
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,820
Mr. Bai's family background is just ordinary.

421
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,220
Why do you have to think about him?

422
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,860
But no matter how good other people's family background is,

423
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,940
it doesn't necessarily have the same interest as Mr. Bai's.

424
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,020
You are in the after life now.

425
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,020
Of course you are grateful to him.

426
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,660
But after you see the prosperity of the capital,

427
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,100
you won't think like that anymore.

428
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
So what?

429
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,140
In the eyes of those noble families,

430
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,340
I'm just a woman with a bad background.

431
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Who would want to marry me?

432
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,940
Just like Mr. Bai,

433
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,660
my family background is just ordinary,

434
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
my character is just ordinary,

435
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,780
and I have a deep love for him.

436
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,980
It's hard for me to meet him in this life.

437
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,580
But can Mr. Bai's double-bride

438
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,620
promise you to marry him?

439
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
What did he say?

440
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,220
He said he would marry me.

441
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
His parents will definitely agree.

442
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,100
Fifth Lady, have you taken a rest?

443
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
I have something to ask you.

444
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,020
Wanqing, open the door.

445
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,380
I have seen the Fifth Lady and the Sixth Lady.

446
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,140
Don't be so polite.

447
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,980
Mr. Bai will return to Yizhou tomorrow morning.

448
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,180
I'm afraid he can't see you off.

449
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,260
Why... why would he leave?

450
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,980
Mr. Bai said he has something important to report to the elders.

451
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,180
He can't delay it.

452
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,860
This is a token of his love.

453
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,020
I'll give it to the Fifth Lady.

454
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,780
May you have a happy marriage.

455
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,940
Then I'll ask Mr. Dong to thank Mr. Bai for me.

456
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,380
So he can rest assured.

457
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,540
I will definitely bring him.

458
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,100
I'll go now.

459
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,220
I'll go now.

460
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,020
Oh my god!

461
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,700
This is too expensive!

462
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
No, no.

463
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,820
Fifth Sister, you should return it.

464
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,580
You just took such an expensive gift for no reason.

465
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,500
What if you can't explain it clearly?

466
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,820
What do you know?

467
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,500
This is not an ordinary gift.

468
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,700
This is a token of Mr. Bai's love.

469
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,380
These are the precious gems needed for making performance.

470
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,220
If it wasn't for personal rising,

471
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,580
Why would you redress this tree for the elders?

472
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,580
Such a hick of youraja!

473
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,380
How could you ask me to hand you the token?

474
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,180
How could my brother send you this?

475
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,900
How can you question me without permission?

476
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,860
I think you're jealous of Mr. Bai's love.

477
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
I'm jealous of you.

478
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,860
Oh my god.

479
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,860
I'm not going to touch you.

480
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,860
Do whatever you want.

481
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Wanqing, I'll sleep in your room tonight.

482
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Come to me when you're ready.

483
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
I know.

484
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
A momentary departure,

485
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,860
I hope to meet you in the frost.

486
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,860
I'll be there when you're ready.

487
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,860
Master,

488
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,860
Qin Yan left in such a hurry.

489
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,860
What does he mean?

490
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
I asked the Ninth Lady to be my servant.

491
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
She must be in a hurry to go back

492
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
and report to me.

493
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,860
Could it be,

494
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,860
she wants to drag the Ninth Lady

495
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
and ask you to help the Crown Prince?

496
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,860
The entire capital of Fang Yan

497
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
doesn't want to drag me.

498
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
I'm afraid only the Queen Mother will do.

499
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Then you will go back to the capital this time.

500
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,860
You will be the uncle in their eyes.

501
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,860
I can't wait to bite one person.

502
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,860
I don't have the spirit to talk to them.

503
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
It's good to be an orphan.

504
00:23:46,860 --> 00:24:02,900
Just leave 50 people in the name of the

505
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,860
What happened?

506
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,860
Why did it turn out like this?

507
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
Did you hear about

508
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,860
the rumor about the Three-Face Village?

509
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
I heard.

510
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
I heard that you were driven out of the inn

511
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,860
because of the rumor.

512
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,860
That's why I came to the White Grass Garden.

513
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
I have a guess about this.

514
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,860
But there is no concrete evidence.

515
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
So I can't report to the authorities

516
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,860
and I can't check it publicly.

517
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
Could you let my third brother

518
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,860
stay here for a few more days?

519
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
I can report to the authorities

520
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,860
as soon as I find the evidence.

521
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
In case the people are affected by the rumors,

522
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
I will spare my life.

523
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,860
You have what you want,

524
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,860
but you can't do it.

525
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

526
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,860
Don't leave the mountain

527
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
during this period.

528
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,860
Here, I'll put it on for you.

529
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,860
I'll help Xiaowan.

530
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
I'm sorry.

531
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,860
Could you tell me

532
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,860
where you got the information?

533
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,860
The wild silkworms.

534
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,860
Except for the four ladies,

535
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,860
everything else is broken.

536
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
Why didn't you check it first?

537
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

538
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,860
I did check it last night.

539
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Everything is fine.

540
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,860
But the car was broken this morning.

541
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
What are you waiting for?

542
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
Fix it.

543
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,860
Yes.

544
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Fix it.

545
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
I'm leaving now.

546
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,860
I'll see if you agree.

547
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
You want to leave?

548
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
It depends on

549
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,860
if my general agrees.

550
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
It's empty.

551
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Why did you pack these empty boxes

552
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
when you're not leaving?

553
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
If it wasn't for the perfume,

554
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,860
my third brother would have found out

555
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
that we knew we wouldn't leave.

556
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
You're the most capable

557
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
of saving the world.

558
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
I'm here.

559
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Your Highness.

560
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
Jiu.

561
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
I'm here.

562
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Third brother,

563
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
are you going to pack the car?

564
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,860
No hurry.

565
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,860
There's something wrong with the carriage.

566
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,860
We can't leave yet.

567
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
How about

568
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
you and Jiu take a rest first?

569
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,860
Thank you, third brother.

570
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
Jiu.

571
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,860
Jiu.

572
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,860
Third brother,

573
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Sister Wu is missing.

574
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
Missing?

575
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,860
What happened?

576
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
We found her things

577
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
and found her favorite

578
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
headdress and clothes.

579
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
They were all missing.

580
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860
Did the thief kidnap her?

581
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,860
What she likes the most

582
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,860
is missing.

583
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,860
She must have taken them away.

584
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,860
She took them away?

585
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
Where could she go?

586
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
I think she must have

587
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
eloped with Mr. Bai.

588
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Don't move.

589
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Be careful of the footprints.

590
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
There are no other maids

591
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
in the grassland except for Lin Shen.

592
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,860
It's not

593
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
breakfast time yet.

594
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
These footprints

595
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
must be Sister Wu's.

596
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
Wait here.

597
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
I'll go and have a look.

598
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Go.

599
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,860
Wanhe.

600
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,860
Wanhe.

601
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
My wife.

602
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,860
It's really Mi Yao.

603
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,860
Don't go forward.

604
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,860
Be careful of the footprints.

605
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,860
How is it?

606
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
I'm afraid she left the grassland.

607
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
Dongshu.

608
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,860
When did Mr. Bai leave the grassland?

609
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Last night,

610
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
Young Master Bai only asked me

611
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,860
to prepare a water and a carriage in the morning.

612
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,860
I don't know anything else.

613
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
They should have left not long ago.

614
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,860
I'll take someone to chase them.

615
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Third Brother.

616
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,860
Sister Wu's footprints

617
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
are a bit rusted.

618
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,860
They should have been left before sunrise.

619
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
They must have left before dawn.

620
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,860
They had planned it long ago.

621
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,860
I'll take someone

622
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,860
to chase them to Yizhou.

623
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,860
I'll go with you.

624
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,860
No.

625
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,860
What if they go to Yizhou?

626
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,860
How can you tell

627
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,860
if they're really going to Yizhou?

628
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
Well...

629
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,860
Don't be so arrogant.

630
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,860
If you keep delaying,

631
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,860
they'll go far away.

632
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
Then I'll ask the Princess

633
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,860
to take care of them.

634
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,860
I'll prepare the carriage.

635
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
Let's go.

636
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
Don't tell anyone about my sister.

637
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
Let's go.

638
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,860
My wife.

639
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
Let's go on the way to the cold.

640
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,860
My wife, what about me?

641
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
You and your brother will fight.

642
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
The Crown Prince and General.

643
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
Go.

644
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Go.

645
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,860
Third Brother.

646
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,860
The long-distance inn

647
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
is the way to the outskirts of the mountain.

648
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,860
Stop there.

649
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
Okay.

650
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
Go.

651
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Go.

652
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
Go.

653
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Go.

654
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,860
Don't move.

655
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
Go.

656
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,860
Where are you going?

657
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
Listen.

658
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,860
Your leg is still injured.

659
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
You're going to bring the wound to check.

660
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
Why don't you take a rest?

661
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
What?

662
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
Are you going to stay here

663
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
and celebrate the New Year with me?

664
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
Third Brother.

665
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
Where's the Ninth Lady?

666
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,860
What do you mean?

667
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
You don't believe

668
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,860
that I'm the one who can heal you?

669
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
I don't believe that.

670
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,860
Listen.

671
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,860
Last time, I was too anxious

672
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
to take the risk.

673
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,860
That's why I didn't care

674
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,860
about the injury.

675
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,860
Your Highness, you...

676
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,860
You should be reasonable.

677
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,860
How can you take it for granted?

678
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,860
You misunderstood me.

679
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
I was just asked by the Ninth Lady

680
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
to do something.

681
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,860
I wanted to know if it was what she wanted.

682
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,860
That's why I had this question.

683
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
That's good.

684
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,860
Tuoyi, get on the bed.

685
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,860
No need.

686
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,860
Third Brother.

687
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
There's no big problem with the skin.

688
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,860
No need to worry.

689
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,860
If there's no big problem,

690
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
I'll take care of it.

691
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
Get on the bed.

692
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,860
Shopkeeper.

693
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
Who's there?

694
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
I've met Mr. Qin.

695
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
I've met Mrs. Qin.

696
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,860
Okay, let me ask you.

697
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
Have you seen a woman recently?

698
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,860
She and...

699
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
Third Brother.

700
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
Have some snacks with Ning'er.

701
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,860
Okay.

702
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,860
Your Highness, please.

703
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,860
It's just snowing.

704
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
Why don't you wait for the road to be better before you set off?

705
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
Please drink some hot water to warm up.

706
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,860
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

707
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,860
It's snowing heavily today.

708
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,860
Is it easy to do business?

709
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
There's no one here.

710
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
It's colder when it snows.

711
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
I can't even see a shadow on the road.

712
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
Maybe someone was driving at night

713
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
but didn't get enough rest.

714
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
To be honest,

715
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,860
since the accident in the Three-Dimension Village,

716
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,860
I've been raising a dog.

717
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,860
I've been keeping an eye on the gate at night.

718
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
If someone passes by,

719
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
they will definitely bark at me.

720
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,860
I'm not like this now.

721
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
I sleep and bark every day.

722
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
I've wasted food for nothing.

723
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,860
You just had a cold wind

724
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
and ate something.

725
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Why does Mrs. Qin have the tea tree of the Zhang family?

726
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
What family?

727
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
This is made by the servant of the Bai Cao Garden.

728
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
It's impossible.

729
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,860
I saw the tea tree

730
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,860
and there was a mark of the Zhang family.

731
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
How could it be wrong?

732
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,860
What mark?

733
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,860
The leaves on the tea tree.

734
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
Only the Zhang family

735
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,860
can make this mark

736
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,860
like fresh leaves.

737
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
This is also their ancestral memory.

738
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
They always pass on the daughter, not the daughter-in-law.

739
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,860
Other families can't do it.

740
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
What Zhang family did the shopkeeper say?

741
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Where is the Zhang family from?

742
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
The Zhang family from the east of the Three-Dimension Village.

743
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
His family has been in the tea tree for generations.

744
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,860
Everyone here knows.

745
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,860
Who is the Zhang family now?

746
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,860
I've figured it out.

747
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,860
It's just a little girl left.

748
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,860
She hasn't been recruited yet.

749
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,860
She's still in the family.

750
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,860
A few months ago,

751
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
she was killed by a monster.

752
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,860
From now on,

753
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,860
there's no one left.

754
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
The tea leaves made by the servant of the Lin family

755
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,860
are better than the local people.

756
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,860
There are many people died in the tea garden.

757
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,860
The young people who work in the tea garden

758
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,860
suddenly disappeared.

759
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,860
When they found the body,

760
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,860
all the six houses were taken away.

761
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Brother,

762
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,860
send someone to the police station to check the garden.

763
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,860
What happened?

764
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,860
It's too late to explain.

765
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,860
Ning, take me back to the garden.

766
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860
Okay.

767
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,860
What about my sister?

768
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,860
You just wait here.

769
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,860
In case they pass by here later.

770
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Go.

771
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,860
But...

772
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,860
Did I offend you?

773
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
No.

774
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
Don't talk nonsense.

775
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,860
Then why did you

776
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
do something to me?

777
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,860
I didn't do anything.

778
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,860
I'm not satisfied with Yan.

779
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
Okay.

780
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
Let me ask you.

781
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,860
What do you want from my sister?

782
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,860
What do you mean?

783
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
You know that I'm a spy.

784
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
You even declared her your servant.

785
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,860
You made her look down on you.

786
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
If this news spreads out,

787
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
how will she be a person in the future?

788
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,860
How will her good art

789
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,860
be shown in the future?

790
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,860
You clearly cut off her future.

791
00:33:45,860 --> 00:34:06,860
You said she would be a girl.

792
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,860
Now is the time.

793
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
Now she is at stake.

794
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,860
Lord know that

795
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,020
I don't need to know her name.

796
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,380
But the world cares about her.

797
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,780
She is a woman of the world.

798
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,940
She is a woman of the world.

799
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,660
She is a woman of the world.

800
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,620
If I don't know her name,

801
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,620
what will you do to her?

802
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,100
The legend of the Medicine King Valley is 100 years old.

803
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,580
But only the Ninth Lady is the only one.

804
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,940
She is the only one who is innocent.

805
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,900
How can we let her die because of the world?

806
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,020
Women are not easy to deal with.

807
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,260
So we have to treat her with our country.

808
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,660
How long can you protect her?

809
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,020
I'm begging you.

810
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
One day,

811
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,580
she will not be in the same place as me.

812
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,420
Then she can do what she wants.

813
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,340
And the world will respect her.

814
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,700
The world...

815
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,260
respects...

816
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,780
you.

817
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,340
I hope you can remember what you said today.

818
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,460
I also hope I can help you.

819
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,140
Your Highness, the medicine is ready.

820
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,340
Come in.

821
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:28,660
Fuling.

822
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,220
Be careful.

823
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,860
Fuling, hold me.

824
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,220
Why are you so badly injured?

825
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,700
Take off your clothes. I'll take a look.

826
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,060
Come on.

827
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,060
Let me see.

828
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,460
No, no, no.

829
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:35,900
I'll take it off.

830
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,820
No, I'm fine.

831
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,940
I'm really fine.

832
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,740
Don't worry.

833
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,260
Look.

834
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,420
You lied to me.

835
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,100
How could I lie to you?

836
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,340
Besides, I'm really injured.

837
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,580
My master is here.

838
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,380
You can't bite me.

839
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,100
Hold on.

840
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,260
Master.

841
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,100
I have something important to tell you.

842
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,340
A letter came from the mountain.

843
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,340
It said that the Ninth Madam,

844
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,580
Mr. Qin and the Princess

845
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,700
have arrived at the inn.

846
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,860
Why did my junior go there?

847
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,900
The mistress said

848
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,340
not to tell anyone.

849
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,380
Including me?

850
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:05,940
Yes.

851
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,260
The Fifth Madam and Mr. Bai ran away.

852
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,900
My mistress went down the mountain to chase them.

853
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,220
When did she run away?

854
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,460
She said it was before the time of Mao.

855
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,380
Paifeng.

856
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,500
Tell the Black Armor Division to go to the mountain immediately

857
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,540
and search for the track of the Fifth Madam.

858
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,420
Yes.

859
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,140
Is there anything wrong?

860
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,060
After that, no one had gone down the mountain before.

861
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,180
So the Fifth Madam is still near the Peach Garden.

862
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,460
Go.

863
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:37,900
Go.

864
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,540
Go.

865
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,140
Go.

866
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,340
Go.

867
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,060
Go.

868
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,220
Divide the money.

869
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,020
Yes.

870
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,020
Go.

871
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,740
My lady.

872
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,020
My lady.

873
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,180
You're finally back.

874
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,580
Fuling.

875
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,460
Where is the Prince of Yan?

876
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,740
His Highness said

877
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,860
no one had gone down the mountain before.

878
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,340
The Fifth Madam must be nearby.

879
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,540
She went to find him with Paifeng.

880
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,580
Wait here for her.

881
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,580
If she comes back,

882
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,860
tell her to go to the Renxin Garden immediately.

883
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,620
Tell the Black Armor Division to guard all exits.

884
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,100
No one is allowed to leave the Peach Garden.

885
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,820
Yes.

886
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,300
Go.

887
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,500
Where are you going?

888
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,020
I found the beast last night.

889
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,460
The people of Xingqiu must have noticed it.

890
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,660
I'll go to the safe place first.

891
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,580
I'll go with you.

892
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,020
Go.

893
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,020
You can't get involved in this kind of case.

894
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,900
If what you said is true,

895
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,140
it's a crime against human rights.

896
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,420
What if he's killed?

897
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,220
How can you protect yourself?

898
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,580
I have a way.

899
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,860
Wan.

900
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,140
We're like sisters.

901
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,900
We should be loyal to each other.

902
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,660
Go.

903
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,700
Are you calling me?

904
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,500
Who are you?

905
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,620
Why are you here?

906
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,740
You're Bai Feijue?

907
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,460
If you're Bai Feijue,

908
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,900
who's that Bai Feijue outside?

909
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,260
You mean...

910
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,460
He and Lin Shen's case

911
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,060
are all patients who have been changed.

912
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,100
I'm not a patient.

913
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,980
I'm a patient.

914
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,860
I'm a patient.

915
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
I'm a patient.

916
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
I'm a patient.

917
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,860
I'm a patient.

918
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,660
Tell me.

919
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,660
Lin is also a patient.

920
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,460
The enemy is attacking us.

921
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,660
I can't save you now.

922
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,060
If you're really Bai Feijue,

923
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,260
he won't hurt you.

924
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
But if the officers come,

925
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,460
I'll save you.

926
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,060
Wan.

927
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,860
If he's really Bai Feijue,

928
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,860
then the person who eloped with Qin Xiang...

929
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,260
Qin Xiang must be worried.

930
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,060
Let's go.

931
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,660
Let's go.

932
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,260
Senior.

933
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,460
Here's the thing.

934
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,660
Mrs. Qin

935
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,660
is the cousin of our junior sister.

936
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,060
If Mr. Bai is sincere,

937
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,860
why doesn't he go to the capital to propose?

938
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,460
You're taking her away.

939
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,060
It's elopement.

940
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,060
If in the future...

941
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,060
How can you save our junior sister?

942
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,060
Have some tea.

943
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,860
You've been a little forgetful lately.

944
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,060
This special incense

945
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,860
is just right for you.

946
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,860
Senior.

947
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,660
You're so fond of your junior sister.

948
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,460
I won't make it difficult for you.

949
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,060
Come.

950
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,860
One bowl of detoxification, one bowl of antidote.

951
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,060
Remember, don't eat or touch anything after you go in.

952
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,260
I'll take care of everything.

953
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,260
Okay, you talk, I'll do it.

954
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
Senior Brother.

955
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,260
Little Sister is here too.

956
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,060
Did you find Linh?

957
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:11,060
Shangwei, Third Brother is afraid that we will be tired, so he asked us to come back first.

958
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,460
Is Mu Qing here too?

959
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
Yes.

960
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,860
This tea is from the garden.

961
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,860
Princess and Little Sister, please try it.

962
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
Thank you.

963
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,660
Senior Brother, I've been here for so long, why don't you talk to me?

964
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,460
Senior Brother.

965
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,660
Hurry, calm down.

966
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,660
Come.

967
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,660
Opposite side shoulder

968
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,060
You knew to prepare the antidote early.

969
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,980
Little sister, you are indeed very smart.

970
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,540
It's a pity that you lack experience and your knowledge is limited.

971
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,220
Little sister, do you feel that your brain is dull,

972
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,220
your face is hazy, and your limbs are not there?

973
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,340
What?

974
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,820
You can even guess that it's a anesthetic?

975
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,940
No wonder Master is so fond of you.

976
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,460
He only passed the golden needle to you.

977
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,660
This incense is a dream that I carefully made for the patients.

978
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,980
The fragrance is rich and the smell is very fragrant.

979
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,860
Compared to the anesthetic, it's more strange.

980
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,060
It's a pity that you are obsessed with those wild things.

981
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,740
Otherwise, the three of us

982
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,340
would often make mistakes in medicine.

983
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,260
How troublesome would that be?

984
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:08,940
调到计划

985
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,020
Young Master.

986
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,460
Junior Sister, you kill me!

987
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,460
I'm sorry.

988
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,460
