00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Young master, you are born by the former lady

10
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I am too impolite

11
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You don't need to take it seriously

12
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She doesn't care about it

13
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Please, I will go to the cave

14
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's time to sleep

15
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Jiuyun Huo

16
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Ok, don't go too far

17
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have been here for two days

18
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I haven't visited you

19
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are not in good health

20
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I rarely see you

21
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I am good at medicine

22
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You can go to see me

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you for your help

24
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will treat your illness later

25
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you know who saved your mother in Changmu Lian?

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It should be the twin

27
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They are all in the house

28
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you want to know, I will ask for you

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's late

31
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We will go back

32
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you

33
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You are welcome

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Young master

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Mrs. Qin

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I am coming in

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,320
The

39
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Liu Renli and Pang Fuliang are from Dingzhou

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They haven't been back for years

41
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They are so familiar with Dingzhou

42
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They even ignore the ancestors

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It seems they have made a lot of mistakes

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Go and check

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What bad things happened to Dingzhou

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Before they left

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Master, how about I go to Dingzhou by myself?

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No need

49
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You don't need to do that

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You don't deserve to do that

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You should go to see the elder brother

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You should take Fuliang out

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Go to the park

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The crown prince is always dangerous

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He is not afraid of the imperial examination

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He is a man of honor

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He is always kind

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You don't need to worry

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's not a good time

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to transfer the crown

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You should try to

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
keep the position

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You should take the position

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You should take the position

67
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You are much more capable

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
than the 4th rank

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right?

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You are right

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You are right

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Everyone wants to be a official

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But no one can think that

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
we only want the position

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You have been in the Ministry of Personnel for many years

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
These little things

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
are not common

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I am flattered

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I just want to make friends

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't have much experience

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When will you come back?

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
When I come back to the capital

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will visit the emperor

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
after I come back

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You should take the position

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You should take the position

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You will have a chance to see your father

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in the future

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You are right

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Master

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's wrong?

93
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
Now we don't know

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,680
Your wife

95
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,860
is just a live-in

96
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
patient

97
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,620
But you have the Joseph case

98
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,720
A new case

99
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,300
A public case

100
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
The case is decided

101
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
The punishment for the dead

102
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
will be calculated by zero

103
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,300
Will happen again

104
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,560
Miss Ju

105
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
The victim is Mrs. Qin

106
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
Kang Futian's friend

107
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,200
Mrs. Qin?

108
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I'm afraid the woman who is so unknown

109
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
has a bad background.

110
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
There is no trace of dragging or beating.

111
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
It seems that she died of self-intention.

112
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Otherwise, the murderer did it too cleanly.

113
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
The wound is fine.

114
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
It didn't move at all.

115
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
There is such tea in my room.

116
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,200
It was ordered by the Green House to entertain the guests.

117
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Maybe it was sent to me by the tea house after dinner.

118
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,200
It's reasonable to say that you wanted to drink some good tea before you committed suicide.

119
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
But you didn't drink it at all when you sent it.

120
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
So you were in a hurry to learn the shortcut.

121
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
It's not reasonable.

122
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
There are some traces of damage in these places.

123
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
It seems that there are some things like gums that can pull me.

124
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
It's indeed a bit strange.

125
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Please arrange for me to examine the body.

126
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
I'll take you directly.

127
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Don't break in.

128
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Please be careful.

129
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
I want to see how she is.

130
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Move away. I want to go in.

131
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Please be careful.

132
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Bai Feng, please let Cao Cao in.

133
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
She...

134
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
She...

135
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
We came here at night.

136
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
She has been unconscious for a long time.

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Your Highness.

138
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Why did she leave like that?

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,200
May I ask what your relationship with the deceased is?

140
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,200
She is an old friend of mine.

141
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
She is a friend of mine.

142
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
She is an old friend of mine.

143
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Is she really just an old friend?

144
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,200
She is the former leader of the Twin-Qing Sect.

145
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Qingli's teacher.

146
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Qing Yu.

147
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
The deceased?

148
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Mrs. Qin is the late Qingli's teacher.

149
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
So both Pang Gong and Cao Cao knew the deceased.

150
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
They liked watching the Twin-Qing Sect's play when they were young.

151
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Mrs. Qin was the leader at that time.

152
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
They knew each other.

153
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,200
It's a good thing.

154
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
I see.

155
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Qing Yu.

156
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Why did you take this step?

157
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Actually, Mrs. Qin died of suicide.

158
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I didn't do anything.

159
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Your Highness, you mean...

160
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Qing Yu was murdered by someone?

161
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Wang Zhizhou sent the body to the government office.

162
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
We can confirm it after the autopsy.

163
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Since you have informed Wang Zhizhou,

164
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,200
I will ask Mrs. Qin to come with you.

165
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Bai Feng.

166
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Go and check if the Twin-Qing Sect is supporting Ding Zhou.

167
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Yes.

168
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
What?

169
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Is there anything wrong with Ding Zhou?

170
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
These three people are the problem.

171
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Liu Renli's control of the Overseas Faction

172
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
is a major help for Pang Fuliang's collusion with the official field.

173
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
It's not a big deal.

174
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
But I think it's a good thing.

175
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
It's not a big deal.

176
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
It's not a big deal.

177
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Liu Renli's control of the Overseas Faction

178
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
is a major help for Pang Fuliang's collusion with the official field.

179
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Pang Fuliang also provided Liu Renli with money to buy officials.

180
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
They have a common interest.

181
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm not surprised that Liu Renli can become Qing Huiyuan's guest.

182
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,200
But Qing Yun is just a spirit who enters the grain.

183
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
How can he let her stay in Qing Huiyuan

184
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
with Pang Fuliang as her disciple?

185
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,200
The servants in this yard change every year.

186
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm afraid they do it to cover up Qing Yun's identity.

187
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Liu Renli's power

188
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
seems to be related to Qing Yun.

189
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
But Pang Fuliang is a little bit biased.

190
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Could it be that Qing Yun has the two of them?

191
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Pang Fuliang has to tolerate her.

192
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,200
There must be a secret between the three of them.

193
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Did you kill Qing Yun?

194
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Say it!

195
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
It's not me.

196
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Why did she tell you about the Overseas Faction?

197
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
She's dead now.

198
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I have no choice but to say yes.

199
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Why did I dirty my hands and use my brain?

200
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Qing Li is dead.

201
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Now Qing Yun is dead.

202
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Only we know about this.

203
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
How can I trust you?

204
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
If that incident

205
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
is exposed,

206
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
you and I will be dead.

207
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
You've been caught by Yan Chi.

208
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
If you bring out the old incident,

209
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,200
you and I will be dead.

210
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
This...

211
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
This is the water from the warehouse.

212
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
It can remove the smell and prevent the poison.

213
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
I've never been to the training room.

214
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I'll let you see

215
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
what the Overseas Faction is.

216
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Don't be too modest.

217
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Thank you for your advice.

218
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
That's right.

219
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Let's go.

220
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,200
He's between 45 and 55 years of age.

221
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
His clothes are in perfect condition.

222
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
There's no sign of wear and tear.

223
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
There's no sign of wear and tear.

224
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
He has a piece of oil in his left sleeve.

225
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Long Xian's incense

226
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,920
It's a very valuable incense.

227
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,320
There are some scratches on the back of the sword.

228
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,880
It's three-parted.

229
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
The edge is uneven.

230
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,120
There are green pieces in the gap.

231
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,200
It should be on the pillar or the beam.

232
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,960
Bai Feng,

233
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,400
check it yourself.

234
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,240
Yes.

235
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,360
Hurry up!

236
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,240
It was conducting��을 Cave Com.

237
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,240
His neck has been pressurized by blood circle.

238
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,360
It turned pale.

239
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,200
There are spots with accreditation in his eyes.

240
00:15:46,200 --> 00:16:14,320
The wound river isほw with just unkown

241
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
There are also purple and red stripes on the back of the feet.

242
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
They are called fast and linear.

243
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
The cause of death should be King Yi.

244
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
So he died of selfishness.

245
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,320
King Yi doesn't necessarily die of selfishness.

246
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,320
When a person is selfish, there is inevitably a struggle.

247
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,320
So the hook won't be so neat.

248
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
And the dead is already half a year old.

249
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,320
He is very considerate of his own makeup and clothes.

250
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,320
It means that he is a person who loves his own appearance.

251
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,320
This kind of person probably won't use his own clothes to make Yi Rong look bad.

252
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
The rope used by the dead is Huzhou Qingchou.

253
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
This is one of the ropes that can cause the curse.

254
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,320
When a person is in a state of suffocation, he will grab the rope with his hand.

255
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,320
And there is no trace of grasping on this rope.

256
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,320
The dead should have lost consciousness before he got the rope.

257
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
So he died of selfishness.

258
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
He needs to be tested.

259
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Test?

260
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:38,100
But the

261
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
test is not over yet.

262
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
I'm used to it.

263
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
My head hurts so much.

264
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Why is it so uncomfortable to be drunk?

265
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
I won't drink anymore.

266
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
Okay, then don't beg me next time.

267
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Wang Zhizhou, are you also drunk?

268
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
How is this drunk?

269
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
This looks like being scared by Xiaowan.

270
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,100
I've seen it before.

271
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,100
Isn't it just using a needle to sew the belly skin?

272
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,100
You're awake again.

273
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,100
No matter where I go, I've seen Xiaowan

274
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
open the dead's belly skin.

275
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Did you vomit?

276
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
I'll try it.

277
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
I'll hold it.

278
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
You get up when I drink.

279
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Okay.

280
00:18:35,100 --> 00:19:00,100
I won again.

281
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Give him a bowl of sugar water.

282
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
Okay.

283
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
I think it's because of yesterday's wine.

284
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Drink it.

285
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
Man Tuo Luo.

286
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,100
The common drug and anesthetic in the market are all white powder.

287
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
The black powder is actually Man Tuo Luo's seed powder.

288
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,100
The seeds are more toxic.

289
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,100
In one moment, you'll feel dizzy, sleepy and numb.

290
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,100
After half an hour, you'll fall into a coma.

291
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,100
You'll be addicted to wine and be more toxic.

292
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
But I haven't seen the wine.

293
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,100
What if the dead went out to drink and came back?

294
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
I don't think so.

295
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,100
Either the dead went out to drink and came back.

296
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
Or the perpetrators were afraid of being exposed

297
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
and punished with Man Tuo Luo's seed powder.

298
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,100
But if there's Man Tuo Luo's seed powder in the bottle,

299
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
you'll feel disgusted.

300
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,100
How could the dead drink it?

301
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,100
If the perpetrators drink with the dead,

302
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,100
when the dead is at a 70% drunk,

303
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
they'll exchange the wine for medicine.

304
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
The dead will never be able to tell.

305
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Master.

306
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
My lady.

307
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Look at this.

308
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Does it look like the dead's body?

309
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Where did you find it?

310
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,100
In the pillar outside the study.

311
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Pang Fu Liang?

312
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,100
It's exactly the same.

313
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,100
There are some incense from the island of Weizhou.

314
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
It's light and safe.

315
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,100
If you like it,

316
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,100
I'll send someone to send it to you.

317
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Okay.

318
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Send it to the wine girl.

319
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,100
The wine girl is kind and kind.

320
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,100
It's the same with this incense.

321
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Did you invite Mrs. Qin to come to the pillar?

322
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Mrs. Qin usually comes with the twin-living class.

323
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,100
I've never invited her alone.

324
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,100
You seem to be dissatisfied with Mrs. Qin.

325
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,100
I didn't want to talk about the dead.

326
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,100
But now, I have to talk about it.

327
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
After Mrs. Qin took over the class,

328
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
I thought she was having a hard time.

329
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
I know you care about her.

330
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,100
But she's getting more and more hungry.

331
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Yesterday, she even brought the twin-living class

332
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,100
to exchange for my ten-way inn.

333
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,100
I drove her away.

334
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Did you talk about it here?

335
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,100
I met a guest here.

336
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
He was in the garden.

337
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Did Mrs. Qin stay for dinner?

338
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
She likes to drink.

339
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
She just used some leeks.

340
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Okay.

341
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
I'm sorry to bother you today.

342
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
I'll see you later.

343
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
No need.

344
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Guests.

345
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Master, what can I do for you?

346
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Go and call Mrs. Qin.

347
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Master, she's not feeling well.

348
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,100
I'll ask you to call her here.

349
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Yes, I'll do it right away.

350
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
The oil on the dead's sleeve

351
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
is the lamp oil from Pang Fuliang's study.

352
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
They've met in the study

353
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
and used leeks.

354
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Please.

355
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
But Pang Fuliang lied

356
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,100
and said he met in the garden.

357
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
I even asked him to give you the lamp oil.

358
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Now you have the evidence.

359
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
The seeds of the mantou are quite strong.

360
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
But if you put it in a heavy dish,

361
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
it's hard to tell.

362
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Pang Fuliang is very sharp-sighted.

363
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
If he wants to kill someone,

364
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
he has a way to kill them.

365
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Now, we need to find the one who killed Qingyun.

366
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
But it's not that simple.

367
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,100
In the call of the imperial family,

368
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Pang Fuliang didn't dare to act rashly

369
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
during his birthday banquet.

370
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Moreover, His Majesty has already heard

371
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
the rumour of the corruption.

372
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Liu Renli wants to get away from the crown prince.

373
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
If Pang Fuliang wants to run away,

374
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
he wouldn't dare to act rashly.

375
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Qingli and Qingyun died in prison.

376
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
It's not a coincidence.

377
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
Even the witness of the two cases

378
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
are all suspicious.

379
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
It's the first time I've seen you being troubled.

380
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,100
I'm not afraid.

381
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,100
I'm just afraid of the physical feeling.

382
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
It's okay.

383
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Let's bear it for a while.

384
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Let's check Qingyun's old body first.

385
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
See if we can get rid of the fog.

386
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
You're tired today.

387
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
Go to rest.

388
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
If there's any news about Bai Feng,

389
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
you must tell me as soon as possible.

390
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Don't worry.

391
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,100
I won't miss any chance to see you.

392
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
I'm leaving.

393
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
I'll let Fulin see that he's stopping me again.

394
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
Jiu Niangzi.

395
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
What's up, Mr. Pang?

396
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
My father has sent me to send you the lamp oil.

397
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Thank you.

398
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
Who dares to kick me?

399
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,100
You dare to hit me?

400
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
You don't want to live?

401
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Stop it. Why are you drunk again?

402
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
No.

403
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,100
Yuanyuan.

404
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
Yuanyuan.

405
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Look.

406
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Mrs. Qi.

407
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Let me tell you.

408
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,100
We're real couple and fake brothers.

409
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
No.

410
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,100
Fake couple and real brother.

411
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
If we're real brothers,

412
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
don't stop me.

413
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
I'll kill you.

414
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Stop it.

415
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Hurry up.

416
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
I can't stop the princess from coming back.

417
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Jiu Niangzi, I'll go now.

418
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
If you have time tomorrow,

419
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
I'll go with you to the lake.

420
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
Lake?

421
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
Who are you?

422
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,100
You dare to swim with me?

423
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
He is...

424
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:56,420
a

425
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
What?

426
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
I'll beat you.

427
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,100
No his highness is tr theatrical.

428
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
only

429
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
I do.

430
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
Ok.

431
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Let me see.

432
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Come on.

433
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
Ok.

434
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Fei Lering.

435
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
After princess wake up,

436
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Have somecold-c evaluä soup.

437
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,340
The prince of Yanling takes the princess to eat and drink every day

438
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,540
If it goes on like this, the princess will be ill

439
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,260
I'm afraid she hasn't learned to drink and drink

440
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,260
I'll talk to her when she wakes up

441
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,460
Ge'an, I can still drink

442
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,260
Stop drinking, why are you still drinking?

443
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
Wipe your hands

444
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
Wipe your hands

445
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
Why are you looking at me like that?

446
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,740
My lady, you are more smiley than before

447
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Really? Why didn't I notice?

448
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,740
Since the prince made you so happy

449
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,740
Then I'll forgive him for dragging you around to work every day

450
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,740
But I just like him dragging me around to work

451
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
What should I do?

452
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,740
My lady, even if he likes you in his heart

453
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,740
He will still cover his mouth

454
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,740
Unlike you, you always talk about your love

455
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,740
You are more like my mother

456
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
My lady, you are talking about me talking

457
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,740
Take care of the princess, I'll go and write my notes

458
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,740
These two people are not easy to deal with

459
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,740
It hurts so much

460
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
It hurts

461
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,740
It hurts so much

462
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,740
I don't think it hurts that much

463
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
It hurts so much

464
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,740
It hurts

465
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,740
Brother Qi, I really didn't let them hit me hard

466
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,740
I just can't stand the way he misses his wife

467
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,740
I just...

468
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,740
Which lady is looking for me?

469
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,740
She...

470
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,740
You are the one who can't take care of me

471
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
I'm sorry

472
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,740
Mr. Tang

473
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
I've been waiting for you for a long time

474
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,740
You are such a wonderful person

475
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,740
I like you

476
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,740
Let me hug you

477
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,740
I'll teach you

478
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
I'm not only handsome

479
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
But also very good at fighting

480
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,740
You are so good at fighting

481
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,740
I want to see you

482
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,740
You are so good at fighting

483
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,740
I want to see you

484
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
You are so good at fighting

485
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,740
I really didn't expect that evil person

486
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,740
Would let Qi Cao hurt him

487
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,740
If I had known that Qi Cao would throw his body

488
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
And also be a great doctor

489
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,740
I would have never done that

490
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Sister Jiu, can you do it?

491
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,740
Brother, since you asked me to treat Mr. Pang

492
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
I will do it

493
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,740
After this needle, I can walk on the ground

494
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,740
If not, I have to lie on the ground for half a month

495
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,740
It hurts

496
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,740
I'm afraid of you

497
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,740
You, help me hold his feet

498
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,740
Do you want to see me?

499
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,740
Mr. Pang, pain is not pain

500
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,740
To avoid future trouble, you should endure it

501
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,740
My sister-in-law is so deadly

502
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,740
I have something to do, I have to go

503
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
Come back

504
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,740
After this, you will be punished

505
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,740
Brother, don't worry

506
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,740
I tell you

507
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,740
I can't, I'm so laughing

508
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
You didn't see that

509
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,740
Wan is so good

510
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Such a thick needle

511
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
It pierced his nail

512
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,740
I don't know who is the hero

513
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
He is so kind

514
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
Keep your voice down

515
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,740
Don't let Qi Cao hear

516
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,740
It's not you

517
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,740
People are not ideal

518
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,740
In dreams, you become a hero

519
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
I

520
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,740
Let's go to do something

521
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,740
What?

522
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,740
Brother Qi asked us to do double shift

523
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,740
Why do you come to Yun Shaofang?

524
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,740
Are you stupid?

525
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
To ask about a person

526
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Not ask about the person around him

527
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,740
But ask about his death partner

528
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,740
The person who hates you most understands you the most

529
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,740
Yun Shaofang was the biggest theater in the region

530
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,740
Since the ten guest houses and the double shift were together

531
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
I almost didn't close the door

532
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,740
Everyone hates Pang Fuliang and the double shift

533
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,740
To ask about them

534
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,740
Is there anything better than this?

535
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
I didn't expect

536
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,740
You are so fast

537
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
It's really useful

538
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,740
Let's go to be the actor with me

539
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,740
Ok

540
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
Please come in

541
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
Please

542
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,740
Li Siqing

543
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,740
The documents and accounts of the Southeast Yanyuan are all here

544
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,740
I will go back to the capital today

545
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,740
Take all the cars away

546
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
Yes

547
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,740
The world is so big

548
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,740
It's almost impossible for me to fit in

549
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,740
Why are you here again?

550
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,740
I come to give you this

551
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
This is father's handbook

552
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
Where did you get it?

553
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,740
I heard that Mr. Shen has been in Yuzhou for three years

554
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,740
I thought that there might be his handbook in the file

555
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,740
It's true that the book was found in the price warehouse

556
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,740
This handbook

557
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,740
It's all father's handwriting

558
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,740
It's all his short-term achievements

559
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,740
Thank you

560
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,740
I want to see

561
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Who is playing the ghost here

562
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,740
The ghost is the only thing I miss

563
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:24,740
The ghost is the only thing I miss

564
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,740
Mrs. Qin

565
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,740
Do you know who is here?

566
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,740
I don't know

567
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,740
Who are you looking for?

568
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,740
My wife

569
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,740
You have a daughter?

570
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
She is a adopted daughter

571
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,740
She is the daughter of the woman who met her in the wild

572
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
She is a poor girl

573
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
My wife

574
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,740
Thank god

575
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,740
You scared me

576
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,740
Mrs. Qin, you found me

577
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,740
Mrs. Qin, that uncle can jump water

578
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,740
I want to jump water too

579
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,740
I want to jump water too

580
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,740
Is this Liu Cao Si's official house?

581
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,740
Yes

582
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,220
when the Emperor acted on you.

583
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,580
Your Highness,

584
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,540
His Majesty is going to investigate

585
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,320
the

586
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:32,620
anchor of the

587
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,620
This Guan Yin Yin.

588
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,620
Legend of Few thousands Zhan

589
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:23,780
stone public had been

590
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,460
more unusual

591
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,040
The sea level is high.

592
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,020
It lost its life and becamecrible.

593
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,280
St infected, there is nothing left.

594
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,600
It didn't recognize it as poisoned,

595
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,220
but it still has this smell.

596
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,560
And it's bound to die of starvation same as death.

597
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,340
Not needed on hand, no red-blo saber.

598
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,520
Where there's sore feet and leg,

599
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,820
every part will be slightly participants.

600
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,780
It's the struggle between his survivors.

601
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,860
But our hands and feet are not tied up even when we found him.

602
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,820
I think it's the rope of the person who killed the man.

603
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,820
Unless he was dragged into the tiger's den after being dragged out.

604
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,820
This is the strange place.

605
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,820
Look.

606
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,820
There is a oval scar on the victim's body.

607
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,820
This is the wound on the gun.

608
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
It should be the weapon of the long gun.

609
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,820
It's here.

610
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,820
The right palm and the mouth of the tiger have thick scissors.

611
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,820
The victim has been a civil official for ten years.

612
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,820
But these descendants are still here.

613
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,820
It means he has never stopped practicing martial arts.

614
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,820
His physical strength must be good.

615
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,820
Ordinary people want to beat him to death.

616
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,820
It's hard to stop.

617
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,820
When we arrived, the victim just died.

618
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,820
The person who did the crime should have been too late to take the rope and cover the scene.

619
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,820
But if there is no rope, where does this scar come from?

620
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,820
It must be the rope.

621
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,820
The key is the material of the rope.

622
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,820
Let me do it.

623
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,820
Let me do it.

624
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,820
Look.

625
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,820
The scar on the victim's body is lighter than that of the normal rope.

626
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,820
And there is no scratch.

627
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,820
It means that the rope is soft.

628
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,820
The criminal should use force for a long time.

629
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,820
The rope is untied after the victim passed out.

630
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,780
The purpose of the human being's death is to drown him.

631
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,780
Look at this.

632
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,780
These are the banknotes left by Hu Mian Sheng.

633
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,780
Those who were soaked in water are worth more than ten thousand taels.

634
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
Soaked in water?

635
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,780
Have you heard of the magic of escaping under water?

636
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,780
I grew up in the military camp.

637
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,740
How can I hear about this?

638
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,740
This is the old trick of the military camp.

639
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,740
Use the numb to make a rope.

640
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,740
Tie the hands and feet of the person.

641
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,740
Soak in water and it will melt.

642
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,740
The rope is slowly melting.

643
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,740
The person can escape from the water naturally.

644
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,740
Does the ordinary people know this trick?

645
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,740
Of course not.

646
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,740
Otherwise, what does the military camp rely on to eat?

647
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,740
I saw this from my father's palm.

648
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,880
The

649
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:50,200
It seems that the double or triple

650
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:59,740
Why the night turns around

651
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:05,740
But the same, again illuminating your light

652
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:12,740
Like a flower, moving in the snow

653
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:20,740
So cold, so warm

654
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:27,740
If a love falls into the shadow

655
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:34,740
The snow falls, a white snow

656
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:40,740
If a love is like a star

657
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:47,740
It can be like a star, the same night

658
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,740
The same

659
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:57,740
Open your heart, love doesn't matter the deep sea

660
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:04,740
Please give me courage, let fate be open

661
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:11,740
Don't be afraid of the starlight being covered by the moonlight

662
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:21,740
The stars will shine, beyond the sky

663
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:32,740
Like dust, but the color of the stars

664
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,740
The same

665
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:43,740
Open your heart, love doesn't matter the deep sea

666
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:51,740
Please give me courage, let fate be open

667
00:44:51,740 --> 00:45:00,740
Don't be afraid of the starlight being covered by the moonlight

668
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:09,740
Please give me courage, let fate be open
