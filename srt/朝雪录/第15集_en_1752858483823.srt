Episode 2

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My lord, I didn't find any traces of the carriage on the way

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Will they cross the mountain?

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They didn't escape, they won't go this way

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But the forest is all over, how can there be no traces?

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Could it be that their camp is in danger?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Go back to the prairie immediately

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Retreat!

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Retreat!

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The forest is all over

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Ni

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wake up

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ni

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Where is this?

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is the secret room underground

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I didn't touch anything

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How did Sun Hao get it?

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He took my senior first

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then he brought us closer to his special medicine box

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was careless

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He even used his own junior

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Your senior wouldn't...

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
My senior wouldn't know

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He is now in danger

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's not like we've been here for so long

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Qi Ge should be here to find us

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But we don't know where the secret room is

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He can't save us even if he wants to

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So we have to find a way to get out of here

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We can stand

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We can stand

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have to complete my great cause of breaking into the underworld

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We can't be trapped here

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's go

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This way

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This way

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This way

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This way

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He is the monster from the Three-Demon Village

43
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We can't let him get away again

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This way

45
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He left

46
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How much more?

47
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sun Hao is in danger

48
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you add more money, you can collect more heart veins

49
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Tell me in two hours

50
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes

51
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Mr. Bai

52
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Mr. Bai

53
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Qi Qiao, why?

54
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Who let you save your wife's life?

55
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're not my wife

56
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're not my wife

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You will be my wife

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You'll be my wife

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You will be my wife

61
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's go

62
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Go

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's go

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's go

65
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Go

66
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go

67
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Go

68
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,280
No one is allowed to enter or leave the manor.

69
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,400
Everyone, follow me!

70
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Yes!

71
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,640
Wu,

72
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,800
help her up.

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,880
Wu,

74
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,640
Sister Jiang...

75
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,560
I know it.

76
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,840
We'll take you out now.

77
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Bastard!

78
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,480
She didn't even leave a single piece of clothes.

79
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,240
Wu, hang in there.

80
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,720
My sister used more medicine than us.

81
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,320
I'm afraid she can't walk for a while.

82
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,360
Then let's go.

83
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,560
Let's go.

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,960
Let's go.

85
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,840
You...

86
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,320
Are you alright?

87
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,360
I'm fine.

88
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,120
I never thought there would be an organ under this ground.

89
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,240
There's an island right here.

90
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,440
Let's go sanitation to the back.

91
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,920
Okay, let's go.

92
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,820
Here is the place

93
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,180
Not far from here

94
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,500
Exiya

95
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,260
Come on

96
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,560
Get another one

97
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,640
Master

98
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,960
There are only a few people left in the yard

99
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,840
Why don't you see Dongshu?

100
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,440
Commander, I found only one person outside the inn

101
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,200
He was lying on the wall of the Yidu City

102
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
He is still alive

103
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,400
Fuling, you stay here and take care of him

104
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Yes

105
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,800
The rest of you search the back yard

106
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
Yes

107
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Hang in there

108
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I feel better, let me do it myself

109
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Thank you

110
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Don't let anyone go

111
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Yes

112
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Go back

113
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
No

114
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Your hand is shaking like that, can you have my sword?

115
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I will kill you

116
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,200
You are still not confident, it's really boring

117
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Why do you treat me like this?

118
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Why not?

119
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Do you really think I love you so much?

120
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,200
But I really love you

121
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Really?

122
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
You really love the Bai family, right?

123
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
You dare to elope with me without knowing who I am

124
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
It's too easy for you to love me

125
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
You three are really in love

126
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Which one should I start with?

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
You?

128
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
You?

129
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Or you?

130
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
The tea garden has been closed for so long

131
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
It's not easy to find the big brother's wish, right?

132
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,200
I don't know how long sister-in-law can hold on

133
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Although we can't beat you

134
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
But it's not difficult to sell your own heart

135
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
If we three die in front of you

136
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
How will big brother punish you?

137
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Shoot yourself?

138
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I don't believe Qin Wu dares to shoot himself

139
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I just need to drag your heart and body away

140
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Stop

141
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
If you dare to go one step further

142
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I will kill Qin Xiang

143
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
It's your sword, not my dagger

144
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I think he told you how I can't tolerate him

145
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Qin Wan

146
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
And me

147
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
If Qin Xiang wants to die, we will die together

148
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
You crazy women

149
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Are you crazy?

150
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Let her go

151
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Is he dead?

152
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
He died secretly

153
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
He couldn't save 100 hearts

154
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I won't come back

155
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
He came from there

156
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
The exit is over there

157
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Go

158
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Slow down

159
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Be careful

160
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
General, there is no other way out

161
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
The gate is opened from the inside

162
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,200
This kind of military system is not as mobile as human power

163
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
There is no wind here

164
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
It must be the water

165
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
But there is no water around

166
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
There is no water on the ground

167
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Not necessarily underground

168
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Dig it for me

169
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Go

170
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Someone is coming

171
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Qi came to save us

172
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Let's go inside

173
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
This way

174
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Qi

175
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Qi

176
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Qi is dead

177
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
He is dead

178
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Shut up

179
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Feiyan is not dead

180
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
He just got sick for too long

181
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Tired

182
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Sleep

183
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
He is crazy

184
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
I'm not crazy

185
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
It's just that you people can't see Feiyan's beauty

186
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
If you don't get along with each other

187
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Feiyan must be in a state of panic at this moment

188
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Don't go

189
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Senior brother

190
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
You wake up

191
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Sa has left

192
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
He has left for a long time

193
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I said Feiyan is still alive

194
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,200
As long as I give her the blood of a young girl

195
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
She can wake up

196
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
She can wake up

197
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
So you go to kill people

198
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
As a doctor

199
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Not only can't save a dead person

200
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
My magic of love

201
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
I've saved so many lives

202
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Why

203
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Why can't I save my beloved

204
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
God

205
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Why are you so unfair to me

206
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
This is just an excuse for you to kill

207
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Because of you

208
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Not many people died in the third month

209
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
How many people broke their love because of you

210
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
You are fair to them

211
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I'm not wrong

212
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,200
I just came from the weak and dying

213
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
They can't live long

214
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
These ignorant people

215
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Rather than living in the world

216
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
It's better to achieve my illusion

217
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Can't you be more blessed with the world

218
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
You are blessed with the world

219
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
If you don't fulfill your wish, you are a ignorant person

220
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Do you think who you are?

221
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
You dare to forget your enemy's life and death

222
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm not worthy

223
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
You are so rude

224
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
You don't deserve to be with Feiyan

225
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,400
No

226
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,200
But this is okay

227
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,200
The stone door is also closed

228
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Believe that there will be a few of you

229
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
When Feiyan comes

230
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
I will surely indicate that there is no trouble

231
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Hmmm

232
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
A special coming soon

233
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,640
It's a decoy

234
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,800
Goodbye

235
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,920
Those humans we save

236
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,120
Hold them up

237
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,580
You are that person

238
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,360
Hold me

239
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,040
Help me

240
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,040
Hold me

241
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,560
You hold me

242
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,360
Help

243
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,080
Help me!

244
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,120
Hold on tight!

245
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,840
Honey, hold on tight!

246
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,040
Don't let go!

247
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,800
Help me!

248
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Help me!

249
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,520
Louder!

250
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,240
Hold on!

251
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,320
I can't hold on anymore!

252
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,560
Help me!

253
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,800
Master, watch out!

254
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,440
Help me!

255
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Honey!

256
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,800
Don't let go!

257
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,760
Hold on tight!

258
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,520
Help me!

259
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,160
Leave me alone!

260
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,520
Please, please!

261
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Hold on!

262
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,280
I'll definitely save you!

263
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,680
Hold on tight!

264
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Hold on tight!

265
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Qing Wan!

266
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,480
Help me!

267
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,880
Help me!

268
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,880
Help me!

269
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,480
Zhang Xian!

270
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,200
Let go!

271
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
No!

272
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,800
You're not going to save me!

273
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
You're going to kill me!

274
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,480
You're not going to save me!

275
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,720
Let go!

276
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,520
Let go!

277
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,920
Let go!

278
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Let go!

279
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,080
Jiang Hong Er's

280
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,400
love and death are one and the same.

281
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Love is not afraid of death.

282
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Help me!

283
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Please, please!

284
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Let fate be kind.

285
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Don't be afraid of the starlight.

286
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,480
The moon and the wind are high.

287
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,480
The stars will shine.

288
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
In the end of the world.

289
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Let's go!

290
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Hurry!

291
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Let's go!

292
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Let's go!

293
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,480
The stars are shining.

294
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,480
The stars are shining.

295
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Don't be afraid of the starlight.

296
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:48,480
The stars are shining.

297
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Don't be afraid of the starlight.

298
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,480
The stars are shining.

299
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,480
The wind and snow are giving me a shoulder

300
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,480
If I can't be with you for a lifetime

301
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Come here, come here, come here

302
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Hurry up

303
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Come here, come here

304
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Don't stop

305
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Waner

306
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Come here

307
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
Waner, come here

308
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Ok

309
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Dad, I'll go with you

310
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Please be brave

311
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Let fate be open

312
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,480
Don't be afraid of the starlight

313
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Be touched by the night sky

314
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Please be shining

315
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,480
In the sky

316
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Did you find it?

317
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
No

318
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
There must be another mechanism here

319
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
Even this grass

320
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
We have to pull it up and see

321
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Go find it

322
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Yes

323
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Wen Feng

324
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
When can we find the mechanism?

325
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Why don't we go down to save people?

326
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Except for the master

327
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,480
We are not good at floating water

328
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
No

329
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
You said you were good at floating water

330
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
No

331
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,480
You said you were good at floating water

332
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Why don't you know how to float?

333
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
What are you doing?

334
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Go down

335
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Calm down

336
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
My seven stars are so good

337
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
They haven't come up yet

338
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
What's the use of going down?

339
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Now in the ground

340
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
I don't know what it looks like

341
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
You go down in a hurry

342
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Are you going to die?

343
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
General Bai grew up in Shuxi

344
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
It's the driest place

345
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Where did he learn to float?

346
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
General Bai

347
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
I was talking nonsense just now

348
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
Don't take it to heart

349
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
I'm just worried

350
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Why haven't they come up for so long?

351
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
Will it?

352
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Will it?

353
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
No

354
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Xiaowan and Brother Qi

355
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
All lucky

356
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Will definitely succeed

357
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
I'm so worried

358
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Wan

359
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Wan

360
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Wan

361
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Wan

362
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Wan

363
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Calm down, Yanchen

364
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
You will find a way

365
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
You will find a way

366
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
You will find a way

367
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
There is a way

368
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Wan

369
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Wan, wake up

370
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Spit

371
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Don't you still want to be the leftist who is against the village of Xia Yuan?

372
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Don't you still want to be innocent?

373
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Wake up

374
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Wake up

375
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
Wake up

376
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
Hurry

377
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Wake up

378
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Wake up

379
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
You are awake

380
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
It's really you

381
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
I can't think about it

382
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
Let you sacrifice yourself

383
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
I actually came back here

384
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
I'm sorry

385
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Your wound is stained with water

386
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Let me deal with it for you

387
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
You rest well

388
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
I don't need

389
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
If you act recklessly again

390
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
If there is any accident

391
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Where can I find you?

392
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Don't worry, Your Highness

393
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
I have learned what I have learned

394
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
I'm talking about you

395
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,480
I only want you in my life

396
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
I'll go change your clothes

397
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
You know what I'm talking about

398
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I won't take it back if I say it right

399
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Then you let me go first

400
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
It's not easy to talk like this

401
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
It's too cold here

402
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
You let me sit up

403
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
What are you doing?

404
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Now that you sit up

405
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Can't you take a cold?

406
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
I'm sorry

407
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm sorry

408
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
I'm sorry

409
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm sorry

410
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm sorry

411
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
I'm sorry

412
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
I'm sorry

413
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
I'm sorry

414
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
I'm sorry

415
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
I'm sorry

416
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Do you want to take a cold?

417
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Your Highness is kind and generous

418
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
You treat me so well

419
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
How can I be indifferent?

420
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
I don't love you in this life

421
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
I have been a soldier since I was a child

422
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
I never know what love is

423
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
At first I just appreciate you

424
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Then I gradually trust you

425
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I don't know when

426
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
I suddenly feel

427
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
I'm happy when I'm with you

428
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
I hope I can be with you every day

429
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Even if I'm with you, I'm as dry as a shadow

430
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
When you are sad

431
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,480
But my heart is a group

432
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
I don't want you to be a little bit wrong

433
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Before I came here

434
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
I wanted to see you wholeheartedly

435
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Protect you

436
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Even just now

437
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
I saw you lying there without a trace

438
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
This is the first time in my life

439
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Know what fear is

440
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
If you and I can get out today

441
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
In this life

442
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
I am willing to be with you

443
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
In this life

444
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Can see your kindness

445
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I am lucky in three lives

446
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
But I

447
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
But I

448
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
Not a good match for you

449
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Shen Wan

450
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
I am willing to

451
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
You have made a promise to me

452
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
To keep secrets from each other

453
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
But I have to know

454
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Who is the one who made a promise to me

455
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
How to find it

456
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
I will tell you

457
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
I haven't found anything yet

458
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Your father hid your traces very well

459
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
The people of the Apothecary Kingdom can't get in

460
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
But you and real Qin Wan

461
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Have been in the Apothecary Kingdom

462
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
The time you disappeared and Qin Wan

463
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
It's exactly the same in the world of Jinzhou

464
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Although there are nine soldiers and one doctor

465
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
But your medical skills

466
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
It's obviously long-term practice

467
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Talent

468
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
It's impossible to reach such a pure and pure place

469
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
However, there is one more thing

470
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Your heart for the Lord Shen

471
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
What you said

472
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Can't prove anything

473
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
You know

474
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
I never look at evidence

475
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
This is enough for me

476
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Then you should know

477
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
The purpose of my trip to Jinzhou

478
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Is to find the truth

479
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
You want to make a wish for the Lord Shen

480
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
I want to help the Lord Jin

481
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Our purpose is already thought

482
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Since you know it

483
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Why do you love

484
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Because there is only one you in this world

485
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Whether you are the God Wan or Qin Wan

486
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
You are the only one in this world

487
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
The irreplaceable person

488
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
If I miss

489
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
I will destroy Moji in this life

490
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:38,980
You have seen Good will

491
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,480
You have seen what I can do

492
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,480
Lord

493
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Lord

494
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,480
I amgan

495
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,480
Master, I can't see anything

496
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,680
Come and help me

497
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,880
Yes

498
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,480
Waner, from now on, my life is yours

499
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,080
I'd rather not marry

500
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,480
I want to protect you for the rest of your life

501
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,280
If you don't marry

502
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,880
You'll have to eat me

503
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Don't cry

504
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,880
You're a heroine, why are you crying?

505
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,280
I was scared by you

506
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,680
Thanks to your help

507
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,680
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable

508
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,680
You don't have to marry me

509
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,480
My lady

510
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,480
Here comes the medicine

511
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,480
Let me

512
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,680
Or I'll do it

513
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,280
Chu Ling

514
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,880
Chu Ling

515
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,080
I'll go to the bathroom first

516
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,280
I'll come back to accompany you later

517
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,880
Go go go

518
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,280
It's hot

519
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
I'll go to the bathroom first

520
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
I'll go to the bathroom first

521
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,880
Then I won't bother you to rest

522
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
You're a gentleman, you're responsible for your health

523
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,280
As long as you can rest in peace

524
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
You will be safe

525
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Thank you, third brother

526
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,080
What's wrong?

527
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,680
We'd better avoid it in the future

528
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,480
What's there to avoid?

529
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,480
They will be late sooner or later

530
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
You don't want me to go to the door and propose

531
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,880
They are still in the dark

532
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Don't talk nonsense

533
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
No nonsense

534
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,280
Although the underground place is not good

535
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,480
But what I said is true

536
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,680
But I don't understand the scenery

537
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,280
The mood is not suitable

538
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,280
If it weren't for the current identity

539
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,680
I don't want to live the life of a noble lady

540
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,680
But I love you so much

541
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
Be my chess piece

542
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,880
Should be a hero who can fight alongside me

543
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,680
Instead of living in the inner circle

544
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
Only know the rouge and powder of the father and father

545
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,480
What chess piece?

546
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,080
I don't need this

547
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
Then you

548
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,880
Are you going to be angry with me?

549
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,880
Angry

550
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,280
I didn't do anything to you

551
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,880
Don't talk nonsense

552
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,680
It's also a mess to mess with my heart

553
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Listen

554
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
Before my father died

555
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,480
I don't want to mention marriage

556
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,880
Because once you become a wife of the inner village

557
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
There are more rules to keep your hands and feet

558
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,880
Sorry

559
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,680
If you don't accept

560
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,280
We can still be like before

561
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,080
No way

562
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,280
Why?

563
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,880
Because my heart can't go back

564
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,280
Also because I was planning

565
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,880
Let you be my wife

566
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,080
Be my wife in a fair and just way

567
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,280
Yanzhi

568
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,280
But

569
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
But you have to make up for some benefits for me

570
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
What benefits?

571
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,280
There are Yueqing in Jingzhou

572
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,280
Your brothers in Yaowanggu

573
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,280
If you go to the capital

574
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,280
What if you meet someone who is not planning?

575
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,080
To avoid night dreams

576
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,080
Should you give me some benefits?

577
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Let me rest assured

578
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,280
But I have no common things

579
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,680
I'm willing to give you and Su Wenjiu

580
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,280
Then you have to promise

581
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,680
No side concubines

582
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,680
No concubines

583
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,080
Whether married or not

584
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,680
If you can't be one-sided

585
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
High and wide

586
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,480
I can go anywhere

587
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,680
Qin Wan

588
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,680
I'm not a person who loves love

589
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,680
I'm not a person who loves love

590
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,880
I'm not a person who loves love

591
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,880
I'm not a person who loves love

592
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,880
I'm not a person who loves love

593
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,480
I'm not a person who loves love

594
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,480
I know what is life and death on the battlefield

595
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,880
I'm mature with it

596
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,880
The road we chose to check

597
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,680
Except you

598
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,680
No woman can walk with me

599
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,680
You are enough for this life

600
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,680
Until you came to my world

601
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,680
Write down the music

602
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,280
You gave me the sunny day

603
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Let the future have a picture

604
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,680
When I close you, I find out

605
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,880
Love is a little

606
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,680
I'm here, I have something to do

607
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,480
Why can't I see anything suddenly?

608
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,680
I said I'm here, I have something to do

609
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,680
Let me tell you

610
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,280
But don't bother me

611
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,280
Tell me

612
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,280
How big are theacts

613
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,480
It's fake

614
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
Everything is fake

615
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,680
I tarried a lot

616
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Aren't you afraid

617
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
New discipline

618
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,680
Why are you so powerful

619
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,480
Sky is clear

620
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,080
The sky in my heart

621
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,880
Old surgery

622
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,080
How could you say its start

623
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Don't bother me

624
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,480
Beautiful

625
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:54,880
Come on

626
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,280
It's really beautiful

627
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,280
The snow is freezing

628
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,280
So cold, so warm

629
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,280
If I fall in love

630
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,280
I will be buried

631
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,280
The snow falls

632
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,280
I will be buried

633
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,280
If I fall in love

634
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
I will be buried

635
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,280
If I fall in love

636
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,280
I will be buried

637
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,280
However

638
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,280
Let's say our hearts are separated

639
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,280
Love lovers love each other

640
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,280
I'm brave

641
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,280
I can be so generous

642
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,280
Don't be afraid to be a star

643
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,840
