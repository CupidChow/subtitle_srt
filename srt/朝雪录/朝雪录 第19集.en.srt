00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,490
Thank you.

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,050
You're welcome.

5
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,479
It's all Qing's fault for overreacting.

6
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,009
It's just a minor chill. How could I
trouble you with this, Miss Qin?

7
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,009
As a physician, it's my duty
to heal and save lives.

8
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,210
There's no need to overthink it, Madam.

9
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,320
If you don't mind, Miss Qin,

10
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,510
[Mrs. Pang]

11
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,950
just take my pulse like this.

12
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,020
Come on.

13
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,370
Have another bite.

14
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,050
Madam, you truly care about Miss Jia Yun.

15
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,510
With such kindness in your heart,

16
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,360
you're sure to be rewarded with blessings
in the future.

17
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,520
Thank you, Miss Qin.

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Yun and Yan are both well-behaved.

19
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,180
Madam, please give me your other hand.

20
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,240
Who did this to you?

21
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,650
I bumped it myself.

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
Mother is lying.

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,950
It was Father who hit her.

24
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,950
Don't cry, Yan.

25
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,800
Be good.

26
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,660
Go play in the courtyard for a while.

27
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,700
Be careful.

28
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,380
Madam, these external injuries

29
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,710
only need some ointment

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,020
and a few days of rest to heal completely.

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Thank you, Miss Qin.

32
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,470
However, Madam, you're mentally drained

33
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,730
and have lost all hope.

34
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,480
That is the true root
of your physical weakness.

35
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,440
Miss Qin.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Please help Madam.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,520
Qing.

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,370
-Please get up, Qing.
-Please listen to me.

39
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,530
Master has become
increasingly irritable lately,

40
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,370
taking his frustration out on Madam
at the slightest provocation.

41
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,370
A few days ago,

42
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,190
he called Madam to his study
and tormented her.

43
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,180
The day before yesterday,
Young Master Yan got beaten,

44
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,180
and Master blamed it on Madam again.

45
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,360
You wretch!

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,680
If you hadn't been so permissive,

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,240
would he have stayed out all night?

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,400
If you weren't so incompetent,

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,360
would he have fallen into someone's trap?

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
I'll beat you to death!

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,470
Don't hit my mother!

52
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,980
Mother!

53
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,840
Don't hit Mother!

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,590
Mother!

55
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,840
Mother!

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,910
Stop!

57
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,700
Don't hit Mother!

58
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,000
Mother!

59
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,620
Madam cries every day

60
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,180
and can't eat a thing.

61
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,890
How could she not feel utterly hopeless?

62
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,710
Qing.

63
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,860
-Miss Qin.
-Come on.

64
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,560
Please help Madam.

65
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,700
I beg you.

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,000
Mother, I'm hungry.

67
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,790
Qing.

68
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,810
Don't make things hard for Miss Qin.

69
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,020
Go feed Yun.

70
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,930
Come on.

71
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,330
Come on.

72
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,370
When I first met Yun,

73
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,850
she was like thisâ€”

74
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,870
always acting like
a four or five-year-old child.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,330
Madam, with your two children,

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,490
what do you plan to do in the future?

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,670
Though my husband treats me indifferently,

78
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,480
he dotes on Yan greatly.

79
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,590
When Yan grows up a bit,

80
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,100
he can help his father
uphold the family name,

81
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,120
and perhaps things will get better then.

82
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,170
Madam,
please don't harbor any more illusions.

83
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,840
If a man can hit you once,

84
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,430
he will do it countless times.

85
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,070
He'll only become
more and more comfortable

86
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,360
and reckless with it.

87
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,480
Men who raise their hands against women

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,560
are all of corrupt character,

89
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
complete and utter cowards.

90
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,180
How could they possibly have

91
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,840
the willpower and determination
to change themselves?

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
I don't expect him to change.

93
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,570
I just hope Yan can grow up quickly.

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,360
What difference will it make
when he grows up?

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,910
Watching his mother be humiliated

96
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,940
and abused every day,
powerless to do anything.

97
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,150
Over time,

98
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,300
that will only leave him full of
resentment and repression.

99
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,360
How could he possibly grow into

100
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
someone strong and responsible?

101
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,970
Madam, please stop
using your children as an excuse.

102
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,470
Miss Qin, everything you said

103
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,630
is wise and kind.

104
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,190
It's just that for now,

105
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,560
I can still manage.

106
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,420
I think I'll endure it for the time being.

107
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,240
Madam, if you don't want
to live in this hell forever,

108
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,510
you have no choice but to risk everything
and leave this all behind.

109
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,240
Only then will you and your children
have a chance for a better life.

110
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,880
I, Qin Wan, have said all I can.

111
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,409
I hope you will consider it carefully,
Madam.

112
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Miss Qin.

113
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,990
Please don't blame Madam
for being indecisive.

114
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,140
Her family is also in business.

115
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,220
Years ago,

116
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,300
to acquire Madam's family's assets,

117
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,830
Master conspired with others,

118
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,680
forcing her family

119
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,190
to the brink of ruin.

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,190
To protect her family business,

121
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,180
Madam reluctantly became
Master's second wife.

122
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,720
So Madam's family was willing

123
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,330
to sacrifice their daughter's life

124
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,930
just to save their business?

125
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,720
If her family business collapsed,

126
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,580
Madam would have no way out at all.

127
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,240
Besides, she has two children.

128
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,370
If she really left the Pang family
for her own sake,

129
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,750
Young Master Jia Yan
would lose everything,

130
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,170
and all these years of her endurance
would be for nothing.

131
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,900
Miss Qin, you're a nice person,

132
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,360
but

133
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,830
if you haven't experienced
someone else's pain,

134
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,390
perhaps don't be too quick to judge.

135
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,120
Madam is not like you, Miss Qin.

136
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
She doesn't have skills to rely on,

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,659
so she can only submit to fate.

138
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,680
In this world,

139
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,420
facing injustice,

140
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,690
what can a powerless woman do

141
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,040
but endure it quietly?

142
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,660
The relationship
between Qing Yun, Liu Renli,

143
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,990
and Pang Fuliang is truly extraordinary.

144
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,920
The Shuangqing Troupe travels
far and wide,

145
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,200
making the world their home.

146
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,010
But Qing Yun, just to see them,

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,570
travels thousands of miles

148
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,070
to Yuzhou almost every year

149
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,040
for a reunion.

150
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,930
Even ordinary relatives

151
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,930
aren't this close.

152
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,430
Pang Fuliang is quite generous too.

153
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,390
Wherever there's a Shifang Inn,

154
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,159
it's always available
for the Shuangqing Troupe.

155
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,120
The Shuangqing Troupe's fame
across the land

156
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,280
owes much to

157
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,150
Pang Fuliang's support.

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,020
What special talent do you think
Qing Yun has

159
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,600
that makes Pang Fuliang
so generous to her?

160
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,150
Chi.

161
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
You've hit on something important.

162
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,530
Do you know
why Liu Renli remains unmarried?

163
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,270
As they say,
the falling flower has feelings,

164
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,190
-but the flowing water is indifferent.
-Just say it.

165
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,200
Look at you,

166
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,340
you have no sense of romance at all.

167
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,990
Liu Renli is deeply in love with Qing Yun,

168
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,950
but she doesn't care for him at all.

169
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,960
Are you saying

170
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,310
Pang Fuliang is only
being nice to Qing Yun

171
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,690
to win Liu Renli over?

172
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,510
Exactly.

173
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,210
Master,

174
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,100
there's new information.

175
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,640
Qing Yun, Liu Renli, and Pang Fuliang

176
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,870
are indeed all from Dingzhou.

177
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,530
Liu Renli used to run
a martial arts school in Dingzhou.

178
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,780
Later, the three of them left together,

179
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,690
and only Qing Yun returned

180
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,120
to Dingzhou to retire
under the name Madam Qin.

181
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,870
When they left Dingzhou,

182
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,070
a major gold heist
had just occurred there.

183
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,240
A gold heist?

184
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,919
How much gold was stolen?

185
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,280
Was it real gold or paper money?

186
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,549
Have they caught the bandits?

187
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:42,280
How come I never heard of
such a sensational case?

188
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,360
It was an unsolved case from 15 years ago.

189
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
Since it involved stolen military funds,

190
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,400
His Majesty had it covered up.

191
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,670
I only know because I overheard Father

192
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,800
discussing it with his subordinates.

193
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,410
I never expected Qing Yun's death

194
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,670
would be connected to such a major case.

195
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,350
Chi, do you suspect

196
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,970
they were behind it?

197
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,120
You two, come with me to the prison.

198
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,450
It's time to interrogate Yang Ying.

199
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,130
Little Wan'er!

200
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,350
I knew you're still awake.

201
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,710
Do you know what I've been doing
these past few days?

202
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,390
No idea.

203
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,270
Yan Li and I went undercover,

204
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,360
as spies.

205
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,300
Was it fun?

206
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,790
Fun? Not at all.

207
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,950
We discovered something big.

208
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,840
That Pang fellow is definitely
not a good guy.

209
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,130
My Lady, Your Highness.

210
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,920
Young Master Yan says

211
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,160
we need to pack our belongings quickly

212
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,490
and leave Yuzhou early tomorrow morning.

213
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,880
Why such a hurry?

214
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,040
Does Chi know about this?

215
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,900
No, he doesn't.

216
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,350
No need to ask.

217
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,920
It must be related to Liu Renli's death.

218
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,160
Go pack our things first.

219
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,640
Ning and I will make a run
to the prefect's office.

220
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,120
Okay.

221
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,270
â™ª The Dharma sees
the child's filial piety â™ª

222
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,790
â™ª He tries to find
and save his mother in hell â™ª

223
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,920
â™ª Ride on the auspicious cloud,
heading for Mount Lingshan â™ª

224
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,880
Every time I hear this part,

225
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,240
someone dies.

226
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,550
This is already the fourth time
I've heard it.

227
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,550
â™ª Buddha's compassion â™ª

228
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:40,310
â™ª Guides the way â™ª

229
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,130
Why did she stop singing?

230
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,240
Let's go.

231
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,810
What's wrong with her?

232
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,950
She probably had a seizure.

233
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,550
She got frightened just now.

234
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,360
Come on.

235
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,710
Yang Ying.

236
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,470
Since its founding, the Shuangqing Troupe

237
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,400
has always had two leaders.

238
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,220
Why is it that after Qing Yun left,

239
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,040
the number of leaders
went from two to one?

240
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,970
That's not true.

241
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,160
There was another leader, Qingxi.

242
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,990
She's Qing Yun's junior,

243
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,670
but later she got married

244
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,120
and left with her apprentice.

245
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,360
Qing Yun had a falling out
with her after that.

246
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,280
What was Qingxi's apprentice's name?

247
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Qing Huan.

248
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,000
In terms of movement techniques
and vocal skills,

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,940
she's better than
Qing Yun's apprentice Qing Li.

250
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,420
It's really a pity.

251
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,540
And who did Qingxi marry?

252
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,190
A general from the Northwest,

253
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,050
surnamed Zhang, I believe.

254
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,760
He also helped her
escape her lowly status.

255
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,700
So when did Leader Qing Yun

256
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,770
pass her position

257
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,190
to Qing Li?

258
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,640
About

259
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,750
eight or nine years ago, I think.

260
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,160
After Leader Qingxi got married,

261
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,590
Qing Yun drank every day

262
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,790
and lost interest
in managing the Shuangqing Troupe.

263
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,000
15 years ago,

264
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,830
Qing Yun followed Mr. Pang
to do business in the Northwest

265
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,000
and made a fortune.

266
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,480
Later,

267
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,290
it was said that Leader Qingxi
took her disciples to visit her hometown

268
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,850
and was killed by bandits.

269
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,430
After that,

270
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,670
Qing Yun handed over the leadership
to Qing Li

271
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,430
and retired herself.

272
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
Occasionally after that,

273
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,870
she would come with us to Yuzhou

274
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,200
to meet with Mr. Pang.

275
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,900
Chi.

276
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,320
How did you know there would be

277
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,050
records of the gold heist here?

278
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,290
I once saw it when...

279
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,920
When reading
a senior judicial official's notes.

280
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,040
Which senior official?

281
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,360
Let me read it too.

282
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,210
I forgot.

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,120
I only remember he previously
served in Yuzhou.

284
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,380
Why so many questions? Hurry and search.

285
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,670
Found it.

286
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,650
This is...

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The household register
of General Zhenwu's family?

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,640
Wife:

289
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,940
Zhang Qingxi.

290
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,470
The military funds allocated
to the Northwestern border army

291
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,040
were divided into four routes.

292
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,640
The route escorted by General Zhenwu
from the Northwest

293
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,970
was robbed in Dingzhou.

294
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,520
50,000 taels of gold
vanished into thin air.

295
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,920
All accompanying soldiers died fighting.

296
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,140
General Zhenwu's family members

297
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,720
also perished.

298
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,550
All dead?

299
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,630
How is that possible?

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,430
What kind of bandits would do this?

301
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,490
Intelligence says

302
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,360
Liu Renli's resignation from office,

303
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,160
Pang Fuliang's purchase of
the Shifang Inn, and Qing Yun's retirement

304
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,760
all happened in the same year
as the gold heist.

305
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,880
50,000 taels of gold.

306
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,950
What a great deal.

307
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,160
But that was all military funds,

308
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,790
and those were all soldiers escorting it.

309
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,280
They must have been insane.

310
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
I bet General Zhenwu never imagined

311
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,880
that instead of dying on the battlefield,

312
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,280
he would die by the weapons
of his own people.

313
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,470
I'll arrest that beast Pang Fuliang
right now

314
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,470
to honor General Zhenwu's memory!

315
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,470
Stop right there!

316
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,050
Do you think we're still in Shuoxi?

317
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,670
Since I've taken the position
of Surveillance Commissioner,

318
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,310
I must act according to
national laws and criminal codes.

319
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,240
But this case happened so long ago.

320
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,590
Where can we find evidence?

321
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,590
Qing Yun and Liu Renli are both dead.

322
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,830
If Pang Fuliang refuses to confess,

323
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,720
there will be no witnesses left.

324
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,310
Let's go meet with Pang Fuliang now

325
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,560
and settle all these accounts with him
one by one.

326
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,960
[Qinghui Manor]

327
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,260
What's wrong with Yun?

328
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,500
Yun!

329
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,550
Yun!

330
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,580
Yun!

331
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,590
Yun!

332
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,590
Mother.

333
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,820
Madam, Young Lady just
had a seizure.

334
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,680
Has this ever happened before?

335
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,710
Yun has had this condition
since childhood.

336
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,370
It tends to act up
whenever she gets frightened.

337
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,310
Yun, look what this is.

338
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,150
Mother.

339
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,790
Where is my general?

340
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,640
I want my general.

341
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,950
Yan will go get it for you.

342
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,430
I want my general.

343
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,470
Yan's gone to get it, okay?

344
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,590
These two dolls are so exquisitely made.

345
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,250
Where did you get them, Madam?

346
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,920
Yun loves listening to opera

347
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,640
but can't easily meet strangers,

348
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,280
so Qing specially made these two dolls

349
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,680
to keep her entertained.

350
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,810
Yun.

351
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,500
Good boy, Yan.

352
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,830
â™ª Ride on the auspicious cloud,
heading for Mount Lingshan â™ª

353
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,560
â™ª Buddha's compassion guides the way â™ª

354
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,470
Jia Yun can sing
"Mulian Rescues His Mother"?

355
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,930
So what we heard before...

356
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,000
Thank you.

357
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,160
Please stop here.

358
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,930
Little Wan'er.

359
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,510
What is this?

360
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,370
Don't touch it.

361
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,630
This is a Datura flower.

362
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,640
It's poisonous.

363
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,230
Ning, go to
the prefect's office immediately,

364
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,360
tell Chi everything that just happened,

365
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,750
and ask him to bring people
to Qinghui Manor as soon as possible.

366
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,360
Got it.

367
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,630
You're doused with tung oil.

368
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,730
Help...

369
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:18,960
Help...

370
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,470
Me...

371
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,840
I can't treat your wound.

372
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,880
As soon as this sword is pulled out,

373
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,210
you will die instantly.

374
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,860
Who did this to you?

375
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,650
If you don't speak now,
you'll die in vain.

376
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,100
Hurry up! Come on!

377
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,350
Go get water quickly!

378
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,170
Hurry!

379
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,570
You, come here!

380
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,890
-My Lady!
-Wan!

381
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,800
-My Lady!
-Come on, put out the fire!

382
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,120
Hurry up!

383
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,080
Wan, where are you?

384
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,540
Put out the fire! Quickly!

385
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Steward, have you seen Her Ladyship?

386
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,350
Is Her Ladyship inside?

387
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,320
Get lost! You're being a nuisance!

388
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,920
Go away!

389
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,160
You old servant!

390
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,880
-How dare you shove her?
-You dare to push me?

391
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,430
-So what if I did?
-I'll beat you to death!

392
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,920
I...

393
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,670
If you ever dare touch her again,

394
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,930
I'll kick you to death!

395
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,230
Qin Wan!

396
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,050
-Little Wan'er!
-Are you alright?

397
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,910
Little Wan'er!

398
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,430
-Little Wan'er, are you in there?
-My Lady!

399
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,840
Little Wan'er!

400
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,160
My Lady!

401
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,320
Little Wan'er, answer me!

402
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,300
Wait for me!

403
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,060
Are you okay?

404
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,200
I'm okay.

â™ª Turn love into a secret,

407

-My Lady!

411
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,710
You scared the hell out of me. Let me see.

412
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,560
Don't move, don't move.

413
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,290
Let me check.

414
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,640
It's okay now.

â™ª Turn love into a secret,

416

Chi.

417
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,030
-That was impressive!
-Wan, you almost scared me to death.

418
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,880
You're way too brave.

419
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,320
â™ª If you unveil the mystery â™ª

420
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,230
You scared the hell out of me.

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,450
It's alright, it's alright.

422
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,540
â™ª And walk through this journey with me â™ª

423
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,230
Chi.

424
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,470
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

425
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,430
Don't you know who I am?

426
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:46,490
â™ª That would be the best ending for love â™ª

427
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,950
Don't worry, I'm fine.

428
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,800
I'm alright.

429
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,730
Thank you for saving Her Ladyship.

430
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,930
It's what I should do.

431
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,360
You know what this means for
our Little Wan'er?

432
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,990
Surviving a calamity will surely bring
good fortune.

433
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,710
Exactly.

434
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,600
My Lady, there must be plenty of blessings
coming your way.

435
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,400
Indeed.

436
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,690
Yan Chi's feelings for Qin Wan

437
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,490
are truly something else.

438
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,920
If we play this right,

439
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,360
within three years,

440
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,560
the Shuoxi Army will become
a strong support for His Highness.

441
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,020
If His Grace asks about Liu Renli,

442
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,690
how should we respond?

443
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,710
I've already mentioned it in my letter

444
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,570
that Li Muyun suddenly
made a visit to Yuzhou,

445
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,770
and to avoid revealing our intentions,

446
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,630
I stopped in time.

447
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,850
Understood.

448
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,400
However,
something like Liu Renli's incident

449
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,460
must never happen again.

450
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,880
If it happens again,

451
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,230
I'll lose all credibility

452
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
with His Highness forever.

453
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,880
That was because Pang Fuliang
deliberately concealed information.

454
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
It wasn't your fault, Young Master.

455
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,920
I was still too hasty.

456
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,330
I'm afraid observant people may
have already noticed my intentions.

457
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,200
We can't be seen so close
to Prince Yu anymore.

458
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,560
As it happens,

459
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,960
Father wrote that

460
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,470
His Highness's affairs
have run into some trouble

461
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,470
and urgently need
Wan's skills to solve the problems.

462
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,670
Let's set off for the capital right away.

463
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,320
Yes.

464
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,640
[Yuzhou Prefecture Office]

465
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,840
The fatal wound is still
some distance from his chest.

466
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,160
The killer wanted Pang Fuliang

467
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,400
to watch himself being burned alive

468
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,270
without being able to save himself.

469
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,070
Based on the victim's injuries,

470
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,990
even if he hadn't been burned to death,

471
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,090
he could have died from blood loss,

472
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,390
leaving no chance for rescue at all.

473
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,790
This notebook

474
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,990
documents Father's investigation

475
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,080
of the gold heist,

476
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,340
along with many inconsistencies
in the official records.

477
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,080
Father meticulously organized files
on many unsolved cases.

478
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,710
I wonder

479
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,020
how many still remain to this day.

480
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,190
Don't worry.

481
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,720
No matter how many still remain

482
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,100
or where they might be,

483
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,150
we'll definitely be able to retrieve them.

484
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,510
The official records state that

485
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,510
General Zhang's entire family was
burned to death in the inn,

486
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,850
but after my father personally examined
the bodies, he discovered

487
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,810
the family

488
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,540
was actually abused to death,

489
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,450
and the fire

490
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,360
was just to cover up the evidence.

491
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,750
Qingxi died from a broken neck by hanging,

492
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,930
the eldest son was drowned,

493
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,230
and General Zhang was killed
by an arrow in his back.

494
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,960
Now look at these four victims:

495
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,160
Qing Yun was hanged,

496
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,700
Qing Li

497
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,650
died from an arrow in the back,

498
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,850
Liu Renli was drowned to death,

499
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,990
and though Pang Fuliang suffered
a sword wound,

500
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,590
the torment of waiting to die

501
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,600
was more lethal than his injury.

502
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,920
The causes of death for these four

503
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,800
are almost identical
to General Zhang's family's,

504
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,230
which cannot be coincidental.

505
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,640
But their actual causes of death

506
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,230
were never recorded in the official files

507
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,320
or made public.

508
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,320
The murderer of the Pang family case
actually knew these details perfectly,

509
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,640
which suggests this person

510
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,120
is very likely a survivor of

511
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,980
the gold heist.

512
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,430
Keep reading.

513
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,480
The bodies of her foster sister
and eldest daughter are missing.

514
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,970
But Qingxi doesn't have a foster sister.

515
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,410
Unless...

516
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,950
Yang Ying said Qing Huan was
the most skilled in the Shuangqing Troupe.

517
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,530
If the foster sister was Qing Huan,

518
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,320
then Qingxi's eldest daughter

519
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,120
was very likely rescued by Qing Huan.

520
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,670
Killing Liu Renli and Pang Fuliang

521
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,510
requires some martial arts skills.

522
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,470
Judging from the movement techniques
and motive,

523
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,260
the killer

524
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,040
should have been Qing Huan.

525
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,980
According to household records,

526
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
if Qingxi's eldest daughter
survived until now,

527
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,560
she should be around 18 years old,

528
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,360
and Qing Huan should be about 30.

529
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,120
Based on the age calculation,

530
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,030
plus the Datura flowers in the courtyard,

531
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,360
the dolls, and the song,

532
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,100
Qing Huan is very likely to be Qing.

533
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,270
Then the Eldest Madam
of the Pang household

534
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,600
must be General Zhang's eldest daughter.

535
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,390
After the gold heist,

536
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,700
the battle in the northwest

537
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,900
was extremely tough.

538
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,060
My father once believed

539
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,080
that the military funds
were stolen by mountain bandits.

540
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,640
After driving back the enemy forces,

541
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,840
he also went to wipe out
several bandit strongholds.

542
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,170
Who could have imagined

543
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,160
that the always brave and open-minded
General Zhang

544
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
would die at the hands of those villains?

545
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,360
Although these people deserved to die,

546
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,190
none should have died unjustly and without
clear cause due to vigilante punishment.

547
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,270
Such revenge

548
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,560
neither serves as a warning to the public

549
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,710
nor honors
General Zhang's noble reputation.

550
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,970
No matter the reasons,

551
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,190
the criminals' crimes
should be made public

552
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,390
and then punished according to the law,

553
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,560
including those

554
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,470
who deserve to die.

555
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,270
Rest assured.

556
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,920
We'll definitely bring the gold heist

557
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,030
back to light

558
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,290
and use the law

559
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,750
to give General Zhang the justice
he deserved.

Governor Wang has surrounded
our courtyard with his men,

563
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,560
saying they're here to make an arrest.

564
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,800
Qing, you're suspected of
murdering Pang Fuliang

565

and burning his body to destroy evidence.

566

You are to be arrested immediately.

567
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,560
Qing couldn't possibly do such a thing.

568
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,950
I'll go with them.

has accused a member of

Qing Huan, a disciple of Qingxi,

of murdering the former Shuangqing Troupe

She killed so many people.
That's four already.

How cruel.

599

But she looks like a powerless woman.

to present to the court?

Thank you, Governor.

However, my evidence
is rather extensive and complex.

618
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,800
Since Qing has not yet been convicted,

00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,860
may I ask if you would allow her to stand,

Bring a table.

624
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,750
These two arrowsâ€”

625
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,990
one has a wooden shaft with an iron tip,

626
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,880
the other is made entirely of iron.

627
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,160
This pure iron arrow

628
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,880
was removed from the victim's body
as the murder weapon.

629
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,410
And this iron-tipped arrow

630
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,600
is the one originally included
in the quiver for performance use.

631
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,510
The killer replaced this iron-tipped arrow

632
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,910
with a pure iron one,

633
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,420
increasing the weight,

634
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,030
requiring the mechanism to be triggered
twice in succession to release it.

635

Therefore, when Yang Ying
lowered her head again,

636
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,600
the iron arrow was released

637

and struck the victim's vital point.

during the performance.

using her alias Madam Qin,

654
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,080
had a private conversation
with Pang Fuliang in his study,

demanding the Shifang Inn from him.

They had a heated argument
and parted on bad terms.

The killer knew
Madam Qin was fond of drinking,

658

so they took the opportunity

to put Datura seed powder in her wine.

After Madam Qin passed out
due to the poison,

the suspect snuck into her room,

removed Madam Qin's waistband,

dragged her near the beam,

was looped over the beam

667
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,470
and tied around Madam Qin's neck,

668
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,600
after which the hemp rope
around her waist was untied,

669
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,930
using the falling body's momentum
to strangle her to death.

670
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,909
Jumping onto the beam

671
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,400
is not something
an ordinary person could do.

672
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,280
How did Qing manage it?

673
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,520
This is the testimony of Yang Ying,
deputy leader of the Shuangqing Troupe.

674
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,530
Qing

675
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,239
is actually Qing Huan.

676
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,840
She fully inherited
her master Qingxi's skills.

677
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,989
Her singing skills, lightness techniques,
and movement techniques

678
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,920
are all outstanding among her peers.

679
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,070
Even the Shuangqing Troupe Leader Qing Li

680
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,730
was slightly inferior to her.

681
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,739
Qing.

682
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,720
Do you admit

683
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,950
to what Commissioner Yan

684
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,240
just stated?

685
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,680
I admit it.

686
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,260
She killed so many people!

687
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,260
How could she bring herself to do it?

688
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,190
Silence!

689
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,860
Master Wan.

690
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,250
Do you have any more evidence
to present to the court?

691
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,450
No need for more evidence.

692
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,570
I killed them all.

693
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,190
It was me who shot Qing Li,

694
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,580
hanged Qing Yun,

695
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,470
drowned Liu Renli,

696
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,820
and stabbed Pang Fuliang to death,
burning his body afterwards.

697
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,220
No one else was involved.

698
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,920
This is too vicious.

699
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,800
This is a blatant disregard
for the law!

700
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,680
She deserves to be executed!
Truly inhuman!

701
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,630
Qing,

702
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,650
are you confessing to your crimes
here in court?

703
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,630
By the law,

704
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,360
I am guilty;

705
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,350
but by human conscience,

706
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,470
I am innocent.

707
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,840
What?

708
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,990
She claims she's innocent.

709
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,840
Silence!

710
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,640
You insolent woman.

711
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,950
How dare you make a fool of me!

712
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,580
Governor Wang.

713
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,360
I have a few questions for Miss Qing.

714
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:21,920
Please proceed.

715
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,950
With your skills,

716
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,630
when you stabbed Pang Fuliang
with your sword,

717
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,960
could you have killed him with one strike?

718
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,570
Yes, I could.

719
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,720
Then why did you

720
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,920
deliberately miss his heart by an inch?

721
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,760
Because I wanted him to suffer,

722
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,680
to watch himself being burned alive.

723
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,290
What kind of grudge did you two have

724
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,530
that drove you to harm him so severely?

725
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,110
They were just a bunch of

726
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,380
cold-hearted, rotten, and vicious people.

727
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,270
Because they

728
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,890
conspired to hang my master Qingxi,

729
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,760
shoot General Zhang, my master's husband,

730
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,110
and drown my master's eldest son.

731
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,720
Even my master's little daughter,
Jia Yun,

732
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,120
was frightened into such
a state of idiocy.

733
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Because they

734
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,170
were the real culprits

735
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,400
behind the gold heist from 15 years ago!

736
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,600
What?

737
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,550
This is an earth-shattering secret!

738
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,880
The culprit hasn't been found in 15 years.

739
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,580
Court dismissed!

740
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,360
The gold heist
will be tried another day.

741
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,230
Take Qing away!

742
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,720
Thank you.

743
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,910
Should I call you Qing Huan or Qing?

744
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,270
Since I left the Shuangqing Troupe
with my master,

745
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,690
the name Qing Huan has had
nothing to do with me anymore.

746
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,180
Please just call me Qing.

747
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,450
I presented the evidence and accused you,

748
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,550
yet you hold no grudge against me at all.

749
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,880
From the moment I did those deadly deeds,

750
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,920
I knew this day would come.

751
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,550
Why should I harbor hatred towards you?

752
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,680
Miss Qin, since you were willing

753
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,150
to help me reveal the injustice
from back then in court,

754
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,590
you must have known something
about what happened.

755
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,790
I might as well tell you
the whole truth.

756
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,070
Miss Qin, I believe you'll
understand my intentions.

757
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,280
Though Qing Yun was older than my master,

758
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,630
she was narrow-minded,

759
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,920
envious, and resentful of talent.

760
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,350
She envied my master
for marrying a good man

761
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,950
and coveted the wealth
of the general's household.

762
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,510
Therefore, after falling out
with my master,

763
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,320
she came back,
pretending to rekindle their sisterhood.

764
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,110
My master was very loyal and trusting,

765
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,070
so she was easily fooled
by Qing Yun's act,

766
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,330
which invited trouble

767
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,560
and planted the seeds of disaster.

768
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,880
The journey was going smoothly, and once

769
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,920
we reached Mengzhou, the border troops
were supposed to meet us.

770
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,750
But unexpectedly, Qing Yun colluded with
Pang Fuliang and Liu Renli...

771
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,140
Kill!

772
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,100
Bringing Qing Li to Dingzhou.

773
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,590
They disguised themselves as coachmen
and cooks to sneak into the inn,

774
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,450
drugged the escorting soldiers,

775
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,840
and slaughtered

776
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,510
everyone.

777
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,400
Master's two children

778
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,490
were just innocent little kids back then,

779
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,550
but that vicious wretch

780
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,000
still threw them into the well.

781
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,730
Fortunately, that day, Master advised me

782
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,580
to be more respectful to Qing Yun.

783
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,850
Acting on impulse, I hid away

784
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,300
and thus survived.

785
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,930
So Lady Jia Yun...

786
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,250
Right, Jia Yun was Master's
youngest daughter.

787
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,680
After they left,

788
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,600
I immediately went down into the well.

789
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,760
But

790
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,770
only Jia Yun survived.

791
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,970
Her older brother carried her
on his back until his death

792
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,610
and ended up drowning himself.

793
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,440
That's how Jia Yun ended up
like she is now.

794
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,920
So you did all this

795
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,070
to make Qing Yun and the others
pay blood for blood?

796
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,780
For a lowborn woman like me,

797
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,760
I had to become even more ruthless
than those villains

798
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,320
to seek justice for my master's family.

799
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,070
But why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

800
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,030
Miss Qin.

801
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,800
The gold heist involved military funds.

802
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,360
Have you ever wondered

803
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,720
why it could remain hidden for 15 years?

804
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,690
General Zhang was brave and upright,

805
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
and my master was kind and generous.

806
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,760
Why did they die tragically
at the hands of villains,

807
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,840
while those scoundrels could rise to power

808
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,440
and do whatever they please?

809
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,830
In this world,

810
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,880
there's no true justice

811
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,660
or clear distinctions
between right and wrong.

812
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,660
It all comes down to power and money.

813
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,430
True justice,

814
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,920
clear distinctions
between right and wrong...

815
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,260
Wan.

816
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,550
When judging a case, remember:
official matters belong to authorities,

817
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,950
right and wrong have reason,
and severity is governed by law.

818
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,330
One must not override public justice
for personal reasons,

819
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,040
nor bend the law

820
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,000
to favor personal relationships.

821
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,630
The unexceedable bounds
of severity and leniency

822
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,030
constitute the law;

823
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,780
carefully upholding legal principles while
deeply considering human circumstances

824
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,910
is what makes the law strict and clear.

825
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,170
Even if perfect justice
is hard to seek in this world,

826
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,650
one must not lose faith because of it,

827
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,870
much less use it as an excuse to do evil.

828
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,740
Only by upholding justice

829
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,630
with a public-minded heart

830
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,330
can we change

831
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,590
