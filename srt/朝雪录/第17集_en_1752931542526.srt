00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thank you, thank you

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Lin Mu Yun

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come, you also taste

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wife, you just stared at Lin Mu Yun, almost didn't eat much

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can't eat

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can't eat

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I accidentally met him just now

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I was afraid that my heart would be exposed

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was afraid that my heart would be exposed

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Not blame you

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Who is the big enemy of this brother?

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Can be like a nobody

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I have imagined him countless times

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I have imagined him countless times

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I didn't expect it to be a real gentleman

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Wife, he hurt your family

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No matter how gentleman he looks, he is also a bad person

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Smile

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Xiaowan

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Scared me to death

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's me

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Finally escaped

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why didn't you two call me when you two ran out?

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's very stuffy inside

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Come out to get some air

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know what happened to the Princess Yu

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I have to stare at my wedding

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In those women's houses

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There is a son, nephew, nephew

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Born in the blue jade tree, not ordinary

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No future, not married

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They are all waiting for me to save the husband and the disaster

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I broke my hand

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't help it

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's rare that you can hold it

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a progress

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Princess, little sister

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why are you here?

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm afraid that you have missed the twin aunt

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Come to teach you

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I ate too much

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just come to disperse

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have to see the aunt later

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You are lucky

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Princess Yu Wang, you are as good as the East Sea

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You are as good as the South Mountain

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Good

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's drink to the toast

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Princess Yu Wang, you are as good as the East Sea

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You are as good as the South Mountain

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yu Wang, I'll drink with you

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Lord Li

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Come

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Come

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Come

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Come

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Come

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I dare not come over to toast every year

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Who are they?

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They are all from the theater

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The one who toasts over there is Liu Renlin

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Keep an eye on him

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Li Siqi

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I just found out that you still live in the theater

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If you don't mind

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
My green and gray garden is pretty good

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm here because of the military order

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I should be in the theater

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can't do it

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Li Siqi is just doing his job

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm rude

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Come

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Mr. Pang, cheers

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Li Muyan is very cautious

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's hard to change the middle

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Nonsense

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't give birth to my baby

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Who gave birth to it?

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You are so rude

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are drunk

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You are drunk

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't give birth to it

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How could I know?

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Mr. Shu, I can only advise you

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Only the bride knows who the father of the child is

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So you should not offend the girl

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I should treat you better after I die

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Finally, you are right

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You can't offend the girl

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
She is very good

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Come

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come, let's drink

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Come

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Come

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Come

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Prince Yi is so handsome

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So many embroidery

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Come

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Come

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's invite Prince Yu to say a few words

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ok

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Come

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's drink to Prince Yu

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Come

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Please tell Prince Yu

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm not good at drinking

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I want to go back to the inn to rest

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I won't go there in person

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't want to disturb Prince Yu

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Ok

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
As you know

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The crown prince has two cases in Jingzhou

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm very happy

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you can give me some advice after I go back

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will be very honored

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You know the two are different

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They are different

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm not ashamed to be a man who is not good at reading

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't thank you

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Please

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Brother

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You haven't established your foot in the Ministry of Justice

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is it appropriate to tear your face at this time?

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have no face to speak with her

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Come

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Come

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Good

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Good

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If Sister Wu knows that there is such a big ranking

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She will cry again

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Then don't let her know

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Who let her make mistakes

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Punish her to be a minor

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Pang Gong

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Why did Liu Renli leave in advance?

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
In this case

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Even the crown prince doesn't care about it

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You are right

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Liu Cao Si is afraid of being watched by Yan Chi

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So he had to avoid it

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why?

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He has been in Qingyuan Pawn Shop

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yan Chi is the one who did this case

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What?

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He has something to do with that case?

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How dare he do this

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He has been out of the country since the news came out

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If he has evidence in Yan Chi's hands

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I will never recommend him to the crown prince

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't worry, young master

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's clean

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The two of them are so restless

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I have to find a place to relax

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's the crown prince

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Little crazy

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What are you doing?

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Master told me to watch here

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Little crazy

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I heard that the ninth wife of the Qin family is my future wife-in-law

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
My future wife-in-law

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I heard that my wife-in-law has done a lot of work on the case in Jingzhou

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Right?

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
My wife-in-law looks like a baby

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What can she do?

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't ask me

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You have asked me many times

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't know

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It seems that it is hard to say

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You said that there are only a few lines in the case

185
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What is inconvenient to let people know?

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Cut the case

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
My brother

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Push the case

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It doesn't matter if people know

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Criminal law

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let the book check

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Catch people

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
My wife-in-law's little body is not very good

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Then there is only a feast left

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What's wrong?

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My wife-in-law can't be a coroner, right?

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Thanks

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Wait a minute

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why do you thank me?

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you for telling me

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
My future wife-in-law is a master of playing dead

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I didn't tell you anything

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
As long as my brother thinks

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can say it

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You are the crown prince

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
How can you wrong me?

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Come

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
King Japanese, дело

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Good

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Where have you been?

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Going to the bathroom

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Start

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Start

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,300
crucial

216
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,360
V laisser

217
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,840
difficulties

218
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,920
Wake up

219
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,240
How am I

220
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,000
Hello

221
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,560
Press

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:14,800
An

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
Nice!

224
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,480
Nice!

225
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,700
Great!

226
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Good job!

227
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Good job!

228
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
So good!

229
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Good job!

230
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Good job!

231
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Good job!

232
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
Sister Jiu, you are so beautiful!

233
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Yes!

234
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
So beautiful!

235
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:40,980
This is...

236
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,580
Are you okay?

237
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,360
My lord!

238
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Your Highness!

239
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Don't move!

240
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
Prince Yu is seriously ill.

241
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
You can't move.

242
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Fu Ling, go get the pen.

243
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
Yes.

244
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
She's dead.

245
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
It's not me.

246
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
I can't let go.

247
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
I can't let go.

248
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
I can't let go.

249
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
I can't let go.

250
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
It's not me.

251
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
I can't let go.

252
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
It's not me.

253
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Be quiet!

254
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,480
Bai Feng.

255
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
Yes.

256
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Lock the scene.

257
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Whoever leaves without permission will be killed.

258
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Yes.

259
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Lock the scene!

260
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
What's going on?

261
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Where is the jade boat?

262
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
It's here.

263
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
It's here.

264
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
It's here.

265
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
It's here.

266
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,480
Remove the blood and stop at the blood-colored red room.

267
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Yes.

268
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Your Highness.

269
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
You are Wang Zhizhou?

270
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

271
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Zhizhou is old.

272
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
You don't have to be so polite.

273
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

274
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
The suspect, Yang Ying, is being escorted to the government office.

275
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Please interrogate him as soon as possible.

276
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
Yes, Your Highness.

277
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Yes, Your Highness.

278
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Take this medicine to the farmhouse.

279
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
You'll be better in two seasons.

280
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Yes.

281
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
How is it?

282
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
It's nothing.

283
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
How is Shu Zu?

284
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
He is fine.

285
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Did you find anything suspicious?

286
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Not yet.

287
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Thank you for saving Shu Zu.

288
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
It's not necessary to thank me.

289
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,480
It's easy to commit suicide if such a thing happens at the banquet.

290
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I want to see the body of the leader as soon as possible.

291
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
So as not to spread rumors.

292
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Okay.

293
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
I'll ask Bai Feng to escort you and Ning Er to the government office.

294
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
I'll go to you after I see the scene.

295
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Ning Er, let's go.

296
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Okay.

297
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
I'll go too.

298
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Let's go.

299
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Oh my god!

300
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Have you seen enough?

301
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
It's my turn, right?

302
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
How could I see enough?

303
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
It's very wonderful.

304
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Wait a little longer.

305
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
You've been watching for so long.

306
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
I haven't seen it yet.

307
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Why is it suddenly over?

308
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
It's over?

309
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Let me see.

310
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Help me hold it.

311
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
What's wrong?

312
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
It's not necessary.

313
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
It's just watching people sew clothes.

314
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Can sewing clothes be the same as sewing people?

315
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Okay.

316
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
I've told you.

317
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Don't watch the banquet at night.

318
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
You have to watch it.

319
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Look.

320
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Don't listen to me.

321
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
What are you doing?

322
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Help me this time.

323
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
In the future, I will definitely fix it.

324
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I told you not to watch the banquet.

325
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Are you uncomfortable now?

326
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
You're so annoying.

327
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Go to the bathhouse.

328
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Okay.

329
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
It's okay.

330
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
I've done what you wanted.

331
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
If you dare to break your promise,

332
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
I'll kill you.

333
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
No.

334
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,480
I can't keep my promise.

335
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Why are you laughing?

336
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Listen to me.

337
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
I want to get drunk.

338
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
No.

339
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
If Xige knows,

340
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
she will feed me.

341
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Believe it or not, I'll...

342
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
You're cruel.

343
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Go.

344
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Put it down.

345
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Let Ge Zi go to check.

346
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Yes.

347
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
You go out, too.

348
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Yes.

349
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
He died by a chest?

350
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Yes.

351
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
The arrow hit the heart.

352
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
He died by a chest.

353
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
But if it was intentional,

354
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
the murderer must be sure to kill him.

355
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,480
But I didn't find any traces of hands and feet when I was watching the banquet.

356
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Is it really an accident?

357
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,480
There must be a reason for any accident.

358
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
What did Yang Ying say?

359
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Wang Zhi Zhou is interrogating.

360
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
What are you worried about?

361
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
I want to see the law.

362
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
You can recommend me.

363
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
I want to take this case.

364
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Then take it.

365
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Why are you hesitating?

366
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
But you're in charge of Qingyuan Pawn Shop.

367
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
And the case of Yan Yun's corruption.

368
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
I don't want to cause you trouble.

369
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Prince Yu is the only imperial uncle of His Majesty.

370
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
He is the highest imperial family member.

371
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
In his banquet,

372
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
not only did the death case happen,

373
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
he was also suddenly in danger.

374
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,480
I can't just sit and watch.

375
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Moreover,

376
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
this banquet

377
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,480
gathered officials from Shangjing and Southeast China.

378
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,480
It's hard to say how many people were involved in the case.

379
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,480
It may not be related to the two cases I'm responsible for.

380
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,480
You came to help me.

381
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
It's a help to me.

382
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
It's not a trouble.

383
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Great.

384
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Is this the arrow shot from the swords?

385
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
There are many arrows here.

386
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
Except the one shot by the arrow.

387
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
I picked it up myself.

388
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
I didn't let anyone else do it.

389
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Strange.

390
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,480
This arrow is much lighter than the one shot by the arrow.

391
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Look.

392
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Give me the arrow.

393
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
This arrow is made of iron.

394
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
It's made of wood.

395
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
This arrow is made of pure iron.

396
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Even if it's an iron arrow,

397
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
the speed and power of this box

398
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
are enough to kill.

399
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
No need to change it to pure iron.

400
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
The problem is on this box.

401
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Pure iron is too heavy.

402
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
It needs to be pulled twice to shoot.

403
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
The double-edged arrow in the show

404
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,480
will definitely design the timing and location of the first arrow.

405
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
And Yang Ying and Qingli have been working together for so long.

406
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
They should have a tacit understanding and trust.

407
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
But the man of the bear took advantage of this.

408
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,480
He didn't shoot the iron arrow according to the time.

409
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
While Qingli was not prepared,

410
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
he took the opportunity.

411
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,480
The man of the bear needs to be familiar with this box.

412
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
So he can know where the iron arrow is.

413
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
The arrow is not aimed at the target.

414
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
It can hit Qingli's arrow.

415
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,480
When Qingli was shot, he was about to shoot the arrow.

416
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,480
That was the only time he was behind Yang Ying.

417
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,480
The man of the bear knew Yang Ying would be in danger.

418
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
So he used the mechanism.

419
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,480
He could take the opportunity so accurately.

420
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,480
He must have a good idea about the arrangement of this show.

421
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
In this way,

422
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
everyone in the Double-edged Arrow Class is suspicious.

423
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Because the students of the Double-edged Arrow Class want to make a mistake,

424
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
they have to sing the whole script of this show.

425
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
They all know the arrangement of this show.

426
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
And the direction of the arrow.

427
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Such an important prop.

428
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Why didn't Yang Ying check it before the show?

429
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Because Yang Ying is the vice class leader.

430
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:17,300
She also has to be responsible for the

431
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,480
mess in the troupe.

432
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Even if she did it herself,

433
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
she couldn't have carried the arrow on her back.

434
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
As long as someone took advantage of her absence,

435
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
she could take the opportunity to take action.

436
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Now,

437
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
we have to find out who else can take this arrow

438
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,480
except Yang Ying.

439
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
I don't understand this trick.

440
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
Hey, Wan Yang Ying.

441
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
You admitted that

442
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,480
you killed the Double-edged Arrow Class leader Qing Li

443
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
and made a mistake in the show.

444
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Is it true?

445
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,480
It's true.

446
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Since it's true,

447
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,480
then make a sound on the bow.

448
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
No, no, no.

449
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
No, no, no.

450
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
No, no.

451
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Yang Ying,

452
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
on the birthday banquet,

453
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I saw you kill the class leader Qing Li.

454
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
The evidence is all here.

455
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,480
You can't escape from the crime of killing.

456
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
After this mission,

457
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
I have to make a vow.

458
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480
I don't want to kill anyone before the mission.

459
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,480
As long as you make a sound on the bow,

460
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I will take the initiative to make a vow

461
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
to spare your life.

462
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
It's not me.

463
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Be more careful.

464
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
It's not me.

465
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
It's not me.

466
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Yang Ying,

467
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
you want to play tricks on me.

468
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Make a sound on the bow.

469
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
If you make a sound again,

470
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Stop.

471
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Stop.

472
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

473
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Why did Wang Zhizhou kill the criminal?

474
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,480
How dare Yang Ying make a vow?

475
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,480
I have to punish her severely.

476
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
You are killing me.

477
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Yang Ying was blocked when she was killed.

478
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
She couldn't breathe,

479
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
so she couldn't shout and scream.

480
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Her breath was in a mess.

481
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Her body was in a mess.

482
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Your Highness,

483
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,480
she is lying.

484
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,480
The girl you are talking about

485
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
is the one who I consider as the night master,

486
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
the one who killed the criminal, Mr. Jiu.

487
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Mr. Jiu,

488
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,480
please forgive me for my words.

489
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
If Yang Ying has been unconscious for too long,

490
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
she will have a bad breath.

491
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
I have to save her as soon as possible.

492
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Take Yang Ying to the prison.

493
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Yes.

494
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
You must save her life.

495
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Let's go.

496
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Your Highness,

497
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I am a man of Qihai Valley.

498
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,480
I won't use my body to commit crimes.

499
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,480
The criminal, Yang Ying, has confessed that

500
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
she killed the night master Qingli

501
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
but she refused to confess.

502
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
What's the situation?

503
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
It's...

504
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Yang Ying admitted that she wanted to be the master

505
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,480
but Qingli disobeyed her order

506
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,480
and gave the double half to someone else in the North.

507
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Yang Ying will regret it.

508
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,480
When did Qingli give the double half to someone else?

509
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Where did she poison herself?

510
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
It's...

511
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
How did Yang Ying use the Sword Yard to kill?

512
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,080
Yang Ying has already confessed.

513
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,880
Why bother to investigate these small things?

514
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,280
If Yang Ying wants to kill the leader of Qingli,

515
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,880
he has many ways and methods that are not known to the world.

516
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,680
Why does he have to kill people in public?

517
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,680
The spirit is a very rough and rough person.

518
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Yang Ying is probably just being angry.

519
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,880
My family has done such a bad thing.

520
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,780
Wow!

521
00:28:49,480 --> 00:29:13,880
So Wang Zhi przSlash

522
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,160
How can you say that?

523
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,280
Shen Yi committed a crime against the law.

524
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,880
How can he be sure of his law?

525
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,080
That's also the law that His Majesty has made.

526
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,200
He never denies it.

527
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,400
Wang Zhizhou, do you want to defend His Majesty?

528
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,760
Your Highness.

529
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,880
I have always been loyal to His Majesty.

530
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,160
I have been a minister for many years.

531
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,840
I have always been a man of good character.

532
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,080
I don't want to be a lowly official.

533
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,360
I just want to be a good man.

534
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,040
A good man?

535
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,760
Wang Zhizhou, if you want to end this case as soon as possible,

536
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,360
I'm afraid you've made the wrong decision.

537
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,080
I'm stupid.

538
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,640
Please give me advice.

539
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,640
The man who committed the crime destroyed Prince Yu's birthday banquet.

540
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,320
Prince Yu almost died.

541
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,520
If you end this case as soon as possible, what will Prince Yu think?

542
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,920
If he files a report to impeach you for neglecting the law and lying to you,

543
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,120
not to mention the case,

544
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,120
I'm afraid Wang Zhizhou will be caught in the trap.

545
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,020
I...

546
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,840
I will have to go.

547
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,560
If you don't want to die with me,

548
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,600
be it a battlefield or an uphill fight,

549
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:59,200
go from wavering position to�

550
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,040
and do what you want.

551
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,280
I have to leave so I can make more arrangements.

552
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,000
Thank you for advice.

553
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm here.

554
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Guards!

555
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Guards!

556
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
As the chief officer of Yi State,

557
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
you should be concerned about the officials' ways.

558
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That's why you're so diligent.

559
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
If you're a official like this,

560
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
why are you so strict?

561
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That's why

562
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
your parents are so noble.

563
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Father is poor and poor.

564
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That's why he wrote the law.

565
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
But he only wants to pay for his mistakes

566
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
because of the false charge.

567
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
His whole life is not a law.

568
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's you,

569
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
his most beloved daughter.

570
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
In terms of the law,

571
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm not as good as you.

572
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
In terms of the official field, you're not as good as me.

573
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You only care about the law.

574
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'll help you to have no grudges.

575
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We'll work together

576
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
to make sure that the work of the court will be paid off.

577
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Thank you.

578
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
If I were a man,

579
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I would have killed the enemy long ago.

580
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Where is he?

581
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Why are you so angry?

582
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What's the purpose of your boat?

583
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What's the purpose of your bow?

584
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm a man of the world.

585
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm a soldier in the battlefield.

586
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm not as carefree as you.

587
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Cheers!

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Let me tell you.

589
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Although I'm a man,

590
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm not as carefree as you.

591
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Where are you going?

592
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
My late father

593
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
has changed his life to a position of the king.

594
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's not a law.

595
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's not a law.

596
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm just

597
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
a nobody.

598
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm not as good as those rich people in the capital.

599
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But those who are close to me

600
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
are all the people who are greedy for positions.

601
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
None of them are good.

602
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yes, none of them are good.

603
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
My luxurious life

604
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
is not because of those vulgar things.

605
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's right.

606
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's not easy for a man to grow up like you.

607
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't worry.

608
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
From now on,

609
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'll treat you as my good friend.

610
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I will never let anyone take advantage of you.

611
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What kind of friend?

612
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Good friend.

613
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Cheers!

614
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Cheers!

615
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Cheers!

616
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Good friend.

617
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Since we're all good friends,

618
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I have to tell you the truth, right?

619
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Of course.

620
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Actually,

621
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
that day,

622
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
when I was testing the poem,

623
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I was

624
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
closing my eyes.

625
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
What?

626
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What?

627
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I was fooled by you.

628
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Good friend,

629
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm telling the truth.

630
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You can't be angry.

631
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I didn't expect you wouldn't dare to look at me.

632
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Come on.

633
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Let's drink to our brothers.

634
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Cheers!

635
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I say,

636
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
you're afraid of being tricked into marriage.

637
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm afraid of being trapped in the inn.

638
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Luckily,

639
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
we're married.

640
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
As long as you don't mind my justice,

641
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I will never mind your phoenix school.

642
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Isn't it beautiful?

643
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Brother Yue,

644
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
that's a high sword.

645
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
If we can do it,

646
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
we can go to the wide sky

647
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
and enjoy ourselves.

648
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Then we can forget our worries.

649
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Great!

650
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Come on.

651
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's a deal.

652
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We can't be together.

653
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Cheers!

654
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You're heartless.

655
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
If it weren't for me,

656
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
you wouldn't be where you are today.

657
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
What's the point of a small inn?

658
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
This inn

659
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and even the whole Pang family

660
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
should be mine.

661
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Go!

662
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
My lady, come here.

663
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You're finally back.

664
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You must be tired.

665
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Luckily.

666
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Fuling,

667
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
are you blaming me

668
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
for making your wife suffer?

669
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
How dare I blame you?

670
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I just feel sorry for my wife.

671
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Then why did you

672
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
call yourself me in front of your wife?

673
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Now you call yourself me.

674
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
How can you be the same as your wife?

675
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm your wife.

676
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
How can you be the same as your wife?

677
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Okay.

678
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I won't let your wife suffer anymore.

679
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Okay?

680
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That's more like it.

681
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Go visit Lord Yu.

682
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You should rest early.

683
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
If you meet Qin Yan,

684
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
you should remind him.

685
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I've also checked the account book.

686
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Tell him to be careful not to get caught in the fire.

687
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Why do you always help the House of Zhongyong?

688
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Because if you stay in the House of Zhongyong,

689
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I can't let anything happen to them.

690
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I don't want to involve you.

691
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
This is the kind of food that Ying Qi used.

692
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
If I'm not around,

693
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
you can look up to the sky when you're in danger.

694
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Just pull down the heart.

695
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll be there as soon as possible.

696
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
This is the eagle whistle

697
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
that is specially equipped for the King of Shuoxi.

698
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
After the whistle,

699
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
it will make a sound similar to the sound of the sea.

700
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I can hear it within two miles.

701
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Do you remember?

702
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I do.

703
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You're far away from me.

704
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
There's a fire on the edge.

705
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If you're near me,

706
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
you'll get hurt.

707
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Honey,

708
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
go back.

709
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's getting cold.

710
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You don't have to get up early tomorrow.

711
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You should rest well.

712
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
If you have any news about Qingli love,

713
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'll pick you up.

714
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Okay.

715
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Let's go.

716
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Your Highness,

717
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
you should go back and rest.

718
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You're the only one who can solve the problem.

719
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The eagle whistle.

720
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Why hasn't Master Qin arrived yet?

721
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You're in a hurry.

722
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's normal to wait.

723
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Don't you know the reason?

724
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's because Li Muyun and Yan Chi suddenly came.

725
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Can I say that?

726
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
If Master Qin knows you're being watched by Yan Chi,

727
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
he can introduce you to the Crown Prince.

728
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The Crown Prince?

729
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Li Muyun is here.

730
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Everyone knows that His Majesty wants to investigate the South-East.

731
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You're the first one to avoid him.

732
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Then you're the one who's in a hurry.

733
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You can guess anyone with your hind legs.

734
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But you're not clean.

735
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
The Crown Prince wants someone who can help him earn money.

736
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Not someone who'll cause him trouble.

737
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
What should we do now?

738
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I don't care.

739
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
If you can't get through the Crown Prince's path,

740
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
you have to find a way to fill the hole.

741
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Otherwise, I may not be able to save my head.

742
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Besides,

743
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
if it weren't for me,

744
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
who would protect your business?

745
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
What do you think of me?

746
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
A hen?

747
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
We made a deal.

748
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You go with your master.

749
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
He'll take over his double-dealer class.

750
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'll take over my ten-room inn.

751
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Ten-room inn?

752
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's none of your business.

753
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You said it.

754
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Now, you want me to fill the hole.

755
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He wants my ten-room inn.

756
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Why?

757
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
He really wants your ten-room inn?

758
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
When?

759
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
He came to you just now?

760
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You should have known his plan.

761
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I went to see him a few days ago.

762
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
He told me that Qingli lost the double-dealer class to someone else.

763
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And he threatened him with what happened that year.

764
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
A woman is afraid of her life.

765
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I told him not to mention it to you.

766
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But...

767
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm confused.

768
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But now that Qingli is dead,

769
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
why does Mrs. Qin still want my ten-room inn?

770
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
What does it mean?

771
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Think about it.

772
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
A woman has been holding such a big thing in her heart for so many years.

773
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's not easy.

774
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You miss her. Don't count me in.

775
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
She's old.

776
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Why do you still miss her?

777
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It's just because of the past.

778
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
She can help you.

779
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
She loves beauty.

780
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Give her more.

781
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Just give her enough to make a living.

782
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
If she dares to threaten me with that thing,

783
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I promise she won't get a single coin.

784
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
What about me?

785
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Do you want to die too?

786
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Master, Mr. Qin is here.

787
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Hello.

788
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000

789
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000

Please.

806
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Please.

807
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Please.

808
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Can you please come out?

809
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
What is that sound?

810
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Got anything inside it?

811
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,300
Why isn't there anyone to save me?

812
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,040
How can you hèron my soul?

813
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,920
