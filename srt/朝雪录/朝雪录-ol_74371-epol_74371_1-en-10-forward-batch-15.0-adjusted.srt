1
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,710
Mr. Qin Liang, I'm entrusting
my daughter to you.

2
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,800
-Go!
-Minister Shen, don't worry!

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,460
Hurry, run!

4
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,320
Must capture Shen Yi's whole family!

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,530
Run! Just go!

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,390
-Father! Mother!
-Run!

7
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,240
Mother!

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,890
Don't be afraid.

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,320
Father!

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,860
Don't let any of them get away!

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,000
Mr. Qin Liang!

12
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,840
My daughter, Wan,

13
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,840
upon reading this letter,

14
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,400
give up seeking justice

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,000
and revenge.

16
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,570
Never return to the capital.

17
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:54,960
Father,

18
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,460
what kind of injustice

19
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,950
could be so severe as to get Mr. Qin Liang

20
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,610
and our entire family killed?

21
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,120
There's no way I'm not

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,840
avenging your deaths.

23
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,270
From today on,

24
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,090
I am no longer Shen Wan,

25
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,800
but Qin Wan, daughter of Mr. Qin Liang.

26
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:13,150
I will try to get to the bottom of it

27
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,260
and seek justice for you all.

[Coroner's Diary]

29
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,270
[Episode 1]

30
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,970
Mrs. Huo, what do you mean by this?

31
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,630
Madam Qin,

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,470
it was a reckless promise we made

33
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,680
with your second son's wife

34
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,860
when we were young

35
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,260
[Madam Qin]

36
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,000
to make our children betrothed.

37
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,700
Madam Qin, could you please help us

38
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,700
[Mrs. Huo]

39
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,220
cancel this engagement?

40
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,300
You're really putting me on the spot.

41
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,570
Although our Qin family hasn't
split into smaller households,

42
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,079
as their stepmother,

43
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,250
how can I interfere in
the second branch's domestic affairs?

44
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,250
That makes sense.

45
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,360
Mrs. Huo, as you know,

46
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,600
Qin Liang is not my biological son.

47
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,860
He hasn't been home for years.

48
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,700
His daughter's marriage

49
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,950
is not something I can decide.

50
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,140
But his wife passed away young.

51
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,320
Their daughter has been raised
in Medicine King Valley

52
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
without parental guidance.

53
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,870
It's been over a decade,

54
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,000
and we don't know
her temperament or character.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,730
Mrs. Huo, please rest assured.

56
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,470
When Qin Liang returns,

57
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,070
I will discuss the matter of canceling
the engagement with him.

58
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,790
Our Qin family

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,700
won't let a childhood joke

60
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,700
ruin the future of our younger generation.

61
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,570
Well...

62
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,210
Grandma, there's something
I need to tell you.

63
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,770
She's back? Why?

64
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,990
Greetings, Grandma.
I'm Qin Wan, your granddaughter.

65
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,850
Greetings, Madam. I'm Fuling.

66
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,920
Mother,

67
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,270
Fuling is the maidservant
who attends to Wan.

[Third Master Qin's Wife, Lin]

69
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,920
I saw her when the second branch
sent New Year's gifts last year.

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,190
Raise your head.

71
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,450
Are you really Qin Wan?

72
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,700
Grandma, I'm Wan.

73
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,860
This is Father's seal.

74
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,300
Please take a look, Grandma.

75
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,110
Caihe.

76
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,010
Of all times to return, you...

77
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,480
I encountered a shipwreck
on my way home.

78
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,940
Father saved me at the cost of his life.

79
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,740
Were it not for Father's sacrifice,

80
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,400
I wouldn't have made it here
to see you, Grandma.

81
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,610
This young lady has suffered so much.

82
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,370
Indeed.

83
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,390
Grandma, this is

84
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,890
indeed Uncle Qin Liang's personal seal.

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,160
It's only been a few years since he left.

86
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,040
How could he be gone?

87
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,250
Oh, my poor son!

88
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,350
Madam Qin,

89
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,270
since you have
a family affair to handle,

90
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,740
we'll leave you to it.

91
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,740
Let me return
this jade pendant to its owner.

92
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,330
I'll take my leave.

93
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,130
Well...

94
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,080
Quickly, give this jade pendant
back to them.

95
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,920
This engagement cannot be called off.

96
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,750
Hurry!

97
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,520
Oh, my poor son!

98
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,600
How could they break off the engagement
in public like this?

99
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,659
How disrespectful to our Qin family!

100
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,640
My Lady! My Lady!

101
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,550
Madam, Her Ladyship fainted!

102
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,990
Please go get a physician!

103
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,080
My Lady! My Lady!

104
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,250
My Lady, you freaked me out!

105
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,060
I thought you really fainted.

106
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,360
How could we end that dilemma
if I didn't fake passing out?

107
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
What took you so long?

108
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,120
The moment you fainted,

109
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,310
I was soon taken
to face Madam Qin's interrogation.

110
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,390
What did they ask?

111
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,560
Just everything

112
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,920
we rehearsed before.

113
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,900
"Madam,

114
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,310
the physician
from Medicine King Valley said

115
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,340
Her Ladyship had fully recovered.

116
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,310
So Master Qin Liang took Her Ladyship
back home for ancestral worship.

117
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,040
But on the way, we encountered a storm.

118
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,270
The boat capsized.

119
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,390
To save Her Ladyship, Master Qin Liang

120
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,110
was swept away by a wave.

121
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,240
When Her Ladyship came around,

122
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,670
Master Qin Liang was already gone.

123
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,170
Her Ladyship had no choice

124
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,190
but to ask someone to help bury
Master Qin Liang properly on the spot.

125
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,670
We made it back, starving and exhausted."

126
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,130
Fortunately, Master Qin Liang
wasn't close to them.

127
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,170
And they haven't seen
his daughter for years.

128
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,500
Or we just couldn't convince them easily.

129
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,600
Good.

130
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,820
Now tell me

131
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,470
about that engagement.

132
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,150
Our master's wife arranged it
with the Huos before she passed away.

133
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,030
Back then,

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,150
Mr. Huo was just
a minor county magistrate.

135
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,010
They definitely wanted
to use this childhood betrothal

136
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,030
to build ties with the Qin family's
first branch and the Marquis of Devotion.

137
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,789
Later, Master Qin Liang

138
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:57,840
took Miss Qin
to Medicine King Valley for treatment.

139
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,909
After she passed away last year,

140
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,360
Master Qin Liang was in great agony

141
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,160
and didn't inform the Qin family.

142
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,360
Now that Mr. Huo
has been promoted to prefect,

143
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,760
they surely see this engagement
not good enough for them anymore.

144
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
What a bunch of treacherous gits.

145
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,270
This is actually better.

146
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,510
Without this engagement,

147
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,720
we can plan better in the future.

148
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,960
But the engagement called off in public

149
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
has disgraced the Qin family.

150
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,390
Madam Qin won't dare
to offend Prefect Huo.

151
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,120
She'll surely take it out on me.

152
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,960
You need to be cautious too.

153
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,150
Don't worry, My Lady.

154
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,840
I was sold to the Qin family
when I was young.

155
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,970
I'm experienced in dealing with them.

156
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,450
Once the remote corner,

157
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,550
now the Buddhist pure land.

158
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,420
Master Pu'an is here.

159
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,720
May all taboos stay away.

160
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,100
Once the remote corner,

161
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,060
now the Buddhist pure land.

162
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,940
Master Pu'an is here...

163
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,760
Looks like Madam Qin thinks
I'm some kind of jinx.

164
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,910
They're holding an exorcism ritual here.

165
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,550
What...

166
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,000
How could she do this?

167
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,600
They're bullying you!

168
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,720
What are you doing?

169
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,760
Madam Qin's order—

170
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,340
Fuling has privately
badmouthed the master

171
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,150
and must be sold
and sent away immediately.

172
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,740
Fuling is my servant.
I will discipline her.

173
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,610
Leave her alone.

174
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,470
You've only been back in the mansion
for a few hours.

175
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,870
And now you already dare
to refute my order?

176
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,750
Do you have any respect for your elders?

177
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,370
Please forgive

178
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,650
my rudeness, Grandma.

179
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,730
Fuling accompanied me
on the long journey home.

180
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,380
I'm grateful to her
for not leaving me behind.

181
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,720
Considering her youth
and ignorance, please

182
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,520
forgive her this once, Grandma.

183
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,120
It's my fault.

184
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,440
I dare not speak out of turn again.

185
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,770
Please spare me, Madam.

186
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,560
Madam,

187
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,050
the ritual has just begun.

188
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,790
Punishing them now would be inauspicious.

189
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,800
Why don't we leave it for later?

190
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,150
Fine.

191
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,070
Given your merit
in protecting your mistress,

192
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,020
I'll spare you this time.

193
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,300
But Wan,

194
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,760
you've been lax
in disciplining your servants.

195
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,790
From today on, you shall
copy scriptures in this courtyard

196
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,340
to pray for your parents

197
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,380
with your monthly allowance
cut for a year.

198
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,380
Only when you learn to be a filial child

199
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,610
can you come out and show your face.

200
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,910
Thank you for showing mercy, Grandma.

201
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,720
It's all my fault.

202
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,830
It's alright. This isn't your fault.

203
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,760
With an intention to punish me,

204
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,920
Madam Qin can easily find ways to do so.

205
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,550
Fuling.

206
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,750
Miss Qin was my best friend
in Medicine King Valley.

207
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,150
I, like her, see you as a friend

208
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,440
rather than a servant.

209
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,550
So you don't need to be
a meek servant in front of me.

210
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,150
My Lady...

211
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,610
But

212
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,170
without a monthly allowance,

213
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,630
how are we supposed
to get through this year?

214
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,930
Don't worry.

215
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,000
Even if it's just for

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,730
her kind and benevolent image,

217
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,300
Madam Qin won't starve us.

218
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,160
Uncle Qin Liang,

219
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,250
you and my parents

220
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,170
all told me not to seek revenge.

221
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,300
But I won't find peace in the world

222
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,640
until the culprit who murdered you
is brought to justice.

223
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,970
Uncle Qin Liang, please

224
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,490
forgive me for using your daughter's name

225
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,150
to carry out dangerous deeds.

226
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,420
Master, please rest assured.

227
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,930
I will definitely follow your words

228
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,650
and take good care of Her Ladyship,

229
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,710
never leaving her.

230
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,720
Your elder brother,
the Marquis of Zhongyong,

231
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,140
[Third Master Qin, Qin An]

232
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,120
is now highly valued

233
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,280
by the Crown Prince in the capital.

234
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Keep in touch with him regularly

235
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,730
and try to secure
an official position for Chen as well.

236
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,580
[Young Master Qin, Qin Chen]

237
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,690
Don't just mess around
in the back courtyard all day.

238
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,560
My elder brother has no time
to pay attention to me.

239
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,160
Although we have the same father,

240
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,640
he's the eldest legitimate son
of Father's first wife,

241
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,400
while I was born to Father's second wife.

242
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,000
We're from different wombs.

243
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,680
Mother!

244
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,910
So what?

245
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,330
Eight taels of silver!

246
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,390
He still has to call me Mother!

247
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,930
This old mansion

248
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,610
still relies on you
to uphold its reputation.

249
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,290
Stop bringing about
"second wife" all the time.

250
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,800
Do you want everyone to know that you
were raised by your father's second wife?

251
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
Even your son is grown up now.

252
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,790
Why are you still such a failure?

253
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,250
Father, please don't upset Grandma.

254
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,920
Just listen to her.

255
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:50,950
Go away.

256
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,310
Madam, Miss Qin Wan is here to greet you.

257
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,590
I won't see her.

258
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,600
Madam, today is the day
of the Second Master's funeral.

259
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,080
Miss Qin Wan went to pray
early this morning

260
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,050
and just returned.

261
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,510
Maybe you should let her in

262
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,580
in case those outsiders

263
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,460
say that you're always biased
toward Master Qin An.

264
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,830
What a nuisance.

265
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,190
Let her wait!

266
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
My Lady,

267
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,360
the Madam is talking
with Master Qin An.

268
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,560
Please wait a moment.

269
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,600
I see. Thank you, Miss Caihe.

270
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,240
Prince Jin committed suicide
in the imperial due to his crime.

271
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,340
Didn't they say that
no concrete evidence was found

272
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,070
to prove he killed Consort Jin?

273
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,420
How did he end up committing suicide?

274
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,750
It must be the manipulation

275
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,870
of that Minister S-Shen

276
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,530
of the Supreme Court, Shen Yi.

277
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,990
Mother, I heard that

278
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,040
-My Lady.
-the murder weapon used by Prince Jin

279
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,710
was also hidden by him.

280
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,600
Were it not for his student, Li Muyun,

281
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,940
who reported it to the court,

282
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,890
this case

283
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,520
would have been covered up

284
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,250
by him and Prince Jin together.

285
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,890
Minister Shen

286
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,030
was known as "Shen the Upright,"

287
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,840
a squeaky- clean official,
and an expert in criminal law.

288
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,370
How could he help Prince Jin

289
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,350
do such a corrupt and shady thing?

290
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,150
Was he out of his mind?

291
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,740
You know nothing about the officialdom.

292
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,550
If Shen Yi were truly an upright official,

293
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,410
why would he flee with his family?

294
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,560
I heard that His Majesty

295
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,220
was so irritated
at his fleeing to escape punishment

296
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,560
that His Majesty ordered...

297
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,020
O-Ordered his entire family
to be executed.

298
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,320
But fleeing away didn't help.

299
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,120
It's said that
they encountered a terrible storm

300
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,650
and the entire family died.

301
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,370
"Shen the Upright"? Ridiculous.

302
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,120
Who knows how many shady deals

303
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,580
he made behind the scenes.

304
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,270
This is karma.

305
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,700
He deserved to die.

306
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,440
There's no such thing
as a truly upright official in this world.

307
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,080
Shen Yi merely used his official position

308
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,670
to do some things
to please the common people

309
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,490
and build up his own reputation.

310
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,660
In the end,
he was nothing but a fame-seeker.

311
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,610
Mother, you're absolutely right.

312
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,210
My father would never
collude with Prince Jin.

313
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,560
Who framed him?

314
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,370
Was it Li Muyun

315
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,830
or...

316
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,640
Why did His Majesty
believe those rumors so easily?

317
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,570
Why did Prince Jin commit suicide?

318
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,950
Why?

319
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,960
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,430
No.

321
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,290
I must go to the capital.

322
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,660
I must go to the capital immediately.

323
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,760
Madam, are you tired?

324
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,410
I'll have someone
send us back to the mansion.

325
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,800
I can seldom be this free and at ease.

326
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,970
If the Marquis finds out about this,

327
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,410
I won't be able to sneak out again
in the future.

328
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,400
Back in the day,

329
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,600
I accompanied the Old Marquis
on the military campaigns...

330
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,220
Madam! Madam!

331
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,550
What's wrong, Madam?

332
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,040
Madam, wake up!

333
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,360
Young lady,

334
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,120
could you fetch us a physician?

335
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,840
Madam!

336
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,870
Miss, you'd better

337
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,360
send someone to inform
your family of this.

338
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,440
Madam!

339
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:09,790
No way.

340
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,890
My madam was fine just a moment ago.

341
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,790
Please go get a physician for us.

342
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,080
Madam.

343
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,440
Lay the madam down flat.

344
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,550
Hurry.

345
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,390
Your madam has
an old ailment of wind evil.

346
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,210
Her symptoms worsened six months ago.

347
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,650
Just now, her body
became rigid and unresponsive,

348
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,770
her tongue stiff, throat obstructed,
pulse sluggish, and qi stagnant.

349
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,579
It's a case of wind hysteria
due to wind evil entering the liver.

350
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,640
Yes, you're right.

351
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:31,200
Remember my technique.

352
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,760
Bring me paper and an ink brush.

353
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,920
Continue massaging.

354
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,470
Based on my prescription,

355
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,150
decoct and feed the medicine
to her within two hours.

356
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,030
Keep massaging according to my technique.

357
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,300
Acupuncture would work best for her

358
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,890
if there's someone skilled in it.

359
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,440
If she can break into
a heavy sweat before nightfall,

360
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,040
she'll get over this crisis.

361
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,920
If not,

362
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,360
you gotta prepare for her funeral
within seven days.

363
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,820
Thank you.

364
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,750
My Lady, where have you been?

365
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,400
I told Caihe that

366
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,350
you lost your purse
and went to look for it.

367
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,960
You didn't go
greet Madam Qin this morning.

368
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,820
She was furious

369
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,400
and confined you to quarters again.

370
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,200
Fuling,

371
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,640
I am Shen Wan,

372
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,580
not Qin Wan.

373
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,920
My Lady, you mustn't say
such things recklessly again.

374
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,580
My father neither
colluded with Prince Jin

375
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,240
nor did he flee out of fear of punishment.

376
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,800
He and my mother were set up
and killed by someone.

377
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,100
I saw it with my own eyes.

378
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,030
I also know that

379
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,240
Lord Shen

380
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,870
is an absolutely upright
and good official.

381
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,240
All those who have
slandered and framed him

382
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,830
will be hit hard by karma.

383
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,420
I want to go to the capital

384
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,590
to find my parents' bodies

385
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,980
and clear their names
of false accusations.

386
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,140
Okay, I'm going to beg Madam Qin

387
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,690
to let us go to the capital.

388
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,500
She won't let us leave.

389
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,590
I'll figure out a way myself.

390
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,310
But I can't take you to the capital.

391
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,310
The case of my father and Prince Jin

392
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,890
concerns His Majesty's will.

393
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,020
It's more treacherous than I thought.

394
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,000
It's safer for you to stay here.

395
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,960
Wan, the first day I got
to the Medicine King Valley,

396
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,890
you taught me
how to take care of Miss Qin step by step.

397
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,620
After Miss Qin passed away,

398
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,570
you kept me by your side.

399
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,240
I know I'm not much help

400
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,860
when it comes to big things,

401
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,110
but I can keep you company

402
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,500
and take care of you!

403
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,110
And I swore
before Master Qin Liang's grave that

404
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,150
I would never leave you in this lifetime.

405
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,750
If you don't take me with you,

406
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,160
I'll go on my own

407
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,900
to find you in the capital!

408
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,670
Get up.

409
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,610
Didn't we say no more tears?

410
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,440
I promise you.

411
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,230
We will never be apart

412
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,690
in this lifetime.

413
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,930
Grandma, these fabrics are nice,

414
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,080
but they still can't compare
to that gold-speckled red gauze

415
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,480
[Fifth Lady, Qin Xiang]

416
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,880
from your storeroom.

417
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,360
You've got quite the eye.

418
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,760
That was a gift from the Emperor

419
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,440
to the Marquis of Devotion
and our third branch of the Qin family.

420
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,500
There were only three bolts in total.

421
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,960
How could you possibly get
to use one of them?

422
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,710
Grandma, the Marquis of Anyang's Mansion

423
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,160
is the most prestigious family
in all of Jingzhou.

424
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,560
It's a rare honor that we were
even invited to this wedding.

425
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,160
If I dress well,

426
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,290
won't it reflect glory

427
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,850
on the Qin family as a whole?

428
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,960
Oh, I see your little plan.

429
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,070
Fine.

430
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,310
Have your mother sew two
beautiful dresses.

431
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,440
You'd better wear them properly.

432
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,830
Don't go ruining them.

433
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,640
If you can catch the eye

434
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,830
of Grand Princess,

435
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,430
a good marriage

436
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,920
will naturally come knocking.

437
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,820
Xiang, what are you waiting for?
Thank Grandma.

438
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,960
Thank you, Grandma.

439
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,050
Grandma, you treat me the best!

440
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,600
-I know you.
-Madam.

441
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,470
Princess Yongning
of the Marquis of Anyang's Mansion
has come to vist.

442
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,800
Quickly, invite her in!

443
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,370
[Princess Yongning, Yue Ning]

444
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,840
Greetings, Princess Yongning.

445
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,780
Please rise, Madam.

446
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,450
There's no need for formalities.

447
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,570
Please have a seat, Madam.

448
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,900
Please, Your Ladyship.

449
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,560
Your Ladyship, may I ask what brings

450
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,620
you to our humble home today?

451
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,970
Lvxiu.

452
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,810
I'm here on behalf of Grand Princess

453
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,070
to express gratitude for
Miss Qin's lifesaving kindness.

454
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,610
You mean Wan?

455
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,510
-Let me help you.
-No need.

456
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,530
Let me do it myself.

457
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,330
Give me one.

458
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,280
Miss Qin!

459
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,380
Miss Qin!

460
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,410
Hurry up!

461
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,920
Change your robes and go to the main hall!

462
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,790
The Princess Yongning from
Marquis of Anyang's Mansion

463
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,590
has come to thank you in
person for saving her life!

464
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,160
Princess Yongning?

465
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,450
I haven't saved any princess.

466
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,590
Did you aid an elderly madam

467
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,850
on the street days ago?

468
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,310
That elderly madam

469
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,950
was none other than the Grand Princess,

470
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,750
the matriarch of the
Marquis of Anyang's Mansion!

471
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,590
Princess Yongning is Grand Princess' own
granddaughter,

472
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,720
She's come in person to
convey her grandma's gratitude.

473
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,430
You two, stop what you're doing.

474
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,100
Come help Miss Qin with these buckets!

475
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,930
-Yes.
-Hurry.

476
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,310
Please go ahead, Miss Caihe.

477
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,180
I'll be there shortly.

478
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:37,820
Yes.

479
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,350
My Lady,

480
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,310
the person you saved is the
Grand Princess—

481
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,070
His Majesty's own aunt!

482
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,480
I only thought she looked wealthy.

483
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,790
I had no idea

484
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,420
her status was so exalted.

485
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,450
Well then, this means

486
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,710
we might finally return to the
capital soon.

487
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,710
Then hurry and change your clothes!

488
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,520
No, I won't.

489
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,650
I'll go dressed just like this.

490
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,390
I want Princess Yongning to see exactly

491
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,740
how I've been living

492
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,330
in the Qin family.

493
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,800
Greetings, Grandma.

494
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,130
She dresses so plainly.

495
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,990
What a disgrace to the Qin family.

496
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,400
Wan, why are you so late?

497
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,830
Hurry and pay your respects
to Princess Yongning.

498
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,730
No need for formalities.

499
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,690
Miss Qin, do you remember her?

500
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,270
It's you?

501
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,470
How is your family's madam?

502
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,400
Thanks to your timely treatment,

503
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,010
Grand Princess is feeling much better.

504
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,740
I've come on her behalf to
express our gratitude.

505
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,090
What does she know about medicine?

506
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,070
It was pure luck, nothing more.

507
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,170
Wan,

508
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
you never mentioned

509
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,520
what happened that day after you returned.

510
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,330
See?

511
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,150
Miss Lvxiu has been looking
all over for you.

512
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,030
As long as the right person
was found, it's fine.

513
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,690
Miss Qin, come with me.

514
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,400
My grandma is still waiting
for your follow-up consultation.

515
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Since the Princess has come
to invite you personally,

516
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,100
you must serve the Grand Princess well.

517
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,850
Don't be reckless and cause trouble.

518
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,220
Your Ladyship,

519
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,960
may I also go and pay my
respects to the Grand Princess?

520
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,140
What are you going there for?

521
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,570
My grandma doesn't even know you.

522
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,250
I...

523
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,610
Miss Qin, please.

524
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,920
Mother.

525
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,370
Alright, alright.

526
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,310
Your Ladyship, what are you looking at?

527
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,310
You're so young.

528
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,510
I've never seen such a
youthful divine physician.

529
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,050
Skill in medicine lies in talent
and experience,

530
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,440
not age.

531
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,920
Moreover,

532
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,040
I grew up in Medicine King Valley,

533
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,370
and trained in both medicine
and alchemy from childhood.

534
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,850
Naturally, my understanding
is a little different.

535
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,810
So

536
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,360
you're a medical talent?

537
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,720
Perfect!

538
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,460
I'm a martial arts talent!

539
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,140
My father said that

540
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,410
if I'd been born a boy,

541
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,360
I'd have outshone all my brothers.

542
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,970
My father often regrets that I
was born a girl.

543
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,970
Otherwise,

544
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,310
I would surely be a pillar of the state.

545
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,510
So it's a case of

546
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,340
talent recognizing talent.

547
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,670
I've finally met a kindred spirit.

548
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,390
You haven't paid yet.

549
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,520
Officer!

550
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,150
-You can't take it!
-Go away!

551
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,030
How can this soldier bully
people like this?

552
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,830
Officer!

553
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,830
There are elderly at home
waiting for money to buy medicine.

554
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,880
Officer!

555
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,860
What's wrong with me taking
a few of your chickens?

556
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,480
You just look like you need a beating.

557
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,080
Get away!

558
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,480
Let go! You...

559
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,440
Officer!

560
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,140
Your Ladyship, come down quickly!

561
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,450
The Shuoxi Army has arrived.

562
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,610
These soldiers

563
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,240
look battle-hardened.

564
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,150
Their fierce aura

565
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,990
sets them apart from the
provincial troops.

566
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,320
They serve under the Black
Armor Guards,
Young Marshal of Shuoxi Army.

567
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,350
The Young Marshal has
fought bloodily across Shuoxi.

568
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,850
His name strikes fear in enemy ranks,

569
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,650
and his forces are unstoppable.

570
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,030
Stop!

571
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,330
Who are you?

572
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,500
According to Shuoxi military law,

573
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,590
anyone who oppresses the people

574
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,500
shall be executed on the spot.

575
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,960
Anyone caught stealing for personal gain

576
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,900
shall be executed on the spot.

577
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,250
Executed?

578
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,790
What do your Shuoxi military laws

579
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,070
have to do with us Jingzhou soldiers?

580
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,640
Anyone who defies our superiors

581
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,770
and disobeys orders

582
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,260
shall be executed!

583
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,150
How dare you!

584
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,840
He deserves it for bullying civilians.

585
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,640
Send his body to the garrison commander,

586
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,910
and tell him

587
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,660
if he can't control his troops,

588
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,470
I, Yan Chi, will take over for him.

589
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,270
Yes!

590
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,260
Officer.

591
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,790
Thank you, Officer.

592
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,070
That's the Young Marshal of Shuoxi Army,

593
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,110
my cousin,

594
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,630
the legendary God of War, Yan Chi!

595
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,160
He joined the army at 10,

596
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,990
and by 15, he was earning
top honors every year.

597
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,520
Pretty impressive, right?

598
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,390
Indeed.

599
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,110
Thank you, Officer.

600
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,240
Thank you, Officer.

601
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,490
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

602
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,950
[Grand Princess]

603
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,390
Madam.

604
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,140
The Crown Prince has returned!

605
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,100
Great Aunt,

606
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,370
I've come to pay my respects.

607
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,630
You old rascal! Still as playful
as ever at your age?

608
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,510
Come here.

609
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,160
The Shuoxi Army has
heavy duties at the border.

610
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,710
How could your father

611
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,000
possibly let you wander off?

612
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,790
Guess, Great Aunt.

613
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,450
You snuck out on your own,

614
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,140
didn't you?

615
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,360
I can never hide anything from you.

616
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,880
I had some disagreements with my father

617
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,610
over military affairs.

618
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,600
I ran back in a fit of anger.

619
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,900
Did he strike you again?

620
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,390
Why can't he ever

621
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,000
grasp a father's kindness?

622
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,350
I'm used to it.

623
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,290
It's only because your mother
passed too soon,

624
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,880
and you're his only son left

625
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,620
to keep him company.

626
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,780
Just cut him some slack.

627
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,780
He's been lonely most of his life.

628
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,510
He doesn't need me to back down.

629
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,060
In his heart,

630
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,210
I'm probably not even half as important

631
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,650
as the Shuoxi Army.

632
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,940
Chi.

633
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,370
It's been years.

634
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,140
You're looking more impressive than ever.

635
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,300
You were so decisive

636
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,640
and commanding
in the marketplace.

637
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,290
Grandma.

638
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,850
Gap Tooth has grown so tall.

639
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,070
Let me check if your teeth are all in.

640
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,600
Don't call me Gap Tooth.

641
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,860
My teeth have all grown in
for a long time!

642
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,050
Come.

643
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,100
Chi, why are you distracted?

644
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,590
Are you looking down on me?

645
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,370
This lady looks familiar to me.

646
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,250
This is Miss Qin of the Qin family.

647
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,380
How do you know her?

648
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,050
I, Qin Wan, pay my respects
to the Grand Princess.

649
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,810
So you're Miss Qin of the Qin family?

650
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,920
Come here.

651
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,420
Little Medical Fairy,

652
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,480
stay away from those two.

653
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,310
Don't let them hurt you.

654
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,450
A few days ago on the street,

655
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,000
I had a relapse of my old ailment.

656
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,040
Luckily, you treated me.

657
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,820
Otherwise, Chi

658
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,490
wouldn't have been able to
see his great aunt.

659
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,550
You saved someone on the street.

660
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,740
Miss Qin, may I ask

661
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,690
where you learned your skills?

662
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,330
I grew up in the Medicine King Valley;

663
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,800
all the doctors and patients there
are my teachers.

664
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,260
So that's why Great Aunt
calls you the "Little Medical Fairy?"

665
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,470
Chi,

666
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,530
how long will you stay

667
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,490
in Jingzhou this time?

668
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,830
Don't worry, Great Aunt.

669
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,030
I definitely want to celebrate

670
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,960
my cousin Jia's wedding properly.

671
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,290
That's more like it.

672
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,820
By the way, Little Medical Fairy,

673
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,380
you must come to

674
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,020
my eldest grandson's wedding.

675
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,420
I'll send you an invitation.

676
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,950
Thank you, Grand Princess.

677
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,880
However,

678
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,750
it hasn't been three years
since my father's funeral.

679
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,040
We're a family of generals.

680
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,230
We don't fuss over such things.

681
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,160
Just consider it

682
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,730
as you coming to keep me
company and have a chat.

683
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,640
We'll close the door

684
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,360
and have our own little feast.

685
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,610
Alright, I'll do as you say.

686
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,980
But today, you must listen to me as well.

687
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,080
It's getting late.

688
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,680
I should take your pulse
and apply some acupuncture.

689
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,210
Alright.

690
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,780
Then I'll go out and practice with Chi.

691
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,700
I still need to keep Great Aunt company.

692
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,720
No distractions allowed

693
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,410
during treatment.

694
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,380
Did you hear that? Let's go.

695
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,970
[Grace and Purity]

696
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,160
My Lady!

697
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,080
My Lady, look,

698
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,450
I got new clothes!

699
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,070
This is great.

700
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,880
No more patchwork for me!

701
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,970
This house is huge!

702
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,100
My Lady, why aren't you happy?

703
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,830
Tinglan Garden is the best
courtyard in the Qin Mansion.

704
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,240
Now it's ours.

705
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,600
It feels like a dream!

706
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,870
These were never mine to begin with.

707
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,600
What's there to be happy about?

708
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,110
Wan!

709
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,510
-Wan!
-Third Madam.

710
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,070
Miss Qin.

711
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,140
Wan, how is it?

712
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,780
Is this courtyard to your liking?

713
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,030
Thank you, Third Madam.

714
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,300
Call me Auntie.

715
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,750
Auntie.

716
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,770
Look at our Wan—

717
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,139
such a sweet voice,

718
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,770
that face, that figure—

719
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,630
truly the best in Jingzhou.

720
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,679
No wonder
the Grand Princess favors you so much.

721
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,330
I've been so busy

722
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,219
this past year,

723
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:45,010
so I've forgotten to bring you

724
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,440
these things I prepared.

725
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,670
Take a look; do you like them?

726
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,320
I don't need so many.

727
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,139
Keep them.

728
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,270
You can alternate between them.

729
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,070
When you're all dressed up tomorrow,

730
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,330
it'll make the Grand Princess happy too.

731
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,449
Thank you, Auntie.

732
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,949
We're family; no need to be so formal.

733
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,790
Alright.

734
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,000
I won't disturb your studies anymore.

735
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,320
Here.

736
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,360
All of you, follow me.

737
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,800
Put all these over there.

738
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:12,180
Put them all here.

739
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,850
Yes, yes, quickly put them there.

740
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,630
Such a good girl.

741
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,470
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

742
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

743
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,210
Greetings, Great Aunt.

744
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,050
Greetings, Your Highness.

745
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,880
Chi,

746
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,550
what are you doing here

747
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,080
instead of sitting in the front hall?

748
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,750
Look,

749
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,340
you're making Wan nervous.

750
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,140
Miss Qin, this is our first meeting,

751
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,960
but why does it

752
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,030
seem like you're a bit

753
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:01,950
wary of me?

754
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,730
Your Highness, just a few days ago

755
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,670
I saw you display great martial skill

756
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,880
and strict discipline.

757
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,480
Naturally, I hold you in awe.

758
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,860
The fierceness of the Shuoxi Army

759
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,510
is reserved for the enemy.

760
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,410
We never harm the innocent.

761
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,260
Thanks to the Shuoxi Army for

762
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,320
defending the nation and
bringing peace to countless families.

763
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,450
Alright, alright.

764
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,370
You.

765
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,920
You go sit in the front courtyard, okay?

766
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,070
The two of you being all
polite back and forth

767
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,950
is exhausting.

768
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,770
The bridal procession hasn't arrived yet.

769
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,900
Let me keep you company a while longer.

770
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,080
How come it's still not here?

771
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,010
The auspicious time has passed, hasn't it?

772
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,410
I feel uneasy.

773
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,210
Go check outside again.

774
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,010
Go and check.

775
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,680
Yes, Great Aunt.

776
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,430
Wan,

777
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,600
come here.

778
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,460
Sit down.

779
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,230
You're such

780
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,610
a straightforward

781
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,260
girl,

782
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,950
so why do you overthink everything?

783
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,880
How did you figure that out?

784
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,880
Well, I've lived for so many years.

785
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,560
If I still couldn't read people,

786
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,690
all those years would've been wasted.

787
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,310
Actually,

788
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,710
I've already found out

789
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,650
all about the kind of life
you’ve been living

790
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,810
in the Qin family by the time
I came looking for you.

791
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,810
No wonder

792
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,100
you're so cautious, afraid to
make even the slightest misstep.

793
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,030
Luckily, fate brought us together.

794
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,490
From now on,

795
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,670
I'll try my best

796
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,860
to protect you,

797
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,110
so you'll never...

798
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,800
Look,

799
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,690
you're making yourself look
like a little old lady.

800
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,210
Be happy.

801
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,110
Smile.

802
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,040
Thank you, Grand Princess.

803
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,750
Hearing your words,

804
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,740
all the grievances in my heart

805
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,290
have completely vanished.

806
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,740
Marquis of Anyang's Mansion

807
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,010
Father,

808
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,020
[Yue Jia, Marquis of Anyang's Heir]

809
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,180
I was sent to escort the bride

810
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,040
and have safely brought her back.

811
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,910
I, Wei Yanzhi,

812
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,180
under orders from the Duke of Song,

813
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,140
[Wei Yanzhi]

814
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,000
have delivered the bride without incident.

815
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,480
Yanzhi, you've endured a long journey.

816
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,670
Thank you for your efforts.

817
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,400
Jia,

818
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,210
you've worked hard too.

819
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,380
The bride has arrived, and
the auspicious hour is here.

820
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,700
Young Master, please kick the sedan door.

821
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,560
Madam, please step down from the sedan.

822
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,390
Young Master, please kick the
sedan door again.

823
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,640
May the Master fear no domestic strife,

824
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,170
nor the Madam feign meekness.

825
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,160
May you love each other until old age.

826
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,050
Madam, please step down from the sedan.

827
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,160
The auspicious time has arrived.

828
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,430
Young Master, lift the bridal veil.
