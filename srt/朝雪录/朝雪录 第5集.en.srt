[Coroner's Diary]

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,940
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,680
Fuling,

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,840
get me some alum,

5
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,960
clear water,

6
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
and filter cloth.

7
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,950
Your Highness.

8
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,150
Your Highness.

9
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,580
Excuse me, Miss Qin.

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,700
Someone robbed

11
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,170
my coroner's kit just now.

12
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,480
I ran after him for a while,
but still lost him.

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,350
I was thinking about

14
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,680
turning to constables.

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,500
Then I found the coroner's kit
right in front of the office.

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,889
Missing any autopsy tools?

17
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,150
That's the weird part.

18
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,640
I checked carefully.

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,730
Nothing was lost.

20
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,520
What's more, the tools
are in the exact same place

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,200
as before.

22
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,610
Open it and let's see.

23
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,930
[Postmortem Report]

24
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,620
Anything wrong?

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,079
Jinyu Bone-setting Ointment,

26
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,760
a precious and priceless medicine

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,790
to heal bones and tendons,

28
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,190
only sold in the capital.

29
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,930
And you even know the medicine
only sold in the capital?

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,410
I'm a physician

31
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,780
curious about special medicines.

32
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,570
In this case,

33
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,940
the thief not only has a bone injury

34
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,030
but also comes from a rich family.

35
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,820
Is it a strong smell?

36
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,640
Yes.

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,120
This person probably has nothing to do
with the wedding procession.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,170
He didn't know
the previous autopsy results,

39
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,360
so he held and checked
the report for quite a while,

40
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,290
leaving the smell of the ointment.

41
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,190
Your Highness, you can smell it.

42
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,850
I didn't see anything.

43
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,920
I swear I didn't.

44
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,470
Stand straight and speak.

45
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,980
News from the capital.

46
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,460
Wei Qizhi, the Wei family's eldest
legitimate young master,

47
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,640
wasn't injured taming a horse,

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,040
but got his right leg
broken by Duke of Song

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
and was locked up at home.

50
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,450
So his half-brother, Wei Yanzhi,
sent the bride off instead of him.

51
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,760
The day after the wedding procession

52
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,320
left the capital,
Wei Qizhi escaped and has been

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,450
missing since then.

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,350
That day, the man who pushed the tower

55
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,950
and hurt me seemed crippled.

56
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,570
Would Duke of Song
badly injure the Wei family's

57
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,030
legitimate young master?

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,660
Unless Wei Qizhi
made a horrendous mistake.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
If he was Song Rou's lover...

60
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,160
Song Rou would marry another nobleman.

61
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,130
Love turned into hatred; he killed her

62
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,350
out of wrath. That makes sense.

63
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,250
But who was the one
playing ghost to scare me?

64
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,580
Wei Qizhi couldn't be
so light on his feet.

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,820
His leg injury may not be real.

66
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,990
Only by finding him

67
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,590
can we figure out the truth.

68
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,920
You can examine it here.

69
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,450
I'll have Bai Feng protect you.

70
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,840
I'm going to meet Wei Yanzhi

71
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,240
and see what he has to say.

72
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,970
Duke of Song not only

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,330
failed to discipline his daughter

74
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
but also asked his nephew

75
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,480
to destroy the body and evidence

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,810
to deceive His Majesty.

77
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,450
Your actions

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,520
have shown a complete disregard
for my Yue family,

79
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,050
for His Majesty,

80
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,610
and for the national law!

81
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,500
Please calm down, Your Grace.

82
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,720
I simply couldn't

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,160
bear to see Rou be accused

84
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,890
of infidelity after her death.

85
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,890
So I ordered Wei Cheng to burn the body

86
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,490
in case the postmortem report
to the Ministry of Justice

87
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,760
would make both our families
a laughing stock in the capital.

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,490
I

89
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,610
will take all the blame.

90
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,590
Please spare the others
in the wedding procession.

91
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,640
I made the decision to burn the body.

92
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,570
It has nothing to do
with Vice Commandant Wei.

93
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,250
Wei Cheng!

94
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,300
Song Rou's death

95
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,040
is closely related to the person
whom she had an affair with.

96
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,400
You were in such a hurry
to destroy the evidence.

97
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,490
Was it to cover up your family's stigma

98
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,370
or to protect the adulterer?

99
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,610
I just...

100
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,080
Please stop covering
for the Eldest Young Master, my lord.

101
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,940
Your Highness,

102
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,670
Your Grace,

103
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,130
the person who had an affair
with Lady Song Rou

104
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,659
is our Eldest Young Master,

105
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,550
Wei Qizhi.

106
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,280
Is there any solid evidence?

107
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,200
The Eldest Young Master
admitted it himself.

108
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,080
Madam found that Lady Song was pregnant,

109
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,850
so Lady Song

110
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,570
had no choice but to confess her affair
with the Eldest Young Master.

111
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,690
Duke of Song

112
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,250
was so furious that he broke
Young Master Qizhi's leg.

113
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,400
Regardless of your motives,

114
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,530
you committed a severe crime of arson.

115
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,960
You're under arrest.

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,560
Take him away.

117
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,200
Go.

118
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,280
Vice Commandant Wei,

119
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,080
did Wei Cheng

120
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,159
tell the truth?

121
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,159
My brother

122
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,710
had been on good terms
with Rou since childhood.

123
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,320
So I didn't overthink it.

124
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,159
Not until Duke of Song asked me
to send Rou off instead of my brother

125
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,159
did I find out that

126
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,250
he and Rou

127
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,400
had made a terrible mistake.

128
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,570
You and Wei Qizhi lived
under the same roof.

129
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,370
How come

130
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,630
you don't know his whereabouts?

131
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,810
Two years ago,

132
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,130
I rode on Duke of Song's coat-tails
and joined the Patrol Battalion.

133
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,990
My brother had a big fight with me,

134
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,250
and he's refused to talk to me since then.

135
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,800
So I really have no idea.

136
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,050
Why did you have a big fight?

137
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,840
Because

138
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,470
my father's legitimate wife
wanted my brother to marry Rou.

139
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,250
But given the Wei family's
average background,

140
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,110
Duke of Song didn't approve of it.

141
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,860
My brother's pride resulted in

142
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,330
the growing distance

143
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,290
between him and the Duke of Song.

144
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,760
He didn't want me to accept
the Duke's help, I guess.

145
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,220
Is Wei Qizhi left-handed?

146
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,159
Yes,

147
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,370
he is.

148
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,180
It's said that
being born left-handed is a jinx.

149
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,330
So his mother

150
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,730
forced him to use
his right hand since he was young.

151
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,580
Few people know about this.

152
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,659
Your Highness, I lied to you

153
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,659
in order to protect my brother.

154
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,460
I

155
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,130
shouldn't have done this.

156
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,700
You...

157
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,890
You almost screwed things up!

158
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,470
I

159
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,740
have let you down, sirs.

160
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,170
Miss Song

161
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,610
passed away in Jingzhou.

162
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
Before we catch the murderer,

163
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,260
you'll be grounded

164
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,030
in the Eastern Courtyard.

165
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,840
We've finally got to the bottom of it.

166
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,380
We still need to verify the truth.

167
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,090
The priority now

168
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,490
is to find Song Rou's head

169
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,150
and the murder weapon.

170
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
Fuling, silver chopsticks.

171
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,630
My Lady,

172
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,140
the alum indeed removed all the residues.

173
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,650
It looks like some sort of

174
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,800
silk gauze.

175
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,440
Not gauze.

176
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,490
It's paper.

177
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,340
Wei Yanzhi confessed.

178
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,710
What did he say?

179
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,030
He turned in his brother,

180
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,730
Wei Qizhi,

181
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,490
who had long been in love with Song Rou.

182
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,090
And he was born left-handed.

183
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,680
Born left-handed?

184
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,280
Does he usually use his left hand?

185
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,210
Then many people should know that.

186
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,890
He was forced to use his right hand
since he was young.

187
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,020
So few people know it

188
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,150
other than those really close to him.

189
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,220
I found this paper scrap
from Song Rou's stomach.

190
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,970
Song Rou had been living
a luxurious life since birth.

191
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,610
Why would she swallow

192
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,670
such coarse paper?

193
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,410
How important
is the content written on it?

194
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,360
Maybe the key is not the content.

195
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,800
Sometimes, to protect

196
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,760
the source of information,
the spy in the army

197
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,130
will destroy
insignificant intelligence as well.

198
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,660
The source of information?

199
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,110
Different types of paper

200
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,910
can reveal the writers' habits.

201
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,820
Although the handwriting on this

202
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,800
has been dissolved by gastric fluid,

203
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,760
this paper appears unusually durable,

204
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,850
not something
ordinary people can purchase.

205
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,890
My Lady, is that sparkling thing

206
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,600
gold powder?

207
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,760
Not as bright as gold powder.

208
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,620
It's orpiment.

209
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,370
Orpiment is often used
to make golden lacquer.

210
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,010
Add raw golden lacquer
to wood pulp to produce

211
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,730
the dusted-gold paper,
also known as "mini scattered-gold paper."

212
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,400
I know that!

213
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,730
I know the dusted-gold paper.

214
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,850
This kind of paper gives off
a faint lacquer tree scent.

215
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,890
And it's cheaper
than scattered-gold paper.

216
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,760
Ordinary aristocrats who can't afford
scattered-gold paper

217
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
would write on dusted-gold paper instead.

218
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,490
According to the information
from the capital,

219
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,850
the Wei family
may be an average household,

220
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,850
but Wei Qizhi

221
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,730
is pretty pretentious and willful.

222
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,730
He likes playing the zither,

223
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,160
so he learnt
how to make the zither himself.

224
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,060
He likes horse riding,

225
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,520
so he tried to tame the horse on his own.

226
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,610
He likes porcelain.

227
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,640
So porcelain items
are everywhere in his house.

228
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,400
In this case,

229
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,670
this dusted-gold paper
suits his temperament.

230
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,280
Right now, this paper scrap

231
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,810
is the only evidence
related to the murderer.

232
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,820
The Wei brothers grew up together.

233
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,800
I want to meet Wei Yanzhi
for confirmation.

234
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,040
It's said that Wei Yanzhi fell ill

235
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,890
with a high fever after he went back.

236
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,620
The Yue family can't ignore it.

237
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,760
If you want to see him,

238
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,850
you'll have to spend

239
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,180
some time treating him.

240
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,750
Sir,

241
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,610
two buns, please.

242
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,150
Okay.

243
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,250
Two.

244
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Thief! Catch him!

245
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,430
Stop there! Catch the thief!

246
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,390
Catch the thief!

247
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,090
Where did he go?

248
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,560
Thief! Catch the thief!

249
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,120
You got this.

250
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,570
Okay.

251
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,660
Thief, you

252
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,330
wanted to steal the postmortem report?

253
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,660
Thanks to His Highness's brilliant idea,

254
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,020
we caught you, the key figure in the case.

255
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,030
Will you surrender yourself,

256
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
or do you want us to take you by force?

257
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,090
Young Master Qizhi,

258
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,680
I...

259
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,330
As if

260
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,680
I had a choice.

261
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,000
Come in, please.

262
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,040
You have a high fever.

263
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,610
There's no need for courtesy.

264
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,070
Thank you, Your Highness.

265
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,810
You're seriously ill,

266
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,890
but why did you open the window?

267
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,520
I wanted

268
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,690
to get some fresh air.

269
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,210
You are taking a turn for the worse.

270
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,670
Is the medicine not right?

271
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,050
Any prescriptions?

272
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,250
It's on the table.

273
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,490
Don't worry, Vice Commandant Wei.

274
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,890
Miss Qin is a miracle-working physician
who cured the Grand Princess.

275
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,950
She came all the way here to treat you.

276
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
I dare not trouble you, Miss Qin.

277
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,280
Don't worry, Vice Commandant Wei.

278
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,680
It's a physician's duty to treat patients.

279
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,950
Vice Commandant Wei,

280
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,430
please.

281
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,610
Have you taken a bath
with cold water recently?

282
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,760
I came back late

283
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,860
on the night of the Autumn Festival.

284
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,830
I had no time to wait for hot water,

285
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,520
so I used well water.

286
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,820
That prescription is correct.

287
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,890
It's just that your long, tiring journey

288
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,160
and constant worries

289
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,970
have taken a toll on your illness.

290
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:40,640
After all,

291
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,560
I've failed the Yue family

292
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,330
and Rou.

293
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,530
I can't feel at ease.

294
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,680
Is it the famous Chengying Sword?

295
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,380
Sharp eyes, Your Highness.

296
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,730
Can I take it off to have a closer look?

297
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,400
Hold on.

298
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,640
This sword

299
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,610
was given by Duke of Song.

300
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,450
It's as important as my life.

301
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,250
I never dare to play with it.

302
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,660
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

303
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,730
A man of taste appreciates swords.

304
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,040
I won't blame you for it.

305
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,520
Thank you for your magnanimity,
Your Highness.

306
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,180
You're indeed our role model.

307
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,890
Vice Commandant Wei,

308
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,490
you can change it to a charcoal basin
to warm the room up.

309
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,800
The high stove is producing

310
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,890
excessive scorching heat,

311
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,490
not good for your recovery.

312
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,020
I always feel freezing cold

313
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,490
at night.

314
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,210
I will just

315
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,910
reduce charcoal during the day.

316
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,300
That works too.

317
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,850
You don't need to change the prescription.

318
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,050
A few days of rest will help you recover.

319
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,010
Thank you, Miss Qin.

320
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

321
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,890
Get some rest, Vice Commandant Wei.

322
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,560
Take care.

323
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,160
Wei Yanzhi had a stove
burning in his room,

324
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,250
but the window was open

325
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,640
with super strong incense.

326
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,810
There must be something off.

327
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,130
Chengying Sword is famous and priceless.

328
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,560
Why would Duke of Song
highly value his nephew

329
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,690
born of a concubine?

330
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,610
The burning ashes
in the mansion are all here.

331
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,860
It's not winter yet. Only a few

332
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,190
people are burning charcoal.

333
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,720
So they are
basically from Wei Yanzhi's room.

334
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,990
Little Wan'er,

335
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,680
what are you and Chi looking for?

336
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,250
It's so dirty.

337
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,560
Let the servants do it.

338
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,890
They can't understand.

339
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,550
Do you have to search them all?

340
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,090
Master,

341
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,590
Wei Qizhi has been arrested
and imprisoned.

342
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,090
Did he confess his crime?

343
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,740
Not yet.

344
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,560
But Prefect Huo has tortured him.

345
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,130
Ning, keep a close eye on these ashes.

346
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,760
Let no one touch them.

347
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,040
Okay.

348
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,090
Let's go to the prefect's office.

349
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,680
Let's go.

350
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,050
Your Highness,

351
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:10,940
Miss Qin.

352
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,640
Wei Qizhi only confessed that

353
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,060
he sent the servant, Wu Shu,
to steal the postmortem report.

354
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,130
He refused to admit anything else.

355
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,599
They are really stubborn.

356
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,770
Even torture couldn't make them
spit out the truth.

357
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,609
Without evidence,

358
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,369
how could you torture them, Prefect Huo?

359
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,970
Besides, I haven't checked
his leg injury yet.

360
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,720
Where is he?

361
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,960
Your Highness,
the prison is foul and filthy.

362
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,920
Please...

363
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,320
I'll punish you for the arbitrary torture.

364
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,910
Prefect Huo, I'm impressed by your way

365
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,170
of interrogation and torture.

366
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,640
Were you trying to force him
to confess by torture?

367
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,370
He said his leg had been broken.

368
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,800
Of course, we should

369
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,000
go for the fatal spot.

370
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,160
So I hit his injured part.

371
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,290
But he

372
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,960
refused to confess.

373
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,130
You broke his injured leg again.

374
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,880
Now we can't tell

375
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,610
whether he was limping before.

376
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,440
Besides, the leg injury is hard to heal.

377
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,850
If he is disabled because of this

378
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,380
and proven innocent later,

379
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,380
how can you make it up to him?

380
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,480
If he had no evil intentions,

381
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,570
why would he
follow Song Rou all the way to Jingzhou?

382
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,370
On the wedding day,

383
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,640
he lingered at the Shili Temple.

384
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,090
He stayed there one more day

385
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,400
definitely to remove the traces of murder.

386
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,570
Sir, I'm innocent!

387
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,290
Sir!

388
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:23,480
Sir!

389
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,050
Take him away.

390
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:24,850
Let him speak.

391
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Sir, my Young Master

392
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,570
was afraid that Miss Song's secret
would be exposed,

393
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,920
causing her to be abused
by the Yue family,

394
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,640
so he came here despite his injured leg.

395
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,570
When we arrived in Jingzhou,

396
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,400
we heard about Miss Song's death.

397
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,090
So he ordered me to steal
the postmortem report

398
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,000
to figure out

399
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,210
how exactly Miss Song died.

400
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,240
My Young Master and Miss Song
didn't have an affair!

401
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,810
In no case would he murder her!

402
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,570
Sirs! We're innocent!

403
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,960
Stop talking nonsense!

404
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,160
Wei Qizhi admitted that
he had an affair with Song Rou.

405
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,850
Young Master Qizhi cherished Miss Song
as his own sister.

406
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,240
There's no way they had an affair!

407
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,680
No way he killed her!

408
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,880
Does Wei Qizhi write with his left hand?

409
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,890
Yes, so what?

410
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,440
Many people can write
with their left hands,

411
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,960
like our Second Young Master!

412
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,920
Why can Wei Yanzhi
use his left hand to write?

413
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,610
Young Master Qizhi was plagued by rashes
when he was little.

414
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,440
Madam Wei was worried that
being left-handed jinxed it.

415
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,610
So she forced him
to write with his right hand.

416
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,000
But he was so stubborn

417
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,110
that he refused to change.

418
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,530
To prevent Master Wei from favoring
the concubine's son because of it,

419
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,960
she forced Second Young Master to write

420
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,200
with his left hand to destroy him.

421
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,680
But Young Master Qizhi didn't want

422
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,890
Young Master Yanzhi to be implicated,

423
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,330
so he changed to use his right hand.

424
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,590
So Second Young Master

425
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,130
ended up with better left-handed writing

426
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,680
than Young Master Qizhi.

427
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,980
Since when did Wei Qizhi
start to use porcelain only?

428
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,360
It's not that Young Master Qizhi
likes porcelain items only.

429
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,610
He's just disliked the scent of lacquer
since childhood.

430
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,720
Other types of utensils

431
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,200
almost all contain lacquer more or less.

432
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,330
So he uses white-porcelain items
for convenience.

433
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,660
I swear with my life that

434
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,980
Young Master Qizhi

435
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,810
is innocent!

436
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,920
Prefect Huo,

437
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,520
please get a physician
for Wei Qizhi right now.

438
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,610
I'll be on my way.

439
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,880
I didn't kill Rou.

440
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,130
It wasn't me.

441
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,810
I didn't kill her.

442
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,330
I didn't.

443
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,170
Stop searching.

444
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,810
I can arrest him first

445
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,640
and interrogate him in turn.

446
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,000
When he's exhausted,

447
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,920
I'm sure he'll give himself away.

448
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,580
But we need sufficient evidence
to convict him.

449
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,850
The testimony can only serve as one of it.

450
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,310
It's not enough to confirm

451
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,980
that person as the murderer.

452
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,920
But this slow investigation might

453
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,440
give the real murderer a chance to escape.

454
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Then our efforts will all be in vain.

455
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,480
It's easy for you
to convict someone, Your Highness,

456
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,770
but a wrong conviction
will ruin a man's entire life.

457
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,330
Don't let impatience

458
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,130
wreck the fairness of the laws.

459
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,770
Is this also the saying

460
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,700
of Minister Shen Yi who you admire?

461
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,730
Yes.

462
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,650
Thank you for your guidance.

463
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,200
Miss Qin, please continue
to gather the evidence.

464
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,850
Leave the arrest work to me.

465
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,550
Thank you, Your Highness.

466
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,650
But I want to ask you for one more favor.

467
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,500
[Jingzhou Prefecture Office]

468
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,770
Wei Qizhi,

469
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,280
since your leg is badly injured,

470
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,000
you can sit down and talk.

471
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,470
Thank you for your kindness, sir.

472
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,090
I can stand.

473
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,680
Wei Qizhi,

474
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,200
tell me

475
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
how you

476
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
got your leg hurt.

477
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,350
Two months ago, in the capital,

478
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,930
Duke of Song broke my leg.

479
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,890
And yesterday, you...

480
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,990
That's enough.

481
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm asking you why Duke of Song

482
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,340
beat you so hard that time.

483
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,290
Because I admitted

484
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,210
my affair

485
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,130
with Miss Song.

486
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,290
So is it true that
you had an affair with her?

487
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,240
No.

488
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,240
Then why did you admit it?

489
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:24,750
Out with it!

490
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,290
Rou's reputation outweighed my life.

491
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
She said it was me.

492
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,250
Then I'd admit it.

493
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,740
Wei Qizhi,

494
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,570
it's very likely that

495
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,530
Song Rou was killed by the one she loved.

496
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,620
Can you really bear

497
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
to see the murderer get away with it?

498
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,000
That day, Rou came to me, crying

499
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,640
and saying that
she had an affair with someone.

500
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,240
After Duke of Song found out,

501
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
she blurted out my name out of panic.

502
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,850
Rou, tell me.

503
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,440
I asked her who that man was,

504
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,290
but she cried without saying anything.

505
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,230
In the end,

506
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,000
she even forced me to claim
to be her lover by hurting herself.

507
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,960
Who on earth is he?

508
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,810
I can't say it!

509
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,010
If others find out,

510
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,490
his future will be ruined.

511
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,320
I really love him.

512
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,300
A few days later,

513
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,440
Duke of Song showed up with his men,

514
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,440
breaking my leg
without giving me a chance to explain.

515
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,240
In view of my previous grudge
against Duke of Song

516
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,840
and my promise to Rou
to pretend to be her lover,

517
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,310
I admitted it out of anger.

518
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,930
Later, I was recuperating at home.

519
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,620
Yanzhi said that
Duke of Song didn't punish Rou.

520
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,340
So I didn't rush to ask her
for the whole story.

521
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,310
Until she left the capital for marriage,

522
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,990
the person she was protecting
still hadn't shown up.

523
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,100
What a coward.

524
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:47,840
How is it?

525
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,670
Young Master,

526
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,990
Miss Song was murdered.

527
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,980
She even got beheaded.

528
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,440
I was afraid that person would betray her.

529
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,950
If the Yue family finds out

530
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,130
about her infidelity,

531
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,930
she wouldn't be able to survive.

532
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,240
So I followed her here secretly

533
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,810
to confirm her safety.

534
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,850
I didn't expect to hear this bad news.

535
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,720
What the hell are you doing?

536
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,290
Guards!

537
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,200
Hold him down.

538
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,240
Wei Qizhi suffers from a rare disease.

539
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,780
His contact with the lacquerware
will lead to rashes.

540
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,090
At worst,
wind evil can infiltrate his organs,

541
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,090
knocking him out.

542
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,960
So it's rumored in the capital that
he only uses white-porcelain items.

543
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,890
That's the reason.

544
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,890
Judging from his symptoms just now,

545
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,530
he'd never use the dusted-gold paper

546
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,240
that contains golden lacquer.

547
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,640
Yes.

548
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,090
So the victim swallowed
the dusted-gold paper

549
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,290
to protect someone else instead of him.

550
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,530
So,

551
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,000
he's not Miss Song's lover?

552
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,000
Yes.

553
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,950
Now I know who the murderer is.

554
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,290
Bet you do too, Miss Qin.

555
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,480
Your Highness, just do it.

556
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,360
I will get the real culprit

557
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,220
with solid evidence.

558
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,400
Vice Commandant Wei,

559
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,580
where are you going in such a hurry?

560
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,100
Take it out and get what's inside.

561
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,610
Yes.

562
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,810
Your eldest brother has been arrested.

563
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,090
If you are innocent,

564
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,530
why are you trying to run away?

565
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,730
I'm not running away.

566
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,000
I just want to go back to the capital
and report this to the elders.

567
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,640
What?

568
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,730
Are you going to lock me up
in this mansion forever?

569
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Still can't let me touch it?

570
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,610
A man of dignity can be killed,
but not humiliated.

571
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,160
Chengying means a lot to me.

572
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,640
No one can touch it.

573
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,690
Did you hear that, Prefect Huo?

574
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,090
Vice Commandant Wei said it himself that

575
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,290
even I

576
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,400
couldn't touch his Chengying Sword.

577
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,160
Yes, I heard it clearly.

578
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,530
Good.

579
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,050
Bring it in!

580
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,920
Wei Yanzhi,

581
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,570
do you know what this is?

582
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,480
This is the glue left by the burnt fat.

583
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,370
Although you broke the skull,

584
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,300
lit the incense,

585
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,810
and opened the window to ventilate,

586
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,740
you forgot to clean the iron tongs.

587
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,700
Silver-frost charcoal
wouldn't leave such a stain.

588
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,050
Take the evidence away.

589
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,690
Yes.

590
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,720
Found it, Your Highness.

591
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,670
Give it to Miss Qin.

592
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,420
He really killed Miss Song.

593
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,000
According to the traces on the skull,

594
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,720
the murderer must have stabbed the sword

595
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,680
directly into the victim's occipital bone
from behind

596
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,020
and cut off her head
to hide the sword mark.

597
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,770
Wei Yanzhi,

598
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,990
the evidence is irrefutable.

599
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,890
Do you have anything else to say?

600
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,850
The murderer dipped the victim's blood,

601
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,440
disguised the wedding sedan
as the crime scene,

602
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,850
dressed the victim up in the wedding gown,

603
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,180
and put her in the sedan.

604
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,390
To stop Miss Qin from examining the body,

605
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,330
you played the headless female corpse
to scare her.

606
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,480
You also tried to use
the ink on the wedding gown

607
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,010
to frame your legitimate brother,
Wei Qizhi.

608
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,660
To pin the crime on Wei Qizhi

609
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,590
and get rid of me, the examiner,

610
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,770
you sent your loyal Captain of the Guard,
Wei Cheng,

611
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,170
to impersonate Wei Qizhi

612
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,530
and assassinate me at the lantern fair.

613
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,160
When you found that
the assassination failed,

614
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,960
and the autopsy was inevitable,

615
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,240
you ordered Wei Cheng
to burn the morgue overnight

616
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,480
and attempted to destroy
the evidence once again.

617
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,810
Also, you heated up the stove

618
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,370
to burn the victim's head.

619
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:55,900
Now,

620
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,860
we have the witness and evidence.

621
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,050
You murdered the victim,

622
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,610
Wei Yanzhi.

623
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
How ruthless and insane.

624
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,840
We've got solid evidence.

625
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,370
What else do you have to say?

626
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,290
Me? Ruthless and insane?

627
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,720
That woman

628
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,130
was insane!

629
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,720
She had such a great marriage

630
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,450
with a member of the Yue family,

631
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,770
but why did she pester me

632
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,500
and force me to elope with her?

633
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,460
Why?

634
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,950
My elder brother
is the legitimate young master!

635
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,500
They broke his leg like it was nothing.

636
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,170
What if it were me?

637
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,100
I would have been dead, I guess.

638
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,480
Sha had no idea

639
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,800
about the consequences
of going against the Duke!

640
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,000
Yanzhi.

641
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,700
You're finally here
to take me away with you.

642
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,890
Why did you come out
in your wedding dress?

643
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,290
If someone witnesses it,

644
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,120
you and I will be done for.

645
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,130
I was anxious to meet you.

646
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,690
Don't worry.

647
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,400
I've sent the Nanny away.

648
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
She won't notice.

649
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,580
Do you have my letter

650
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,160
with you?

651
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,610
I was afraid that the Nanny might see it,

652
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,140
so I swallowed it secretly.

653
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,440
Oh, dear...

654
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,530
Why?

655
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,020
It must've been a pain
to swallow the dusted-gold paper.

656
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:29,860
For you,

657
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,550
I'm not afraid of any pain.

658
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,580
Yanzhi,

659
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,290
take me away tonight.

660
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,960
I'd rather die

661
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,130
than let other men touch me.

662
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,050
I won't marry

663
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,810
anyone other than you in my life.

664
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,850
Can we

665
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,640
be together forever?

666
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,500
Don't think like that.

667
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,530
I'll feel bad.

668
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,090
Let's leave tonight.

669
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,260
We'll go far, far away.

670
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,460
Our destination is

671
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,100
wherever you want to go.

672
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,770
If you say yes,

673
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,640
I'll cherish you, love you,
and be with you

674
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,290
forever and ever.

675
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,620
Nothing will separate us.

676
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,200
There will be neither
the legitimate young lady of Song family

677
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,530
nor the young master's wife of Yue family.

678
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,720
I will only be Mrs. Wei, plainly dressed.

679
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,970
I would go anywhere with you

680
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,530
as a loving couple

681
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,530
forever.

682
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,680
But...

683
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,910
I don't want that.

684
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,370
She gave up
the wealthy and luxurious life for you,

685
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,770
yet you killed her
for your selfish desire.

686
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,400
How dare you say
she didn't care about your feelings?

687
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,890
As a concubine's son,
I've been through trials and tribulations,

688
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,220
including those caused

689
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,740
by my legitimate mother, to come this far.

690
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,850
Why should I give up my future and live

691
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,330
a low-profile life for her?

692
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,600
Why should I?

693
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,670
This foolish and hateful woman

694
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:27,040
tried to ruin my life with love.

695
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,120
She deserved to die.

696
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,310
The woman you said is called Song Rou.

697
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,920
The most foolish thing she did

698
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,040
was to use all her intelligence

699
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,290
to protect you!

700
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,650
If she didn't swallow
that paper

701
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,480
you used to lure her
into your deadly trap,

702
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,690
you'd have
been brought to justice long ago!

703
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,960
You cruelly hurt the woman
who loved you deeply.

704
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,280
You're the one who deserves to die!

705
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,250
So what?

706
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,790
As long as I don't love her,

707
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,690
even if she died
ten thousand times for me,

708
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,960
it'd only be a mistake.

709
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
A mistake!

710
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,040
If Miss Song knows

711
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,290
someone still cares about her,

712
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,810
she'll rest in peace.

713
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,690
Without you,

714
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,540
the person who cares about her
wouldn't have survived.

715
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,540
Xu He.

716
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,400
Since the case is closed,

717
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,120
now

718
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,650
let's repair Miss Song's body.

719
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,800
Miss Qin,

720
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,170
I don't understand.

721
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,600
The case is closed.

722
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,080
What's the point of repairing her body?

723
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,170
Normally, we'd return

724
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,850
the body to his or her family.

725
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,650
If no one takes the body,

726
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,690
we'd buy a coffin

727
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,520
and bury the body at the back mountain.

728
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,850
We had to choose the autopsy
to prove someone's innocence.

729
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,880
The victim's corpse

730
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,730
revealed the truth to us.

731
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,400
We should restore her dignity.

732
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,170
Miss Qin,

733
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,330
why did you start to call her

734
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,130
Miss Song again just now?

735
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,200
Because from today onwards,

736
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,840
I don't need to see her
as evidence anymore.

737
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,690
I can finally send Miss Song off

738
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,770
without feeling bad.

Thank you.

756
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,600
You have only half an hour.

757
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,400
Don't forget.

758
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,690
Yes.

759
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,300
What are you doing here?

760
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,210
To laugh at me for your mother?

761
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Yanzhi,

762
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,200
I just want to ask you.

763
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,000
Rou loved you deeply

764
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,510
and was pregnant with your child.

765
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Have you ever had
any real feelings for her?

766
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
You want to scold me for her?

767
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,330
Even now, you still feel no remorse?

768
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,370
Who are you to scold me?

769
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,690
Because I'm your elder brother!

770
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,660
I don't have an elder brother.

771
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,170
As the Wei family's
legitimate young master,

772
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,960
you were born with all the honor

773
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,350
and everyone's love.

774
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,520
What about me?

775
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,850
I'm just a concubine's lowly son

776
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,780
who couldn't even see
his own mother before she died.

777
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,900
Your mother made my mother
die a miserable death.

778
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,760
Do you think I don't remember?

779
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,060
All these years,

780
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,230
when your mother disciplined you,

781
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,920
I'd suffer double the punishment with you.

782
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,960
I couldn't join the Patrol Battalion

783
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,770
due to your dislike for Duke of Song.

784
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,170
I was the one
who liked learning the zither,

785
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,370
but your mother
only allowed you to learn it.

786
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,330
Were it not for this,

787
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,250
I wouldn't have
turned to Rou to learn the zither,

788
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,710
and things
wouldn't have ended up like this!

789
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,930
So you've been holding
deep grudges against me.

790
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,850
I'm sorry.

791
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,590
No more hypocritical look of grief.

792
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,810
After all these years
of the game of fake brotherhood,

793
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,480
I've had enough.

794
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,080
Now, leave.

795
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,090
No matter what you think,

796
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,170
I have never tried to hurt you.

797
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,770
After we part today,

798
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,250
I hope you can

799
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,490
find peace in your next life.

800
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,110
[Here rests Miss Song,
Duke of Song's legitimate daughter]

801
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,220
Poor Miss Song.

802
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,250
Were it not for Grand Princess
and Young Master Wei Qizhi,

803
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,380
she wouldn't have had a proper burial.

804
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,730
Young Master Wei Qizhi
insisted on burying her in Jingzhou.

805
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,420
Seems like

806
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,610
he's completely disappointed
in the Song family.

807
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,270
Maybe because he knows them too well,

808
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,000
he chose to do it this way.

809
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,800
Given Duke of Song's character,

810
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,350
he wouldn't let Miss Song

811
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,890
be buried in their family cemetery.

812
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,040
It'd be better to bury her here.

813
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,370
It's a beautiful place,

814
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,770
guaranteeing a peaceful next life.

815
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,020
Whenever I think about it,
I feel terrified.

816
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,400
A woman

817
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,580
got killed

818
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,370
due to her infatuation.

819
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,890
In order to protect
the family reputation, her father

820
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,820
just left her body alone like this!

821
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,850
She couldn't even return to her hometown.

822
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,080
Are these men

823
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,210
heartless?

824
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,760
It has nothing to do with gender.

825
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,210
Be it Duke of Song or Wei Yanzhi,

826
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,080
they are selfish people

827
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,770
who care about themselves only.

828
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,710
Seems like as women,

829
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,600
we'd better stay single
to protect ourselves.

830
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,710
Master, the case is closed.

831
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,520
Should we go back to the capital now?

832
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,120
Bai Feng,

833
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:10,100
I think I've made some progress

834
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,030
on the case we're investigating.

835
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,560
You mean new clues
about Prince Jin's case?

836
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,250
Nope.

837
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,040
