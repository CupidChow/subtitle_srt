Episode 2

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Get back to your state, Mai Dong comes back

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Mai Dong invites you to watch the snow road

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hurry up, get the car to An Yao's mansion

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Prince

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Prince, please tell me if Jiu sister is in the car

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Prince

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What do you want from me?

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Jiu sister, your sister-in-law just came back from the mansion

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
She just saw Hong

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The doctor said that the old man and the child are going to die

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Fuling, go prepare the medicine

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ok

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Princess, I will go to the Princess Royal's house again

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I know, I know, you go quickly

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Cut the medicine into pieces

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Three bowls of medicine, one bowl

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Divide into four parts

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Three parts a day, one part a night

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Two days in a row

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sister-in-law, you just finished the needle, you should sleep for a while

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sister Jiu

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sister Jiu

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How is it? Did the child survive?

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sister-in-law is fine, just need to take medicine

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If she sees Hong again, she still needs to continue the needle

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Great, great

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Look, what's wrong with this?

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you sister Jiu, thank you for coming and the child

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Brother, you don't have to do this

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's just that sister-in-law is already weak

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And pregnant for seven months

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I really shouldn't have come back to visit my family

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is all my fault

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Pregnant women tend to think too much

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Brother still needs to accompany and solve the problem

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
In case sister-in-law wants to solve it again

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ok

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The Crown Prince doesn't have to follow the internal house

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If it is spread out, I'm afraid it will damage the reputation of the young general

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Jiu Niangzi helped the Marquis of Anyang to make the case successful

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I just want to personally thank the old lady Qin

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm leaving

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The Crown Prince doesn't have to be so polite

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's just a matter of the people's duty

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I have one more thing

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sister Jiu

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Crown Prince

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Sister Jiu, today you saved the lives of Xinlan's mother and son

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is a little bit of our heart

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please be sure to take it

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If sister Jiu doesn't take it

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's because she doesn't like the gift we gave her

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you brother

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's good that you like it

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Your Highness, I'm leaving

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Madam

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This Lan Bao's head is made by Jinxiu's house

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Their family specializes in making this head

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's a little bit of a waste

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is made by Jinxiu's house

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Their family specializes in making this head

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If you buy it in time, you can't buy it

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I guess this is the head that brother originally wanted to make for sister-in-law

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mrs. Qin is the daughter of the magistrate of Jianzhou

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I heard that she was pregnant shortly after marriage

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Please be satisfied with this

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How could the Crown Prince know so much about the people of Qin?

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Because Jiu Niangzi

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In the future, the Marquis of Anyang will have a lot of fights with Qin

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I have to know more about Jiu Niangzi

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I wonder if my brother is satisfied with this marriage

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What does it have to do with the Marquis of Anyang?

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Mrs. Qin is seriously ill

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mr. Qin doesn't accompany Zuo You

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But he dares to give you such a generous gift in front of me

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm afraid that the feelings of the royal family and the state are more important to him than the safety of the young lady

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Brother is in the hope of the old lady and the third lady

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Such a situation is also for the future of the third room

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
A man who does not hesitate to wrong his wife and children for his own future

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How can this kind of family style be your duty?

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't know if Jiu Niangzi is willing to go back to the capital

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can help arrange

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The old man's father is also in the soil

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There are still many houses in the capital

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will go back sooner or later

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's great

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
In the future, if I have any requests

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I hope that Jiu Niangzi will help

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
As you wish

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The wound on the crown prince's body has not recovered yet

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Remember not to move with anyone

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Avoid the wound breaking

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If Jiu Niangzi has a free time

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Please cure the old wound I want

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Today I am leaving the capital

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You are going back to Shuoxi now?

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How many days?

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Three or five days

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I will go back to Shuoxi

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will go back to Shuoxi

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will go back to Shuoxi

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I will go back to Shuoxi

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How many days?

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Three or five days

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Six or seven days

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So fast

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's too late to try the medicine

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I will go to the pharmacy to get the medicine

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Thank you for the gift

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You and I don't have to be polite

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
In the future, you can call me Yan Chi

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I dare not to be rude

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I thought we have a lot of experience

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And we have a good understanding

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why are you so polite?

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I dare to talk to the crown prince about understanding

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Your Highness is a royal family

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can't be rude

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Master, we are going back to Shuoxi

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Really?

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Then why are you...

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why is the portrait of Shen Niangzi not sent yet?

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Shen Yi disappeared before he got out of the palace

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Shen Niangzi has been with him for a long time

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He has been in the capital for a long time

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He never attended poetry and flower meetings

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No one has ever seen his real face

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He is similar

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't care about the portrait

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Tell the Eagle Clan to search for his tracks

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Everything is ready

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Take the treasure

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,220
The

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Someone is here to watch the wine

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How do you know?

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is the sign of Mu Ji

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's the same as Mu Ji's long legs

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This person should be a man of 5 inches and 7 inches

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Look at the direction of Mu Ji

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That person was looking at the sky

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why is it so late?

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It rained yesterday

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you lost your time before this

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You wouldn't have been able to see Mu Ji

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The mud was already washed away by the rain

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Send the Eagle Cavalry to Jinzhou

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The Eagle Cavalry

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why are there so many herbs in the medicine room?

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The herbs in the house are managed by the old lady

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The expensive herbs are only used by the masters

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Go to the Eagle Cavalry

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Someone is dead

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Lady, don't go

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll go and see

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If you need anything, just call me

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll go with you

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What are you doing here? Hurry up and help

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hurry up and help

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Lady

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Turn around

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's too late

172
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The person has died

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Go and call someone

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Someone

175
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Someone fell into the water

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Help

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yuan Yi, how could it be her?

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You know her?

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
She is

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The second-class maid in the old lady's room

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Who are you?

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why are you here?

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I am

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Lady, I called someone

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Second-class maid

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Second-class maid

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Second-class maid

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Lady

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is your cousin

190
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The second-class maid in the third room

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The one who is not often at home

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Second brother

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Please forgive me

195
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Where?

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I dare not

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Second young master

198
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Lady

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Wait

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Wait for me to call the officer

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll deal with it after the feast

202
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Steward Liu

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Lian Yi

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Lian Yi

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Lady

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll deal with this

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Please go back

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Lady

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Please go back

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
When are you going to report to the officer?

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This Lian Yi is the second-class maid

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
in the old lady's room

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I have to ask the old lady

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
before I can do it

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Jiu Weiwei

217
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The old lady is in charge of the house

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Don't worry

219
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's raining so hard

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll send you back

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Lady

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you, steward Liu

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Lady

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Second brother, give me the medicine

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Second young master, are you tired?

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll wipe your sweat

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No, no, no

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Help

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Second brother, let me see

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let me see

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The eyebrow bed

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Please save me

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Please save me

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Second brother followed me

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
to let me treat you

236
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
How do you know I followed you?

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Please go back

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Jiu Weiwei

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I really didn't mean anything

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I've been around your yard for half a day

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I didn't dare to say anything

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Later, when I saw you go out

243
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I followed you

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No, no, no

245
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Jiu Weiwei

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I know I'm a loser

247
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't deserve your treatment

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I shouldn't have

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
hurt your eyes

250
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But I really can't help it

251
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If this news spreads

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'll be dead

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
for the rest of my life

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Please save me

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Please save me

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Give me your hand

257
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
How long has he been sick?

258
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Three, four days

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Who told you this?

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's the outside

261
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The outside

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Jiu Weiwei, don't ask

263
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm so confused

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't want to ruin your ears

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If I'm well

266
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll be in good health

267
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I won't go to those places

268
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You should know

269
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's very dangerous

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I can't guarantee it

271
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm very grateful

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I dare not ask for more

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't have the right medicine

274
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You can come back tomorrow

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Please tell me

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Jiu Weiwei

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You just tell me

279
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Where did you plant the purple bamboo?

280
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Behind the pool

281
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Jiu Weiwei, you forgot

282
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Jiu Weiwei

283
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
My wife was five years old

284
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I just remember

285
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I saw the purple bamboo forest

286
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But I forgot where it was

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
In the house

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There's no purple bamboo anywhere else

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But Jiu Weiwei

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't go there

291
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Without her permission

292
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No one can enter the purple bamboo forest

293
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Why?

294
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't ask

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The less you know

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The better

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll go

298
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Where did you plant the purple bamboo?

299
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
On Lianye

300
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
My wife

301
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You don't want to meddle in this, do you?

302
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What if the crown prince

303
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Ask us to enter the capital?

304
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We've been planning for so long

305
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What if we're delayed?

306
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If so

307
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll ask the crown prince

308
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
To tell the prince

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The clues

310
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Anyway

311
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll make Lianye die

312
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The purple bamboo forest

313
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,080
Dao

314
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Finally

315
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
The journey flashlight

316
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
My wife

317
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
Since she passed away

318
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Why is Lianye here?

319
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:48,380
The

320
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,180
scene

321
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,820
is right

322
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,560
穹娘子

323
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,720
Why are you here?

324
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,360
I'm not familiar with this place.

325
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,560
I got lost in the early morning.

326
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,280
Please guide me to the Tinglan Court.

327
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,680
That way.

328
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,240
Honey.

329
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,440
Honey, where have you been this morning?

330
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,520
How did it become like this?

331
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,960
I went to the Purple Bamboo Forest this morning.

332
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,040
In the midnight,

333
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I think someone was chasing me in the Purple Bamboo Forest.

334
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
He must have seen something he shouldn't have.

335
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
That's why he was attracted to the killing fire.

336
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,560
And then,

337
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,040
I saw the steward Liu Chun.

338
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,160
He looked at me with a gloomy look.

339
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,400
That Liu Chun,

340
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,120
I've always thought he was strange.

341
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,880
He was here to give gifts on the festival.

342
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,880
His eyes were staring at us.

343
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,720
But he is an old man in this mansion.

344
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,400
Could it be...

345
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,480
Could it be that he killed Lian Yi?

346
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,760
Honey, this mansion is so scary.

347
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,280
How about we return to the mansion of Marquis Anyang?

348
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,520
No.

349
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,840
We can only rely on ourselves.

350
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,320
We can't stop the demon from coming

351
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,800
no matter how we rely on others.

352
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,720
But...

353
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,640
Don't be afraid.

354
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,160
Just be careful.

355
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,040
Don't let others get in your way.

356
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,640
Why is it so hard to live a peaceful life?

357
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,160
You're quite good at dealing with them.

358
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,080
But your position is a bit awkward.

359
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,680
I've been guarding for a whole night.

360
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,080
It's good enough to have this gun.

361
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,320
Did you find anything?

362
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,920
Hai Shimo,

363
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,400
the second young master of Qin's mansion and the ninth lady

364
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,480
went to the Tinglan Courtyard together.

365
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,720
They left after talking for a while.

366
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,520
It seems that they are looking for a doctor.

367
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,960
No one else will appear after that.

368
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,640
Looking for a doctor?

369
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,640
Let me keep an eye on them.

370
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,360
Master,

371
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,320
I'll take care of the ninth lady.

372
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,280
If I'm busy investigating

373
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,640
the assassins who killed you and the prince,

374
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,720
I can't let anything bad happen.

375
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,800
You can't let anything bad happen.

376
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,840
You want to keep an eye on Fulin, right?

377
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,720
It's a good thing.

378
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,560
I'm still learning from you.

379
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,120
I joined the Ministry of Justice

380
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,640
to investigate the real murderer of the Prince Jin case

381
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,680
and the mastermind behind the plot of the Shuoxi Army.

382
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,760
The ninth lady's eye-catching skills

383
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,360
can be my main assistant.

384
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
You're just pretending to be a priest.

385
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,040
You're so arrogant.

386
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,680
I can't hear you.

387
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,320
The punishment is 200 times more than the actual punishment.

388
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,840
Your Highness.

389
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,120
I heard from Run New gez慢

390
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:44,500
that theappa syloneum is the father of the

391
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,800
combinations of ph jego dungain and death,

392
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,360
Her Highness must have forgotten that

393
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,960
if you don't protect the fish and keep the threads underwater,

394
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,840
she will give birth to a adhesive of pheria nr12

395
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
and deliver it immediately.

396
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,280
I believe that

397
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,800
three powerful beats when facing kitty cat

398
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,760
is more than enough

399
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,880
Give me a~!!

400
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,760
Mother.

401
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,720
We're about to get a herb for Prince Rui from allonsia.

402
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,220
I'm not waiting for long.

403
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,960
I'll choose it myself.

404
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,120
He's so arrogant because he's favored you.

405
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,000
But I heard that he's been sick for days.

406
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
He's still mad.

407
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,800
Let me do it.

408
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,040
It's not worth being mad for him.

409
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,280
We should do our own business.

410
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,040
Why did you take only one?

411
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,080
What if it gets mixed with the medicine for the crown prince and the second son?

412
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,880
I'll go back and check.

413
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,000
The medicine for the crown prince is to be counted.

414
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,600
According to the medicine,

415
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,200
we can guess the ingredients of the prescription.

416
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,080
If it's not mixed with the medicine for the crown prince,

417
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm afraid that the second brother's illness will be revealed.

418
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,080
Madam Jiu,

419
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,800
the medicine you want is ready.

420
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,640
I'll go and check.

421
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,320
Madam Jiu,

422
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,720
are all the medicines you want?

423
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,440
The medicines in the mansion are very good.

424
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,760
The prefecture doctor is very good at managing.

425
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,080
It's a matter of the interior.

426
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,080
What illness does Madam Jiu have?

427
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,040
She said she was depressed.

428
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,760
Who prescribed this prescription?

429
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,040
I don't know.

430
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,040
Madam Jiu, do you think it's still correct?

431
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,160
I'm glad that Madam Jiu thinks it's correct.

432
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,160
Okay.

433
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,480
Prefecture doctor, help me grab some medicine.

434
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,760
I'll go over there.

435
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,160
Follow me.

436
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,960
Madam,

437
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,760
is there something wrong with this prescription?

438
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,560
It seems to be a woman's illness.

439
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,640
The crown prince has a small eyebrow injury.

440
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,280
Could it be the second son?

441
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
It shouldn't be.

442
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,480
The second brother must have never used medicine before.

443
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,160
It's highly이어 to give the alright ghost medicine.

444
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,400
Giving child ready is not only good for the health.

445
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,240
It can even protect you

446
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,840
from any condition.

447
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,560
Behind Madam Jiu can usually let her mom

448
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,440
and mom take care of what you wish to give her.

449
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:45,400
I'm already гр Bununya who gets

450
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Greetings, Ninth Madam.

451
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Get up.

452
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Are you satisfied?

453
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
The person that Old Madam chose must be very good.

454
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
As long as you are satisfied.

455
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Old Madam is waiting for my reply.

456
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
I'll go now.

457
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I'll go greet Old Madam now.

458
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
No need.

459
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Old Madam knows that you are busy.

460
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
She wants you to have more time to rest.

461
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Thank you.

462
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Sister Fulin, let me do it.

463
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
You go and arrange for them to stay for a while.

464
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Yes.

465
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Follow me.

466
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Yes.

467
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Madam, those two girls have been arranged.

468
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Old Madam suddenly sent someone to come.

469
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
She must be trying to find out your whereabouts.

470
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Someone has checked this room.

471
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,400
The paper and paper in this room have not been touched.

472
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
It shows that it is not my identity.

473
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
I only saw Liu Chun this morning in the Purple Bamboo Forest.

474
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
At this time, only two people were sent in.

475
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Although I don't know who these two girls are behind,

476
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
they must have something to do with the death of Lian Yi.

477
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
You guard the room.

478
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
I'll go and check.

479
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Yes.

480
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Go out.

481
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Go out.

482
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Hurry up.

483
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Go.

484
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Go back and tell Marquis Song that His Majesty is benevolent.

485
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,400
He has only now reduced his concubine's palace title to Marquis.

486
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
If he comes to bother me again,

487
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
the Marquis's mansion will be the Song's mansion.

488
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
It's just a matter of my words.

489
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Get lost!

490
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Go.

491
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Go.

492
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Go.

493
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Go.

494
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Go.

495
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Go.

496
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Go.

497
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Go.

498
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Go.

499
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Go.

500
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Qilang,

501
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,400
the battle between the King of Cheng and the Crown Prince

502
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
has almost reached a clear end.

503
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,400
The Shuoxi Army has taken over half of the country's military forces.

504
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Who doesn't want to take a bite of this piece of meat?

505
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Although you are benevolent,

506
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,400
the words of the ingredients are still a bit reckless.

507
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm afraid that someone who is interested will use it.

508
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Before I came,

509
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,400
His Majesty has promised to let the Shuoxi Army follow the order and not follow the order.

510
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
It seems that I have never been trusted before.

511
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,400
But it's not like I'm putting my father on the fire.

512
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
But my father doesn't listen to me.

513
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
He wants to make contributions to repay the kindness.

514
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
If this is the case,

515
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,400
I, the Crown Prince, still have a deep heart.

516
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I'm afraid that the first person His Majesty can't tolerate

517
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
is my father and son.

518
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
I'm really sorry for you.

519
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Unfortunately, King of Rui doesn't have a clear view of you.

520
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
My father is only loyal and righteous.

521
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
He takes my consideration

522
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
as a new book.

523
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
King of Rui is not a person who doesn't know the truth.

524
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
I believe that one day

525
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
he will understand your pain.

526
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
I hope so.

527
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
I hope he can understand it sooner.

528
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
My wife,

529
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
those two have fallen asleep.

530
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
You go to the back window to guard.

531
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Let him in when he sees the second brother.

532
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Yes.

533
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Second brother, come in.

534
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Ninth sister, I...

535
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Look.

536
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
It's only been one day.

537
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Why is it so much stronger?

538
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm not saved, right?

539
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
No.

540
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
But you have to tell me the truth.

541
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Your illness really has nothing to do with the people in the mansion.

542
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I swear to God.

543
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Because my wife doesn't like concubines.

544
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I don't even have a maid.

545
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
How can I dare to attract women from the mansion?

546
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
Ninth sister, believe me.

547
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Believe me.

548
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
I don't believe you.

549
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,400
But this prescription can't be shared by men and women.

550
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
If this person really spreads to other people in the mansion,

551
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
I'm afraid you can't hide your illness.

552
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
It really doesn't.

553
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
It really doesn't.

554
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Ninth sister, just let me be alone.

555
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
That's good.

556
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
I've put the prescription in the medicine bag.

557
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
These ointments are applied to the window frame.

558
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
You must apply it according to the method I wrote.

559
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Come to me after you're done.

560
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Thank you, Ninth sister.

561
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
I'll go first.

562
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Second brother.

563
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Do you know why the purple bamboo forest in the mansion has become a forbidden area?

564
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Not immediately.

565
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I have an original goose-uplư phrase.

566
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Will you ask me for me?

567
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
If you don't, then answer me.

568
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
What?

569
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:30,300
Why is19th sister

570
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,600
It seems that this purple bamboo forest is inevitable.

571
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,980
7 years ago

572
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,800
Auntie Ba

573
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,080
So this lui strongest woman also dunk all night

574
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,580
Don't you see that women?

575
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,760
Monk Jiu must have forgotten

576
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
This place is a forbidden area

577
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,500
Anyone who夜väx enter will be punished

578
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
What I know is…

579
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
My lady!

580
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
My lady!

581
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,200
Madam Jiu, the doctor has arrived.

582
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,080
We can go to get the medicine.

583
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
I see.

584
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,640
What else do you need?

585
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,320
Lately, the house has been full of mud and dirt.

586
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,960
It's very polluted.

587
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,720
You'd better not go anywhere.

588
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,040
Wanxing, how did you know I was here?

589
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,840
Sister Fulin told me to follow Madam Jiu.

590
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
So I followed her.

591
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
I see.

592
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
I'm on my way.

593
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,880
Why didn't I see you?

594
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,040
I don't know either.

595
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,240
Don't follow me

596
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,800
unless I tell you to.

597
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,200
Yes.

598
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Go away!

599
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
If you go, I'll die in front of you!

600
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Qin Shuang?

601
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Go away!

602
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Calm down.

603
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
My lady!

604
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
My lady!

605
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Go away!

606
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Go away!

607
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,200
If you come again, I'll die in front of you!

608
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,640
Shuang, put down the scissors.

609
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,640
I've been dead for so long.

610
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,640
Why do you still care about me?

611
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
I've been begging you every day.

612
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,000
Why don't you listen to me?

613
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Shuang.

614
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,360
Shuang, put down the scissors.

615
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Put it down.

616
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,840
Let's talk in the yard.

617
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,880
I punish you for your own good.

618
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,040
Think about it.

619
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,160
You offended the eldest princess.

620
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,440
If I don't punish you,

621
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,200
I'll be angry with her.

622
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,640
What should I do?

623
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,080
If it's for my own good,

624
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,080
why would my mother and sister treat me like this?

625
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,480
Shuang.

626
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,080
I'm the wife of the Qin family, not a prisoner.

627
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,880
Why do you treat me like this?

628
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,200
You're not like the wife of the Qin family.

629
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,680
If you keep doing this,

630
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,560
your whole family will be ashamed of you.

631
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,800
Anyway, I've had a good life.

632
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,680
I'd rather not live like this.

633
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
I'd rather not live like this.

634
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Calm down.

635
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Go away!

636
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,480
Help!

637
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Help!

638
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Untie the rope.

639
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Yes.

640
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
Throw it away.

641
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Help!

642
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
Put it down.

643
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,920
Madam, please forgive me.

644
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,560
This well is about to be completed.

645
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,600
The water is already dried.

646
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,720
We're dealing with the mud.

647
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,880
I didn't expect that the Sixth Madam...

648
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,200
What's the point of saying that now?

649
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,040
Hurry up and save her.

650
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Go!

651
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,360
Help!

652
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,240
It's so dark here!

653
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,640
Help!

654
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
I'm going to die!

655
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,120
You're a sinner!

656
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,320
Sixth Sister, we've put the rope down.

657
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,520
You tie it on your waist.

658
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,800
We'll pull you up now.

659
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,400
I... I'm done!

660
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Come on!

661
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Wait!

662
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,720
Something is clinging to me.

663
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Help!

664
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Help!

665
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Help!

666
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Help!

667
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
There's no dead person!

668
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,440
Why would there be a dead person's bone in the well?

669
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Hurry up and pull it in!

670
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Hurry up!

671
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Hurry up!

672
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
Use more strength!

673
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Be careful!

674
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Hurry up!

675
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Hurry up and pull him in!

676
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
Slowly.

677
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,040
Come on! Hurry up!

678
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
Help him over there.

679
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Hurry up!

680
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
Hurry up!

681
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,360
Hurry up!

682
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Hurry up!

683
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Hurry up!

684
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Help him over there.

685
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Help him.

686
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Sit down.

687
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Dead person!

688
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
I saw a dead person!

689
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,400
Sixth Sister, there's a dead person in the well!

690
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,080
There's a dead person's bone in the well!

691
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,560
Look at Sixth Sister.

692
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,080
She's scared to talk nonsense.

693
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,360
Where did the bones come from?

694
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Mother!

695
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,440
There really is a dead person's bone in the well!

696
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,720
I saw it!

697
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,440
It's holding my fist.

698
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,120
It's a white dead person's bone!

699
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Alright.

700
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
What happened?

701
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
I saw it.

702
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Yes.

703
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Third Aunt,

704
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
why don't we let them go down and have a look?

705
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,200
There are so many people watching.

706
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
We can't help them.

707
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,360
It's even worse if they go out and talk nonsense.

708
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Yes.

709
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,040
Even the nine girls are thoughtful.

710
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Liu Chun!

711
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Liu Chun!

712
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,760
Hurry up and find someone to go down and have a look.

713
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Yes.

714
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Alright.

715
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,400
You're not hurt, are you?

716
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Don't be afraid.

717
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
I'm fine.

718
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,640
It's alright.

719
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
It's alright.

720
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
It's alright.

721
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
Madam!

722
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,200
The bottom is all over the place!

723
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,680
There's nothing but that dead person's bone!

724
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,120
I know! I know!

725
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Hurry up!

726
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Let's get rid of that well!

727
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,160
We can't let it harm others again.

728
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,640
You!

729
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,640
You're really something!

730
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,120
You're using this dead person's bone as a dead person's bone!

731
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,240
You can't be so naughty anymore!

732
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Do you understand?

733
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,480
But I...

734
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Alright.

735
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
I'll go in.

736
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
I'll go in.

737
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Alright.

738
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,400
Then...

739
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,440
Then, mother, will you still lock me up?

740
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Let's go back and rest for a few days.

741
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Little nine girl.

742
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,120
You must be tired today.

743
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,600
Go back and rest early.

744
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,280
Let's go.

745
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
Mother, let's go.

746
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,880
Little nine girl, why are you still holding that?

747
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,160
Throw it away! I don't want to see it!

748
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
Little nine girl.

749
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,400
I was bad to you before.

750
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,840
Why did you still help me?

751
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,680
We are sisters.

752
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,360
Besides, you didn't harm me.

753
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,720
After this,

754
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,000
don't do anything stupid again.

755
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,640
Mother,

756
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,080
is there really a human bone in that vase?

757
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
The human bone is white.

758
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,400
The crying face looks black.

759
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,200
No matter how afraid Qin Shuang is,

760
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,800
he won't be as black and white as he seems.

761
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,720
Then, the Qin manor is so scary.

762
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,640
You must not let anyone go anywhere alone.

763
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,720
Am I alone?

764
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,280
Aren't you telling Wanxin to follow me?

765
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,920
I'm the one who's going to follow you.

766
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,840
I'm the one who's going to follow you.

767
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,600
I'm the one who's going to follow you.

768
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,480
I'm the one who's going to follow you.

769
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,120
Are you telling Wanxin to follow me?

770
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,880
I'm worried that she's alone in the room

771
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,360
and I'm the one who's going to follow you.

772
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,480
Although Wanxin is timid,

773
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,360
she has her own ideas.

774
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,160
She's not like Wan Tang.

775
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,720
If you don't like her,

776
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,400
I'll let Wan Tang follow you.

777
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,880
No need.

778
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,000
I want to see what she wants to do.

779
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,640
Madam, can we go back to the capital as soon as possible?

780
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,480
I'm more afraid of this manor.

781
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,800
What are you afraid of?

782
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,160
You don't want to be in danger.

783
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,400
Besides,

784
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,880
we have to listen to the crown prince's arrangement

785
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,280
when we go to the capital.

786
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,400
Let's endure it.

787
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
What's wrong with you?

788
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:25,200
Why do days and nights turn around?

789
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:32,200
But I still have to light up your light

790
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
like a flower.

791
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,600
I'm afraid that I can't see you.

792
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,600
I'm afraid that I can't see you.

793
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,600
I'm afraid that I can't see you.

I'm afraid that I can't see you.

800
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,600
I'm afraid that I can't see you.

801
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,600
I'm afraid that I can't see you.

802
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,600
I'm afraid that I can't see you.

803
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,600
I'm afraid that I can't see you.

804
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,600
