Please subscribe to La La School channel to not miss the fascinating videos

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Private love, are you sure?

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Madam, some words can't be said randomly

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please look, this is the old scar

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can see it from the place where Wei's mansion is rotten

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The black spots above and below are symmetrical

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The black spots above are called big and long

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's because the upper teeth are called lower teeth

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Big and loose, more severe damage

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is a bite mark, it's a scratch caused by human food

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Even if it's bitten by a human, it may be a fight between women

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Men and women have different widths and widths

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If it's caused by fighting, the dead will definitely resist and avoid

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The wound and the position will be different

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, and Song Rou is the pearl of the Song Dynasty

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No one in the mansion dares to touch it, it's even more dangerous

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, just by a bite mark, Song Rou has private feelings

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is too hasty

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And Bai Chi Yi, Bai Chi Yi relies on the wood to survive

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He rarely attacks living things

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Only the dead have been lying naked near the bed

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's possible to find Bai Chi Yi in private

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Do you think he was forced to do it?

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why is it not a warning?

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Do you really think Song's guards are dead?

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The day of the wedding, the dead were carried into Jingzhou city in the wedding sedan

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Only when the night was over, they could act

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If it wasn't for the relatives, why would he go to Rong Shu Lin alone at night?

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Mrs. Song died so tragically

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why did the Song family not notice it?

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Even someone tried to play tricks in the mansion

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's probably the Song family who disturbed our mind

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you think it's the people below who tried to escape the crime of escorting the unfavorable?

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's inevitable that the people who tried to escape the crime of escorting the unfavorable would be punished

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What you think is reasonable

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I urge Mr. Huo to conduct a autopsy

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
To find solid evidence

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What? A autopsy?

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No way, no way

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Then Duke Song will never agree

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Master Huo, Song Rou should have been married a few months ago

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If Song Rou was married before the wedding, but still married to Duke An Yang

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Duke Song is treating Duke An Yang's dignity as a threat

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How could he treat the imperial court's dignity?

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is a serious matter

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Duke Huo has been a minister for many years

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What should he do? I don't know

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I will investigate the Song family again

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I urge Wei Yanzhi to be more careful

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I will take my leave

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Duke Song and Duke An Yang are not good friends

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Before the autopsy, please ask your wife to not tell anyone that Song Rou might have lost her position

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The missing person is a man of great power, with a hundred accounts

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Although I am not an official, I know the rules of the autopsy

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have thought about it

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Director Xu, put the body of the body and the Chang'an clothes into the empty coffin

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Put the body of the body around the body, and fill it with glue and charcoal

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Put more ice around the coffin to delay the body of the body

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Prepare three cups of tea

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let the people in the capital carefully investigate the Song family's back house

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Back house?

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Is Song Rou not a regular person?

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It seems that you have to be sent back to the new camp to learn the rules

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Master, please spare me

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I would rather run around the capital

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I also can't bear to leave you

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Am I right?

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Take care, my lady

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
General Bai has something important to do, don't disturb them

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't know what to do

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I can't imagine that other than me, General Bai who is cruel and cruel

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He has another person to be afraid of

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Master, don't call me general

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You are calling me so weak

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Throw stones

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Mr. Hua, you know my difficulty

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If so, I can't explain to the Duke

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If this case is not solved, the Duke, the Duke, and even you and me

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Can't explain to the Emperor

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are right, but

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Master

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I found the crime scene

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Where?

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
At the post station of Shilin Temple

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
As my lady said, there is a tree of glory next to the post station

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We found blood on the side of a barren pile of dead branches

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Did you find Rou's head?

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No, we searched the whole mountain, but we didn't find it

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Did the beast take it away?

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Shilin Temple is the closest post station to Jingzhou

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Many people come and go

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Unless the cold winter is hard to cover

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The beast won't appear here

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It may be taken away by the murderer

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What's the use of the murderer escaping?

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Maybe it's to cover the evidence

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sorry

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Wei Fuwei, please ask Duke Song to sign a letter with me

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
After all, regardless of whether you agree to post or not

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I will explain to the Emperor and Duke Anyang

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm leaving

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Your Highness, you are so good

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
With Duke Song's order

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I was guilty of being ungrateful before

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Now it's all Duke Song's fault

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I and my brother are guilty of being ungrateful

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
To make the court judge

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
To make the court judge look bad

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
How can you be so happy for having a burden?

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I didn't mean to shut up

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The ninth wife is kind and righteous

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't take it to heart when you are angry

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I have solved Duke Song's case for you

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Duke Anyang needs you to deal with it

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
After all, Duke Anyang's mansion only wants the truth

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ok, I will interrogate the servant of the Song family now

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm leaving

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
See you

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Son, you should focus on your work

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Qin Wan is too arrogant

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We can't get him

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Fu Ling, get in the carriage and go back to Duke Anyang's mansion

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The ninth wife is angry

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
She looks angry

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You owe the whole Jinzhou, let's start

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Master

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm angry

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The little lady is angry

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I have to get her back

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't get her back

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Coming

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The ninth wife

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The ninth wife

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The ninth wife accused me of using Duke Song's handbook to help Huai Xin

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Although Master Huo has done a lot for Duke Anyang's mansion

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If he is under the pressure of the crown prince, he may not dare to do it

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Huo Huai Xin is just afraid of the responsibility of the master

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
She is afraid that you really find the evidence

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If the Song's private communication incident occurs, Duke Song will be angry with her

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Then why does the crown prince still have to let Master Huo Huo take the blame?

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Is it more important than the appearance of the official appearance?

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Because you have tested the red mark

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The emperor has personally asked about this

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Although the red mark cannot be used as a solid evidence of Song Rou's private communication

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But it is enough to make people suspicious

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If I put the autopsy test and the surgery of Duke Song together

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The emperor will suspect that Duke Song deliberately hinders the autopsy test

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If the emperor orders the autopsy, what can Duke Song do?

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I just wronged you

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Please punish yourself

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No need

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I just followed the order

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Nothing

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But I hope the ninth wife can be honest with me in the future

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And be honest

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I always feel that Wei Yanzhi is a little suspicious

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
She seemed to be sad just now

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But she didn't even dare to look at me

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I will send someone to keep an eye on her

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Whether it is really a letter for Duke Song

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Tomorrow is the 15th, there is a lantern show

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
She didn't know that I had already tested the private love of the Song's wife

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Please release the news

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Say I want to see you in a few days

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I will lead her out of the lantern show tomorrow

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
See if she wants to take the opportunity to kill me

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why are you so risky?

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Find a five-fingered arm of the Marquis of Anyang to help you

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If Wei Yanzhi is the murderer, without Zhen

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
How can she be fooled?

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You can send someone to follow me tomorrow

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Goodbye

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Young master

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The letter from the capital

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The day we set out

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The letter from the capital

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The day we set out

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The young master and Changsui are gone

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The guards have been all over the capital

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Didn't find the young master

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The Duke of the State just sent us a letter

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Send someone to follow our way

190
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm afraid my brother is chasing after me

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Then will the wife be caught by the young master?

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Shut up

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't you think Duke Song's mansion is not big enough?

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But I heard from the crown prince's subordinate

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
There are three thousand gold coins left

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If it's really cut out

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
How can we explain to the Duke of the State?

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If the people who watch the banquet are gone

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The Duke of the State can be relieved

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The old princess's condition has stabilized

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
She just needs to take medicine and rest

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll come back for a check-up the next day

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This time

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a good thing that the ninth lady saved my old life

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ninth lady

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If you stay

207
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It would be great to accompany Ning'er

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes, little Waner, you stay

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Thank you for your kindness

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But the Qin's mansion is not far from here

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's convenient to come back

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Why don't you go back every day?

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The ninth lady has not left the house yet

214
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If you don't go home at night, it will cause people to criticize

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Xiaoqi, your face is ugly

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is it because the case is not done well?

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The ninth lady has found out that it was a matter of ten miles

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The imperial guards have not entered the capital yet

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No one can be involved in Duke Anyang's head

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So my cousin can clear the suspicion

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank God

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Ninth girl

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You are really the lucky star of our family

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't know how to thank you

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Since I came to Jinzhou

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I haven't gone out to play

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I want to go to the autumn trip this evening

229
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Can you please ask the eldest princess to say hello to my grandmother?

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What's so hard about that?

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll send someone to tell your grandmother

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Don't go back to Qin's mansion tonight

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let Xiaoqi accompany you

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And Ning er, go to play together

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes, I promise to accompany Xiaowan to play happily

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And Wei Fuwei

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I see he is unhappy all day

238
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm afraid he is still worried about the case and unable to be released

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Can you let him go together?

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That Wei Fu's son

242
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's pretty unlucky to be involved in this

243
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't know how to explain to Duke Songguo

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It looks pitiful

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Go, go, go

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's go play together

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Everything is up to my grandmother

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll go too

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Go, go, go, go

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Go play with everyone

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Lady

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Look, a car gift

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Princess, this is too much

254
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This is all prepared by mother and grandmother

255
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If you don't want it, go to your mother

256
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Go, get on the car

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you princess

258
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What is this?

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The most popular painting book at the moment

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Lady Song Jiu, she must like it

261
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You send a book to a woman

262
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Aren't you afraid of ruining her reputation?

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Thank you, I can't give you a good meal

264
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If you send a book for a doctor

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
She may like it more

266
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Go back quickly

267
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Then give it to you

268
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Brother Xie

269
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is for you

270
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
This is the painting book of justice

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
By the way

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I will personally do the task of sending the ninth wife

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why?

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Just because you can't beat me

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I will beat you one day

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm waiting

277
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Set out

278
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Look at my big white painting

279
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Big white painting

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Big white painting

281
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Big white painting

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So beautiful

283
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Little Wang

284
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
This street is full of toys and food

285
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Where do you want to start playing?

286
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Where are my brother and brother?

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I didn't see them when I got off the car

288
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Leave them alone

289
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's play by ourselves

290
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Princess, look at that lantern

291
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So beautiful

292
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That little rabbit is so cute

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Look, there are also shadow

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's go, I'll take you to play

295
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Hurry up

296
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hurry up

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You also try

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
No

299
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't know

300
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Oulu Wangji

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
O what?

302
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The tune is called Oulu Wangji

303
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
In such a noisy place

304
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Wei Fuwei can still hear the music and play the music

305
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I guess you've been playing since you were a child

306
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Where?

307
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oulu Wangji is my brother's favorite tune

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I heard my brother talk a lot

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Naturally remember

310
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Did your brother learn to play since he was a child?

311
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
My brother is the eldest son of Wei's family

312
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He is really loved by his mother and Duke Song

313
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Duke Song also asked the best Qin's teacher to teach him and Xiaorou for him

314
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If he hadn't broken his leg before he left

315
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He should have sent the family

316
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The second joint and the thumb joint of the left hand

317
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
There are thick joints

318
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
According to the servants of Duke Song's family

319
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Mrs. Song is really good at playing the zither

320
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Then why didn't Wei Fuwei learn to play the zither?

321
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
When my mother was alive

322
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
She didn't want me to disturb Duke Song

323
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Since we are out to play

324
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Everyone is happy

325
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't talk about these sad things

326
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The crown prince can't find us

327
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He must be anxious

328
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I will go there with Wei Fuwei

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You go to find them

330
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Then come to us to meet

331
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
How does this work?

332
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let the ninth wife and the princess wait a moment

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I will go to find the crown prince

334
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I just want to find the one who plays the zither first

335
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So I ask the ninth wife and the princess to wait a moment

336
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Go, go, don't lose them

337
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If only I knew he was a son

338
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm afraid everyone will say

339
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Good for everyone

340
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let's go

341
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Come

342
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Fulin, you go to ask the princess to leave

343
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No, I have to protect you from here

344
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I have an appointment with the crown prince

345
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He will protect me secretly

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You don't have to worry about me

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Go

348
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This is beautiful

349
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Princess, look

350
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The butterflies on it are so beautiful

351
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's go to the second floor

352
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Ok, Xiaowan

353
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Where is Xiaowan?

354
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
She went to find the crown prince

355
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't worry

356
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But

357
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Go, go, go

358
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Aunt, this is so beautiful

359
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I want to play

360
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You go up and try

361
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Goodbye, aunt

362
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Goodbye

363
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The ninth wife

364
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The ninth wife

365
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So beautiful

366
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's really beautiful

367
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The Xuxi army guards the border

368
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The white boat is on the road, the night is fast

369
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
For the thousands of lights can be seen every night

370
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The people are peaceful and peaceful every night

371
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The ninth wife, you are so beautiful

372
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't have seven brothers

373
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I only wish the one I like

374
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Peaceful every night

375
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Only the country is prosperous

376
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
People can be safe and sound

377
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Isn't it?

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Go

379
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Go

380
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Go

381
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Go

382
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Sorry

383
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Who are you looking for?

384
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Sorry

385
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I got the wrong person

386
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Who is he looking for?

387
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm here

388
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The mask is so beautiful

389
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's take a look

390
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Wei Yanzhi, is it you?

391
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Wife, do you want to buy a mask?

392
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We have everything

393
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Just pick whatever you want

394
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I want this

395
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Ok

396
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Come, come

397
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Take a look

398
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's so beautiful

399
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Let's have a look

400
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
When we are hit, we have a chance to get it

401
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A chance to be the best

402
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Big brother

403
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Take a look

404
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's so beautiful

405
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So beautiful

406
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Let's have a look

407
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Let's have a look

408
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Come, let's have a look

409
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Let's have a look

410
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,180
It can kill a person with Hesitation and

411
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,400
it can take a life.

412
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,600
Go!

413
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,760
Go.

414
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,280
He found out and went to buy a mask.

415
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,720
But I found out that person is not Wei Yanzhi.

416
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,400
It's really not him.

417
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,800
He's still listening to music.

418
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,680
But you're bold.

419
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,000
So many people dare to take risks.

420
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,240
It's a shame that someone said that he saw a woman with a mask.

421
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,040
I can find you.

422
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
How do you know that the one with a mask is me?

423
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,720
The mask is hidden in the mountain.

424
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,920
In this world, except you,

425
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,480
who else will wear such a fierce mask?

426
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You're hurt.

427
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,880
It doesn't matter.

428
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,000
Don't tell anyone.

429
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,600
Go.

430
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,440
Go.

431
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,520
How did you get hurt like this?

432
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,080
I'm a fighter.

433
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
I'm always injured.

434
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,120
This stab wound

435
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
was left by Jin Xie Shi.

436
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,000
From the capital to the capital,

437
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
where did you get it?

438
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's true that it's not good to say that a woman is too smart.

439
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I thought only useless people would think like that.

440
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,720
I didn't expect you to be a useless person.

441
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,560
I'm afraid that you know too much and it's not good for you.

442
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
But if you want to hear it,

443
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,520
I can tell you.

444
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,800
I don't want to know the secrets of the army.

445
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,400
If it's not the secrets of the army,

446
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,000
what if it's not the secrets of the army,

447
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
but the case of the capital?

448
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,680
Then you don't have to tell me.

449
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,960
If you're injured,

450
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
you'll be a useless person if you stay here.

451
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,280
Why don't you tell me or treat me these days?

452
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,000
Your wound is already swollen.

453
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,200
I have the wound medicine.

454
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
I can heal it myself.

455
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,600
Use some anesthetic.

456
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
No need.

457
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,800
I can take these wounds.

458
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Your wound is swollen.

459
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
You have to remove the flesh to make it better.

460
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,400
If you move, you will hurt the meridians.

461
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,000
It's too late to regret.

462
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
I was in the army when I was ten years old.

463
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,000
I've always been through these wounds.

464
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,800
Using these things makes people anxious.

465
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Okay.

466
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
If you can't take it, you must tell me.

467
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Don't worry.

468
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
I will take care of it.

469
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,800
I will take care of it.

470
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
These are all medicine for tiger wolves.

471
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Ordinary people can't take it.

472
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,600
The army of Shuoxi is known to be a king of tiger wolves.

473
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,000
It's not appropriate to use medicine for tiger wolves.

474
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
It's ready.

475
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,200
Master, I have something to report.

476
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Come in.

477
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Master,

478
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,800
the foundation of the lantern house was deliberately cut off.

479
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,400
But the person who led the Ninth Madam out was not Wei Yanzhi.

480
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,200
When the incident happened, she was listening to the zither at Tianyin Pavilion.

481
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,800
The master and the manager were all witnesses.

482
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,000
There are twenty people who know martial arts in Song's Mansion.

483
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
They are all in the mansion.

484
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,000
But they have been to the lantern house together.

485
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,200
The small Song's Mansion soldiers are more skilled than the military.

486
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,400
They even play with the same instrument.

487
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
They are really rare.

488
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,800
I'm going to clean up those guys.

489
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Stop.

490
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,800
Don't do anything stupid.

491
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,200
They use these tricks to stop me from picking up the body.

492
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,200
I have to pick it up as soon as possible to make them look good.

493
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Bai Feng,

494
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,000
tomorrow you are allowed to fight with the Song's Mansion soldiers.

495
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,400
You only need to be quiet.

496
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
Don't be hasty.

497
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Just show up when you get the letter of the goods.

498
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yes.

499
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Miss Cheng,

500
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
please do the laundry tomorrow.

501
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yes.

502
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,200
General Bai,

503
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,600
you said the Song's Mansion guards framed you.

504
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,400
They just did it.

505
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,600
What did they say?

506
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
They said that the young general is good at martial arts.

507
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
They told me to come from the capital.

508
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,000
They said it was a case of investigation.

509
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,800
In fact,

510
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,400
they must have killed their wives because they were afraid of them.

511
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,000
Nonsense.

512
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Your Highness,

513
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
I can swear with my life

514
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,200
that no one in the Song's Mansion dares to have such a big evil thought.

515
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Deputy of the goods.

516
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,600
Although the rumors are only for the wise,

517
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,000
there must be a reason for the empty-hearted people to come.

518
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,000
If these words are spread,

519
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
how can I still be honored

520
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
to be the young general of the Shuoxi Army?

521
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,800
I will strictly follow the order.

522
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
I will strictly follow the order.

523
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,800
I am ashamed.

524
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,200
Since there is a villain behind it,

525
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
don't blame me for not keeping my face.

526
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,800
The body inspection of the Song's wife must be completed as soon as possible.

527
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
If you can't catch the real murderer,

528
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
you two

529
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,800
go to Shuoxi with me.

530
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,800
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

531
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
I will arrange a post-mortem immediately.

532
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,400
A post-mortem?

533
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Who will have the chance to womanize it?

534
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Who?

535
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Foreignicion!

536
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,600
I am your concubine today.

537
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,240
Yes.

538
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,360
You've been waiting for a long time.

539
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,720
I don't understand one thing.

540
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,480
Why did he give me the house

541
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,960
to help me with the autopsy?

542
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,280
It has nothing to do with Duke An Yang's mansion.

543
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,960
It's not his duty.

544
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,160
He has nothing to do with Duke Song's mansion.

545
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,840
My dear.

546
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,680
What do you think of his highness?

547
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,160
Very good.

548
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,560
Then why do you think

549
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,360
he has something different from others?

550
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,480
He said

551
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,280
I saved Princess Royal.

552
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,360
I'm his benefactor.

553
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,120
And he only wants me to help him.

554
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,160
Maybe he thinks I'm a good person

555
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,360
and wants to help him.

556
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,640
My dear.

557
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,800
Have you ever thought

558
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,760
maybe he...

559
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,760
He loves you so much?

560
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,600
My identity is fake.

561
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,360
But I'm real.

562
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,840
I want to help him

563
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,360
to escape from Qin's family.

564
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,880
I can't be careful at all.

565
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,200
If I can't help him,

566
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,520
how can I repay his kindness?

567
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,440
Well...

568
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,880
Can't he be his lover?

569
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,400
He...

570
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,600
I don't think so.

571
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,960
Episode 2

572
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
Bring water!

573
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,920
Hurry!

574
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,280
Bring water!

575
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,960
Hurry!

576
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,760
Hurry!

577
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,480
Hurry!

578
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,440
Bring water!

579
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,840
Bring water!

580
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,200
Hurry!

581
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,120
Hurry!

582
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,200
Hurry!

583
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,040
Hurry!

584
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,760
Hurry!

585
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,560
Hurry!

586
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,360
Hurry!

587
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,200
My dear.

588
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,560
A fire broke out last night.

589
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,800
The Eastern Hall was burned down.

590
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,720
I'm afraid

591
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,480
we can't check the body.

592
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,120
Does His Highness know about this?

593
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,080
He came to the Ghost Village at night

594
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,240
when you told him.

595
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,480
He told me to wait here

596
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,280
so that you wouldn't come here for nothing.

597
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,040
Why is the carriage of the Hong Mansion

598
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,440
still here?

599
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
He's worried that

600
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,040
you insist on going there.

601
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,640
Get on the carriage and go to the Ghost Village.

602
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,920
My dear.

603
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,040
The body has been burned to the ground.

604
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,640
Can we check it?

605
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
I'll decide whether we can check it or not.

606
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,400
My dear, it's Wuzhuo Mountain.

607
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,920
This is Wuzhuo Mountain.

608
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,880
It's dangerous.

609
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,800
Don't run!

610
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,000
Isn't this

611
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,520
Wuzhuo Mountain?

612
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,840
This blue mountain

613
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,280
is the entrance狱伲 in Wuzhuo Mountain.

614
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,840
It's as if that he's dead.

615
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We must get inside.

616
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
The phi LOGOMODEND-TAL EM TIANKGU did very well.

617
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
What's this smell?

618
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Copper oil.

619
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
The one in the clothes shop must be Su You.

620
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Someone did it on purpose.

621
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Huo Hua has sent someone to check the person who bought copper oil last night.

622
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
If nothing goes wrong...

623
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
It must be the one from Song's family.

624
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm not sure.

625
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I'm not sure.

626
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
I'm not sure.

627
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I'm not sure.

628
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
I'm not sure.

629
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
I'm not sure.

630
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
I'm not sure.

631
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
I'm not sure.

632
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm not sure.

633
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
I'm not sure.

634
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I'm not sure.

635
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Take care.

636
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Young Master.

637
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,840
I got it.

638
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
I got it.

639
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,720
Lspeak Ouyen

640
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Any more health tests?

641
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,840
There's a black spot on his body

642
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
and no signs of skin texture on his skin.

643
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,840
But boundary pleasure can iceTake a test of his endurance

644
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
to find traces of among 영상.

645
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Therefore, could side consult.

646
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
A pains point isn't confirmed yet.

647
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
The tools are still on his manual.

648
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Arrange!

649
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,440
So I've only built buildings for you,

650
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,660
as Veena has known.

651
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,760
What is this?

652
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,540
This is from our old cry of savior.

653
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,560
I don't think it's right to send beauty out,

654
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,540
and this is why we Celeste trip from the past to Dong gazġogen.

655
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,040
Learning of this will be worth not knowing.

656
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,220
Disowego oh mais能 身負我相信

657
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,920
Take this!

658
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

659
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
You can thank me if you want.

660
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
I'll record the autopsy.

661
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Remember, the autopsy is very serious.

662
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
The autopsy is just to check.

663
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,840
The victim died in the night.

664
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,180
Only a small amount of

665
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
What's wrong?

666
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,840
The bone is large.

667
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
And the back of the body is thin.

668
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
The bones are usually wide.

669
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
The bone is not very deep.

670
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
What do you mean?

671
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,960
The victim had a deep

672
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Did you make a mistake?

673
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,840
According to the width of the victim's bone and the degree of the back of the body,

674
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,840
The victim's pregnancy should be five to six months.

675
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
The back of the body is normal.

676
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,840
It means that if the victim died two months before the birth,

677
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,840
The victim should have recovered.

678
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,840
How dare the people of the State of the State marry her?

679
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840
This is a crime of the King of Jin.

680
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
The Song State is so careful.

681
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
It must have been prepared.

682
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Your Highness.

683
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,840
This is what the shopkeeper bought yesterday.

684
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,840
This is the portrait of the shopkeeper yesterday.

685
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Isn't this the guard of the State of the State?

686
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,840
How can a small guard destroy the area without permission?

687
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
I'm afraid it's Wei Yan's sedan.

688
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,840
He is the one who gave the State of Song the jade.

689
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
How dare you not do your best?

690
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Wei Yan said that his brother and the victim were childhood friends.

691
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,840
If he didn't break his leg, he would be the one from the Song family.

692
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Is his brother the one who has a private relationship with Song Rou?

693
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
That one.

694
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
This is a secret.

695
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Duke Song will find a loyal old man to know about Song Rou's actions.

696
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Let him be married on the day of the wedding.

697
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,840
The model who manages the Pei family may be the one arranged by Duke Song.

698
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Yes. I'll send someone to interrogate him.

699
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
I'm sorry.

700
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
I'm sorry.

701
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
I'm sorry.

702
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
I'm sorry.

703
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm sorry.

704
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
I'm sorry.

705
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,840
I'm sorry.

706
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,840
I'm sorry.

707
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
I'm sorry.

708
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,840
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,840
I'm sorry.

710
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,840
I'm sorry.

711
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,840
I'm sorry.

712
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm sorry.

713
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
I'm sorry.

714
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
I'm sorry.

715
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,840
I'm sorry.

716
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
I'm sorry.

718
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
I'm sorry.

720
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,840
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm sorry.

722
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,840
I'm sorry.

723
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,840
I'm sorry.

724
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
I'm sorry.

725
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,840
I'm sorry.

726
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
I'm sorry.

727
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,840
I'm sorry.

728
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,840
I'm sorry.

729
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
I'm sorry.

730
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,840
I'm sorry.

731
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
I'm sorry.

732
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
I'm sorry.

733
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
I'm sorry.

734
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,840
I'm sorry.

735
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,840
I'm sorry.

736
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,840
I'm sorry.

737
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,840
