1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
characters provide naivete

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,640
илось for you.

3
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,920
Mai Dong is back.

4
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,460
We invite you to watch

5
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,580
Snow-slinger.

6
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,320
The Xins wrote

7
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,200
everything you saw

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,480
is the same as relevant?

9
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,680
Yes.

10
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,880
Why doesn't Yongzi

11
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,240
have anything to say?

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
Your Majesty,

13
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Second Prince sidewalk

14
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Is Yongcai's son.

15
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,300
Yongci should avoid him.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,640
Besides, he caused such a disaster.

17
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,800
Yongzi is really speechless to His Majesty.

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,320
If His Majesty wants to punish me,

19
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,480
then punish me.

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,480
Why should I punish you?

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,360
You have nothing to do with this.

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,000
Get up. Get up. Get up.

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,960
The second prince fled

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,240
and had nothing to do with Qin.

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
I can't blame him

27
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,280
for the flood.

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,160
But in this way,

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,040
Qin is in a state of confinement.

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,520
It's indeed inappropriate.

31
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,040
Now he's just married.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,240
He's been implicated by the second prince.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,520
How about this?

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,880
I'll allow him

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
to rest in the House of Marquis Zhongyong.

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,720
He can't go out without a edict.

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,640
I'll send a doctor to check him every day.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,120
Yongzi,

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm ungrateful to him

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
because you and he

41
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,000
are from the same clan.

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,720
But don't make it public

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,240
or else we'll have more troubles.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,080
Yes.

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
The Empress Dowager is not feeling well recently.

48
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,720
You can go to the Palace more often

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,160
to accompany her.

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,280
I will be with her more often.

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,600
Okay.

53
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,480
You may leave.

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,240
Your Highness. Please wait a minute.

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,640
I'll go in and tell everyone.

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,520
Why are you leaving?

57
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,920
I just feel strange.

58
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,600
His Majesty is too cold to Yan Che.

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,840
He is your only disciple.

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,240
Even if you hate him,

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,840
you shouldn't care about his whereabouts.

62
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,800
His Majesty can support you

63
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,360
but why does he have no contact

64
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,400
with his only disciple?

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,840
His Majesty may not be in contact with Qin Zhaoyu,

66
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,840
but Shi Enyu

67
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,000
used to be loyal to the second prince.

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
He has taken over the court.

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,520
If he wants to stabilize the court,

70
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,040
he won't let Yan Qi be the crown prince.

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,400
His Majesty may not really think so.

72
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,760
After all, he has Sui Ge.

73
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,240
But His Majesty is cold to Sui Ge.

74
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,800
It's strange.

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,960
His Majesty is cold to his own son.

76
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,280
But he is like a son

77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
in front of Yan Li.

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,040
I heard from the royal mother

79
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,200
that this was also after Consort Jin died.

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,400
Before that,

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,360
His Majesty has always been fond of Sui Ge.

82
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,120
Could it be that he is in a bad mood

83
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,400
because of Consort Jin's death?

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,240
I rarely go back to the capital recently.

85
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,640
If you have these thoughts,

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,240
you can ask the royal mother.

87
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,440
But

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,720
it's true that

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,520
after the death of Jin,

90
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,000
His Majesty is more suspicious of his father.

91
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,120
It seems that Consort Jin's death

92
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,280
is more complicated than we thought.

93
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,880
After Yan Qi dies,

94
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,880
I will investigate give you.

95
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,480
The Film Einsatzual Clarity

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,320
is still unknown.

97
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,360
There is more that concerns

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,200
this matter.

99
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,720
You better rumor in the palace.

100
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
Be alert.

101
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,640
Yes.

102
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,920
Princess Dowager's pulseлет mix is normal.

103
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,840
But she did not sleep well.

104
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,320
So I feel a bit strange.

105
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,240
I entered the palace in my tens of years.

106
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,040
So I thought

107
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,080
Yiling's death

108
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,480
to be the consort.

109
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,480
The palace has never been

110
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,520
at its peak.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
It's just a walk in the park.

112
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,920
She can't scare me.

113
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,880
Grandmother,

114
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,200
if you could make another choice

115
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,560
as you wish,

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,760
would you still be willing to be the consort?

117
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,280
Everyone has their own troubles

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,800
in this world.

119
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,680
In my whole life,

120
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,720
I've only had two chances

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
to follow my own heart.

122
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,000
I still don't know

123
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,720
whether it's right or wrong.

124
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,480
But if it's your own decision,

125
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,960
there's no blame.

126
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,480
Even if it's my own decision,

127
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,080
it might not be the result I want.

128
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,240
It's just a coincidence.

129
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,880
Just like my sister Ba.

130
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,680
If it wasn't for His Majesty's grace,

131
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,640
I'm afraid she'll be

132
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,000
alone in the forbidden garden for the rest of her life.

133
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,040
Just try to start over.

134
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,120
Waner,

135
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,400
I'm telling you

136
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,320
not to Multundian

137
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,280
your problems in the palace.

138
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,840
Just close the door

139
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,480
and live your life.

140
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
I'm just a little溜

141
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,560
so I can go far as I want.

142
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,320
I'll keep that in mind.

143
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,000
Go and entertain自zhen

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,720
I'm looking forward to seeing you every day.

145
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,680
Yes.

146
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,920
Did you get any news from Chuan?

147
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,320
Will His Majesty...

148
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,360
I saw the second prince leaving the palace.

149
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,240
The one who followed him

150
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,000
should be the one who took care of the Ninth Prince.

151
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
His Majesty promised you

152
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,320
that he wouldn't hurt the second prince.

153
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,480
You just thought about it.

154
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,200
Since last night,

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,600
he hasn't come to see me.

156
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,440
He is blaming me

157
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,720
for begging for Chuan.

158
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,360
If I had known

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,720
he was so determined,

160
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,160
I...

161
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,080
Your Majesty,

162
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,160
His Majesty is old enough to know the fate.

163
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,280
He is in a big court.

164
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,080
How can he still

165
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
come to see you every day?

166
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,120
If my son...

167
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,880
Your Majesty.

168
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,280
Fine.

169
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,480
I won't say anything.

170
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,800
I won't say anything.

171
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,840
Father.

172
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,880
His Majesty allowed Yu'er to go home and recuperate.

173
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,720
What is His Majesty trying to do?

174
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,600
Shut up.

175
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,560
Yu'er.

176
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,560
Yu'er is coming back?

177
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,360
Go and clean up

178
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,480
Yu'er's yard.

179
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,280
My Lord.

180
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,520
Yu'er is back.

181
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,760
Is she still the Consort Chu?

182
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,960
The second prince has left.

183
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,080
Where is the Consort Chu?

184
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,280
My poor daughter.

185
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,800
Hurry up.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,240
Send your wife back to her room.

187
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,720
Yes.

188
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,440
Madam.

189
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,640
Let's go, Madam.

190
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,280
You are old enough.

191
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Why are you still

192
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,720
so impatient?

193
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,520
I was too careless.

194
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,520
But Father.

195
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,240
The honor of the Zhongyong Mansion

196
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,640
is all in the Eastern Palace.

197
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,400
Nonsense.

198
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,040
The lives of all of us

199
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,280
are in His Majesty's hands.

200
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,760
His Majesty allowed Yu'er to come back

201
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
to warn us

202
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,880
not to get involved in this.

203
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
If we doubt it again,

204
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,000
His Majesty will kill us all.

205
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,000
Father,

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,440
are you willing to sit and wait?

207
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,000
Everyone in the court knows

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,720
you are the leader of the Crown Prince.

209
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
His Majesty will never

210
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
put you in the position of the Crown Prince.

211
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,440
Father.

212
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,640
Are you going to

213
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,600
watch us

214
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,560
work hard

215
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,640
to get the position?

216
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,320
It's not too late.

217
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's send the North Office to the Crown Prince

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
to stop the Crown Prince.

219
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,400
You are a traitor.

220
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,840
The position of the Qin family

221
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,520
is all because of Zhongyong.

222
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
If we don't have loyalty,

223
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
how can we take advantage of the court?

224
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,160
De ada.

225
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,200
A wastewater family

226
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,000
can kill

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
incense and Martyra.

228
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,680
A?...

229
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Madam.

230
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
Madam.

231
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,760
Madam.

232
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,040
什麼事啊?

233
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,760
Trying to...

234
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,520
Sister.

235
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,560
What's wrong?

236
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,640
Are you unhappy?

237
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
I miss my mother.

238
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,600
Come here.

239
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,480
Sui Ge.

240
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,760
Your mother and father

241
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,280
have passed away.

242
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,760
I think when they are alive,

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,840
you should talk to the stars in the sky.

244
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,040
It will make you feel better.

245
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,120
Do you believe they are in the sky?

246
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,840
I do.

247
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,120
Although I don't know

248
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,560
if there are any fairies in the sky,

249
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,440
my mother was fierce

250
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,520
when she scolded me and my father.

251
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
But I know

252
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,600
they are the people who love me the most in this world.

253
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,640
Wherever they are now,

254
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,360
they will hope that I can be as happy and safe as before.

255
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,720
But I don't have a father.

256
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,600
I only have a father.

257
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,440
What's that?

258
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,360
Get us some snacks.

259
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,840
Yes.

260
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,440
Sui Ge.

261
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,160
Sui Ge.

262
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,960
Sui Ge.

263
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,800
Sui Ge.

264
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,880
Do you believe me?

265
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I believe you.

266
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,560
Then let me tell you,

267
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
I never spoke or wrote before.

268
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
It's all a fake.

269
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,080
What happened?

270
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,680
Why did you pretend to be like that?

271
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,400
Because I saw

272
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,160
that Father killed my mother.

273
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,440
How could I have seen that?

274
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,880
You pretended to be stupid

275
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,520
because you were afraid of being known by His Majesty.

276
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,880
Father used to treat me

277
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,520
as he treated Brother Li.

278
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,280
But since that day,

279
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,200
Father has always been dark

280
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,840
when he saw me with my eyes.

281
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,080
Father's temper is getting worse.

282
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,160
If he knew that, he would kill me.

283
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,040
Sister-in-law, believe me.

284
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,200
Sister-in-law, believe me.

285
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Sui Ge, don't worry.

286
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,480
Your brother and I will protect you.

287
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,600
Grandmother said

288
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,560
you are the best dancer in the Zhou Dynasty.

289
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,000
I will tell you everything.

290
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,000
Can you and Brother Qi help me?

291
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,720
I don't want Mother and Brother Jin

292
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,040
to die in vain.

293
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Sister-in-law, I promise you.

294
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,360
That day,

295
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,280
I was supposed to

296
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,400
attend the official banquet of the backyard

297
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
with my brothers.

298
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,400
Brother Jin made an appointment with me

299
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,400
and wanted to give me a gift.

300
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,760
But I don't like

301
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,240
the banquet of adults.

302
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,000
So I pretended not to go.

303
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,840
I went to the Han Guang Hall

304
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,360
to see Mother's collection.

305
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,200
At that time,

306
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,920
Father and Mother came back in advance.

307
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,560
So I hid behind the curtain.

308
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,680
I want to ask you.

309
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Where did you get this book?

310
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,840
What are you up to?

311
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,240
Your Majesty, please tell me

312
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
why your handwriting

313
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,440
is different from the one in the book.

314
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,080
Didn't I tell you?

315
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,640
I was hurt before.

316
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
I hurt my back and my arms.

317
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,640
My handwriting will change naturally.

318
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,600
I've never seen Father

319
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
in such a state of exhaustion.

320
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,320
He was so scared.

321
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,600
Sui Ge, Brother Jin is here.

322
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,760
Go and call the imperial doctor.

323
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,960
You don't know anything.

324
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,280
Don't tell anyone.

325
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,120
Don't say anything.

326
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,520
Your Highness.

327
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Your Highness.

328
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,880
It's all my fault.

329
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
If I had rushed out,

330
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,920
Mother wouldn't have died.

331
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,280
If I hadn't forgotten

332
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,920
the promise with Brother Jin,

333
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,400
Brother Jin wouldn't have suffered.

334
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Don't think so.

335
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,000
Sui Ge, remember.

336
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,200
Your mother's death has nothing to do with you.

337
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,240
I promise you

338
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
that your brother and I

339
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,640
will find out

340
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,440
why His Majesty killed your mother.

341
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,200
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

342
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,200
Be good.

343
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
What's the matter?

344
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,680
You're reading the chess book again?

345
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

346
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,640
Your Highness.

347
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,520
As you said,

348
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,000
I can only do these things.

349
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,720
I wonder what you're here for.

350
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,880
I'll just...

351
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,600
It's okay. Give me the key.

352
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
I'll go by myself.

353
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

354
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,720
You're old.

355
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,760
Just rest.

356
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

357
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,280
These chess books are all for the king.

358
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,080
Why do you need to do it yourself?

359
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,880
Your Highness, you don't know.

360
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
These chess books

361
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,800
are not made by the family,

362
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,240
but by His Majesty's favorite.

363
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,680
Why does His Majesty

364
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,440
like the books that children read?

365
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,400
His Majesty is a genius

366
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,040
in chess.

367
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,560
He often says that the fundamental of chess

368
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,720
is the most obvious principle.

369
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,320
It's always the same.

370
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,120
These chess books

371
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,920
have made His Majesty

372
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,680
the best player in the world.

373
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,160
Is His Majesty

374
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,400
deliberately losing to the Empress Dowager

375
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,440
and the Princess Royal?

376
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,880
I guess His Majesty

377
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,440
is being filial.

378
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,040
Unfortunately, His Majesty is busy with the government.

379
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,920
He can't play chess

380
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,200
and doesn't need to learn the art of chess.

381
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,760
Since I was transferred here,

382
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,120
Xuan Ji Pavilion

383
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
hasn't received

384
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,360
His Majesty's treasure for a long time.

385
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Thank you, Master.

386
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Please.

387
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Brother Qi.

388
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,080
What's wrong?

389
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,960
Help me get the top one.

390
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
The top one.

391
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,640
Which one?

392
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,800
The corner one.

393
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,840
This one?

394
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,680
It seems that His Majesty

395
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,960
hasn't been here for a long time.

396
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,240
Otherwise, the maids

397
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,400
wouldn't dare to be so modern.

398
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,720
This is the last time

399
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,600
I've been with my mother

400
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,800
to Xuan Ji Pavilion.

401
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,160
I've been looking for it

402
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,280
since I was a child.

403
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,560
Brother,

404
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,480
do you know who wrote this?

405
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,760
Mother said

406
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,160
this is the last treasure

407
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
that was in front of His Majesty.

408
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,080
It was not easy to find it.

409
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,840
These two characters are the same.

410
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,720
The printed letters on it

411
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,240
are His Majesty's private words,

412
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,360
but they are different

413
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,400
from the characters on His Majesty's bamboo flute.

414
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,280
His Majesty's bamboo flute

415
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,680
is smooth and sharp,

416
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
sharp and sharp.

417
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,400
It's not as smooth as this.

418
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,880
Brother Qi,

419
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,640
this is the day when my mother was in trouble.

420
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,160
I found it in the post

421
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,000
of Mother.

422
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,440
It seems that

423
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,680
it was also written by my father.

424
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,680
The handwriting is like the first one.

425
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,160
Sui Ge,

426
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,120
does His Majesty know that you have this note?

427
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,240
I don't know.

428
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,680
I've never told anyone.

429
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,280
Sui Ge,

430
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
go over there and play.

431
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,280
I have something to tell your brother.

432
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,800
The book that Jin Fei

433
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,280
called the murder

434
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,720
must have been cleared by His Majesty.

435
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,000
I also need to compare

436
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,760
the ink and the treasure

437
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
in the previous emperor's time

438
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,720
to find out the real reason

439
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,960
why His Majesty killed Jin Fei.

440
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,960
If it made sense to let Sui Ge say so,

441
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,600
then it can be confirmed

442
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,800
that Prince Jin

443
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,000
was posing this up

444
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,640
to cover up Jin Fei's murder

445
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,240
and fake it.

446
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,840
In the past,

447
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,120
those who denounced him

448
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,160
for lack of grass-幹

449
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,520
would have caused panic

450
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,280
and win him over

451
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,320
because he was effqual stressful.

452
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,360
So,

453
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,640
the court has always

454
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,800
put this incident

455
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,680
as a trap to腐敗 the people.

456
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,760
But His Majesty has given us an open

457
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,120
enough evidence

458
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,760
Lord Jin is very open-minded.

459
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,680
If he tells others that

460
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,040
he killed Consort Jin,

461
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,120
he might lead the eunuchs

462
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,240
to impeach His Majesty

463
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,120
and break the law.

464
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,080
He might lead the court to be in chaos.

465
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,360
Therefore,

466
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,800
His Majesty will definitely hide the truth.

467
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,920
The King of Qin only knows that

468
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,480
Consort Jin died in the hands of His Majesty.

469
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,080
He doesn't know the truth.

470
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,720
My father and he

471
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,160
never talked about it.

472
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,200
He must be afraid that it will cause a riot

473
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,280
and destroy the court.

474
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,680
He can take Song Xiwen's body

475
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,880
and send it to Lord Jin's residence.

476
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,320
He must know the truth.

477
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,720
He is willing to tell His Majesty about it.

478
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm afraid it will be a riot.

479
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,720
Then Her Majesty must know the truth.

480
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,440
In order to stabilize the riot,

481
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,400
she will kill Song Xiwen

482
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,280
and cause a riot for His Majesty.

483
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,800
No wonder Yan Che

484
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
will be promoted to the Crown Prince

485
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,400
after this incident.

486
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,040
Her Majesty and His Majesty

487
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,400
have already reached an agreement.

488
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,960
Everything Her Majesty did

489
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,760
was to make Yan Che

490
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,200
succeed the throne.

491
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,680
But she never thought

492
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,760
that His Majesty hates to be over-reacted.

493
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,880
She even let His Majesty find a chance

494
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,480
to abolish them.

495
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,200
She is pitiful.

496
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,120
What if Yan Che

497
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,160
tries to rise again after he runs away?

498
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,360
If it goes as we have guessed,

499
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,640
Yan Che

500
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,600
was released on purpose by His Majesty.

501
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,440
I hope he won't fall into Lord Cheng's hands.

502
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,280
Otherwise, he will be killed.

503
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,400
Then who

504
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,320
will come here

505
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,920
to help Yan talks Ga Schools

506
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,400
toley ....

507
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,360
want to do this to me?

508
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,360
Could

509
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
the Yi Family

510
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,080
actually do this to me?

511
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,120
Then this indeed

512
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,840
can be primoed to.

513
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,640
His Majesty

514
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,680
is just too carefree.

515
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,440
I don't know

516
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,260
Hu Ihrei is a B Kanye 살짝 150m high.

517
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,820
If he had survived before...

518
00:21:45,980 --> 00:22:05,820
He'd have gotten himself some of those

519
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,840
vídeo first.

520
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:31,420
Its

521
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,440
to become the new emperor.

522
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,040
I'm the Crown Prince ofozheng, Yan Che.

523
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,240
How dare you!

524
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,480
You don't deserve to be a crown prince.

525
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,720
Yan Qi,

526
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,480
what do you want?

527
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
Brother,

528
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,960
this is Beimang Mountain.

529
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,320
So is it.

530
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,360
I've lost my life because of you.

531
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,320
Are you going to kill me, your brother?

532
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,840
This is a clear and clean land.

533
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,720
This land is really suitable for you.

534
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,560
I'm your brother.

535
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,320
Am I not good enough?

536
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,440
Shameless.

537
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,640
Do you think you can take the crown

538
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
after killing my uncle and me?

539
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,120
Dream on!

540
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,600
Yan Qi.

541
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,360
I'll go.

542
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,920
You're defying the human rule.

543
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,120
How could father...

544
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,940
Zhang Zu Yun

545
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,800
Go, To the ¿ angles

546
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,300
The Crown Prince was banished

547
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,540
from the palace.

548
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,620
He wanted to rebel

549
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,020
with the Northern Army.

550
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,900
After being 곡Nied-on,

551
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,540
and cannot face the enemy,

552
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,480
I will

553
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,300
Quai

554
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,360
myself.

555
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,460
Revert to the City!

556
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,940
Revert to the City!

557
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,180
How about

558
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,860
Emperorbait?

559
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,640
Revert to the City!

560
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,600
Revert to the City!

561
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,740
Ser�를

562
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,580
Empress Dowager

563
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,580
Crown Prince has passed away!

564
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
My son

565
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,580
It's all my fault

566
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,580
I shouldn't have been so harsh on him

567
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,580
I shouldn't have let him leave the palace

568
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,580
I wanted him to be free

569
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,580
But he didn't want to

570
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,580
I wanted him to be free

571
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,580
But he didn't want to

572
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,580
I wanted him to be free

573
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:42,580
But now he treats me like a black hair

574
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
Please be safe, your majesty

575
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,580
Be careful of your body

576
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
Second brother will be worried

577
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,580
My son

578
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
My son

579
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
Father

580
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,580
Father

581
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,580
Don't blame yourself

582
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,580
It's all my fault

583
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,580
I didn't stop you from going to the dead end

584
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,580
I'm willing to take all the blame

585
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,580
Please take care of yourself, father

586
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,580
How does it concern you?

587
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,580
How does it concern you?

588
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,580
I miss you so much

589
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,580
What can you do?

590
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Get up, my son

591
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,580
Thank you, father

592
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
My son

593
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
I'll leave now

594
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
I won't disturb you

595
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
My son

596
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,580
Your highness, please wait

597
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,580
I have something to report

598
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,580
That hairpin is so beautiful

599
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,580
I found it

600
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,580
That's the gift for you

601
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,580
Qi Lang

602
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,580
Qi Lang

603
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
You're here

604
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
Qi Lang

605
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
Tell me the truth

606
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Do you believe that

607
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,580
I'm the son of the late emperor?

608
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,580
If you can't do it

609
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
I can't do it

610
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
Of course I can't

611
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,580
I'm weak

612
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,580
If I'm not forced

613
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,580
How can I find my own way?

614
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,580
I

615
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,580
I order you and Yongci

616
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,580
to find out the cause of my son's death

617
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,580
You must find it out for me

618
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,580
Give my son a clear report

619
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
Yes, your majesty

620
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,580
Mother

621
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,580
My son

622
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,580
Madam, let's go back to the yard

623
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,580
The princess doesn't allow us to come to the garden

624
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
Be smart

625
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,580
She can't be the princess

626
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
She can't be my mistress

627
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,580
You bitch, what are you talking about?

628
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,580
Come

629
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,580
Throw this bitch into the water

630
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,580
How dare you

631
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Why can't I?

632
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,580
Remember

633
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,580
Even if I'm not punished

634
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,580
I'm the princess you ordered

635
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,580
You're just a bitch

636
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,580
You bitch

637
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,580
Do it

638
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
Let me go

639
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,580
She is a bitch

640
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,580
But in my eyes

641
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,580
You're worse than a bitch

642
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,580
Your highness

643
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,580
You beat me without her

644
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,580
Heng Chenbi

645
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
I can spare your life

646
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,580
But I'll divorce you

647
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,580
Go back and tell your father

648
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,580
From now on

649
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,580
Your family will stop wanting to take you from me

650
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,580
Understand?

651
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
Your highness

652
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Your highness

653
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,580
There's nothing to see here

654
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,580
Let's go

655
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Your highness

656
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,580
Your highness

657
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
Our palace is the head of the palace

658
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Your family is close to our family

659
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,580
You're so proud of each other

660
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Why are you so embarrassed?

661
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Who is proud of you?

662
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,580
Now the palace has the glory and wealth

663
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,580
All of them are our sons

664
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,580
They are working for you in the palace

665
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,580
I'm the only prince of the emperor

666
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,580
The prince of the past

667
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Entering the palace

668
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,580
Is only a matter of time

669
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,580
But Feng's family

670
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,580
How can they be considered as the mother of the country?

671
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,580
Your highness

672
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,580
If you want to be a great man in the future

673
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Then take the divorce letter

674
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,580
And send your daughter to rest at home

675
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
If you still want to be a man

676
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
I, prince Cheng

677
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,580
Will not let you be a man

678
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
Yanqi, you bastard

679
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
Father

680
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,580
Go to the imperial concubine and tell her you love her

681
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,580
Shut up

682
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,580
You still think you're not ashamed?

683
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,580
Daughter

684
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,580
The imperial concubine does love you

685
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,580
But she is the mother of prince Cheng

686
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
Who do you think she will help?

687
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,580
Then mother will believe I'm being bullied by prince Cheng?

688
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
Who told you to be angry?

689
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,580
If you had been pregnant

690
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,580
How could you let that bitch stand in the way?

691
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,580
It's so embarrassing

692
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,580
How can a child be pregnant just by saying it?

693
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,580
The imperial concubine is in the palace

694
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,580
The palace is so grand

695
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,580
Yanqi is the only one

696
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,580
How do you know about the palace?

697
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,580
These years

698
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,580
His majesty often gave the medicine to the imperial concubine

699
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,580
He said he would help her to live a long life

700
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,580
The imperial concubine never changes her words

701
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,580
But if she eats too much of the royal elixir

702
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,580
She will be too unborn

703
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,580
Why doesn't his majesty allow the imperial concubine to be pregnant?

704
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,580
Hush

705
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
You just need to remember

706
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,580
The royal family has always been kind and kind

707
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,580
Only to preserve your own glory and wealth

708
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,580
Is the most important

709
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
Prince Cheng was kidnapped and self-reliant

710
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
But he didn't have the blood

711
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
He was kidnapped after he died

712
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,580
There are many bruises on the chest

713
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,580
This wound is the only fatal injury

714
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
When a person is self-reliant

715
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
He will have pain or fear

716
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
He will suffocate when he is alive

717
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
So the strength in his hand will be reduced

718
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,580
The wound should be deep and shallow

719
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,580
But the wound of the second prince is shallow

720
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:57,420
It can be seen that the

721
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
The second prince is so shallow

722
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,420
Not to mention such a small wound

723
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,420
What are you going to do?

724
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,420
Follow the water and push the boat

725
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,420
Follow the wind

726
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,420
I have something important to report

727
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,420
Please tell me

728
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,420
The death of the second prince is a national matter

729
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,420
It can't be done so quickly

730
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,420
Just because of the death of the second prince

731
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,420
I beg your majesty to hand this case to the Dali Temple

732
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,420
Li Muyun, what do you mean?

733
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,420
There were dozens of people in the army at that time

734
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
What is my death?

735
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,420
Your majesty

736
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,420
I am going to the capital to bring Zheng Baishi

737
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,420
To discuss the death of Li Siqing

738
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,420
Zheng Baishi

739
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,420
What do you mean?

740
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,420
Zheng Baishi

741
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,420
You are colluding with Li Muyun

742
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,420
You are framing me

743
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,420
Your highness, you are wrong

744
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,420
I just agree with Li Siqing's case

745
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,420
Why do you say collusion?

746
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,420
King of Rui is here

747
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,420
I have something important to report

748
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
Your majesty

749
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,420
After the examination of Princess Yongci

750
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,420
The second prince Yanche died not by himself

751
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,420
But by being cut by someone

752
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,420
Nonsense

753
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,420
Huang Xue died by himself with a dagger

754
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
According to the wound

755
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,420
The weapon is a long knife

756
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,420
Not the dagger on the left hand of Prince Cheng

757
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,420
I have secretly prepared it

758
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,420
I have secretly prepared it

759
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,420
I have secretly prepared it

760
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,420
I have secretly prepared it

761
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,420
The dagger on the left hand of Prince Cheng

762
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,420
I have secretly prepared it

763
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,420
The wound of the second prince

764
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,420
Is exactly the same as the dagger on the right hand of Prince Cheng

765
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,420
Nonsense

766
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,420
Father, he is framing

767
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,420
I

768
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,420
Asked you to find the second prince

769
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
Why

770
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,420
To help your brother's family

771
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,420
Cut off his throat

772
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
Father

773
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,420
Because

774
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Because he

775
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Because he didn't come back with me

776
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
So I ordered someone to kidnap him

777
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,420
So I ordered someone to kidnap him

778
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
He caught my dagger in one fell swoop

779
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,420
Nonsense

780
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
Your majesty

781
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,420
The second prince

782
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,420
He died unjustly

783
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
Your majesty

784
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Prince Cheng has long been

785
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,420
The ambition to take the crown

786
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,420
He is the only adult prince of your majesty

787
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
He has long regarded the throne as a burden

788
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,420
He even said

789
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,420
Feng's daughter is not worthy of being the queen

790
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,420
He insisted on breaking off ties with my Chinese government

791
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,420
Prince Cheng's brother's evidence is certain

792
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,420
Your majesty can't be too careful

793
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,420
Your majesty

794
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
Cheng

795
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,420
Cheng'en Wang Yanqi

796
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,420
You are really

797
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,420
Violent

798
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,420
Only to take the throne

799
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,420
Kill the chief

800
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,420
Take the throne

801
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
Your majesty is wise

802
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
Your majesty is wise

803
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,420
Who dares

804
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Who dares

805
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
You guys

806
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,420
You guys

807
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,620
You guys

808
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,420
You guys

809
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,420
afraid

810
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,420
It turned out to be my father

811
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,420
Liar

812
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,420
It was you

813
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,140
Why did you lie to me?

814
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,220
Wujia.

815
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,860
Why did you lie to me?

816
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,620
It's the opposite.

817
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,980
From today on,

818
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,740
Yan Qi will be sent to the Imperial Court

819
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,860
and all lives will be sent to the Imperial Court.

820
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:06,980
Go.

821
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,180
Father.

822
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,980
Why did you lie to me?

823
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,540
My brother is your only adult prince.

824
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,140
It's over.

825
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,660
Father.

826
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,420
Your Majesty.

827
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,340
Your Majesty.

828
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,940
Please, Your Majesty.

829
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,140
My son.

830
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,380
My son.

831
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,140
Brother Qi.

832
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,140
How is His Majesty?

833
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,460
The imperial doctor said His Majesty suffered from a stroke.

834
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,940
He needs to rest more.

835
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,140
Brother.

836
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,400
Shall we go and beg His Majesty

837
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,640
to let us go to the capital?

838
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,180
I've had enough of the court.

839
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,180
My headNE ever j widely Disgusting.

840
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,340
It's too picky.

841
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,900
Kick out if you want.

842
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,300
I still have something to take care of.

843
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,900
What is it?

844
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,220
Why don't I know?

845
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,220
I'll tell you after I am settled.

846
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,980
No!!

847
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,060
You do not have the right to tell me your件.

848
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,140
But neither can you!

849
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,420
I don't know anything about this Pимиoli.

850
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,660
The full stations must defend for everyone.

851
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,820
He is a powerful man.

852
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,660
and be statesman.

853
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,340
You and I

854
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,860
are blood brothers.

855
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,820
So let us

856
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,420
work together

857
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,460
to stay forever.

858
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,260
Yan Qi!

859
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,740
You worked over times.

860
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,100
Do you have to explain it to His Majesty?

861
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,780
It's not wrong for me to serve you.

862
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,820
Just save your trouble.

863
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,340
You're watching a play.

864
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,580
Get your hands on it.

865
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,020
Greetings, King of Rui.

866
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,540
Please allow me to speak.

867
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,540
I have a few words

868
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,220
to say to the people of Yan.

869
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:24,820
Why do days and nights turn around

870
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,860
but I still have to light up your light

871
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,620
Like a flower, it's moving in the snow

872
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,500
So cold, so warm

873
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:51,980
If true love falls into the chill

874
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:58,860
the snow falls, my body fries

875
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:05,740
If Asleep Love will be asulus

876
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:12,180
As background as the same night

877
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:18,700
Open your heart, love doesn't matter the deep sea

878
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:25,740
Please grant me courage, let fate be open

879
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:32,580
Don't be afraid of the starlight being covered by the moonlight

880
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,800
The stars will shine outside the sky

881
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,100
Just as the night flow1

882
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,800
Is the starlight's color
