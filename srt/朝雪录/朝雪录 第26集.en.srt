[Coroner's Diary]

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,950
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,509
I think

4
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,590
Li Muyun may have figured out who I am.

5
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,310
There's a tactic in warfare called
"startling the snake by striking the grass."

6
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,910
He has never seen you before.

7
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,039
Even if he grew suspicious
during the autopsy,

8
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,350
he has no proof.

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,250
But if you really react,

10
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,970
you'll fall into his trap.

11
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,530
I nearly ruined everything
over something so small.

12
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,090
I still lack patience.

13
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,260
You've done very well already.

14
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,530
If it were me,

15
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,199
I might've killed him
on impulse and caused a disaster.

16
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,740
You wouldn't.

17
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,690
You're the most cautious person I know.

18
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,750
You never do anything
you're not certain about.

19
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,340
But since returning to the capital,

20
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,950
I'm facing more and more uncertainties.

21
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,860
Because of your father?

22
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,770
He won't listen to me.

23
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,590
How can I be certain?

24
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,060
What worries me now

25
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,990
is Prince Jin and Lord Shen's case.

26
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,310
I went to the Ministry of Justice
to find the files,

27
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,910
but they've all been sealed.

28
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,579
It seems this matter

29
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,140
is far more complicated than we imagined.

30
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,180
Today, when I saw

31
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,250
Li Muyun mention my father,

32
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,090
he showed no guilt at all.

33
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,340
I thought he was shameless,

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,530
and I was furious.

35
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,820
But now that I think about it,

36
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,970
what if he really has nothing
to be ashamed of?

37
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,320
What if he really just did
what he was supposed to do?

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,450
What if my father...

39
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,530
really did help Prince Jin...

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,570
Wan,

41
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,900
stop overthinking it.

42
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,050
We've just returned.

43
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,370
We need to establish ourselves
in the Ministry of Justice before we can act.

44
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,130
Trust me—

45
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,780
the truth will come out sooner or later.

46
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,940
We'll uncover it,

47
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,410
step

48
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,810
by step.

49
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,690
Prince Sui can speak now.

50
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,310
Once his mind is more settled,

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,130
I'll ask if he

52
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,329
remembers anything about Consort Jin.

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,500
Alright.

54
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,950
Don't think about these things anymore.

55
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,220
You've worked hard these days.
You should get some rest.

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,060
The Ministry of Justice prison

57
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,990
isn't exactly a comfortable place
for questioning.

58
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,970
Come on, Your Highness!

59
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,620
Come on! Where are you?

60
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,740
The show is going to begin!

61
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
Over here!

62
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,850
Over here?

63
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,020
I got you!

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,060
I'm too tired to play.

65
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,300
You guys catch me now.

66
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,180
Coming, Sir.

67
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,270
It feels good.

68
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,210
Give my shoulders a massage.

69
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,140
What's going on?

70
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,030
Weren't you supposed to catch me?

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,830
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,659
Why are you crying?

73
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,080
Which bastard bullied you?

74
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,020
I'll take him down right now!

75
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,060
It was you, you bastard!

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,880
I thought you were dead.

77
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,800
How could I be dead?

78
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,920
The other day,

79
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,880
someone was killed at Fengqi House.

80
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,690
It was a brutal death!

81
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,540
So,

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,040
you thought it was me?

83
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,670
I've been looking everywhere for you.

84
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,670
I went to Fengqi House
and Prince Yi's Mansion

85
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,250
but couldn't find you.

86
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,060
I heard Chi was investigating the case,

87
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,400
so I rushed over.

88
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,860
It turned out

89
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,090
Little Wan'er was performing the autopsy.

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,430
The body really looked a lot like you.

91
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,620
It really looked like you.

92
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,540
Even if it wasn't you,

93
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,330
the officer said

94
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,659
the deceased spent every day in brothels.

95
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,890
What if...

96
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,450
the next one is you?

97
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,620
What if you really died?

98
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,740
What am I supposed to do?

99
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,810
If I really die,

100
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,420
I'll make sure you

101
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,000
stand at the front
of my funeral procession.

102
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,300
Fine.

103
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,770
I won't just stand at the front—

104
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,890
I'll perform the rites for you,

105
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,620

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,810
Zhang Dongxuan,

136
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,010
do you want to keep eating
braised lamb knuckles,

137
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,450
or wait here on death row for execution?

138
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,850
I only had one lamb knuckle
and you're already here to settle the score?

139
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,050
Your Highness,
don't you think that's a bit stingy?

140
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,660
As long as you tell me
everything you know,

141
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,520
I promise

142
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,679
you'll have lamb knuckles every day.

143
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,260
So it is a woman!

144
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,230
Your Highness,

145
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,539
am I accurate?

146
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,190
You guessed she was a woman
just because you were told

147
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,000
to wash up before meeting someone—

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,030
assuming only women
care about cleanliness.

149
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,900
Not at all.

150
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,590
It's not just women
who care about cleanliness.

151
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,120
All nobles do.

152
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,060
Besides, it's well known in the capital

153
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,920
that Lord Yan is cold and distant.

154
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,570
The fact that he came specially
to the prison

155
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,790
to order you to clean up
before meeting someone

156
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,900
shows that it must be someone he respects.

157
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,850
And apart from the Empress Dowager,
His Majesty, and Prince Rui,

158
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,660
the only one he'd be
this considerate toward

159
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,260
must be the woman he admires.

160
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,430
Am I right?

161
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,740
Princess Yongci really
lives up to her reputation.

162
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,430
I have another skill too.

163
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,950
Can you guess what it is?

164
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,910
You're even more ruthless

165
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,060
than Lord Yan, little lady!

166
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,120
Mr. Zhang, are you still refusing
to show your true face?

167
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,980
I've relied on this trick
for many years in my travels

168
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,220
without being exposed.

169
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,500
How did you see through it?

170
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,620
You know to use your ears
to locate people by their voices.

171
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,540
But if one pays close attention,

172
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,500
it's obvious you can sense changes
in light and shadow.

173
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,260
I advise you to stop using

174
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,020
this pupil-concealing technique.

175
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,610
It damages the meridians around the eyes.

176
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,410
Over time, it'll harm your vision.

177
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,910
You even know about
the pupil-concealing technique?

178
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,270
The successor of Medicine King Valley

179
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,460
is truly quite something.

180
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,900
Since you know Princess Yongci
comes from Medicine King Valley,

181
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,430
then you should understand

182
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,610
that she is the only one in this world

183
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,140
who can clear your name.

184
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,360
Then you have to tell me

185
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,250
whether the murder scene
of the flaying case in the capital

186
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,700
had the Black Unrighteous Flower symbol.

187
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,210
So far, the crime scene hasn't been found.

188
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,410
But there was a small amount of cinnabar

189
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,710
on the body and where it was dumped.

190
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,380
Are there any other similar cases?

191
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,470
Just this one.

192
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,790
It's similar to the Guanyin Town case.

193
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,210
Only one person has died.

194
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,380
Why did you come to me?

195
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,780
Go now. Leave.

196
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,380
Come back after more people have died.

197
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,310
Zhang Dongxuan,

198
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,980
it's fine if you want to profit from this.

199
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,580
But if you're treating lives like a game,

200
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,040
you'll die in this prison.

201
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,420
You haven't even found the crime scene.

202
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,540
How can you possibly
catch the real killer?

203
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,210
Besides,

204
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,260
only one person has died.

205
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,090
How is it connected to Guanyin Town?

206
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,850
You have to find a new similar case

207
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,900
to link it to the old one.

208
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,730
Should we just sit back

209
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,610
and wait for innocent people to die?

210
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,850
We must not only investigate the case

211
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,060
but also stop the killings.

212
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,020
Only by knowing
the killer's plan in advance

213
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,950
can we save lives

214
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,260
instead of just collecting bodies.

215
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,300
Your Highness,

216
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,450
feel free to ask
whatever you want to know.

217
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,310
Six years ago,

218
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,160
why were you involved
in those three cases in Guanyin Town?

219
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,090
Do you know

220
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,810
why Minister Shen believed

221
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,900
I wasn't the real culprit back then?

222
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,350
Because before the murders happened,

223
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,920
I was already practically a broken man.

224
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,280
Your Majesty.

225
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,420
Greetings, Father.

226
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,140
Golden petals with spring cold.

227
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,360
Among yellow flowers are many kinds.

228
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,600
You tell the traveler on the road,

229
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,090
don't mistake the winter jasmine

230
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,390
for the mustard flower.

231
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,490
Very well.

232
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,260
Crown Prince, in your eyes,

233
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,720
who is the winter jasmine,

234
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,090
and who is the mustard flower?

235
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,420
Father,

236
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,690
while walking in the garden today,

237
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,780
I noticed that
among all the flowering trees,

238
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,600
only the winter jasmine
dared to rival the red plum blossoms.

239
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,570
I got inspired for a moment

240
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,370
and wrote an old verse on it.

241
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,490
I didn't think too much of it.

242
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,850
Since you had the leisure

243
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,500
to stroll in the garden,

244
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,860
I assume the horrifying

245
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,900
flaying case

246
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,420
has been resolved?

247
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,020
Chi and Wan have gone
to investigate under your orders.

248
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,680
Do you know where they are now?

249
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,120
They should still be investigating.

250
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,320
Have you personally read

251
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,380
the case file?

252
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,540
I was planning to do it tomorrow…

253
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,490
Tomorrow again!

254
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
What a "tomorrow."

255
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,850
While you were out

256
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,950
enjoying yourself today,

257
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,810
Chi had already found a clue
in the case files.

258
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,590
Right now, he and Wan

259
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,810
are at the Ministry of Justice prison,

260
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,410
interrogating the suspect
from Guanyin Town.

261
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,450
It's...

262
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,450
I...

263
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,310
It's precisely because
you are the Crown Prince

264
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,560
that I entrusted the capital's security

265
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,310
to you.

266
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,850
And now, three major crimes
have happened under your watch,

267
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,610
yet you remain so negligent.

268
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,090
You're truly

269
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,210
unworthy of your title!

270
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,170
Father, please don't be angry.

271
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,140
I was wrong.

272
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,920
If you look down on the task

273
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,210
I gave you that much,

274
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,140
then just stay in the palace

275
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,300
and enjoy being

276
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
a cultured man of leisure.

277
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,360
Father.

278
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,150
Father, I was wrong.

279
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,940
Please give me another chance.

280
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,070
I will certainly be diligent
in my duties from now on.

281
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,670
Your Highness!

282
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,890
You hit the bullseye!

283
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,420
Your Highness, you never miss a shot.

284
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,620
Impressive archery!

285
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,950
Who do you think is better at archery,

286
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,780
me or Yan Chi?

287
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,690
I've never seen Lord Yan shoot.

288
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,980
But when it comes to archery,

289
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,580
you're definitely the best.

290
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,620
This Yan Chi

291
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,300
is the most cunning of all.

292
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,650
Without a real challenge,

293
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,600
it's impossible to gauge
his true abilities.

294
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,210
Your Highness, you don't need to worry.

295
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,050
Soldiers earn respect
through military merit.

296
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,970
Since Lord Yan has been appointed
to the Ministry of Justice,

297
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,210
it won't be long

298
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,660
before he has no place

299
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,040
in Shuoxi Army.

300
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,780
By then,

301
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,300
you will surely

302
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,900
take his place.

303
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,660
Your Highness,
the Noble Consort has sent a message.

304
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,690
Does Aunt have important matters
to tell you?

305
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,540
Tell the messenger I've received it.

306
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,940
Tell my mother not to worry too much

307
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,600
and to take good care of Father.

308
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,290
Yes.

309
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,190
Your Highness.

310
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,060
Aunt is just

311
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,050
worried about you.

312
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,500
The Crown Prince

313
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,430
has been confined by His Majesty.

314
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,000
His position in the capital prefecture

315
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,490
is probably lost.

316
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,940
Aunt must want you to compete

317
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,450
for the Crown Prince's post
in the capital prefecture.

318
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,180
Women in the harem
only care about that position.

319
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,610
I'm not that foolish.

320
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,690
Father is

321
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,810
sharp, formidable, and in his prime.

322
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,560
If I harbor inappropriate ambitions,

323
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,620
I'd be the first to be dealt with.

324
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,470
But I

325
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,730
underestimated that girl Qin Wan.

326
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,730
Turns out, the expert coroner
who helped the Crown Prince

327
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,190
solve the commoner's case

328
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,230
was her.

329
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,330
Your Highness,

330
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,380
no matter how capable she is,

331
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,950
she's still a woman.

332
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,090
If her reputation is ruined,

333
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,420
would she dare show her face again?

334
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,330
By then,

335
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,010
Yan Chi will naturally lose his support.

336
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,540
Good idea.

337
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,960
But remember,

338
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,140
don't act rashly.

339
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,900
Father and Chi value her highly.

340
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,730
You must find the right moment

341
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,130
before making your move.

342
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,250
Yes.

343
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,900
Qin Wan...

344
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,339
Interesting.

345
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,700
Che!

346
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,570
Get out!

347
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,030
-Yes.
-Yes.

348
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,450
Mother.

349
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,370
I have disappointed you.

350
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,990
You are the Crown Prince of the nation.

351
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,330
You must not speak
such defeatist words so easily.

352
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,060
I'm no longer the Crown Prince.

353
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,940
Father said I'm unworthy of this title

354
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,970
and not fit to be the heir.

355
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,860
Nonsense!

356
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,370
His Majesty only spoke in anger.

357
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,620
He never truly meant to depose you.

358
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,970
Mother,

359
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,160
I've never been

360
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,450
Father's preferred choice
for the Crown Prince.

361
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,050
If it weren't for protocol,

362
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,940
he would have deposed me long ago.

363
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
There's no "if."

364
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,580
You are the legitimate son of the Empress.

365
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,970
By birth and by right,

366
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,100
the Crown Prince title belongs to you.

367
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,850
As long as you fulfill your duties,

368
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,000
no one can seize your position—

369
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,420
not even your father.

370
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,010
Mother,

371
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,490
rather than letting Father

372
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,530
be disappointed time and again,

373
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,660
why don't we take this chance

374
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,490
to step down gracefully?

375
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,140
I...

376
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,380
Did it hurt?

377
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,900
I truly don't like these duties.

378
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,000
But

379
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,770
ever since you were born,

380
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,050
you've had no choice in this.

381
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,660
You think that not being the Crown Prince

382
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,860
means you can live as a carefree prince?

383
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,940
Throughout history,

384
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,270
deposed crown princes have only one fate—

385
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,580
death.

386
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,820
I don't want to hear this!

387
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,490
Very well.

388
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,430
You don't want to be the Crown Prince,
huh?

389
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:28,690
Here.

390
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,100
Mother, what are you doing?

391
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,180
Kill me first.

392
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,290
Are you crazy?

393
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:34,940
Do it!

394
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,970
Do it!

395
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,940
Mother!

396
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,750
Have you lost your mind?

397
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,140
Mother.

398
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,990
You can't do it, can you?

399
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,290
Then focus on being the Crown Prince

400
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,040
until the day you ascend the throne!

401
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,350
For the sake of the people,

402
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,290
you must take that position!

403
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,420
On the Double Third Festival,
we'll arrange a marriage for you.

404
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,210
Before then,

405
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,840
His Majesty will surely
lift your confinement.

406
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,370
Just focus on doing your job well.

407
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,140
Don't cause another scandal

408
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,400
that hands others leverage against you.

409
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,050
Yes, Mother.

410
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,900
The tissue around his wound
has severely contracted,

411
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,300
restricting blood flow.

412
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,660
His left chest muscle
has already atrophied—

413
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,120
it's been over five years.

414
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,860
I had this scar when I was arrested.

415
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,620
It's clearly recorded in the case file,

416
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,820
yet they still

417
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,100
locked me up as the killer.

418
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
With a scar that deep and long,

419
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,140
the damage has already reached
the nerves in his left arm.

420
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,580
There's no way he could carry out

421
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,840
such a complex method of murder
as skinning someone alive.

422
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,400
What if he only planned it,

423
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,690
and someone else did the killing?

424
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,350
What do you mean, little brat?

425
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,860
You treated me well, fed me nice food,

426
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,250
and promised to clear my name.

427
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,010
Now that you've seen my scar,

428
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,010
you're making up some story

429
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,450
about me having an accomplice?

430
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,340
If you're innocent,
why did you pretend to be blind?

431
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,050
If I don't pretend to be blind,

432
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,180
how could anyone believe I could see fate?

433
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,380
How would I make a living?

434
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,660
Then why did you keep pretending
after you were

435
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
thrown in
the Ministry of Justice prison?

436
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,210
Even blind,

437
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,010
I was regarded as a suspect.

438
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,290
If I could see,

439
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,620
wouldn't that make me even less credible?

440
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,620
So Lord Shen only agreed
to reopen your case

441
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,020
because you tricked him.

442
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,570
Nonsense!

443
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,940
Minister Shen has a keen eye for detail.

444
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,420
He questioned me because he found

445
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,490
inconsistencies

446
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,380
in the case file.

447
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,010
He even went to Guanyin Town himself
to investigate.

448
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,250
After confirming what I said,

449
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,290
he declared the case inconclusive.

450
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,290
Go read

451
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,970
his notes yourself—

452
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,050
or stop bothering me.

453
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,790
Unfortunately,

454
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,110
all the records he personally wrote
have disappeared.

455
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,290
No one knows what he discovered
in Guanyin Town,

456
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,040
or why

457
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,180
he labeled your case unresolved.

458
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,620
So that means

459
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,620
only by finding the real culprit
behind the capital's flaying case

460
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,020
can we reopen
the Guanyin Town murder case.

461
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,530
If you help us catch the real killer,

462
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,760
I will certainly clear your name.

463
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,010
Do you know

464
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,500
why I was considered

465
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,570
a suspect in the first place?

466
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,720
According to the previous files,

467
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,290
all three victims
in the Guanyin Town murder case

468
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,100
once came to you for fortune-telling.

469
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,860
Yes.

470
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,620
I never imagined

471
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,240
it would all lead to such a disaster.

472
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,970
Five years ago, I was setting up
a stall beside a temple

473
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,420
when I witnessed two brothers
quarrel with a pilgrim.

474
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,210
I didn't expect the younger brother
would get injured

475
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,900
and become paralyzed on one side.

476
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,140
Later, when I visited him,

477
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,580
I found his elder brother

478
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,790
had seized all his property.

479
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,750
I advised the elder brother to remember
their brotherly bond,

480
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,330
but he was angered
that I had exposed his scheme

481
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,680
and threw me out.

482
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,800
How dare you hit me!

483
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,660
So what?

484
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,100
Looking for trouble, are you?

485
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,860
Beat him!

486
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,450
Beat him!

487
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,050
Don't run!

488
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,900
A few days later,

489
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,490
the elder brother was found
skinned and dumped

490
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,210
right outside my hut.

491
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,660
I fled the temple that night

492
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,320
and moved to the countryside.

493
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,420
His death had nothing to do with you,

494
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
so why did you run?

495
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,450
Do the case files

496
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,770
mention

497
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,470
the Heavenly Way Society?

498
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,450
Yes.

499
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,480
The registrar of Guanyin Town

500
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,280
specifically noted in the files

501
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,690
that except for you,

502
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,090
no one knew about
the Heavenly Way Society.

503
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,380
Just as I thought.

504
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,010
What exactly is this Heavenly Way Society?

505
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,820
The Heavenly Way Society's name means
"acting on behalf of Heaven's justice."

506
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,340
They punish the wicked and eliminate evil.

507
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,860
Members must swear a blood oath
to join it,

508
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,210
vowing to rid the world

509
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,530
of all evil and injustice

510
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,590
in their lifetime.

511
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,290
To quit,

512
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,940
one must cut out a piece
of their own heart flesh

513
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,340
as atonement for breaking the oath

514
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,290
before leaving.

515
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,180
So the wound on your chest

516
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,390
was from leaving the society?

517
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,620
It's all my own doing.

518
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,200
I thought giving up

519
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,010
that bit of flesh would set me free.

520
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,210
But when I saw how
that elder brother died,

521
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,900
I knew he was targeted

522
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,730
by the Heavenly Way Society because of me.

523
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,780
For the crime of sowing discord among kin,

524
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,980
they sentenced him to be skinned alive.

525
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,620
Leaving his body at my hut's door

526
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,980
was a warning

527
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,460
not to reveal anything
about the Heavenly Way Society.

528
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,780
Only the law

529
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,010
has the right to punish crimes.

530
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,220
What right does the Heavenly Way Society
have to abuse private justice?

531
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,460
When I was young,
how could I understand such things?

532
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,890
My family was once quite wealthy,

533
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,900
until a rich man

534
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,830
set his eyes on our stationery shop

535
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,140
and, with a gang of thugs,

536
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,110
brutally beat my father to death

537
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,550
and forced my mother

538
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,100
to hang herself with a hemp rope.

539
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,010
Why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

540
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,610
I did.

541
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,880
I spent all my money bribing officials.

542
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,640
But in the end,
they said there was no evidence

543
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,830
and accused me of false charges.

544
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,620
Turns out that rich man had already

545
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,500
bought off everyone in the county office.

546
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,340
Justice may be slow,

547
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,820
but it never fails.

548
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,110
Such corrupt officials

549
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,140
will be wiped out sooner or later.

550
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,140
Young lady,

551
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,530
what you said is just like

552
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,100
Minister Shen's.

553
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,480
Young lady?

554
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,300
You should respectfully
call her Master Wan.

555
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,860
Even Minister Shen

556
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,420
never asked me to call him Master.

557
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,900
You must really have some skills

558
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,960
to earn

559
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,730
that title.

560
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,050
Alright.

561
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,140
You don't seem like someone
who would just sit and wait for death.

562
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,050
So why did you let that rich man
turn the tables on you without doing anything?

563
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,950
I had no other choice then.

564
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,770
Just as I was about to flee,

565
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,450
I met an old man

566
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,940
who said if I wanted revenge,

567
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,070
I should follow him.

568
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,050
Filled with anger, I blindly

569
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,770
joined the Heavenly Way Society.

570
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,970
I thought it was just a society
like the canal workers' union,

571
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,910
but it turned out

572
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,360
they train assassins

573
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,490
who kill

574
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,090
according to their own laws.

575
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,700
The Heavenly Way Society is strict.

576
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,250
Except for the old man who introduced me,

577
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,850
I've never seen anyone's real face

578
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,970
or known the exact location of their hall.

579
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,350
After I woke up,

580
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,700
I kept thinking about how to escape

581
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,820
this deadly hellhole.

582
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,060
The elder who recommended me
was kind-hearted

583
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,340
and told me about

584
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,630
the flesh-cutting rule
for leaving the society.

585
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,450
But it wasn't until the day I left

586
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,470
that I realized

587
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,730
he had to

588
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,820
cut out a piece of his own heart too.

589
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,390
Mr. Zhang, thank you for today.

590
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,100
The jailer will bring you
some sweet soup later.

591
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,560
Drink it and get some rest.

592
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,220
Flaying skin and pulling tongues?

593
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,750
Could they really

594
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,930
have reached the capital?

595
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,860
Is it good?

596
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,210
Yes.

597
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,530
From now on, we'll buy it from this place.

598
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:57,920
Okay.

599
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,850
Wait.

600
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,140
Master, Your Highness.

601
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,730
Tonight I want to stay at your residence.

602
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,820
At my place?

603
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,530
I can't go back to the palace now.

604
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,940
If I return to
the Marquis of Zhongyong's Mansion,

605
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,870
I'll probably be questioned again.

606
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,770
Staying at your place

607
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,300
won't cause gossip, right?

608
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,690
No.

609
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,660
Our mansion has a second gate.

610
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,650
The carriage can go straight there.

611
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,180
No one will know you're with me.

612
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,670
No, no, absolutely not!

613
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,770
Our princess is a young maiden.

614
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,770
How could she casually
stay at a man's house?

615
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,580
Her reputation is more precious
than Mount Tai.

616
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,970
It must not be tarnished in the slightest.

617
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,050
Lives are more precious than Mount Tai.

618
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,450
Constable Zhan is investigating

619
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,490
the victim's identity.

620
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,810
Please tell him

621
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,570
to focus on families
with brotherly conflicts.

622
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,140
Yes.

623
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,010
Also,

624
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,270
When you come back,
bring two bowls of wonton

625
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,670
for Princess Yongci as a late-night snack.

626
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:24,900
Fuling,

627
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,550
your reputation

628
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,320
is just as important
in Princess Yongci's eyes.

629
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,940
I'll go get the horses ready.

630
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,720
This guy is even smoother than I am.

631
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,540
Today we have some good news.

632
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,280
Our Fuling's marriage

633
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,770
has finally been settled.

634
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,180
He wants me to agree to marry him
just over a bowl of wonton?

635
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,420
That's too easy.

636
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,010
Let's go.

637
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,900
Look.

638
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,620
Your clothes are way too big for me.

639
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,250
It's fine.

640
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,320
You look good in anything.

641
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,620
From now on,
I'll keep two sets of clothes for you

642
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,280
so you can change when needed.

643
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,530
If I often stay out overnight,

644
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,690
won't the Marquis Mansion go crazy?

645
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,540
Then ask His Majesty
to grant you a residence.

646
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,060
It would be convenient
for your future investigations too.

647
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,180
How could I

648
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,230
trouble His Majesty
for such a small matter?

649
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,180
Actually,

650
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,150
I do have a place in mind.

651
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,020
Where is it? I'll buy it for you.

652
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,490
I want to move into Uncle Liang's house.

653
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,200
It's close to my old family home.

654
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,490
I can look for Father's old notes

655
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,460
and pay respects to my parents.

656
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,180
Alright.

657
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,620
I'll have someone

658
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,750
start packing and help you move later.

659
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,640
-Little Wan'er!
-Chi!

660
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,790
Retreat, retreat.

661
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,090
Let me see.

662
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,050
Why are you pulling me?

663
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,900
Do you know
what it means to be inseparable?

664
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,240
Of course I do.

665
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,590
I wasn't trying to tear them apart.

666
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,070
Your Ladyship? Your Highness?

667
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,340
This is for Little Wan'er, right?

668
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,400
I'll send it to her.

669
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,450
Aren't you asking for trouble
if you go now?

670
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,820
What's wrong with delivering some food?

671
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,550
Give it to me.

672
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,490
This...

673
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,010
Oh my goodness.

674
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,760
Three.

675
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,900
Two.

676
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,310
One.

677
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,100
I haven't finished my bowl of wontons yet!

678
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,530
That bowl of wontons
you ate was actually mine.

679
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,040
I told you not to go in,

680
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,690
but you wouldn't listen.

681
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,210
You...

682
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,380
I haven't had time for you lately,

683
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,010
so you took Yue Ning

684
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,810
to hang out at Fengqi House, huh?

685
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,890
Ning, back me up here.

686
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,570
Today I did you a huge favor.

687
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,690
If it weren't for me,

688
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,950
how could Constable Zhan
have found the victim so quickly?

689
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,480
That's true.

690
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,960
He was really impressive today.

691
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,140
The moment I said we still didn't know
who the victim was,

692
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,900
he immediately took me to Fengqi House.

693
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,010
With just a few words, he got the madam

694
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,010
to list all the guests from that day.

695
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,970
While we were trying to decide
which one to investigate first,

696
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,010
Bai Feng said we should focus on people

697
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,060
with conflicts between brothers.

698
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,090
I instantly picked out the name.

699
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,620
So who is it?

700
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,690
Wu Qian, the fourth young master

701
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,620
of the Earl of Weiyuan's household.

702
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,140
The Earl of Weiyuan's household
is basically broke now.

703
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,730
How could Wu Qian have the money

704
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,260
to splurge at Fengqi House?

705
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,970
He might not have money,
but the family still has some assets.

706
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,450
Wu Qian is the Earl of Weiyuan's son
from his later years.

707
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,690
He's the least capable

708
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,140
but the most spoiled.

709
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,660
First he pawned antiques and paintings,

710
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,140
then got obsessed with stone seals.

711
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,750
In the end, he sold off a few shops

712
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,900
and even framed

713
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,370
the Third Young Master Wu Yu

714
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,260
for embezzling family property,

715
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
nearly causing the family to split.

716
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,990
The Marquis of Weiyuan's Mansion?

717
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,530
A few days ago,
there was a murder case in the capital.

718
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,130
Wu Qian from your family was seen

719
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,820
at the crime scene.

720
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,530
We had a sketch made,

721
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:21,010
and it matches him closely.

722
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,900
Are you referring to the flaying case

723
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,159
that's caused widespread panic lately?

724
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,190
Precisely.

725
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,670
The corpse was badly damaged,

726
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,199
making it hard to identify.

727
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,739
So we had to investigate Wu Qian

728
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,600
based on his recent whereabouts.

729
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,750
But this also ties into

730
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,179
the rumors about discord
between you two brothers.

731
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,270
My brother and I quarreled only because,

732
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,460
while Father was gravely ill, he dared

733
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,570
to persuade Mother to sell off her dowry
to fund his extravagance.

734
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,500
I punished him on behalf of Father,

735
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,170
but Mother defended him.

736
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,830
He claimed he wanted
to start a stone seal business,

737
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,159
but

738
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,170
people from Ranmo Gallery
came after him for debts.

739
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,650
Not only did he fail to make any money,

740
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,050
he ended up owing
a hundred taels of silver.

741
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,650
His outrageous reputation is well known.

742
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,310
Why would Ranmo Gallery
still do business with him?

743
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,580
I never interfere in his affairs.

744
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,160
[Ranmo Gallery]

745
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,630
Please have a seat.

746
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,570
Your Highness, feel free to ask anything.

747
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,700
I will tell you everything I know.

748
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,700
Mr. Ning, do you know my fourth brother,

749
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,340
Wu Qian?

750
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,420
Of course I do.

751
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,820
Fourth Young Master Wu
is a regular at Ranmo Gallery.

752
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,190
That day,

753
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,610
the authorities asked me to paint
a portrait of a deceased person...

754
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,410
That's right.

755
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,450
The deceased was my fourth brother.

756
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,700
I want to ask you—

757
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,220
do you think my fourth brother
was a trustworthy person?

758
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,450
It's more accurate to say
that Fourth Young Master Wu

759
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,980
thought I was trustworthy,

760
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,490
which is why he entrusted
your family's paintings

761
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,750
to me for safekeeping.

762
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,700
No need to cover for my brother.

763
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,900
I know

764
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,650
he often secretly sold my family's
calligraphy and paintings to you.

765
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,700
The other day, one of your shop's clerks
came looking for payment,

766
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,260
saying my brother
owed you 100 taels of silver.

767
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,490
Is this true?

768
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,260
Impossible.

769
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,530
Given Fourth Young Master Wu's character,

770
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,970
we always settled accounts in full—

771
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:08,820
no credit.

772
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,010
Could you please call

773
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,610
all your shop clerks here,

774
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,530
so Third Young Master Wu can identify

775
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,330
the person who came for the debt?

776
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,540
Call everyone over.

777
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,650
Here.

778
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,650
Please.

779
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,200
Thank you.

780
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,420
Our studio

781
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,940
only has two painters, two apprentices,

782
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,480
and one errand boy.

783
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,610
The person who came for the debt
that day isn't here.

784
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,380
Mr. Ning,

785
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,410
have you ever employed anyone else before?

786
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,260
Yes.

787
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,570
Third Young Master Wu, take a look.

788
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,630
Is this the person?

789
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,000
That's him.

790
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,120
This person

791
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,220
was our studio's carver, Wang Xin.

792
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,250
But I discovered

793
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,490
he was secretly forging
noble seals for profit.

794
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,740
Because of his misconduct,

795
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,780
I fired him a month ago.

796
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,310
Could it be that

797
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,570
my fourth brother's
so-called stone seal business

798
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,630
was actually selling counterfeit seals
with Wang Xin?

799
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,140
Anyone who can run
such a fake seal business

800
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,480
must have excellent carving skills.

801
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,610
Putting aside artistic flair and spirit,

802
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,870
his carving technique

803
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,030
is indeed very good.

804
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,970
The night Wang Xin went
to collect his debt,

805
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,900
Fourth Young Master Wu got killed.

806
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,260
And he had a financial dispute with him.

807
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,460
He is a prime suspect.

808
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,420
I had this portrait made

809
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,750
specifically to issue an arrest warrant.

810
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,710
I'm hungry.

811
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,900
We've made good progress today.

812
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,010
I'll take you a place.

813
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,540

How do you know so much about everything?

836
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,220
I joined Shuoxi Army when I was eight.

837
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,420
My father just left me at the camp

838
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,820
and paid me no attention.

839
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,180
On the battlefield,

840
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,090
no one treated me as a child.

841
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,820
I had to learn how to survive.

842
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,220
You must have had a tough childhood,
right?

843
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,360
Before I was eight,

844
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,470
I was raised
in the Empress Dowager's palace.

845
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,560
Though without my parents' care,

846
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,650
I had my Grandmother's protection.

847
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,050
It wasn't too harsh.

848
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,820
The real hardships began

849
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,070
when I went to my father's side.

850
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,140
My mother's nanny told me

851
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,130
that when she was alive,

852
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,780
this was her favorite place.

853
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,570
Whenever my father missed my mother,

854
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,630
he would come here.

855
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,950
After I learned about this,

856
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
I often came here

857
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,610
to sit and imagine

858
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,860
what my mother

859
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,530
looked like

860
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,940
standing here.

861
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,700
How did your mother pass away?

862
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,070
The nanny said

863
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,680
my mother suffered a hemorrhage

864
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,760
giving birth to me

865
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,880
and lingered for over a month
before passing.

866
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,470
At that time,
my father was on the way back to the capital.

867
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,730
By the time he arrived,

868
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,980
she had already been buried.

869
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,610
Given your mother's rank,

870
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,530
her body should have lain
in state for several months.

871
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,190
Why was she buried so quickly?

872
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,510
I don't know.

873
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,130
No one ever mentioned it.

874
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,200
Thinking about it, it does seem strange.

875
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Not necessarily.

876
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,880
With Prince Rui's temper,

877
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,130
if something was wrong,

878
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,860
he would have investigated it.

879
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,180
In the end, my father

880
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,940
stayed by my mother's tomb
for three months.

881
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,650
Then he handed me,
swaddled, over to the Empress Dowager

882
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,980
and returned to Shuoxi.

883
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,440
The nanny said that

884
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,450
because Father

885
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,510
never got to see Mother one last time,

886
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,840
his heart seemed as if it had died.

887
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,420
Perhaps that's why

888
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,980
he somewhat blames me for it.

889
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,720
But I don't blame him.

890
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,150
Your mother's death
had nothing to do with you.

891
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,510
One day your father will understand.

892
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,410
You are the most innocent

893
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,070
and the one who needs his love the most.

894
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,050
Having you by my side

895
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,060
is enough for me.

896
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,260
Well,

897
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,620
skinning, tongue-pulling,
freezing to death—

898
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,650
does the Heavenly Way Society
follow any rules for punishment?

899
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,380
Or do they just torture
and kill people at random?

900
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,840
What?

901
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,820
The postmortem reports
of the three victims in Guanyin Town

902
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,780
have clearly stated their causes of death,

903
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,640
but I still can't find
any connection between them.

904
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,900
The reports
are still at the capital prefecture.

905
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,610
Let's head there immediately.

906
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,170
We can also have Zheng Baishi
step up the patrols.

907
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,700
Let's go.

908
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,050
What's wrong?

909
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,820
You specifically brought me here to relax,

910
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,870
yet all I can think about is the case.

911
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,230
Do you think I'm unromantic?

912
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,620
How could I be such a narrow-minded
and ordinary person?

913
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:56,730
Remember,

914
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,720
this is your unique charm.

915
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,300
In this world,

916
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,980
no one but me, Yan Chi,

917
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,930
can truly appreciate it.

918
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,510
Thank you, Your Highness.

919
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,010
Thank you for your hard work,
Your Highness.
