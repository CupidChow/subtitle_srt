1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
lead a happy life.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Untamed

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Get back to your original state.

4
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Maidong is back.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,800
Maidong invites you to watch

6
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,000
the Snow-Crawling Road.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You colluded with Jiang Heying

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to pretend to be Rong Di

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and killed my father.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Have you ever thought

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
you would have a day like this?

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It wasn't me.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It was Jiang Heying.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It was him.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He was the one who

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
was the one

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
who was grudging you and Uncle.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He was the one who was cruel.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
you're still lying

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
after you're dead.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Do you really think

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you can leave the Zongzheng Temple alive?

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Every crime you commit

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
has solid evidence.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It should be executed according to the law.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
His Majesty's arrangement

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
is just to leave

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
some dignity to the royal family.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You've always been

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
a traitor behind the scenes.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Li Siqun,

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll give you

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
a chance to be a man.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It was my fault.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I was wrong.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I kowtowed

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
to Uncle.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm guilty.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll kill you.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll let you

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
experience it yourself.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll let you experience it yourself.

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll let you experience it yourself.

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You say I'm a traitor?

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In this palace,

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
who's not a wild wolf?

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just did what I should do.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I wasn't wrong.

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I wasn't wrong.

51
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not a wild wolf.

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I just did what I should do.

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I wasn't wrong.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I wasn't wrong.

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I was wrong.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I was wrong.

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I was wrong.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I wasn't wrong.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was wrong.

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It was all my fault.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You should say it was my fault.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you dare?

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you want to take revenge,

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you should take Yongci with you.

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You should go to your father's grave

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and live on your own.

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because you

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
are the ones who killed your father.

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What are you talking about?

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yan Zhi,

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
you humiliated me

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
for a woman.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You humiliated me.

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
How could I bear it?

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's why I made up my mind

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
to kill Uncle

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and get rid of this evil spirit.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yan Zhi, you killed yourself

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
for a woman.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You are

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the son of the rebel

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
of the royal family.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The son of the rebel!

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Kill me.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Kill me.

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Kill me.

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Kill me!

88
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Your Highness,

89
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you can't neglect the law

90
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
because you are in a hurry.

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Send under the order

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,500
all the civil servants

93
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
to clean Han's room.

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Go.

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Go.

96
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They took our real family

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,160
can't create forests

98
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,120
and roads

99
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,280
for Without Order.

100
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,360
The whole world

101
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,720
can be eliminated by God's will.

102
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,960
In fact,

103
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,720
my death depends on whether

104
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,720
you give me up or

105
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,400
logging with my father in Может City.

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,920
What?

107
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,020
Bastard!

108
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:49,020
You act살 not

109
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,900
and you frame the emperor.

110
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,120
The people of the Yan State

111
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,800
colluded with Jiang He Ying

112
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,080
to assassinate his uncle, Lord Xianrui.

113
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,760
The poor and the poor are all in the dark.

114
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,240
They abandoned the way of life.

115
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,520
They should be executed.

116
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
The right should be considered.

117
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
The royal family is proud

118
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,560
and they didn't publicize it to the public.

119
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,840
You...

120
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,400
You already know

121
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,960
the real murderer who killed your father.

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,120
You also saw

123
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,280
how Yuan Qing behaved just now.

124
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,960
You should know

125
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,120
how I should deal with it.

126
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Why bother to get involved with Yan Qi

127
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,400
and let others know?

128
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,320
I

129
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,480
should personally punish Yan Qi.

130
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,840
I was wronged and I was punished.

131
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,920
That's why I have to tell my father's soul.

132
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,560
Otherwise,

133
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,520
I would be a son of a man.

134
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm done.

135
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,560
Yuan Qing.

136
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,120
Have you seen

137
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,800
the eunuchs you brought

138
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,160
die because of Yan Qi?

139
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,200
have you seen the eunuchs you brought

140
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
die because of Yan Qi?

141
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,720
Your Majesty,

142
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
my children are very dumb.

143
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,720
They didn't see anything.

144
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
What about you?

145
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,680
You didn't see anything either.

146
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,040
You didn't see anything?

147
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,920
I'm old and blind.

148
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,600
I only saw Yan Qi

149
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,040
hit the eunuch.

150
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
After taking the sword of King of Rui,

151
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,720
he stabbed himself in the chest.

152
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Yan Qi

153
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,600
was arrogant and disloyal.

154
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,400
He was mad and died of self-harm.

155
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,240
But you didn't stop him in time.

156
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,640
You still have the fault of misjudgment.

157
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,640
From now on,

158
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,320
you will be the personal assistant of the Imperial City

159
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,280
after you resign from the Ministry of Justice.

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,480
You will guard all the inner palace.

161
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,400
Your Majesty, please show your gratitude.

162
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,640
Why?

163
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,800
Are you dissatisfied with my punishment?

164
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,840
I dare not.

165
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,040
I...

166
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,520
I thank you.

167
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,520
Enough.

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,240
You should think about it these days.

169
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
Don't make trouble again.

170
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,960
You may leave.

171
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,800
Yes.

172
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,640
Chu,

173
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,760
have you heard me?

174
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,080
I hear you.

175
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,160
You're치

176
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Did you hear that?

177
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Yanqi is dead.

178
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,660
This Jian Zhong is finally dead.

179
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
My Chen.

180
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
You must be heartbroken.

181
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,660
I will make him give up his whole life

182
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
to bury you.

183
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Yanqi

184
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,660
Hurry!

185
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
Back off.

186
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Take the knife.

187
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
You don't trust me?

188
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
I was reckless.

189
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Please don't blame me.

190
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
You are being too harsh.

191
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
I am not in the mood to talk.

192
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Please don't mention my name again.

193
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
From now on,

194
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
just call me Yan Xiao Wei.

195
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
We have been watching you for a long time.

196
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
We only have a chance to follow you

197
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
to kill the enemy and eliminate the bandits.

198
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
No matter what happens,

199
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
you will always be the Young Marshal

200
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
in our hearts

201
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,660
after we die.

202
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,660
Xue Qing Shan,

203
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
with your words,

204
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
I admit that you are my brother.

205
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Bai Feng,

206
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,660
we are not friends.

207
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,660
Although we didn't get to go to the battlefield,

208
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
we will guard the imperial city together.

209
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
I will guard the battle with my own hands.

210
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
These days,

211
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
you need to watch over Yi'er

212
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
and wait for Yan to attack.

213
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Then you can work together

214
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
to guard the capital.

215
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Yes.

216
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Yanqi is dead.

217
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
He was pretending to be dead

218
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
on my knife.

219
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
I couldn't avenge my father.

220
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Do you think father will blame me?

221
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
No.

222
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
Father will not see

223
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
his proudest son

224
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
become a murderer.

225
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,660
Seeing that you are not

226
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
killed by hatred,

227
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
are you hurt?

228
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
No.

229
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,660
I am covered with blood.

230
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
Does His Majesty blame you?

231
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
He doesn't blame me.

232
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,660
He doesn't suspect that

233
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Yanqi is a selfish man.

234
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,660
He took the initiative to cover for me.

235
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,660
He just used the time to

236
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,660
make me the commander of the imperial army.

237
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,660
It's good that you are fine.

238
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
But I couldn't tell the world

239
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
the truth about father's death.

240
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
I don't believe it.

241
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
I know.

242
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
But I have to do this.

243
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
I have to make the emperor

244
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
believe me.

245
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Believe that I am a selfish man.

246
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Believe that I have never doubted him.

247
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Only by letting him

248
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
not be so careful about me,

249
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
we can have a chance

250
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
to find out the truth.

251
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
Father will understand

252
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
your happiness in heaven.

253
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
But father is still here.

254
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
He knows that the danger we are looking for

255
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
is his death.

256
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
I am afraid he will come again.

257
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Father, my father,

258
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
and brother Jin,

259
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,660
they are not the fish in the pond.

260
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,660
They are not the smoke.

261
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,660
They are the people of Great Zhou

262
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,660
who can bring the long-lasting peace.

263
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
As long as we are careful,

264
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
we can't let them down.

265
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
They will support us.

266
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Come.

267
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
These

268
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
are the ones I compared with the material.

269
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
The beads on the chessboard,

270
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
the hand of Sui Ge,

271
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,160
and the ink on the paper of Xuanji Pavilion

272
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,160
are all made by one person.

273
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
But I am sure that Jin Fei is not mistaken.

274
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
These are the ink

275
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
of the emperor in the previous period.

276
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
A'Che

277
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
is the wife of Qin,

278
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
and the wife of Zitong.

279
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
It's true.

280
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,660
This is the death of Yan Che

281
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
recorded by His Majesty.

282
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
We were just looking at the ink.

283
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
We found that

284
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660
His Majesty and Her Majesty

285
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660
were so in love in the previous period.

286
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Yan Che is deeply loved by His Majesty.

287
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
No.

288
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,660
Since I was born,

289
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
His Majesty has never been awake

290
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,660
in Fengyi Palace.

291
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,660
He is also very close to Her Majesty.

292
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
He is also very close to Her Majesty.

293
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,160
His Majesty has never been filial to Yan Che.

294
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
When did he come to Zhenwu Palace?

295
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
The book is a new painting.

296
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
The meaning is in the pen.

297
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
If His Majesty's temperament changes

298
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
after being hurt by the war,

299
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
the ink will change.

300
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
It's understandable.

301
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
But Sui Ge said

302
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Jin Fei would not accept this explanation.

303
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
It shows that the ink changes

304
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
not because of the temperament.

305
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
If we can find

306
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
the ink of His Majesty's war

307
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
as a comparison,

308
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
maybe

309
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
we can find the real reason

310
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,660
why His Majesty killed Jin Fei.

311
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,260
I have His Majesty's personal jade

312
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
on my memorial.

313
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,260
It was also after Jin Fei died

314
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,260
that he returned to the capital to take the edict.

315
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,260
If he was trying to cover up,

316
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,260
the jade on the memorial

317
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,260
may not be his personal writing.

318
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
Then we have to find

319
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
the ink of His Majesty's war

320
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,260
before Jin Fei died.

321
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,260
I found it.

322
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
This is the letter

323
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,260
between His Majesty and my father.

324
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Father has been keeping it.

325
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
Why is there

326
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
a seal on it?

327
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
This letter

328
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,260
is different from the letter

329
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,260
in the previous emperor's handwriting.

330
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,260
But the jade

331
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,260
on my memorial

332
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
is the same.

333
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,260
You mean

334
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,260
His Majesty was

335
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,260
the emperor's father?

336
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,260
How is that possible?

337
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
But I have heard

338
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
that

339
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
the emperor

340
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,260
was the emperor's father.

341
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,260
That's not true.

342
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
So the emperor

343
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,260
was Jin Fei's father.

344
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
So the emperor

345
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
has heard of the illusion.

346
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
But I have never seen it.

347
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
I don't know if it's true.

348
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Even if there is a illusion,

349
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
the grandmother

350
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
can't even recognize her own son.

351
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
And the Noble Consort and the Empress

352
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
have been following the emperor

353
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
since the previous emperor.

354
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
It's impossible to tell.

355
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
It's too strange

356
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
to think about it in detail.

357
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
But it's about the imperial power.

358
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
It's not good to ask anyone.

359
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
It's about the stability of the state.

360
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Before we can make a new state,

361
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
we can't make any mistakes.

362
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
We can't let father

363
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
and father

364
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
and brother Jin's sacrifice

365
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
to be affected.

366
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
We should follow

367
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
brother Jin's case.

368
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
According to the clues we have,

369
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
we can definitely

370
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
clear brother Jin's name

371
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
for my father and brother Jin.

372
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Bitch.

373
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Prince Chen just died.

374
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
You just ran away.

375
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
You are really a vicious woman.

376
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
You used her to

377
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
love you,

378
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
bully me,

379
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
and humiliate me.

380
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
Today I will let you

381
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
die with her.

382
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
You dare.

383
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
I am not Zhong Youhou.

384
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
My sister is the Princess Consort.

385
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
If you kill me,

386
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
I will kill you.

387
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I will kill you.

388
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
I will kill you.

389
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
I will kill you.

390
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
I will kill you.

391
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
I will kill you.

392
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,460
If you kill me,

393
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
they won't let you go.

394
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Really?

395
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,460
Then you can try.

396
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,460
If they kill you,

397
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,460
will someone

398
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
avenge you?

399
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,460
Go to hell.

400
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,460
The traitors are blocking the way.

401
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
Kill them all.

402
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,460
I swear

403
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
I will not

404
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,460
let you go.

405
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,460
Let's

406
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,460
die together.

407
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,460
Sister.

408
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Wu Jian is dead.

409
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,460
Qian Xiang is dead.

410
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,460
Brother Qi asked me

411
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,460
to pick up the fifth lady.

412
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,460
But I was taken away

413
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
by His Majesty to deal with official affairs.

414
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
I was late.

415
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
Why do you say that?

416
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,460
Waner.

417
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,460
It's no use for him to go.

418
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,460
Every time Prince Chen

419
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
and the Chao family

420
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
are killed.

421
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,460
Don't cry.

422
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,460
The Queen hates Prince Chen the most.

423
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,460
There must be someone

424
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
who takes advantage of Zhao State

425
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
to go to the imperial guards.

426
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,460
Prince Chen is the most vicious person

427
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
in the world.

428
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
But these machines

429
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
are not wrong.

430
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
What's wrong with Qin Xiang?

431
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
I'll go find Brother Qi.

432
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
He's still in the Jin family.

433
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
I'm afraid he doesn't know.

434
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Go.

435
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
After Uncle Han received the news,

436
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
he sent someone to the Prince Chen's mansion

437
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
to collect Wu Jian's body.

438
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Sister.

439
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Do you think

440
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
I took away

441
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Sister Wu's fortune?

442
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
If he married Xue Qing Shan,

443
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
then he would be...

444
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Sister, don't say that.

445
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
Come on.

446
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
I chose this path myself.

447
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
No one is right or wrong.

448
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,660
Sister Jiu.

449
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,660
I want to take the legitimate mother

450
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
to the capital to be raised.

451
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
Wu Jian is gone.

452
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Only I, the virgin,

453
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,660
can rely on him.

454
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,660
That's good.

455
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
I can also trust you.

456
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,660
Sister Liu is also pregnant.

457
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
Remember.

458
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Don't cry like this anymore.

459
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,660
Really?

460
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,660
Really.

461
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
These are all my wishes.

462
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Don't be sad and angry anymore.

463
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Imperial Consort.

464
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Imperial Consort Su.

465
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
Imperial Consort.

466
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
This is the tonic

467
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
His Majesty gave you.

468
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,760
It's good for your health.

469
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Imperial Consort.

470
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Imperial Consort Su.

471
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
I'm sorry, Imperial Consort.

472
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
I'm sorry.

473
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Imperial Consort Su.

474
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
What are you doing?

475
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Get lost!

476
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Get out of here.

477
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
You're not allowed to come here again!

478
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
He's going to kill me.

479
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
He killed the Crown Prince.

480
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,760
He killed Qi Er.

481
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
My Qi Er...

482
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,660
My daughter.

483
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,420
This is where you and your father hid things.

484
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,340
It's really quite secretive.

485
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,620
I can't even notice it.

486
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:55,260
It's for a��宝riet

487
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,300
Miss Tang,

488
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,260
you've been missing for a long time.

489
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,700
It's too late that you areーン

490
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,820
If people know,

491
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,500
it is still quite sensitive.

492
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,660
Don't worry.

493
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,900
Just take these verses

494
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,540
and write them till the maritime sea is frog's body.

495
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,340
You can enter by taking these.

496
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,340
I...

497
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,260
The sword is only used by His Majesty.

498
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,460
This dagger is enough to prove

499
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,260
that His Majesty killed Consort Jin.

500
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,380
I've checked the treasure and hid the key evidence.

501
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,700
I'm going to find Lin Wuyun.

502
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,820
I'll go with you when I get the sword.

503
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,620
I can't wait.

504
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,140
I'll see

505
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,020
how she'll face my father's crime of hiding.

506
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,100
Humph.

507
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,900
Consort investigate.

508
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,540
痴.

509
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,420
Miss Lin Täng.

510
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,580
Who are you calling Miss Lin?

511
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,700
I'm going to make a secret case

512
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,740
to restart the case of Prince Jin.

513
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,100
Then you should know

514
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,380
that according to the Great Zhou Law,

515
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,140
if there is no new evidence that can refute the previous case,

516
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,660
the case of the robbery

517
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,780
must not be restarted.

518
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,220
I know.

519
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,260
But I want to know more.

520
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,540
Why did Minister Li tell Prince Jin and Duke Shen

521
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,340
to commit the crime?

522
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,780
Shen Yi

523
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,580
hid the real murder

524
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,900
to create the innocent fake image of Prince Jin.

525
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,460
You didn't find the evidence.

526
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,540
How can you be sure

527
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,180
that the murderer is Prince Jin?

528
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,420
Prince Jin was caught on the spot.

529
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,780
If it wasn't Prince Jin,

530
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,300
could it be the Prince Jiu who was there?

531
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,340
So you used a dagger

532
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,700
that didn't open the door

533
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,140
to solve the case as the murderer.

534
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,140
So that day,

535
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,460
you really saw the picture of Prince Jin.

536
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,380
That dagger

537
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,940
was a gift from Prince Jin to Prince Jiu.

538
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,620
Prince Jin never admitted his crime.

539
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,300
You never found the evidence.

540
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,020
But to make a contribution,

541
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,100
you accused Duke Shen of hiding the murder.

542
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,060
You used a dagger that couldn't kill people

543
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,220
to punish Prince Jin.

544
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,820
I never accused Shen Yi of hiding the murder.

545
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,220
Shen Yi helped the murderer to hide the evidence.

546
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,820
He is the real culprit

547
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,220
of the murder.

548
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,020
So you know who killed

549
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,740
Consort Jin.

550
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,900
Why do you say that?

551
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,140
You only know who Duke Shen is protecting

552
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,860
so you can say

553
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,020
the word of the murderer.

554
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,100
I heard Duke Shen has always

555
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,140
admired you.

556
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,100
I guess he must have told you

557
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,580
about the murder.

558
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,220
You really know a lot.

559
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,300
Since you know the truth,

560
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,820
you should know

561
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,740
that I didn't tell you.

562
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,820
You really don't know

563
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,740
why Duke Shen hid the murder?

564
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,860
You knew that

565
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,980
Duke Shen and Prince Jin

566
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,300
were the three high-ranking officials.

567
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,420
But now you accuse him of

568
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,940
being the son of Duke Shen.

569
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,420
Don't you feel ashamed?

570
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,540
I have no shame.

571
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,740
I made the decision

572
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,140
for the sake of the court.

573
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,540
I just want to cover

574
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,980
my weak words.

575
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,340
If I knew where the real murder was,

576
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,740
I would have known it.

577
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,420
It's a natural law

578
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,540
to commit the same crime as the common people.

579
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,020
I deserve to

580
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,060
be punished by you.

581
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,660
I,

582
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,700
mean it.

583
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,740
How can you

584
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,420
be the difficulty repeater?

585
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,300
I won't be!]

586
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,180
I'm here for you.

587
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,060
Take it easy.

588
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,180
We won't receive

589
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
such a lowoless love

590
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,100
as falling into a pit.

591
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,340
I just hit Li Muyun.

592
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,780
Did he hurt you?

593
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,900
No.

594
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,700
He knew

595
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,740
the real murderer of Jin Fei is His Majesty.

596
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,220
When my father hid the dagger,

597
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,100
he told him

598
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,820
he felt no guilt at all.

599
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,220
He thought he was following the way of heaven.

600
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,740
He said that it was a very deep feeling.

601
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,820
I felt like I was about to die.

602
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,700
You suspect

603
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,140
Li Muyun is from the Heaven's Law Club?

604
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,180
I can't say it has nothing to do with it.

605
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,260
But he has been in three levels of government.

606
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,460
It's really unusual

607
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,180
to be biased against the Heaven's Law Club.

608
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,860
If Li Muyun is from the Heaven's Law Club,

609
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,820
the power and scheme of the Heaven's Law Club

610
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,140
are really a bit scary.

611
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,940
I'll investigate it.

612
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
You can't see him again.

613
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,220
I really want to take his official skin off.

614
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,260
Don't worry.

615
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,260
Whether he is or not,

616
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,340
I won't let him go.

617
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,620
Yes.

618
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,140
How's it going?

619
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,540
Are you scared?

620
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Very much.

621
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,740
I'm panicking.

622
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,260
Poor Meng,

623
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,900
he was harsh brain dead.

624
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,980
Thank you, Your Grace.

625
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,380
I've waited for a long time.

626
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,220
How long is his punishment?

627
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,820
Julie,

628
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,220
tell Him Kingston

629
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,740
Prince Rui.

630
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,060
Your Highness.

631
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,780
Princess.

632
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,020
I heard that Zheng Fu Yin is a famous gourmet.

633
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,220
I invited Zheng Fu Yin to join us today.

634
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,060
He'll taste the dishes of Shuo Xi.

635
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,620
I hope that you'll like it.

636
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,220
Prince Rui invited me here with such care.

637
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,860
Are you asking me to have breakfast?

638
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,460
Don't blame yourself, Zheng Fu Yin.

639
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,300
Prince Rui is thinking about it.

640
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,700
He's doing this to avoid people saying

641
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,300
that you have colluded with Prince Rui.

642
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,900
Zheng Fu Yin.

643
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,100
Please sit.

644
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,140
Tell me.

645
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,300
What do you want me to do?

646
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,580
I heard that Zheng Fu Yin

647
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,180
was born in the same class as Li Mu Yun.

648
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,740
Zheng Fu Yin is from a noble family.

649
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,980
But Li Mu Yun was born in the same family.

650
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,380
In terms of talent,

651
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,140
Li Mu Yun is not like me.

652
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,180
He's arrogant.

653
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,900
He's strict in his words.

654
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,380
His Majesty thinks that he's arrogant

655
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,740
and doesn't want to be an official.

656
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,060
So he's treating his paper as a tombstone.

657
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,500
He's a lowly person.

658
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,420
He's just a low-ranking county

659
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,460
with a county position.

660
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,580
He's been working hard

661
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,740
for years in that cold place.

662
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

663
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,780
Li Mu Yun was born in the same family as him.

664
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,700
But he's born so fast.

665
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,700
I'm sure he knows more about the official than Zheng Fu Yin.

666
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,140
Speaking of the promotion,

667
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,740
Li Mu Yun was really born with talent.

668
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,820
He's quite skilled in the prison.

669
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,300
He helped Shang Guan solve several cases.

670
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,980
And Duke Shen helped him to promote him.

671
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,140
He's been promoted.

672
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,020
Why did you ask about Li Mu Yun?

673
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,500
I want to ask Zheng Fu Yin to go to the Ministry of Justice

674
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,140
to find out where Li Mu Yun has been working for years.

675
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:27,900
Has there been a murder like the one in the Heaven's

676
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,020
I think Li Mu Yun has a collusion with the Heaven's.

677
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,060
Maybe Li Mu Yun was a member of the Heaven's.

678
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,860
When I see the paper,

679
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,020
I'll tell Zheng Fu Yin the reason.

680
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,100
But it's really inconvenient to say now.

681
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,700
If I hadn't been demoted to the Imperial City,

682
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,540
I wouldn't have been able to go to the Treasury of the Imperial Palace

683
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,700
and trouble Zheng Fu Yin so much.

684
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,820
It's really difficult to make such a mistake.

685
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,340
I hope Zheng Fu Yin can help me.

686
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,140
I'll do it.

687
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,580
Your Majesty,

688
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,780
the death of the son is not an urgent matter.

689
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,500
Please forgive the poor and let the son go.

690
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,300
I'll be able to make the country a better place

691
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,900
by selecting the crown prince.

692
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,620
The country will be prosperous.

693
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,660
I think Your Majesty is right.

694
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,020
The selection of the crown prince is not urgent.

695
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,580
Why don't you do more research

696
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,860
and make the crown prince a good person?

697
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,860
Your Majesty,

698
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,340
since the death of King of Rui,

699
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,500
the princes have been fighting with each other.

700
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,020
I beg Your Majesty to go to the Heaven's

701
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,940
to ask the brother

702
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,980
to report to the Heaven and Earth.

703
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,740
How dare you!

704
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,260
I...

705
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,420
My prince...

706
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,580
is not destined to die!

707
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,180
You...

708
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,420
You didn't say you'd share my worries.

709
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,380
You actually made me

710
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,500
make a criminal complaint.

711
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,020
What do you really want?

712
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,260
I...

713
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,660
I'm really a criminal friend!

714
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,580
Tell me!

715
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,660
What criminal friend am I?

716
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,220
Even if I'm a criminal friend,

717
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,740
all my sons will be dead!

718
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,900
I still have brothers

719
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,300
and the imperial family!

720
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,380
Yanli,

721
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,180
Yanchi, and Yanze

722
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,740
are all good men

723
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,660
who are loyal and righteous!

724
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,620
I...

725
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,180
Today,

726
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,580
I'll report to the officials!

727
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,500
Even if my family is destroyed,

728
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,900
I have the power

729
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,140
to rule the country!

730
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,340
I don't need your useless people

731
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,700
to help me!

732
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,700
What are you doing?

733
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
You're making a criminal complaint!

734
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,740
Come here!

735
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,980
What are you doing here?

736
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,260
The palace is in a bad state.

737
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,140
Don't be panic if you're fine.

738
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,220
The palace is out of the picture.

739
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,300
His Majesty said

740
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,540
all the imperial family

741
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,140
are qualified to be the crown prince.

742
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,100
Is that true?

743
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,340
Yes.

744
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,820
It's a thunder of joy!

745
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,660
If you become the crown prince,

746
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,780
you may become the emperor in the future.

747
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,380
It's a great thing.

748
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,100
You're not happy about it?

749
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,780
What's so great about being the emperor?

750
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,100
His Majesty is handsome and powerful.

751
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
The court wants to hear the noise of the officials.

752
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,580
The court also wants to make a memorial.

753
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,420
You have to be in charge of the affairs of the country.

754
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,500
You don't have to think about drinking.

755
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,580
I'd rather die

756
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,660
than live a life of misery.

757
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,940
His Majesty is a wise emperor.

758
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,500
That's why he's so self-willed.

759
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,660
You can be a marquis.

760
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,020
How many lives do I have to live to be a marquis?

761
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,700
The crown prince and the crown prince are dead.

762
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,260
How long can I live in the court?

763
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,820
Besides, I'm just his adopted son.

764
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,540
I don't even have a bloodline.

765
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,700
The royal family is not dead yet.

766
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
I'm not the one to be the emperor.

767
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,780
That's right.

768
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,580
It seems that you can only be

769
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,780
the king of my horse.

770
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,940
I'd rather be the horseman of your horse

771
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,980
than the king.

772
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,220
Who wants to be the king?

773
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,780
Take him away.

774
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,300
What should I do?

775
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Brother Ze's eyes are getting better.

776
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,940
I'm going back to Jingzhou.

777
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,460
How about I take you with me

778
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,100
when we leave the capital?

779
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,660
Really?

780
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,220
Of course.

781
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,660
Why should I wait for you?

782
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,660
I just want to know

783
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,060
if our previous agreement is still valid.

784
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,460
Of course.

785
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,900
Little girl, talk to me.

786
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,060
Wait for me.

787
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,500
The crown prince's son is the heir.

788
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,740
You're so funny.

789
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,220
Your Highness, please be quiet.

790
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,660
If others hear us...

791
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,180
So what if they hear us?

792
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,380
I'm just a concubine.

793
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,580
I'm afraid that others will hear me.

794
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,580
Give this to Princess Yongci.

795
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,100
Yes.

796
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,660
That's her consort.

797
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,980
I won't let you get away with it.

798
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
Thank you for your patience.

799
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,260
The Empress Dowager is still asleep.

800
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,540
I couldn't wake her up.

801
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,180
How is Grandmother?

802
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,340
She's fine.

803
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,220
Don't worry, Your Highness.

804
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,340
What about Suigeng?

805
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,820
How about I take her out for a while?

806
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,220
The Empress Dowager has been studying with Suigeng

807
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:48,540
these days.

808
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,180
I'm afraid that...

809
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,420
I won't bother you then.

810
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,340
I'll come to greet you

811
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,980
in a few days.

812
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,020
Your Highness.

813
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,820
If the Empress Dowager doesn't summon you,

814
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,620
don't enter the palace these days.

815
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,620
I understand.

816
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,620
Thank you, Granny Chen.

817
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,100
Give me the medicine box.

818
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,620
Yes.

819
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,220
Thank you.

820
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,020
Your Highness.

821
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
You lost your sword.

822
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
The Empress...

823
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,020
Shu Hua.

824
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,020
It's really the Empress.

825
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,020
Bai Feng.

826
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
Bai Feng, go get some water.

827
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,020
Yes.

828
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,820
I didn't expect that the Empress would be so strict.

829
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,220
Look at the roughness of the mark.

830
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,420
It's like a snake's hairpin is being cut.

831
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,820
She has this kind of character.

832
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,420
No wonder she has a good relationship with His Majesty

833
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,020
since the previous emperor.

834
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,620
The current Empress

835
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,420
isn't the mother who would get angry

836
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,020
when seeing her son use the ink to wipe his blood.

837
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,820
Her assistant in the palace hasn't shown up yet.

838
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,220
It's not necessarily a good thing

839
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,220
to let you know.

840
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,820
Master, the water is here.

841
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,620
suspicious.

842
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,220
What does this mean?

843
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,220
Bai Feng, look.

844
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,460
Is there a name for the street or alley

845
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,920
of the Science and Technology Family at the Southernниз of the City?

846
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,220
Lord.

847
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,820
or even the previous world.

848
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,780
Master, I'll go and find out.

849
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,980
Could this be a trap for you?

850
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,380
It's impossible.

851
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,540
But according to the current situation of the empress,

852
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,140
she needs to use my power

853
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,740
to avenge her brother.

854
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,140
There's only one family of Qian

855
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,700
in the whole Zhuang's Lane.

856
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,860
Then she could escape.

857
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,420
May I ask is it the Qian's family?

858
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,380
Is this the previous world?

859
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,300
I'm the eldest son of the Empress Dowager.

860
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,100
That's right.

861
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,220
Madam Qian is an old maid in the palace.

862
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,620
I was the eldest son of the Empress Dowager.

863
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,580
You are a maidservant of the Empress Dowager.

864
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,660
Why did you leave the palace and rely on the Empress?

865
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,460
I had to live under the protection of the Empress.

866
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,500
What do you mean?

867
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,660
The Empress asked the prince and the princess to come to me.

868
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,860
I think she has made plans to kill me.

869
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,460
I'm not a person who is greedy for life and afraid of death.

870
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,220
But if I die now,

871
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,580
no one will know the secret in my heart.

872
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,460
If I don't tell the day,

873
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,860
it will cause chaos.

874
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,060
If I die,

875
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,740
how can I face the Empress Dowager?

876
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:22,820
Come on.

877
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,100
Get up and talk.

878
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,900
This is a matter of chaos.

879
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,260
How could it be related to the Empress Dowager?

880
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,460
Because...

881
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:42,740
The Empress Dowager's first child is even a twin.

882
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,060
Her Di кого?

883
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:17,380
Had she Xingxuan do what the Empress Dowager asked her to do to

884
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:54,380
If a lifetime of love can be like a heartache

885
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:00,380
The pain will also be the same

886
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:07,380
Open your heart, love doesn't matter the deep sea

887
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:14,380
Please give me courage, let fate be open

888
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:21,380
Don't be afraid of the starlight being touched by the moonlight

889
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:29,380
The stars will shine beyond the sky

890
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:36,380
The stars will shine beyond the sky

891
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:43,380
The stars will shine beyond the sky
