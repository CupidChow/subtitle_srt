00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
The more you order, the more you get a discount.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,640
Taobao Shangkou invites you to watch

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,640
the five-night detective of Zhao Xue Lu.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,480
In 1936,

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,920
the fog of Huangpu River hasn't been cleared.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,840
I'm a lover, not a lover.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,600
How did you prove

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,120
you're not with him?

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,680
Take out my fucking friendships部分 le j forehead!

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,680
Has anyone worked for someone's life all this life?

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,820
There is a spy in it, isn't there?

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Tar die inculcated

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,760
Kill her

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,320
Warl divides just like bodies

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,100
Wanna the killer

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,380
The case was not as planned.

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,820
A strange theft case

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,700
made them suspicious.

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,740
The first-in-law Chen's family's heirloom

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,700
was not easy to get.

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,980
And the suspect was among the six of them.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,060
In this city of crime,

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,820
everyone has their own secrets.

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,100
The first-in-law Chen's family's heirloom

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,900
Do you want to find it?

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,020
I don't know.

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,060
I really don't know where it is.

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,100
The second-in-law Chen's family's heirloom

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Do you know this?

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,100
You have no way out.

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,100
You broke into the place without a door.

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Chen's family's heirloom

33
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,100
You also stole the double jade.

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
What?

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,100
You're back?

36
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,100
No.

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Come on.

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
Come here.

39
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,100
Sorry.

40
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,100
Foreigners just came back from abroad.

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
I don't understand.

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
My name is Yan Lei.

43
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Hello.

44
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Liu Yang came back.

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
Come on.

46
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,100
Say a few words in Niu.

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Niu.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
Hello.

49
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,100
I'm a little sick.

50
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
I'm a little sick.

51
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
What does it mean?

52
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
Say you're handsome.

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
You choose it yourself.

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,100
Handsome.

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,100
What does it mean?

56
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
Warm you with a smile.

57
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
What's wrong?

58
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Do you want me to jump up and stick my ears to your mouth?

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
I don't know.

60
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
Squat down and talk.

61
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Come on.

62
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
What does it mean?

63
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
Warm you with a smile.

64
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
You've seen the end of the next door.

65
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
The person who stole things

66
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
must be among you.

67
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
The hardest is useless.

68
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Stealing things.

69
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Someone stole things.

70
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,100
What is stealing?

71
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,100
What does it mean?

72
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Aren't you French?

73
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,100
Why do you learn to be like a Japanese?

74
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,100
I have the rules of the police station.

75
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,100
I have the strength and means.

76
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Let me think about

77
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,100
how to beat you.

78
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
Who will start first?

79
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Learn the bird language first.

80
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,100
Come on.

81
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,100
Help me.

82
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
No.

83
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
I'm not afraid of you.

84
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
I'm not afraid of you.

85
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,100
I'm not afraid of you.

86
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,100
I'm not afraid of you.

87
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
I'm not afraid of you.

88
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
I'm not afraid of you.

89
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Come on.

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
What are you doing?

91
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,940
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,420
Everyone,

93
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,780

94
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,060

95
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,900
One of you?

96
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,500
Who?

97
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,300
Well...

98
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,180
It's you. Come here.

99
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,580
There are two people

100
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,900
you trust.

101
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,340
Get back to work.

102
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,780
OMG!

103
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,420

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,140

Goodbye.

111
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,540
Choose another one.

112
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,580
Who?

113
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,380
Choose...

114
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Let them each show their talents.

115
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,020
No.

116
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,780
We don't know

117
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,380
if this is a good thing or a bad thing.

118
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,820
Rock-paper-scissors.

119
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,460
Rock-paper-scissors.

120
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,940
We two.

121
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,380
Rock-paper-scissors.

122
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,780
No.

123
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,900
No.

124
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,260
Never leave.

125
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,580
Never separate.

126
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,660
No.

127
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,620
We never leave.

128
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,220
Yes.

You go.

132
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,900

Goodbye.

134
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,260
I'll bring my dowry.

135
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,620
I'm the dowry.

136
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,460
Okay.

137
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,260
We've made our choice.

138
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,060
They may not be good players.

139
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,580
It's okay.

140
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,220
We're teammates.

141
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,020
We're teammates now.

142
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,580

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,420
Bye.

149
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,860
Let's go.

150
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,740
Hurry up.

151
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,100
Bye.

152
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,940
Bye.

Bye.

156
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,540
Where are we going now?

157
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,580
Let's find the fortune teller first.

158
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,700
Fortune teller?

159
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,140
Where can we find the fortune teller?

160
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,260
Let's take a walk.

161
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,900
Let's find it.

162
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,780
Let's go this way.

163
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,300
This way.

164
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:39,800
The Mushroom religions are the collective

165
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,340
of thoseBuddha and Mahayana.

166
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,960
I miss tasty foods.

167
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,300
I miss tasty foods in the Hard Valley.

168
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,780
I miss tasty food in the Hard Valley.

169
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,020
But I need.

170
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,220
A נorenko.

171
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,660
Put some oil on it.

172
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,860
Put some oil on it.

173
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,500
Put it on.

174
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,140
Sit.

175
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,860
Come closer.

176
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
I'll change it.

177
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,700
It's on.

178
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,900
It's on.

179
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,900
Try it.

180
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
It's on.

181
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,860
It's not that one.

182
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,740
It's on.

183
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,460
It's on.

184
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,100
It's not washing.

185
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,380
It's washing the air.

186
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,340
This air

187
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,740
represents that you two are like a pair of cogs.

188
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,900
You can gather wealth,

189
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,820
you can walk in a big circle,

190
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,220
you can be rich.

191
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,980
Do you know that?

192
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,740
I know.

193
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,580
Among you three,

194
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,500
there seems to be a line

195
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,620
that is drawn here.

196
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,700
I don't know.

197
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,420
Come on.

198
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
Stand here.

199
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,380
Stand here.

200
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,620
I'll close it.

201
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,180
I'll close it.

202
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,340
This is a red line.

203
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,020
It seems to be between you three.

204
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,380
Which two are they?

205
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,660
I think

206
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,180
you must know it.

207
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,300
Who doesn't know that?

208
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,940
The weather is not to be revealed.

209
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,900
I know

210
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,380
why you came here.

211
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,300
But

212
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,500
I just said

213
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,380
the weather

214
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,780
can't be revealed.

215
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,420
Unless

216
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,300
you give me sea turtle soup.

217
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Sea turtle soup.

218
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
I like it the most.

219
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,180
Come on.

220
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,140
I will only answer you

221
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,620
yes or no.

222
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,660
If you answer wrongly,

223
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
I have a sacred oil here

224
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,380
to guarantee your wisdom.

225
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,620
If you answer the soup

226
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,460
in ten sentences,

227
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,380
I will give you

228
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,660
what you want.

229
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,340
Search here.

230
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,780
I'll search.

231
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,060
Search.

232
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,820
There is a woman

233
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,300
who bought a pair of high heels

234
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,780
and wore them to work.

235
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,660
But she died.

236
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,300
Why?

237
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,060
The high heels broke.

238
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,300
No.

239
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,060
Are high heels from someone else?

240
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,340
No.

241
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,180
She is...

242
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,980
She killed herself.

243
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,020
No.

244
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,300
If you answer wrongly,

245
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,100
I'll give you a sip.

246
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,540
Come on.

247
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,900
The wisdom is great.

248
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,580
Oh, no.

249
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,700
It must be very sour.

250
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,940
It's chestnut flavor.

251
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,100
It's not sour at all.

252
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,980
I can't.

253
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
It's delicious.

254
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,700
Yours must be sweet.

255
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,940
Yours must be sweet.

256
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,860
Why are you like this?

257
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,140
Why are you like this?

258
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,180
It's a kind of love.

259
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,660
From now on, they are the same.

260
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,860
OK.

261
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,100
You can ask the question.

262
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,980
Someone in the company

263
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,900
was jealous of her beauty

264
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,220
and killed herself with high heels.

265
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,700
No.

266
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,460
It's not that.

267
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:08,980
Come on.

268
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,100
You are still not clear.

269
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,740
What are you eating?

270
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,900
You are waiting for the monkey to cut off the heel.

271
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,780
Eat.

272
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,460
You two are wrong.

273
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,380
Wrong.

274
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,980
Hello, I'm Zai Zai.

275
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,020
I haven't asked.

276
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,660
It's not that you two

277
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,940
are going to fight with each other.

278
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,980
I want to ask you.

279
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,060
I can't think of it.

280
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,180
Do you need help?

281
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,100
We got it.

282
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,460
We have got the clue.

283
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,860
Can we leave now?

284
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,620
No one is stopping you.

285
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,700
We won't let you go.

286
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,100
We are leaving, too.

287
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,260
You go to find the boss of the study.

288
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,420
There is a dice in turn.

289
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,780
If the number of dice you three

290
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,300
have counted is 13,

291
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,820
you will pass the game.

292
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:06,860
Six.

293
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,340
Eleven.

294
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,060
Two.

295
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
It's OK.

296
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,180
Let's do it again.

297
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,500
Come on.

298
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,460
OK.

299
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,900
I wish you a good trip.

300
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,940
What are you?

301
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,660
A woman.

302
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,180
She wore high heels.

303
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,700
She died when she arrived at the company.

304
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,740
The sea turtle soup, right?

305
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,820
Yes, the soup.

306
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,500
OK.

307
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,020
The sea turtle soup.

308
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,940
I'm good at it.

309
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,940
Come on.

310
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,860
Let me ask you the first question.

311
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,020
She killed him.

312
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,300
The man killed her.

313
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
The sea turtle soup.

314
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,220
The sea turtle soup.

315
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,060
Is it related to the man?

316
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,460
Is the man her boss?

317
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,460
No, it's her colleague.

318
00:12:59,460 --> 00:12:59,900
Come on.

319
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,180
OK.

320
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,700
It's her colleague.

321
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,500
She said it.

322
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,260
Come on.

323
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,100
I'll eat for her.

324
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,980
Thank you.

325
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,580
Why did she wear high heels

326
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,780
and kill her colleague?

327
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,500
She killed her.

328
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,180
I think it's strange.

329
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,180
Is there a mental problem with that man?

330
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,660
No.

331
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,260
Come on.

332
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,260
What's wrong?

333
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,980
It's too sour.

334
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,340
Teacher, please give me some hints.

335
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,540
Is it a normal reason

336
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,020
or a very ridiculous reason?

337
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,700
A normal reason.

338
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,900
A normal reason.

339
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,300
The reason why the man killed her

340
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,020
is because

341
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,020
she wore high heels.

342
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,580
Yes.

343
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,260
The woman wore high heels

344
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,300
and killed her

345
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,700
because she was taller than her.

346
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,740
Half.

347
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,900
I know.

348
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
I guess

349
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,460
the man killed her by mistake.

350
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,820
He might have killed someone taller than her.

351
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,140
But the woman wore high heels

352
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,300
and killed her.

353
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,980
It's possible.

354
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,820
Is it a mistake?

355
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,340
Yes.

356
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,860
Look.

357
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,100
OK, the last question.

358
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,620
A mistake.

359
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,860
It means that she wore high heels

360
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,340
and killed someone taller than her.

361
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,980
OK, it's a colleague.

362
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,140
She killed her.

363
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,820
Then the man killed her.

364
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,780
Maybe it's a mistake.

365
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,380
Is it possible?

366
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,500
Is it possible that

367
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,780
the man is a magician?

368
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,380
And then she...

369
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,420
And then this woman

370
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,620
suddenly wore high heels

371
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,580
and the height was different.

372
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,540
So her organs

373
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,580
and everything was different.

374
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,740
Is it possible?

375
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,660
OK.

376
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,700
Correct.

377
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,980
Congratulations.

378
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
So cool.

379
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,020
Can I follow

380
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,020
my sister-in-law and brother to investigate the case?

381
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,340
An Xin Suo.

382
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:16,140
The fate is in the hands of fate.

383
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,340
Xiao You.

384
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,740
Please keep it.

385
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,860
Let's see.

386
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,500
Let's see first.

387
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,340
And you can also see first.

388
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,380
Let's exchange it.

389
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,740
Yes.

390
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,940
So we're going to Bai Le Men.

391
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,020
We seem to go to Bai Le Men.

392
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,220
Don't push me to微 cordial for a moment.

393
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,740
Sister, I have a feeling

394
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:55,300
Her own

395
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,580
beautiful

396
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,220
beautiful

397
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,260
beautiful

398
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,860
Those who are noisy

399
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,460
That's what she meant

400
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,560
Teacher Liang

401
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,880
I just felt something

402
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,540
Mr. Chen

403
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,580
This not

404
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,740
Mr. Chen

405
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,320
This not

406
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,060
It's

407
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
Excuse me, are you Mr. Chen

408
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,900
Amazing

409
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,580
How can you close in

410
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,860
collaboration

411
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,980
What's it

412
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,860
Cheers

413
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,940
Hello, handsome men and beautiful women.

414
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,100
We, Bailu Men,

415
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
are recruiting men and women.

416
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,460
Are you interested in trying it?

417
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,620
Where are you holding your hands?

418
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,740
Come on, Peng.

419
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,780
Please step up.

420
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,860
I see that you all have some basics.

421
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,940
Don't hide it.

422
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,540
Is there any trick?

423
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,900
I can do popping.

424
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,060
Then you can do popping.

425
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,540
Come on.

426
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,620
I can do popping with my fingers.

427
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,540
Popping.

428
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,140
Popping.

429
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,780
Popping.

430
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
Popping.

431
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,780
Then...

432
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:15,980
Popping.

433
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,940
How to do this?

434
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,300
Isn't it like this?

435
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,220
If we all know it,

436
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,020
it's not popping.

437
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,820
Yes.

438
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,180
We two can do it now.

439
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,020
Is it called popping?

440
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,100
You...

441
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,700
OK.

442
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,380
OK.

443
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:29,940
I'll do that.

444
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,820
I don't believe it.

445
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,060
Is there any popping?

446
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,820
Who has it?

447
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,780
I can do the chorus.

448
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,380
Can I?

449
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:35,900
Yes.

450
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,060
It's so smooth.

451
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,300
It's amazing.

452
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,340
Any male can do this.

453
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,820
I can't.

454
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,100
Now, let's welcome

455
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,140
Mr. Chen Hongsheng

456
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,740
to come up to the stage and say a few words.

457
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,220
OK?

458
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,500
Come on, let's welcome him.

459
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,740
It's been a long time.

460
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
Come on, be careful.

461
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,060
It's been a long time, Boss Liu.

462
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,500
These are

463
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,180
our new dancers.

464
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,140
I'm Chen Hongsheng.

465
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,300
Welcome to the stage.

466
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,180
Tonight,

467
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,100
I'll be the one who gives you the treasure.

468
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,900
Double jade.

469
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,340
The thief is inside the stage.

470
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,100
The thief's jewelry is very special.

471
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,580
The jewelry is very special.

472
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,100
It's his.

473
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,580
Your jewelry.

474
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,460
Oh my god.

475
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,740
That night, my security

476
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,140
was hit by a shield

477
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,460
and I was knocked out on the spot.

478
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,980
Tonight,

479
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,980
I just want to show you the secret sword.

480
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,940
Let's see who is the most suspicious.

481
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,140
Boss, don't do this again.

482
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,940
It's Yu.

483
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,100
I got it.
