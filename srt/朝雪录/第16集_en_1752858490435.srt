00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 5

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's so cold.

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You should go.

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Master, I'm wrong.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I forgot that you just made the new love with Jiu Niangzi.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's the time when the two of you are like a inseparable couple.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I promise that in the future, as long as Jiu Niangzi is here, we'll hide far away.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No, I dare not to break into again.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Enough, enough.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Stop your nonsense.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,640
Yes.

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,640
Tell me.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,080
What's the urgent news?

17
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,760
Marquis Zhong Yong was ordered by Prince Yu

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
to send them to Yuzhou

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
to celebrate Prince Yu's birthday.

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,520
I'm afraid

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,840
we can't follow Jiu Niangzi anymore.

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,160
Even the old man who only knows

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,440
to eat, drink and gamble

24
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
is going to be dragged away.

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,560
Marquis Zhong Yong is getting more and more aggressive.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
Prince Yu is the only uncle of His Majesty.

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,640
His status is on the line.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,440
If it's really for the birthday,

29
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,000
why do you bring a woman's scroll?

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,080
There are three women who are married to the emperor.

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,800
You mean

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,600
Zhong Yonghong is going to send his niece

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
to be his concubine?

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
That's so shameless.

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,840
No matter what,

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,400
we should be prepared.

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,400
Who else is going to celebrate the birthday in the capital?

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,640
I was just about to say that

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
His Majesty doesn't care about it.

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,680
He asked us to

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
make a grand birthday party for Prince Yu

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,240
in person.

43
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,480
A banquet?

44
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,640
That's great.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,720
Let's go.

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,040
Jiu Niangzi is drunk.

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,280
Fortunately, she brought an old man

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
to make up for her drunkness.

49
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,440
I'm

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,120
just showing off

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
in front of Jiu Niangzi.

52
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,720
Here, drink it while it's hot.

53
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,640
Thank you for your concern.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,960
You're welcome.

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,800
His Highness would risk his life

56
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,720
to save you.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm not afraid of such trivial things.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,400
Don't worry, writing can always be helpful.

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
Prince Yu has such a rough RA of work.

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,080
Jiu Niangzi is among family miles.

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,680
You must remember that in every thus Wayne.

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,800
You really understand me.

63
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,040
It's no wonder that this takes you so seriously.

64
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,920
Iå®¹ tide has entrusted even

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,600
the Crown Prince of Prince Rui to you.

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,160
I'm much flattered.

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,600
Do you know how effective this token is?

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,400
No.

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
This token is like the crown prince's personal gift.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
You can call the local lord directly.

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
If someone who wants to get it,

72
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,840
raise an army and rebel,

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
it will be easy to be defeated.

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,640
This token is so precious.

75
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,600
I must return it to you as soon as possible.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,200
Don't worry, Jiu.

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
You are so kind to me.

78
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,600
I will be blessed in the future.

79
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,920
If you want,

80
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,560
we will help you to achieve your goal.

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
What do you mean?

82
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,320
I don't understand.

83
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,120
Why are you shy?

84
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,800
His Highness just gave you ginger soup.

85
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,720
I saw it with my own eyes.

86
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
You misunderstood me.

87
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,440
That ginger soup was a loss for me.

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,080
I was afraid that you would complain to the princess.

89
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,840
So I was here to apologize.

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,640
Really?

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,440
Yes.

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,240
Since I was adopted by Marquis Anyang,

93
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,080
His Highness has treated me like a family member.

94
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,440
But I dare not to do that.

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,840
You are right.

96
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,440
I was too considerate.

97
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,400
I just got the surgery from my father.

98
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
He told us to go to Yuzhou.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,160
If you can make it,

100
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,840
we will set off tomorrow.

101
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,680
Why?

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,520
His Highness is the 60th birthday.

103
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,600
He has a son.

104
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,240
He gave the imperial edict to our family.

105
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,720
Your father is a minister of the Ministry of Personnel.

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
Yuzhou is not far from here.

107
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,280
We can go there and congratulate him.

108
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,120
I see.

109
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,240
I see.

110
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,480
You must be tired.

111
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,520
Go to have a rest.

112
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,720
I will arrange the trip.

113
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,840
Okay.

114
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,000
poison

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,320
Purple

116
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,760
I think we should have a good chat.

117
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,080
We can engage them crack.

118
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,440
03

119
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,400
ACC specially shaped

120
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
I just wrote Yan Li's handbook and it also mentioned the reason

121
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
He will definitely report to the emperor

122
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,400
If I can find a way to get rid of the Du Chou in Yuzhou

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
The emperor will be more happy

124
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Master is indeed a master

125
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Everything about going to Yuzhou is arranged properly

126
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Report to the big master

127
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Everything is fine

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Now I can reunite with the ninth lady

129
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,400
And meet with Li's brother

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
And I can also find some corrupt officials

131
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I admire you

132
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Master Qin

133
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Your highness

134
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Master Qin

135
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
I just received a letter

136
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
I will go to Yuzhou tomorrow

137
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm afraid I have to entrust you to take good care of it

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
What a coincidence

139
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,400
We will also change to Yuzhou to celebrate the birthday of the emperor

140
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Then we can go together

141
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm going to arrange a carriage

142
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,400
If you need anything, just tell me

143
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Then there will be a caravan going to the house tomorrow

144
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Report to the prince

145
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
All the carriage are ready to go

146
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Can leave at any time

147
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Ok, then I will leave on time tomorrow

148
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Your Highness, wait

149
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
What's up

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Steward Zhou, arrange it

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Say it

152
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Your Highness

153
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Jiu Mei said that you protected her well

154
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
And gave her the crown prince's order

155
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Although I am grateful, I also worry about you

156
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
The crown prince's order can mobilize the best soldiers in the world

157
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Such valuable things

158
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
If it falls into the hands of outsiders

159
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Have you ever thought about the consequences?

160
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
If a token can make the world upside down

161
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
What's the use of me still holding it?

162
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I am a little bit of a coward

163
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
I have admired you for a long time

164
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I have a lot to ask for advice in the future

165
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Please give me a little advice

166
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Although I am in the capital

167
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
But I haven't given the task of taking the army

168
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
If you go too close to the capital's royal family

169
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
I'm afraid the emperor will not like it

170
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
It's not good for the Central Marquis's mansion

171
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Yes, I am reckless

172
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
I advise you to shut your mouth

173
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
If the secret escape is spread out

174
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
You only have one death

175
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I don't know he is an imposter

176
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
If I know

177
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
That's you stupid

178
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
If you are at ease in the future

179
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,400
The Central Marquis's mansion will not be lacking you

180
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
If you dare to be reckless

181
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Don't blame this world for not allowing you

182
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Do you understand?

183
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
I understand

184
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Good

185
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
No wonder you want to take us together

186
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I didn't expect the Central Marquis to be so dirty

187
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
The position of the Central Marquis is given by the military

188
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
The position of the Central Marquis is given by the military

189
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
It's in vain to be in the role of the general

190
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
To make a contribution

191
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Pass on this position

192
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
They are responsible for both

193
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I'm afraid I can't even kill

194
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
That Prince Yu is also an old man

195
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
So old and greedy

196
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
If he wants to be greedy

197
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
How can he have a child at the age of sixty?

198
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Who knows if he gave birth to that child?

199
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Anyway, no matter what they do

200
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
We won't let him succeed

201
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Take it back

202
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
If I knew this token is so powerful

203
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I will never take it out

204
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
No matter how the eyes are

205
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
He said he couldn't cause trouble for you

206
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
I dare to give you

207
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm not afraid of trouble

208
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Besides, I will guard you in the future

209
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm much stronger than the token

210
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Lady

211
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
You are so late

212
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Lady, you should rest earlier

213
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
This Bai Feng and Fulin are really a match

214
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I'll make it up to you

215
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Go back quickly

216
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Go

217
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Go

218
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Senior

219
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Are you really going to stay in the prairie?

220
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
The villagers of the prairie are suffering from the poison

221
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I'm afraid your situation is also very difficult

222
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Senior, because of obsession

223
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
I committed an unforgivable crime

224
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
But medical skills have no good or evil

225
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Since he has his life

226
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Since he has his life

227
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Then he made the mistake

228
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
I will take it for him

229
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Senior, I promise

230
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Your Highness

231
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
I beg you

232
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Yes, your highness

233
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
The people in the city are listening

234
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
The people in the city are listening

235
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
The people in the city are listening

236
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
The people in the city are listening

237
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
The people in the city are listening

238
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
The people in the city are listening

239
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
The people in the city are listening

240
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
The people in the city are listening

241
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
The people in the city are listening

242
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
The people in the city are listening

243
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
The people in the city are listening

244
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
The people in the city are listening

245
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
The people in the city are listening

246
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
The people in the city are listening

247
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
The people in the city are listening

248
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Open the gate quickly

249
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Is there anyone?

250
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Open the gate quickly

251
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Is there anyone?

252
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Young master

253
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Young master

254
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I called for a long time

255
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
No one answered the gate

256
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Wife

257
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Why is the gate closed in the daytime?

258
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Why is the gate closed in the daytime?

259
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Is there anything wrong?

260
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Prince of Rui is here

261
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Listen to the order

262
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Open the gate immediately

263
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Open the gate quickly

264
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,400
It's Li

265
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Why is he here?

266
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Who is he?

267
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
He is the son of the emperor

268
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Brother Qi's concubine

269
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:18,260
The first

270
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
The second

271
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
The third

272
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
The fourth

273
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
The fifth

274
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
The sixth

275
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
The seventh

276
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
The eighth

277
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
The ninth

278
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
The tenth

279
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
The tenth

280
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
The tenth

281
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
The tenth

282
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
The tenth

283
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
The tenth

284
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,400
How scary is the look of the prince Yan's eyes?

285
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Brother Qi, you finally came

286
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I miss you so much

287
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
It's you, kid

288
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Close the city gate and don't let the people in and out

289
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
How to enter the gate without closing

290
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Know you're coming

291
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
I specifically enter the gate

292
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
The principle is the same

293
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Foolish

294
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
If I'm not a fool,

295
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
am I still a fool?

296
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,960
Greetings, Prince Yi.

297
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,040
Childe Qin.

298
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,360
It's been a few days,

299
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,200
but you're still so weak.

300
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Why are you in a carriage?

301
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,560
How can I compare with you?

302
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,200
Greetings, Your Highness.

303
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,000
Childe,

304
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,640
the housekeeper of Pang Mansion has been waiting for you at the gate.

305
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,680
Pang Mansion?

306
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,160
No wonder the House of Marquis Zhongyong is rich.

307
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,040
It turns out that the most rich man in the northwest,

308
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
Liang Pang Mansion,

309
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,440
has a family.

310
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,800
Your Highness, you're joking.

311
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,400
My father and my father have known each other for a long time.

312
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,320
At that time, the House of Pang Mansion was not so rich.

313
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,240
But...

314
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
It's getting late.

315
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,840
There are still women in the carriage.

316
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,040
If you want to go to Pang Mansion,

317
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,320
please leave as soon as possible.

318
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,640
Please excuse me.

319
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,160
Goodbye.

320
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,800
After so many years,

321
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,720
you haven't changed at all.

322
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,200
Who told him to be so fake?

323
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,120
It looks annoying.

324
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,160
What's the point of being so talkative?

325
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,920
It's very interesting.

326
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,760
I like to see these people who are so talkative

327
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,280
but can't get over me.

328
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,800
Where are you going?

329
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,720
You just came back.

330
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,640
I...

331
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,040
I'm going to talk to Ning'er.

332
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
She's here too?

333
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,240
If she knows that I'm with you,

334
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
she must follow me.

335
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,640
I finally reverse

336
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,760
Prince Yu's reception party.

337
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,600
Tonight, I'm going to show you a lot of real mer IT.

338
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:20,920
Goodbye.

339
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,260
Tutaj.

340
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,020
Let's go.

341
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Let's go.

342
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Let's go.

343
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,460
This is the ten-room inn of the Pang family.

344
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,060
It's so luxurious.

345
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,940
I heard that every town in the northwest

346
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,220
has a ten-room inn of the Pang family.

347
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,500
Where did they get so much money?

348
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,260
If you marry into such a family,

349
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,460
you'll be a businesswoman.

350
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,580
Is the Ninth Madam looking for the Crown Prince?

351
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,020
I'm looking at the scene.

352
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,140
Prince Yi has something important to discuss with you.

353
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,100
You've told me that

354
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
you can tell me anything.

355
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
It's nothing.

356
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Please.

357
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,780
Young Master.

358
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,780
Young Master.

359
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,660
Young Master Qin has arrived.

360
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Young Master Pang.

361
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,380
Stop here.

362
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,820
Steward Zhou, come here.

363
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,220
I'll take you to get your luggage.

364
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,740
Little Monkey Qin.

365
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,220
It's so nice to meet you.

366
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,820
I'm Pang Yiwen.

367
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,900
I was busy with the banquet of Prince Yu.

368
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,380
I couldn't meet you at the gate.

369
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,980
If I'm not polite enough,

370
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,580
I hope you can forgive me.

371
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,900
You're Young Master Pang.

372
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,900
I've known you for a long time.

373
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,980
I'm flattered.

374
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,140
My father has long been waiting for you.

375
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,340
He's in the kitchen.

376
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
It's been a long time.

377
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,780
I'm flattered.

378
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,020
Please forgive me.

379
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,740
Why not?

380
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,140
I'll be the Crown Prince sooner or later.

381
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,700
Oh.

382
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,900
This is Princess Yongning.

383
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,500
And my sister, Jiao.

384
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Sixth sister.

385
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,700
I'm a princess after all.

386
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,460
How dare Pang Fuliang

387
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,300
not come to visit me personally?

388
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,300
He sent a man with such a sharp sword

389
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,580
to torture me.

390
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,620
He's really a man of his word.

391
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,100
Fifth sister.

392
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,900
Young Master Pang.

393
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Young Master Pang.

394
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Oh.

395
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,500
Please come in.

396
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,700
What's the rule?

397
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,900
If it's just a normal valley,

398
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,900
he wouldn't have the guts to do that.

399
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,500
He can see my third brother's

400
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
acting as usual.

401
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,500
It's the usual way of Pang's Mansion.

402
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
We need to see

403
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,900
who they're relying on.

404
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,700
Then we can say it out loud.

405
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,500
Okay.

406
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
I'm so tired.

407
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,500
I'm going to sleep.

408
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,700
I'm going to sleep.

409
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
I'm going to sleep.

410
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm going to sleep.

411
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
I'm going to sleep.

412
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm going to sleep.

413
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
I'm going to sleep.

414
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
I'm going to sleep.

415
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
I'm going to sleep.

416
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,500
Master.

417
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,300
I can only help you here.

418
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
Don't tell anyone about this.

419
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,700
Be careful.

420
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Ladies and gentlemen.

421
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,300
This is the female house.

422
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,700
This is the upper room.

423
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,900
I'm the oldest among sisters.

424
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,300
I own the upper room.

425
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,500
Wu.

426
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Stop.

427
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,700
We haven't decided yet.

428
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,300
I'm the princess.

429
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,900
Why do you own the upper room?

430
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
You...

431
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,900
Just let her be.

432
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,900
How about this?

433
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
You live in the east.

434
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,300
I live in the east.

435
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,900
Sixth sister lives in the west.

436
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,700
Wanhe and Fulin live in the west.

437
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
Is that okay?

438
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,100
You're so...

439
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,900
You're so smart.

440
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,900
You don't have any faith in normal things.

441
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,700
You're not angry even if I step on your head.

442
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
I'm not angry about this.

443
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,500
Anyway, you can live next door.

444
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,900
I'll come over quietly.

445
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,300
Isn't that better?

446
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,700
That's okay.

447
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,700
Let's go.

448
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Fifth sister is so spoiled.

449
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
She doesn't care about her sister at all.

450
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
What's going on?

451
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,100
What's going on?

452
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
What's going on?

453
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
What's going on?

454
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,300
The Double-Qing Class is here.

455
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,700
The Double-Qing Class is here.

456
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,500
The Double-Qing Class is here.

457
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Yang Ying.

458
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,100
Don't stand here.

459
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Show your face.

460
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Yes, class leader.

461
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,100
Please forgive me, brothers.

462
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
I...

463
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,500
I'm the subordinate of the Qingli class leader.

464
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,100
I'm the subordinate of the subordinate of the class leader, Yang Ying.

465
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,500
This time, the Double-Qing Class

466
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,900
is celebrating the birthday of Prince Yu.

467
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Please give us a cloth.

468
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,100
Thank you.

469
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,500
Thank you.

470
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
The subordinate of the Qingli class leader is so generous.

471
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,100
The mother of the subordinate of the Qingli class leader is a great help.

472
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Yes.

473
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,300
Please give us a cloth.

474
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
Thank you.

475
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,300
Although the Pang family doesn't have a proper taste,

476
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
they really don't spend much money on the invitation.

477
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Waner.

478
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,100
You're not thinking about Brother Qi, right?

479
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,100
You don't even care about me when I talk to you.

480
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm listening.

481
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,500
I'm just thinking

482
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,100
what's the emergency for Prince Yu to be so anxious to find him?

483
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,100
What's the emergency for Yanli, the devil of the mixed world?

484
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,700
He must be taking Brother Qi to the place of fireworks.

485
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
What?

486
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,500
Who let him be the first prince of the capital to cry?

487
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,900
Men gather together

488
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,500
to have fun and have fun.

489
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,100
It's inevitable.

490
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Don't take it seriously.

491
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,500
How can I not take it seriously?

492
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,700
Why is it inevitable?

493
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Well...

494
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,900
Tomorrow we have a birthday party.

495
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,900
You should rest early.

496
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
I'm leaving.

497
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,500
Don't tell Brother Qi that I lost.

498
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,500
Prince Yu, please forgive us.

499
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,900
Be careful of the steps.

500
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Prince Yu, please drink a cup of wine.

501
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
Prince Yu, please drink a cup of wine.

502
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,700
Prince Yu, please drink a cup of wine.

503
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,700
Come on.

504
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,500
Give Brother Qi a toast.

505
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,300
Take care of him.

506
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
I'm willing to reward you.

507
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,500
Prince Yu, please drink a cup of wine.

508
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,340
High five

509
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,880
Brother Qi

510
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,700
Don't be angry

511
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,520
If you don't like them, let them go

512
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,720
You want to use the form of singing and dancing to Tuesday for me

513
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,440
You can hear it on your own

514
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,200
I won't go home until I take a breath

515
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,340
I dare not

516
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,280
Brother

517
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,500
spent many years

518
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,280
Why are you so Punktillist?

519
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Are you still keeping your body as it is?

520
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
It's none of your business.

521
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
I'm just concerned about you.

522
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
So what?

523
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
No way.

524
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
You really want to get married into the bridal chamber?

525
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Your smile is so gentle.

526
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,280
You have someone in your heart, right?

527
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
When did it happen?

528
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
Which girl?

529
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
No, no, no.

530
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Don't say that.

531
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Let me guess.

532
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
You don't like any of the ladies in Qingcheng.

533
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
Where is Qingzhou?

534
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Yuning?

535
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
No, no, no.

536
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
I don't like that crazy girl.

537
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
You are impossible.

538
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
And then...

539
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,760
Could it be the girl in the plain dress of the Qin family?

540
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
It's really her.

541
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,760
You are so mean.

542
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
If you still disrespect her,

543
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
don't blame me for being rude to you.

544
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,760
Brother, you are so mean.

545
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
I treat you as my brother.

546
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
I don't allow anyone to bully you.

547
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,760
I treat her as my wife.

548
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,760
I don't allow anyone to disrespect her.

549
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Including you.

550
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Brother, don't be angry.

551
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
I'm not a man.

552
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
You know I don't have a woman in my heart.

553
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,240
I will treat her as a Bodhisattva.

554
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
I can even treat her as a horse.

555
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Get out.

556
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
You are not a horse.

557
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
You are right.

558
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
You are here,

559
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
I don't need to be bullied.

560
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Get out.

561
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Leave me alone.

562
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Brother,

563
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
I have something to tell you.

564
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
This is the list of guests for the birthday banquet.

565
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Prince Yu knows you are here and he wants to tell me

566
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,240
to keep the one who is unhappy away from you.

567
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
You are so mean.

568
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
I'm afraid you are not a man.

569
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
I heard you found the corrupt Yan Yun.

570
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
How many places are you not happy to see?

571
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Li Muyun.

572
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
He is the new Minister of Dali Temple.

573
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Since the King of Jin...

574
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Anyway,

575
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
since that time,

576
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
he is the favorite of His Majesty.

577
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I told His Majesty about Yan Yun's corruption.

578
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
His Majesty sent him here.

579
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Maybe he wants to suppress Prince Yu

580
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
or the official position of Yuzhou.

581
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Brother Jin is in a terrible situation.

582
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Li Muyun and Shen Yi

583
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
are connected by the crime of colluding with Prince Yu.

584
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
If it wasn't for the advice of Shen Yi,

585
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
he would still be a low-rank official in the local government.

586
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
But he betrayed his master

587
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
for his own promotion.

588
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I don't deal with such a man who is ungrateful.

589
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Okay,

590
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
let's take him to the gallows.

591
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
No need.

592
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Do as he should.

593
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Stay away from me.

594
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Okay.

595
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Liu Renli, the transfer of Jianghuai Road, is also here.

596
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
I can drive him away.

597
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Keep him.

598
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Brother,

599
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
he is not clean.

600
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
He can even drive me away.

601
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Why do you still tolerate him?

602
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Liu Renli

603
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
has spent more than ten years

604
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
from the small county in the past

605
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
to the transfer of Jianghuai Road

606
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
and the tea and salt processing.

607
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
He has done a lot of things.

608
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
He and the fellow villagers of Panghu

609
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
always visit the small village of Pang every New Year.

610
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
It's early this year.

611
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
I'm afraid that he heard the news

612
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
that His Majesty would check the south-eastern salt processing.

613
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I heard that he returned to the capital to work in the past year.

614
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Before he arrived in Tongzhou,

615
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,160
he had been sent to the house of the heads of the departments.

616
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Now it's the end of the year.

617
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
He didn't rush to the capital to work,

618
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
but he came to the universe to make some trouble.

619
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,640
Qingli is a bitch.

620
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
He is not even good enough to be a double-dealer.

621
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Now he is trying to trick us.

622
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,640
If you can beat him this time,

623
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
he will use this matter to threaten you next time.

624
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Do you still want to raise him for the rest of his life?

625
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,640
If I can get to Shi Fang Inn,

626
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,640
what can the few taels of silver he wants be counted?

627
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
Nonsense.

628
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Shi Fang Inn is the lifeblood of Pang Fuliang.

629
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
He doesn't allow anyone to touch it.

630
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
How can we know if we don't try?

631
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
In terms of it,

632
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
we should have our share.

633
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
If not back then...

634
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
You...

635
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
You...

636
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Double-dealer lives next door.

637
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
You should be careful of the walls.

638
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Qinghui Garden is so big.

639
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
The backyard is so far away.

640
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Besides,

641
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Double-dealer has nothing to do with me.

642
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
It's been so long.

643
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Why do you have to be so careful?

644
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
You don't understand the things in the official field.

645
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Now it's different from the past.

646
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
You can't make Pang Fuliang angry.

647
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
Then our...

648
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Don't mention it again.

649
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,600
The new Da Li Temple's Qing, Li Mu Yun and Yan Chi

650
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
suddenly came to Yuzhou.

651
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
They are not just

652
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,600
to celebrate a free and free Prince's birthday.

653
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Recently, I and Pang Fuliang

654
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
can't meet face to face.

655
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
I'll come to see you in a few days.

656
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Be careful.

657
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
I'm leaving.

658
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,680
There's something on the flavour board.

659
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
What's it?

660
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Itelijk.

661
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,520
Many countries share the same principles.

662
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,800
But in the fury ofain Finally people don't tell

663
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
it's the same as person,

664
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
so be careful.

665
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Leave?

666
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,600
Other countries,

667
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,040
there are more things you must be so careful about.

668
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:47,100
Il

669
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,060
l

670
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,960
e

671
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,640
The palace is really magnificent.

672
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,320
I'm afraid even the study of the Crown Prince

673
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,560
is a bit too much.

674
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,400
I'm just a merchant.

675
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,080
How dare I compare with the Crown Prince?

676
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,520
Although the Crown Prince is of high status,

677
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
he is in a high position.

678
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,680
It's inevitable that he will be in a high position.

679
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,520
If you want to be stable,

680
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,920
you still need to plan in various ways.

681
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,600
Please.

682
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,120
As a merchant,

683
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,120
you should be careful about your words.

684
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,120
If I can help you

685
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,960
to get rid of the burden,

686
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,960
I will definitely do it.

687
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,680
You are indeed a straightforward man.

688
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
No wonder my father

689
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,000
has always trusted you.

690
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,640
Without the help of Marquis Zhongyong,

691
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,280
the scenery of the ten guest houses today would be very different.

692
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,600
It's just a pity that

693
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,200
the business of the guest house is too obvious.

694
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,720
If you want to take a step closer,

695
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,360
you have to be more careful.

696
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,280
I know that this is exactly the right thing to do.

697
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,200
I will try my best to make it clear.

698
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,240
Yan?

699
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,000
Yan...

700
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,280
The gongy demasiado large.

701
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
After I tell my father

702
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,080
to report TWGANTO.

703
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,080
Should do so.

704
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Darling,

705
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,160
During transfer of Jianghuai-lu Martial Arts fabrics,

706
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,320
when carefully Somebody leaves missing contributed effort,

707
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,040
You are Pang Mu's old friend.

708
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,520
He is a generous man.

709
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,920
His teammates are very cautious.

710
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,920
He came to Yuzhou to celebrate Prince Yu's birthday.

711
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Why don't you explain to him

712
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,560
the reason why you know him?

713
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,920
Please allow me to introduce him to you.

714
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,280
Have some tea.

715
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,360
Please.

716
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,320
Welcome to here, Miss Fl now

717
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,200
to express our gratitude.

718
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,520
Quickly.

719
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,960
Lighten it up.

720
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,040
We can only save our lives.

721
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,000
Is that you?

722
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,360
Why does your body smell likeíì§ë¶?

723
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,840
I...

724
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,920
I...

725
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,240
In that place...

726
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,200
I mean...

727
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,040
the dragon.

728
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,440
But it's the first time I've been there.

729
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,400
I think Chen She is quite elegant.

730
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,840
I thought she was a brothel at first.

731
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,240
If you haven't been there,

732
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,200
how do you know if Chen She is elegant?

733
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,560
I heard it from someone else.

734
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,240
Someone else?

735
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,440
Who dares to say that in front of you?

736
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,320
It's...

737
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,600
It's just that we're here.

738
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,200
We just want to have a chat.

739
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,040
If you haven't been there,

740
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,480
how do you know it's a chat?

741
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,560
Because I don't need to go there.

742
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
We're not the ones who are addicted to it.

743
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,400
Every time I come down from the battlefield,

744
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,120
there will be a few people in the team.

745
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,960
They are all my brothers who have been with me for many years.

746
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,720
They were born and died.

747
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,480
Instead of making the living people addicted to sadness,

748
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,600
I'd rather they go to Dongla Xichu.

749
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,600
I asked you these

750
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,640
just to find out the truth.

751
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,320
I don't believe what you and your brother mean.

752
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,520
Later, I knew something was wrong with that place.

753
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,560
I drove them away immediately.

754
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,880
Trust me.

755
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,920
If I knew it was that kind of place,

756
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
I would never go there.

757
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,240
I'm sorry.

758
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,720
When I think about it,

759
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,280
you and those women are so close,

760
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,400
I feel uncomfortable.

761
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,840
Even if it's a show,

762
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,400
it's okay to be domineering and good-natured.

763
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,560
I'm just like this.

764
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm not virtuous and I like to be a troublemaker.

765
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,440
Do you regret it?

766
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,560
No.

767
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,160
I like you to be my betrothed.

768
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,040
You're still a Han man.

769
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
It's good that you know.

770
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,440
I forgive you.

771
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,080
Don't worry.

772
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,520
There won't be another time.

773
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,840
The eyes are wide open,

774
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,800
the smile is confident.

775
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,920
The old mother and the Prince Yu.

776
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,680
Why is there someone singing at this time?

777
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,600
This is the double-dead band

778
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,520
that Pang Fuliang invited to celebrate the birthday of Prince Yu.

779
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,480
It's in the backyard of Qinghui Garden.

780
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,680
What is this song?

781
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,440
The double-dead band's best play

782
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,600
is called The Mule and the Old Mother.

783
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
It's about the mother who can't bear to see her mother suffer in hell

784
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,360
and wants to go to the netherworld to save her mother.

785
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,960
If you can save your parents,

786
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,560
what will happen to the netherworld?

787
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,040
Waner,

788
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,480
we will definitely clear your parents' name.

789
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,920
Tomorrow,

790
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,120
Li Muyun will be here.

791
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,800
The Prime Minister is very important to her.

792
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,160
We can't be rash.

793
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,800
Don't worry.

794
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,080
I won't act rashly.

795
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,000
I know it's hard for you.

796
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,200
After returning to the capital,

797
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,040
I will find a way to restart the case of Prince Jin.

798
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,720
I won't let you wait too long.

799
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,800
Really?

800
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,120
I will try my best to fulfill your wish.

801
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,160
The Prime Minister is here!

802
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,120
She only has one day off before this good day.

803
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,920
May your Highness stay staying longer to prepare and have a good remaining year.

804
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,440
She is in a good mood right now.

805
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,820
I don't have to worry about her well being.

806
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,000
Right now,

807
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,400
If my plan is good,

808
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,920
then you must stay as healthy as there is.

809
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,520
You must have Ð¿ÑÐµÐ´å½ Pak Doi.

810
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,600
That's exactly it.

811
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:23,720
Maybe

812
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,920
you can take the plan.

813
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,080
Your Highness.

814
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,880
I beg for further word.

815
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,280
Xiaowan! Xiaowan!

816
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,840
Open the door!

817
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm freezing to death!

818
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,520
Coming!

819
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,120
The King of Yan

820
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,280
Come, come, come.

821
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,440
Thank you.

822
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,040
Come, come.

823
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,440
Congratulations.

824
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,920
Congratulations, Prince Yu.

825
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
Cheers.

826
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Cheers.

827
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,120
Cheers.

828
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Cheers.

829
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Cheers.

830
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
Cheers.

831
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Pour it in.

832
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,120
Cheers.

833
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,120
Cheers.

834
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
Cheers.

835
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,120
Yongning, you're so pretty.

836
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
I have a nephew.

837
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,120
He's 18 years old and still single.

838
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
He's a good match for you.

839
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,120
Princess Yu, I...

840
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,120
Princess, my nephew

841
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,120
is so handsome and handsome.

842
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,120
When do you have time to visit my mansion?

843
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,120
I'll introduce him to you.

844
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,120
Princess, you're so handsome.

845
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,120
You should choose a man to be your match.

846
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,120
Princess, you're pregnant.

847
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,120
Let's make a deal.

848
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
He's my VIP.

849
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
Nice.

850
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,120
The play is specially made for you.

851
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Qingli knows to give you a birthday.

852
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,120
He stayed up all night for this play.

853
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,120
My father always praised me.

854
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,120
I'm so talented.

855
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,120
I'm so honored to drink this.

856
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,120
You're too kind.

857
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
I'm not good at drinking.

858
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,120
Please forgive me.

859
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
No, no.

860
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
As you wish.

861
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
As you wish.

862
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
Brother Qi.

863
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,120
No need.

864
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,120
Cheers.

865
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,120
Lin Mu Yun.

866
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,120
Drink.

867
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
Drink.

868
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,120
The winter is in the snow

869
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,120
So cold

870
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,120
So warm

871
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,120
If a love

872
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,120
falls into the shadow

873
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,120
The snow falls

874
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,120
and the white snow falls

875
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,120
If a love

876
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,120
falls into the shadow

877
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,120
The pain will be

878
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,120
gone

879
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,120
Open your heart

880
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,120
Love doesn't matter the deep sea

881
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,120
Please give me courage

882
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,120
Let fate be open

883
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,120
Don't be afraid of the starlight

884
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,120
The moon will rise again

885
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,120
The stars will shine

886
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:33,120
beyond the sky

887
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,120
The sky is dim

888
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:44,120
But the stars are bright

889
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,120
The sky is dim

890
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,120
But the stars are bright

891
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,120
The sky is dim

892
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,120
But the stars are bright

893
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,120
The sky is dim

894
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,120
But the stars are bright

895
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,120
The sky is dim

896
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,120
But the stars are bright

897
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,120
The sky is dim

898
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,120
But the stars are bright
