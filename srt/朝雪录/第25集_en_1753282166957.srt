00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Your Highness, you are so kind.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Is there anything you want to ask me?

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I know what I want.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But I'm in the position of the Crown Prince.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I have to do something.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have to prove it.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But His Majesty blamed you for the Crown Prince's danger.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Fortunately, the Ninth Lady saved the Crown Prince.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And helped Yan Chi catch the ten brave men.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The students' surveillance is not good.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So it's a fair fight.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But I'm afraid the Ninth Lady will be used by someone.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So I asked the teacher to report to the Ninth Lady.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And select the Crown Princess.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But Jiujie has been conferred the title of Princess Yongsi.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How can she be the second princess?

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Does the Queen want her to be the main concubine?

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then why did you choose Zhaoyu?

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
According to the young treasure,

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
my main concubine's blood can only be Qin Baniang's death.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Forgive me, Your Highness.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I have no such intention.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How can I not know the heart of the young treasure's lover?

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I like Zhaoyu very much.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But I don't want to see the bloodline of the Ninth Lady and her family.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So I mentioned it.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
To be honest,

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I have thought about letting Jiujie marry Yu'er.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Just to make her the Crown Prince's main concubine.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But now...

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is just a little idea of my mother.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In the end, it's still up to my father to do it.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't worry, young treasure.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If Zhaoyu is not willing to suffer this grievance,

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will also ask my mother to arrange a wedding for her.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
To protect her for a lifetime.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thank you for your care of my daughter.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Your Highness.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Your Highness, please.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Your Highness.

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Go and get the imperial physician.

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Wait.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Mother, don't be shocked by a small injury.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If it spreads to the palace,

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
people will think that I should invite Jiujie to be my concubine.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mo Yi, get some medicine.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Does it hurt?

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Since childhood,

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you have never suffered so much.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But because of the invitation,

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
if it wasn't for her being so nice,

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
how could you suffer so much?

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mother, don't worry.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have found that Yifan has already been much happier.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He can drink wine and learn to read and write,

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and he can be a princess.

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He has paid much attention to the Crown Prince.

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The Empress's interest in him is what the Qing family needs.

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't feel wronged.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you don't feel wronged,

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
how can you be so self-conceited?

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mother,

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
what I care about

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
is not the wine,

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
but the Crown Prince.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
How can he say it so easily

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and get me married again?

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Silly child.

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Men are the most unreliable.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Even if you are in love for a while,

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
you will fall in love with him in a few years.

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Besides,

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
if the Crown Prince is in that position,

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
how can you be the only one in the harem?

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You must remember

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to keep your heart.

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I know.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But how can I?

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Sister Wu,

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
why are you sitting here?

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
These two scoundrels dare to eavesdrop on us.

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can't let them spread the word.

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Sister Wu, why are you holding me?

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Did you see us just now?

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Mother?

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You are eavesdropping on us.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Be quiet.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you crazy?

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are all grounded.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If Mother knows that you eavesdrop on her,

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
do you still want to have a good life?

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How is the life now?

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They are all the wives of the Qin family.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Those two little ones

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
want to be the Crown Princess.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
One is sealed by the Princess.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
She is about to fly to the high position to be the phoenix.

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Who cares about our future?

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I only want to marry a honest person.

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Mother will help us.

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What kind of good person can she give us?

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Are you willing to kneel down to your sisters

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
for the rest of your life?

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why not?

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I have to kneel down if I should.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Besides, I am a concubine.

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I am different from you.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But I don't dare to believe it.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Stop them.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Mother.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Mother.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am the Fifth Madam of the Third House.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What are you doing?

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Madam said that

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
there are many flowers and insects in the spring.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Please go back to the house

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and take a rest for a while.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
She wants to build a family with me again?

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Why?

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Are you talking about me?

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Open your mouth.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Please calm down.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't be angry if she said something wrong.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Please help me.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I am sorry.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Please forgive me this time.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can forgive you.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But you have thought about it.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If the rumors spread in the capital

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
that you are a shameless woman,

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I will forgive you.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't think about marrying into a good family again.

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Mother.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I am sorry.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's good that you know your mistake.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't listen to what you shouldn't listen to.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't say what you shouldn't say.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Otherwise,

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
don't blame me for sending you to Jia'an for a rest.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't worry, Madam.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I will never dare to do it again.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Good girl.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Send the two ladies back.

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Tell them to guard the yard.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Don't let any word spread.

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't let any evil spirit come out.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't worry, Madam.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I am not guilty.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Where should I go?

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Isn't this my home?

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Home?

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I am the heir of the first king.

158
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Does anyone care about me?

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Who should I talk to?

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Me?

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Or you?

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have no home.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Where should I go?

164
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No home.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No home.

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You finally come to see me.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If not for your granddaughter,

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
we would have been separated.

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You are healthy.

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You will live a long life.

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's a lie.

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We are not that young.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Your Majesty,

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Princess Yongci is waiting outside.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Waner, do you want to hear her?

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let her in.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Look at them.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
They are making things worse.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Your Majesty, I wish you good health.

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You are welcome.

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Get up.

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let me see.

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Jinjing looks better these days.

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How is it?

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Is Ning'er obedient?

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Does Xiaoqi really protect you?

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
They are all very good.

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
They are not affectionate to me.

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You look better and better.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I often asked Ning'er about it.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
She said you were safe in the house.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I was relieved.

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's because you are considerate.

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I knew it.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
All the letters that care about me

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
will not come from Ning'er.

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Listen, Ning'er is a good boy.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
As soon as he goes out,

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
he will fly to the sky.

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He will be free.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He will remember me.

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Grandmother.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I miss you every day.

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The letters of greetings

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
are from us.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I know.

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You are so considerate.

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Come on, sit down.

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Your Highness.

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Your Highness, it's time to take the medicine.

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You are considerate.

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Look, my considerate is here.

215
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Go.

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Grandmother's medicine

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
is always checked by Xiaowan.

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
She checks the medicine and the fire.

219
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
She even checks the medicine.

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
She is very considerate.

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's right.

222
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
With Wan'er's care,

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
she will recover soon.

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Come on, Your Highness.

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I still think the brown sugar is better.

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You always make me feel bad

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
because you always bully me.

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Sister-in-law.

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Listen to Wan'er.

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Don't be like a child.

231
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You are making a fuss.

232
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Good.

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
When we were young,

234
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
we always let them listen to us.

235
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Now we are old,

236
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
shouldn't we listen to them?

237
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes, Sister-in-law.

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You are so good.

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
His Majesty is so filial.

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He is so considerate.

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
His Majesty is filial.

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But he is busy with the government affairs every day.

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He is so busy.

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
His Majesty is diligent and loving.

245
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's a blessing of the country.

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Your Highness.

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Your Highness.

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Your Highness.

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Xiaojiu.

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What's wrong?

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Your Highness.

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Her Highness accidentally

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
spilled ink on my clothes.

254
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's okay.

255
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Brother Cui.

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Let me take you to change your clothes.

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Come.

258
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll go with Brother Cui to change.

259
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Go.

260
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Go.

261
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why is Xiaojiu still not recovered?

262
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Children in the palace

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
want to grow up smoothly.

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's really different.

265
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Go.

266
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This bird belongs to you.

267
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It doesn't look like a bird's nest.

268
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Did the eunuch catch it?

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't understand.

270
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Someone else caught it.

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But I still don't understand.

272
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
How about Your Highness tell me directly?

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I promise not to tell anyone.

274
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's okay.

275
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Let's not talk if we don't want to talk.

276
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I...I caught it.

277
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Then guess.

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Is this bird happy

279
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
to stay in the cage?

280
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's a wild bird.

281
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It left its mother,

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
left the sky,

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and lost its freedom.

284
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's not happy to stay in there.

285
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's not happy to stay in there.

286
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It doesn't know how to talk.

287
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
How do you know it's not happy?

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It can't go anywhere.

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
How can it be happy?

290
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
How about we let it go

291
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and let it be free?

292
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay?

293
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay.

294
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:41,940
The

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Your Highness,

296
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm very good.

297
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I just can't talk.

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I didn't expect

299
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that I could have a chat with you.

300
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
to cure your illness.

301
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,360
You're so smart.

302
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,840
Just be patient.

303
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,360
Thank you.

304
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,200
I'll go greet the Empress Dowager.

305
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,200
Your Highness,

306
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,880
why don't we go and see

307
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,080
where the little bird flew to?

308
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,680
Is that okay?

309
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,600
Okay.

310
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,600
Go.

311
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,120
You're finally back.

312
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,920
The Empress Dowager heard

313
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,240
the help of theず man,

314
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,840
so she of all of you

315
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,760
was able to raise the division.

316
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,440
She was really happy.

317
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,520
She kept asking you guys at that.

318
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,320
Go.

319
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,400
Grandmother...

320
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,480
You've chosen me?

321
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
You called me grandma?

322
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,360
Good boy.

323
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,160
Cui Ge.

324
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,520
Why don't you go and play with Ni'er?

325
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,800
I'll go to you later.

326
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,040
Let's go.

327
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,320
Be careful.

328
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,240
Let's go.

329
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,280
Xiaojiu's illness is really getting better.

330
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Cui Ge's illness is caused by

331
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
the lack of medicine.

332
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,880
It can only be cured with medicine.

333
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,400
It may be repeated.

334
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,360
Is there no other way?

335
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,720
It's hard to recover

336
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
if the heart is not removed.

337
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
This child

338
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,880
saw his mother

339
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,640
being killed.

340
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,960
How can he not fall ill?

341
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,840
Xiaojiu is close to you.

342
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,520
It's also a fate.

343
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,720
If you want,

344
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,320
I'll entrust him to you.

345
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,400
No matter what,

346
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,320
you have to open his heart.

347
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,480
I'll do it.

348
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,320
I won't let you down.

349
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,280
All right.

350
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
Wan'er has agreed.

351
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Sister-in-law, go and sit.

352
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,320
Sit.

353
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,920
Xiaoqi is here.

354
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,160
Greetings, Grandmother.

355
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,200
Greetings, Aunt.

356
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,160
You're done with His Majesty.

357
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,200
Sit down and have some tea.

358
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,800
I shouldn't stay long.

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm here to take Princess Yongci out of the palace.

360
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,600
What happened?

361
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,000
There's another death case in the capital.

362
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,680
His Majesty ordered Princess Yongci

363
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,160
to help with the case.

364
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,760
This has shocked His Majesty.

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,800
It seems that the case is big.

366
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,000
Is Wan'er all right?

367
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Don't worry, Grandmother.

368
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,800
I'll protect Wan'er.

369
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,440
You're still protecting her.

370
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,280
If you can protect her,

371
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
how can you do that to the princess?

372
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,600
It was my fault.

373
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,560
I didn't check it

374
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,000
and let Yongci take the risk.

375
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
It's not the next time.

376
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,640
I don't believe you.

377
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,600
If...

378
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,800
If Wan'er

379
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,040
suffers, it's us.

380
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,040
Grandmother, I won't cry.

381
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,520
You won't?

382
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,760
Inhale.

383
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,800
Exhale.

384
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,500
lasrieb

385
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,760
She has a fever

386
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,840
at night.

387
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,520
I'm sorry, puppies.

388
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,160
It's okay.

389
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,800
We look after her a lot.

390
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,880
Very well.

391
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,480
Go now.

392
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,720
Yes.

393
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,440
Wait a moment.

394
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
I'm going to help Wan'er

395
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
to find a good horse.

396
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
She is soft-hearted

397
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
and will love people.

398
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
You think

399
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
she can love Wan'er?

400
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,440
She will be punished.

401
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Enough.

402
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
You don't eat or drink.

403
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
You don't do housework.

404
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Since they don't tell us the truth,

405
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
we don't know.

406
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
You don't know?

407
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
I don't know.

408
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
I don't know.

409
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
I don't know.

410
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
I don't know.

411
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
We don't know.

412
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
When they are anxious,

413
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
they will come to us.

414
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Listen to me.

415
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Last night, the body was found

416
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
here.

417
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
It was completely dead.

418
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
It was very serious.

419
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
But the person who did it

420
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
was very clean.

421
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
There was no other clue

422
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
in the body.

423
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
When we first examined it,

424
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
we didn't find anything.

425
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Although this case is far from the main street,

426
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
it connects many small villas.

427
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
If the perpetrators want to get around here,

428
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
they will pass through the alley.

429
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

430
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
I have caught someone to investigate.

431
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Except for the man who was with the husband last night,

432
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
we didn't find anyone suspicious.

433
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
The person's blood color

434
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
is not so dark.

435
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
It seems to be mixed with something else.

436
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
But the content is too small.

437
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
I can't tell if it's mud or sand.

438
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
There is so little blood.

439
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
The place of birth must be somewhere else.

440
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Let's go around and see.

441
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
Where is this?

442
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Fengqi Pavilion.

443
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
The famous flower building in Beijing.

444
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Cai Qi Pavilion

445
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Cai Qi is the symbol of the flower building.

446
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
I haven't been there.

447
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
I knew it at a glance.

448
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
There is a bar in front of the wine house.

449
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
If you get drunk,

450
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
you will meet many people

451
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
who are convenient to you.

452
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Let's go and see the body first.

453
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Your Highness,

454
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I greet you.

455
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Call Mr. Jiu.

456
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
I think it's a little disrespectful.

457
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Mrs. Zheng, don't worry.

458
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
I think Mr. Jiu

459
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
is not that kind of person.

460
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
It's more convenient

461
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
to do so outside.

462
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Then I will follow your order.

463
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Mr. Jiu.

464
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
I don't know how to call

465
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
this officer.

466
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
This is Li Siqing.

467
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Li Siqing,

468
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,440
this is Mr. Jiu.

469
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
I didn't meet you in Yuzhou before.

470
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
This time, I can make up for it.

471
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,440
I have heard about Li Siqing's

472
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
history before.

473
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
I really don't need to tell you.

474
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
I knew I was just a random person

475
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
when I first met him.

476
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
I really admire you.

477
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
Mr. Jiu, don't be polite.

478
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,440
This time, the body is in a terrible state.

479
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
It's badly damaged.

480
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
Go and have a look.

481
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
It's still spring.

482
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Why is the body badly damaged?

483
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Because

484
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
the dead skin

485
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
has been peeled off.

486
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Get on the train.

487
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,440
We are will be going.

488
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,440
We will be going.

489
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Where are we going?

490
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
To the ghost town.

491
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
We are going.

492
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Where are we going?

493
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
We're going.

494
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Where are we going?

495
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
We're going.

496
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
We're going.

497
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
We're going.

498
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,440
What's the matter with you?

499
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
I have no idea.

500
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
You are going to the ghost town?

501
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,880
I've never seen such a cruel method.

502
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,720
You're right.

503
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
There's a place for the murderer.

504
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,040
Such a serious injury

505
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,320
will cause a lot of blood loss before the victim dies.

506
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,240
I've never seen such a thing.

507
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,040
Please give me your advice.

508
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,960
Skin is the biggest barrier to protect the body.

509
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,240
Without the skin,

510
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,560
the blood will be exposed

511
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:35,760
andいいan

512
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,760
If you don't use the whole body,

513
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,080
it'll work hard

514
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,720
to treat the deformities of the body.

515
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,960
This way,

516
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,480
of his dirty descendants...

517
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,160
and broke into court to abjure them.

518
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,480
And so...

519
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,960
does Team Xun

520
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,400
give up their dream of

521
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,280
proud prime minister Bertrand to do banppen greatly...

522
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,320
and destroy the three different people

523
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,920
öyle la Doke Buri?

524
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,280
Remember.

525
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,440
Who is the third?

526
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,560
We must protect the second

527
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
so that theyeah who's the third

528
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,120
can dethrone them all.

529
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,760
All people whoあれ you are

530
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,800
I know.

531
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,760
I know.

532
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,960
No.

533
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,040
Don't R endorsed by lovers.

534
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,640
I won't

535
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,200
Listen.

536
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,620
Don't be a Tartar

537
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,880
and half of the body.

538
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,360
The lower jaw was removed

539
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
to prevent the victim from speaking or committing suicide.

540
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,480
The skin was stripped off.

541
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,200
The face was damaged.

542
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,240
The face couldn't be changed.

543
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,560
Judging from the teeth

544
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,320
and the growth of the bone,

545
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,440
the victim should have just been used.

546
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,560
He was injured at a young age.

547
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,640
It seems that

548
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
it's the karma of the place where the fireworks were.

549
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,080
I thought

550
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,480
as a criminal,

551
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,640
I should know the principle of being cautious and cautious.

552
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,640
There was nothing like a black smoke in the nose.

553
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,520
There was a slight dizziness in the back of the mouth.

554
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,840
It seems to be caused by the shielding machine.

555
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,300
einem

556
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,280
This away course

557
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,400
could only wake people up.

558
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
It should be the pé hurting

559
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,400
to enable people to suffer cases.

560
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,400
Right.

561
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,560
oscillation

562
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,560
The đã relation of the victim's legs

563
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,200
was also manage to cut the shallows

564
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,760
He...

565
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,160
Should I tell him to not Prevention?

566
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,740
Why not?

567
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,400
Better to be the killer.

568
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,240
Defeat?

569
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,560
He...

570
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,240
Dr GPU?

571
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,640
As the name Mori Nakamori,

572
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,280
wicked

573
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,440
turnseth all men.

574
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,880
Lo денег ne Keep the goods

575
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
from sorrow.

576
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,160
Ge Nie,

577
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,480
when the day men shoul be silent,

578
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,800
The person who used the knife

579
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,400
should be a weak person.

580
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,920
Remember.

581
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,440
The victim's body

582
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,840
is not visible to be fatal.

583
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,000
Although there is a lot of blood, he didn't die.

584
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,840
He died of heart attack

585
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
due to excessive pain

586
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,160
during the peeling process.

587
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,800
Mr. Jiu,

588
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,960
you mean

589
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,040
the victim is still alive

590
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,320
when he was peeled?

591
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,960
The wound on the victim's body

592
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,160
is all swollen.

593
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,360
Only when someone is hurt while he is alive

594
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,160
can the skin react like this.

595
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,440
This...

596
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Isn't the victim dying of pain?

597
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,440
Is it Yan Li?

598
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,880
Impossible.

599
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,640
No.

600
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,400
He is in the same position as the body.

601
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,520
As long as the person who used the knife

602
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,400
is powerful enough,

603
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,640
he can kill the victim

604
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,240
before he dies.

605
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,880
He can even feed some strong drugs.

606
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,000
In this case,

607
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,840
whether the victim was fed the medicine

608
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,760
can only be known after the autopsy.

609
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,960
The victim's body is small.

610
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,880
But the color of the wound

611
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,440
is the same as the victim's body.

612
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,680
The peeling time

613
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,040
is less than two hours

614
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,000
to half an hour.

615
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,240
The peeling time

616
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
is the most painful

617
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
for the victim.

618
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,280
The criminal must have a place

619
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
to cover his ears

620
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,520
so that he won't be disturbed

621
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,360
and complete the whole process.

622
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,640
I've been alive for so long.

623
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,680
Such cruel means

624
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,400
is really a first.

625
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,360
The criminal used the peeling method

626
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,440
to kill the victim.

627
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
It's cruel.

628
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,920
The victim is in great pain.

629
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,640
The criminal can still

630
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,880
carefully clean up the place

631
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
where he left the body.

632
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,440
It shows that the cruel person

633
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
is hard to admit.

634
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,320
Uncle Fang.

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,640
Shredding Bead?

Double-edged sword, k burada

639
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,600

642
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,940
It must be during the skinning the victim

643
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,560
some of rat was killed

644
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:21,960
some of rat was killed

645
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,640
some of rat was killed

646
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,300
During the skinning

648
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,320
So that you won the one yearning to arrest him,

arusians,

650
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,120
only have the kidSc Brexit facing forward.

651
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,220
Doubtful girl!

hilcat!

653
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,320
Lin Yujiu!

My head!

657
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,680
Shoot it!

658
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,900
Let's search again!

659
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,560
Stop being so 2-食べ-y Pegasus Ten不要管他了

660
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,320
Are you trying to attack us?

661
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,000
I masquerade from consciousness

662
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,560
and Collection will be experienced

663
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,280
By others

664
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,800
Let us go

665
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,720
It's not easy to make it

666
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,240
To escape from human rulers

667
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,120
there is one more line

668
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
The murderer had three victims.

669
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,720
Every victim's body

670
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,120
was covered with pig's dung.

671
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,480
There was also a black flower

672
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,720
painted with a pencil.

673
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,520
A black flower?

674
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,880
Master.

675
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,240
Princess.

676
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,360
I found it.

677
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,640
You may leave.

678
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,600
Yes.

679
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,240
This is the autopsy of the three victims.

680
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,360
It's rough,

681
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,520
but it's a good example.

682
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,720
The suspect was arrested.

683
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,800
But after the murder,

684
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,800
the files he had

685
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,960
were all found.

686
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,400
So we can't tell

687
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,960
why he had to

688
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,240
make the case of Guan Yinzhen's murder.

689
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,640
Peel the skin to death.

690
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,160
Tear the snake to death.

691
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,040
Cut the finger to death.

692
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,240
Peel the skin.

693
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,040
Kill the pig.

694
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,480
My father wouldn't

695
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,120
turn Guan Yinzhen's case into a case for no reason.

696
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,240
It seems

697
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,280
the murderer may not be the murderer.

698
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,640
If this case is related to Guan Yinzhen,

699
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,240
is the murderer

700
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,760
going to be in the capital again?

701
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,160
But it's not ruled out

702
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,840
that someone used the name of the case

703
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,640
to stir up trouble.

704
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,760
But no matter what the possibility is,

705
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,560
if we don't catch the murderer

706
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
of the peel case as soon as possible,

707
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,320
I'm afraid there will be more victims.

708
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,760
Is the murderer still alive?

709
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,760
Still alive.

710
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
But he didn't confess.

711
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,520
It's also because this case was listed as a case,

712
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,960
so he's been in the prison

713
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,760
waiting for the time.

714
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
I want you to meet him.

715
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,160
Okay.

716
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,200
Tonight is fine.

717
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,400
I'll arrange it immediately.

718
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,080
This is the painter Ning Buyi.

719
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,320
Ying Huashi.

720
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,360
Please greet the Crown Prince and Princess Yongce.

721
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,000
Your Highness.

722
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,760
Princess.

723
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,400
Follow me.

724
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,760
Your Highness.

725
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,320
Ning Hu goddess lives here?

726
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,920
I've never seen such a bloody scene.

727
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,400
I couldn't help myself.

728
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,200
I'm embarrassed.

729
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,320
It's the first time I've seen you in this state.

730
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,720
You must be feeling uncomfortable.

731
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,200
Thank you for your hard work.

732
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,520
If I'm uncomfortable, I won't rush to the doctor.

733
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,000
I'll be fine tomorrow.

734
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Thank you for your consideration.

735
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,600
Although I'm scared inside,

736
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,280
I hope I can help the government.

737
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,600
I hope I can help them.

738
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,200
Thank you for your consideration.

739
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,760
Your Highness.

740
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,360
That's Zhang Dongxuan, the fortune teller.

741
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,440
Zhang Xiazi, get up.

742
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
Someone is asking you a question.

743
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,200
You're pretending to be dead.

744
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,800
I'm telling you to pretend.

745
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,400
I'm...

746
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Please forgive me. I know I was wrong.

747
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Get out.

748
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
Yes.

749
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,120
If you don't return your case to the court,

750
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,240
you should be beheaded five years ago

751
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,080
even if you lack confession.

752
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,240
Now, you can live.

753
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,520
Shen Siqing is dead.

754
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,960
How long can I live?

755
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,320
If someone is as powerful as Shen Gong

756
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,520
and can clear your name,

757
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,720
would you like to try?

758
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,640
I just calculated it.

759
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,720
That person must not be you.

760
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,960
You just need to know that someone can help you.

761
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,720
Clean yourself up later.

762
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,320
I calculated it again.

763
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,720
That person is a woman.

764
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,760
In my prison,

765
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,600
I eat bad food and eat cold food.

766
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,760
I wear shabby clothes and dirty clothes.

767
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,800
Even if I want to help you,

768
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,720
I can't say it.

769
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,600
Are you asking me for benefits?

770
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,200
If you really want to live,

771
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,320
don't think about it.

772
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,120
If I want to live,

773
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,000
you are not the crown prince.

774
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,320
How can you let me live?

775
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,240
How do you know he is not the crown prince?

776
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,840
I heard it.

777
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,120
When you two came in,

778
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,320
he was asking questions.

779
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,160
But the crown prince was walking around.

780
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,080
If he is the crown prince and you are his subordinate,

781
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,720
how can he dare to ask questions

782
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,320
and walk around?

783
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,720
Do you know why we came here?

784
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
The crown prince

785
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,320
cares about my life more than I do.

786
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,920
Is it because I am a bad person?

787
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,720
Speak to me.

788
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,800
Tao, can you drink for a day?

789
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,720
The little village in Tian Xiang House is waiting for me.

790
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,240
These days are not peaceful.

791
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,520
Be careful not to get exposed.

792
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,320
No, I can't.

793
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,720
No wonder you can be so rude.

794
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,520
So you can also

795
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,120
get some information in the prison.

796
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,920
In the prison,

797
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,320
I hear these gossiping and gossiping every day.

798
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
But here,

799
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,320
the world is cold and the food is cold.

800
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,720
Then tell me.

801
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,120
What do you want?

802
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,320
I want to eat

803
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,520
the best food.

804
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Do you think you have the right to talk to me about the conditions?

805
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
I don't know.

806
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,520
I'm afraid you will be angry if I tell you.

807
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,320
I heard that the capital

808
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,120
has a similar case to Guanyin Town.

809
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,720
I'm afraid you are more anxious than me.

810
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
Okay.

811
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,920
Then you wait here.

812
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,720
Your Highness.

813
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
The cold soup stewed congee

814
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,920
should be eaten hot

815
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,320
to make it soft and delicious.

816
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,920
The cold soup stewed congee.

817
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,720
The cold soup stewed congee.

818
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,520
Your Highness.

819
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Have you seen this person?

820
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,720
No.

821
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,320
Does he look like a person?

822
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,520
What?

823
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,120
Doesn't he look like a person?

824
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,120
I don't know him.

825
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,920
I haven't seen him.

826
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,920
Nothing will happen to Yan Li.

827
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,320
It won't happen.

828
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,120
He has nine lives.

829
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,920
I can definitely find him.

830
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,720
Have you seen this person?

831
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,520
No.

832
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,320
Have you seen him?

833
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
No.

834
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,120
Have you seen him?

835
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,320
No.

836
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Remember.

837
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,320
The victim's chest, abdomen, nose, and air duct

838
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,120
are not obvious.

839
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,920
There is no toxic reaction in the liver and kidney.

840
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,520
But before the victim was kidnapped,

841
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,320
he drank a lot of wine.

842
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,920
The heart is not damaged,

843
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,520
but the color is pale.

844
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,720
It is in tune with the pain of pain

845
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,920
and the faintness of the blood.

846
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,320
The heart is in tune with the pain of pain

847
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,920
and the faintness of the blood.

848
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,120
It is indeed painful.

849
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,920
Remember.

850
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
There are food residues in the stomach.

851
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,520
The last meal

852
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,920
will take two hours

853
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,120
to kill.

854
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,520
According to the food residue,

855
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,320
we can see

856
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,920
that the last meal was eaten by crabs.

857
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,520
Although there are few crab meat,

858
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,520
some big restaurants

859
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,120
will give it to the rich.

860
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,920
Do we have to search the whole restaurant?

861
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
No.

862
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,720
His Majesty specifically ordered

863
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,920
that this matter concerns the economic security.

864
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,520
We must not disturb the people

865
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,920
and cause panic.

866
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,320
Maybe the food residue is crab or crab?

867
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,720
What's the difference?

868
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,920
The time of death

869
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,920
is less than two hours

870
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,120
when the victim was found.

871
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,720
The time of death is less than two hours

872
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,920
which means the killer peeled the location

873
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,520
and the place where the killer kidnapped the corpse

874
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,720
is not far away.

875
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,120
The crime scene of the killer

876
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,920
is that there is a fengqi building behind the restaurant.

877
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,520
The restaurant is good at making crab.

878
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,120
The fengqi building is far closer to the crime scene.

879
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,120
You shouldn't be young.

880
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,920
What's wrong with your friends

881
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,120
going to the restaurant?

882
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,320
Besides,

883
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,920
Yan Li told me about the crab.

884
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,520
You shouldn't be young.

885
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,920
There is no food residue in the stomach.

886
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,320
It's the crab.

887
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,720
Yes.

888
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Zhai Mutou,

889
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
go to the fengqi building

890
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,520
and check the crime scene

891
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,720
to see if there are any guests

892
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,320
who ordered the crab.

893
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,520
Yes.

894
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,720
Mr. Jiu's proposal is very reasonable.

895
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,520
It reminds me of someone.

896
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,720
Who?

897
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,520
My teacher.

898
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,520
He is Shen Yi, Shen Gong.

899
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,920
Mr. Jiu's eyes

900
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,120
and my teacher's

901
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,520
looks

902
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,520
are exactly the same.

903
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,720
I thought

904
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,920
that no one could do

905
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
what Mr. Jiu did.

906
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,720
If Shen Gong is still here,

907
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,520
maybe we can still get a chance.

908
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,120
I was too impulsive.

909
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,920
His Majesty is still waiting for me to reply.

910
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,520
I'll take my leave.

911
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,520
Mr. Yu, take care.

912
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,120
Let's go to the Ministry of Justice.

913
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,520
Why are you in such a hurry?

914
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,720
Since he said that I was

915
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,320
a little different from Shen Gong,

916
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,120
I have to

917
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,120
get to the bottom of Shen Gong's case

918
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,520
before I can be unbeatable.

919
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,120
So cold, so warm

920
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,520
If a love

921
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,920
falls into the shadow

922
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,320
The wind and snow fall

923
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,720
and my body is white

924
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,120
If a love

925
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,520
is like a star

926
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:49,320
The pain will also be the same

927
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,520
Open your heart

928
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,920
Love doesn't matter the deep sea

929
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,320
Please give me courage

930
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,720
Let fate open

931
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,120
Don't be afraid of the starlight

932
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,520
Be changed by the night

933
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,120
The stars will shine

934
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,520
beyond the sky

935
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,520
It's like dust

936
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,920
But it's the color of the starry sky

937
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,320
The starry sky

938
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,320
The starry sky

939
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,320
The starry sky

940
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,320
The starry sky

941
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,320
The starry sky

942
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,320
The starry sky

943
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,320
The starry sky

944
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,320
The starry sky

945
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,320
The starry sky

946
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,720
The starry sky
