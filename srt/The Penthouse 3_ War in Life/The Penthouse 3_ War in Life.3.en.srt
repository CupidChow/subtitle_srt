1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,280
(The characters, locations,
]incidents, organizations,)

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,120
(and background
of this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:17,634
Ro Na will get disqualified
along with Eun Byeol.

4
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:19,432
I knew it was you.

5
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:23,151
Eun Byeol is so dumb.
She's nothing without her mom.

6
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:26,409
By the way,
whom did you ask to do this for you?

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,151
That's a secret.

8
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:31,433
Jenny seems to have failed the exam too.

9
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:33,497
That means
I might be the only one who gets in.

10
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:35,477
Not everyone gets into SNU.

11
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:38,685
But you'll get accepted
because you're my daughter.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,074
Do you know why
your mother's so nice to you guys?

13
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,533
Why?

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,840
She wants to become your sole guardian...

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,850
so she can take the inheritance
of your biological mother.

16
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:04,303
She's not that kind of person.

17
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,973
I'm sorry. But it's true.

18
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:14,670
She's related to the death
of your biological mother.

19
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,176
Really?

20
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:20,352
Did Logan really kill our biological mom?

21
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:22,250
Because of Mom?

22
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,509
-Excuse the mess, everyone.
-Sorry for the mess.

23
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:41,705
We're sorry.

24
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:43,300
Su Ryeon?

25
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,474
You're Baek Jun Ki, aren't you?

26
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:50,196
Let me go. I'm going to kill him.

27
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,324
Baek Jun Ki, who are you really?

28
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,983
My daughter's there.

29
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:58,015
I can't let her watch her own father die
right before her eyes.

30
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,064
Maybe it was not her.

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,077
Dad. What's wrong?

32
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,790
Nothing. Let's eat.

33
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,420
Why are you stopping me?

34
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:46,926
Who are you to interfere in my life?

35
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:48,491
I'm Shim Su Ryeon.

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,977
Shim Su Ryeon?

37
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,343
Where have you been?
Why did you only show up now?

38
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:56,667
Do you know
how much I was looking for you?

39
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,325
What were you doing when Logan died?

40
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,507
Answer me!

41
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,230
Logan's brother came over.

42
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,913
-When?
-A while ago.

43
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,424
Why is Logan's family
coming into our home?

44
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:19,281
What was Mom's relationship with him?

45
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:21,852
It bothers me the more I think about it.

46
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,749
Would you do something for me?

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,311
Drink. It'll calm you down.

48
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:37,831
I was scared.

49
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:40,315
I came to Korea because of Logan.

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,314
But he died before my very eyes.

51
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:48,660
I was afraid I'd be framed for his murder.

52
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,567
That's why I ran away.

53
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,061
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:56,838
I have so many questions.

55
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,982
Why did Logan bring you to me?

56
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:02,782
What was Mr. Baek like?

57
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:05,076
My real name is Joo Dan Tae,

58
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,394
not Baek Jun Ki.

59
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:10,955
Joo Dan Tae?

60
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,801
You're Joo Dan Tae?

61
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:18,088
Mr. Baek worked for our family
ever since my father...

62
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,113
started a business in Korea.

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,106
I looked up to him like a big brother.

64
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,029
Not long after my family moved to Japan,

65
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,307
Mr. Baek showed up
in the middle of the night.

66
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,649
Why...

67
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:36,711
How could you...

68
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:38,983
This isn't you.

69
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,350
You're a good kid.

70
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't care about being good!

71
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,814
Just give me my money!

72
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,617
Open the safe now!

73
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:55,949
You scumbag.

74
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,887
Honey!

75
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,661
Mom...

76
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,113
There was another rat in the house.

77
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,750
There you are.

78
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:23,883
Jun Ki!

79
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,624
Tell me the code to the safe. Now.

80
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,413
Then I'll let you live.

81
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,498
-You...
-1-9!

82
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,934
1-9...

83
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,063
7-1...

84
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:45,174
0-5-1-9.

85
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:50,090
1-9-7-1-0-5-1-9.

86
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,242
You loser.

87
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,190
(Baek Jun Ki)

88
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,300
(Baek Jun Ki)

89
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,913
How could he do something so heinous?

90
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,573
When I came to,

91
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:13,401
I was in a lock down ward
of a mental hospital.

92
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,690
The police thought he was dead...

93
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,085
since he was never found...

94
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:21,574
although they had an APB out on him.

95
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,141
But he had changed his name.

96
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,235
He took my name, Joo Dan Tae.

97
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:31,213
His identity was perfect
when I married him.

98
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,524
He said he graduated
from Tokyo University,

99
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:35,643
and that his parents
who ran a resort in Osaka...

100
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,316
passed away tragically.

101
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,642
He even had many guests
come from Japan to our wedding.

102
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,083
Was all of that a lie?

103
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:46,018
I'm sure he hired them.

104
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:47,895
Since Jun Ki was an orphan.

105
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:51,911
He used my identity to marry you.

106
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:57,425
We could've given him
as much money as he wanted.

107
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:02,120
Why did he kill my parents?
They did nothing wrong!

108
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,843
I'm going to kill him.

109
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,520
Is that why...

110
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,131
Logan brought you here?

111
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:16,358
He said he'd expose Jun Ki
and his real past...

112
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,427
to make sure he can never make a comeback.

113
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:22,465
But...

114
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,789
I saw Jun Ki here that day.

115
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:37,150
It was definitely him.

116
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,420
He was disguised as an old man,

117
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,268
but those devilish eyes...

118
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,049
were the same from 27 years ago.

119
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:49,495
Old man?

120
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:51,661
I never forgot it even for a moment.

121
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:55,759
That rat killed Logan. I saw it.

122
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:59,458
He escaped from prison. I'm sure of it.

123
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,842
Then that creepy metallic sound...

124
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,271
was Dan Tae?

125
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:07,138
I couldn't do anything.

126
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,314
I thought he'd try to kill me again.

127
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,922
I should've come to you sooner.

128
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,137
I found this at the scene.

129
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:29,135
It's the ring Logan planned to give you.

130
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,532
It seemed like...

131
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,960
he cared for you a lot.

132
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,015
He was excited the entire time
about proposing to you.

133
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,928
Are you steadfast...

134
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,196
about what you said?

135
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,619
That you'll kill Dan Tae.

136
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,298
Of course.

137
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:20,035
I'll make him pay for what he did.

138
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:23,598
Now that I'm back as Baek Jun Ki,

139
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,579
I will make him remember...

140
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,997
everything he did to me one by one.

141
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,245
Can you sing for your exam tomorrow
after crying all day?

142
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,763
Your voice is all over the place.

143
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,643
Why does everyone suspect me?

144
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:48,583
What kind of idiot
would put her phone there...

145
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,067
knowing she'd get found out?

146
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:53,285
Someone did it on purpose
to make sure you failed.

147
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:54,969
It was Joo Seok Kyung.

148
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,612
Didn't she act weirdly in the hall?

149
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:00,685
Seok Kyung sang before you,
so she left ahead of time.

150
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,936
The only people left behind
were Eun Byeol and Ms. Jin.

151
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,061
Ms. Jin?

152
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:09,122
Everyone, attention.

153
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:13,001
You are not allowed to
bring in cell phones or voice recorders.

154
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:14,729
Please take off your headbands...

155
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,850
or any other accessories
that could make you stand out.

156
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,428
What is it?

157
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,757
It's nothing.

158
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:24,963
Seoul National University
isn't the only university out there.

159
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,135
Focus on
the rest of your performance tests.

160
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:30,255
I will not let this incident drop.

161
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:31,943
Drink up.

162
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,400
(Playing recording)

163
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,111
Jenny doesn't know that...

164
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:53,282
you went to jail for murder, right?

165
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:55,271
Of course not.

166
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,679
I'll keep my lips sealed forever.

167
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:00,892
No. No.

168
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:03,459
My dad's not that kind of man.

169
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,536
No! He's not!

170
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:09,408
No, my dad's not like that.

171
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,906
He's not!

173
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,268
Did you check the security cameras?

174
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,649
Don't worry. I dealt with them.

175
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,149
The pottery.

176
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:50,846
I'm carrying them. Let's get to it.

177
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:52,411
-Let's go.
-It's this way.

00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:05,896
Come along.

181
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:08,711
It's deeper than it looks.
Watch your footing.

182
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:12,203
Watch the pottery!

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,112
What a dreadful mess they are.

Nice going, Dong Pil!

Sirs, I brought you cold sikhye.

-Okay.

00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,161
I like how you act, little brother.

00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:22,641
Thank you, sir.

So, did Eun Byeol do okay
at her performance exam?

198
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:28,071
She had an exam?

199
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:31,291
Oh, dear.
Now that you don't live at Hera Palace,

200
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,014
the ordinary man knows nothing.

201
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:35,640
I haven't talked to her in a while.

202
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:38,352
Aren't you being too harsh
on your only daughter?

203
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:40,163
Wouldn't Eun Byeol be upset?

204
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,459
She would be.

205
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,409
Your twins will both
get into Seoul National University.

Oh, gosh.

210
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:56,229
You don't know, do you?

211
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,303
Seok Hoon skipped his performance exam.

212
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:01,357
What did you say?

213
00:16:01,617 --> 00:16:04,368
Min Hyuk's just like me
and is always in the know,

214
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:08,750
and your son Seok Hoon
ran off somewhere without taking the exam.

215
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,658
Why would the studious boy do that?

216
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:16,902
You're in no position
to worry about someone else's kid.

217
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:18,497
Your daughter Jenny...

218
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,036
failed her exam
because she didn't even sing.

219
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:23,061
Why wouldn't Jenny sing?

220
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:25,165
Why wouldn't she?

221
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:27,373
Why?

222
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,227
-How would I know that?
-Be quiet!

223
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:40,144
Jenny, you can't go on your own.
I need to come with you.

224
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:42,482
You'll be busy
with two exams to take today.

225
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:43,547
We'll be rushed.

226
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,428
How will we get from Seocho
to Sinchon in time?

227
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:47,056
Should we hire a motorcycle?

228
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:49,655
I'm going alone. Don't tag along.

229
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:52,556
Wait, Jenny. What's wrong with your voice?

230
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,552
Did you cry? Do you have a cold?

231
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,845
Jenny, you're still here. I made it.

232
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,445
I'll drive you. Let's go.

233
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,078
Honey, bad news.

234
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:05,153
Jenny's gone hoarse. What should we do?

235
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,948
You were on a high for a while.

236
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:09,105
What happened to you?

237
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:11,573
Jenny.

238
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,018
Is something wrong?

239
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,188
What is it? Yesterday...

240
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,154
What?

241
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:21,239
I heard you didn't sing at the SNU exam.

242
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,881
Is that true?

243
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:25,969
You didn't sing? What's that about?

244
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,609
Are you crazy?

245
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:30,252
You'd been waiting for that day
for 11 years.

246
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,676
Jenny. It's okay, you can talk to Daddy.

247
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:41,211
-My goodness.
-Jenny.

248
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:44,910
You brat
How dare you do that to your dad?

249
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,071
How long were you going
to make a fool of me for?

250
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:51,558
Did you think it would be a secret
if you didn't tell me forever?

251
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,233
Your passport.

252
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,087
There were no stamps in it
for the past six years.

253
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,115
Dubai?

254
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,497
How can you fly to Dubai
with an expired passport?

255
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,885
Which old passport did you look at?

256
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:11,710
Dad sent your presents
from his construction site in Dubai.

257
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,287
Stop it already!

258
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,009
Are you really a murderer?

259
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:24,721
Did you kill someone?

260
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,313
Jenny, there was this situation.

261
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:29,730
What situation justifies murder?

262
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:32,624
How many things are you hiding from me?

263
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,968
Mom works at a bathhouse
and Dad's a murderer.

264
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,802
How many more things are there
that I can be bullied for?

265
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:46,912
I thought our family
could live happily now.

266
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:48,539
What is this?

267
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:51,083
You ruined everything!

268
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,183
Who told you? Who was it?

269
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,945
Why does that matter? It's all true.

270
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:02,182
It matters. Who told you?

271
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:14,045
Jenny doesn't know
that you went to jail for murder, right?

272
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:15,847
If Joo Seok Kyung knows,

273
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:19,327
the whole school knows.

274
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,600
Joo Dan Tae, that scumbag.
I've had enough of it.

275
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,941
I will slit his throat...

276
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,615
-and go back to prison.
-No!

277
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:41,369
Don't stop me. I will make him pay.

278
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:43,469
If you won't do it, I will.

279
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,872
Did I say I won't do anything?

280
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:51,655
-I will do it.
-But when?

281
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,359
Give me time.

282
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,874
Until I find proof.

283
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:58,015
What proof?

284
00:19:58,095 --> 00:19:59,414
Proof that...

285
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:02,180
Joo Dan Tae killed that woman.

286
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:04,603
Not me.

287
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:06,744
Where is that proof?

288
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:10,021
Under the Hera Palace fountain.

289
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,931
The body's still there.

290
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,258
-What?
-So...

291
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,527
wait.

292
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,430
I will...

293
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,727
dig her back up.

294
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:34,912
Mr. Baek.

295
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,871
Shoot. What do you want?

296
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:40,750
Darn it.

297
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:48,141
-Logan?
-I'm back.

298
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:51,606
No!

299
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:57,350
No!

300
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,241
Logan, that punk.

301
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:08,568
He's torturing me even in death.

302
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,000
Do you like it?

303
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,904
I thought it would suit you.

304
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,314
Thank you.

305
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,976
I will never forgive him.

306
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,301
I will make him pay...

307
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,451
the price of your life.

308
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,013
Seok Hoon.

309
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,280
Why didn't you take the exam yesterday?

310
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,916
Are you really not going to college?

311
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:49,820
I want to go to college.
Just not Seoul National University.

312
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,645
I think dad bribed someone.

313
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,382
I don't want to get admitted like that.

314
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:57,184
Why did he do that?
You would have gotten in anyway.

315
00:22:57,264 --> 00:22:59,018
He probably wanted to make sure.

316
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,918
Isn't that what parents are like?

317
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:04,109
Do anything for their children.

318
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,444
Did you ask him for something?

319
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:12,314
What are you implying?

320
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,237
I can get into SNU by myself, too.

321
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:18,237
You're not the only smart one here.

322
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,876
I think something's going on
between Seok Kyung and your father.

323
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,400
I heard Ro Na got disqualified yesterday.

324
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,967
I'll keep an eye on Seok Kyung.

325
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,327
I won't tolerate it any longer...

326
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,759
if she keeps on behaving like that.

327
00:23:58,014 --> 00:23:59,826
What are you doing here?

328
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,032
I called him.

329
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:03,993
I need him to run an errand for me.

330
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:08,472
I already called Assemblyman Bong.

331
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,554
He'll know when you drop it off.

332
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:11,721
Got it.

333
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,827
You wanted me to smile like this
when we're around other people.

334
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,043
How do you feel,
coming back for the first time in a while?

335
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:28,104
It was nice when you lived here, no?

336
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:30,332
When you would bluff and show off...

337
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:32,146
without ever really fitting in.

338
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,188
My current life suits me better.

339
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:36,803
I heard
you live in a one-room apartment now?

340
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:38,790
I told you I could help you get a studio.

341
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,649
I prefer not having anything.

342
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,940
No family, no house.

343
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,799
You don't have to worry
about me, Chairman.

344
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:45,381
Don't forget to eat.

345
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:48,442
I hear convenience store meals
are pretty good nowadays.

346
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,823
Thank you, Chairman.
I'll put it to good use.

347
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,732
How was that?

348
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:17,462
Didn't want to be the only one
enjoying that spectacle.

349
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,290
You finally found the right job.

350
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,416
Joo Dan Tae's dog. It really suits you.

351
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,381
You won't even talk to me?

352
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:34,625
You'll pay for having betrayed...

353
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:36,561
Eun Byeol and me.

354
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,536
Curse me all you want.

355
00:25:39,616 --> 00:25:41,248
I'm on the brink now anyway.

356
00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:44,600
No one will stay by my side no
other than Chairman Joo.

357
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,193
You better hold on tight
to that string then.

358
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:48,145
I may cut it off.

359
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,248
Or push you off the brink.

360
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:06,788
Was Cheon Seo Jin behind...

361
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,050
what happened at the testing site?

362
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,909
I don't think it was her.

363
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,400
Given that Eun Byeol also didn't do well.

364
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,748
Then who was it?

365
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:20,238
There's one person I suspect...

366
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:22,894
but there's no reason for her
to do that to Eun Byeol.

367
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,296
Could it have been Seok Kyung?

368
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:36,335
She must be very upset
since her SNU free pass became invalid.

369
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,097
I want to say no,

370
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,524
but I can't.

371
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,232
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

372
00:26:48,312 --> 00:26:50,343
Nothing's for certain as of now.

373
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:53,720
Ro Na must be dejected.

374
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:56,096
It was difficult for her
to change her mind.

375
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:57,715
I know.

376
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:06,500
How's work?

377
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:10,035
I'm trying my best.

378
00:27:10,115 --> 00:27:11,915
We have quite a lot of customers.

379
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:20,249
Logan's money is gone.

380
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,900
Ten billion dollars.

381
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,202
Do you know anything about that?

382
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:29,529
Me?

383
00:27:30,411 --> 00:27:33,554
How would I know?

384
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:34,954
That much money.

385
00:27:35,874 --> 00:27:38,477
I was never that close with Logan.

386
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:40,596
You know that.

387
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,539
When I go back to America,

388
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:50,008
I will receive an inheritance
under Seol A's name.

389
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:52,715
About ten billion dollars.

390
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:57,222
With that money, I was thinking
I could establish a foundation...

391
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,596
that supports talented kids like Seol A.

392
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,340
Can you...

393
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,323
take on that money for me?

394
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:06,495
What?

395
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,972
Why would I?

396
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:12,468
You can do it yourself.

397
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:15,559
Su Ryeon is back.

398
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:17,018
You can ask her, too.

399
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,401
I'm asking because I can't.

400
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:22,281
Why is that?

401
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:26,847
No, thanks. Why are you doing this to me?

402
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:28,275
How do you trust me?

403
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:33,234
I might run away with that money.

404
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,992
That would be too bad,
but it would still be my fault...

405
00:28:38,072 --> 00:28:39,760
for having misjudged a character.

406
00:28:40,672 --> 00:28:42,540
But the Yoon Hee I see...

407
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,615
has both good and evil.

408
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,011
That's why I want it to be you.

409
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:50,361
It's something only you can do.

410
00:28:56,476 --> 00:28:59,103
This is the key
to my secret safe in Korea.

411
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,290
(Seoul Bank VVIP)

412
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,860
I won't tell you...

413
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:15,632
how to use that money. However...

414
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,721
I have one thing to ask for.

415
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,432
What is it?

416
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:25,636
Don't be alarmed.

417
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,282
You can never,
ever repeat what I'm about to say...

418
00:29:31,432 --> 00:29:32,725
to Su Ryeon.

419
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,823
A bloodline of hers...

420
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,501
may be alive.

421
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,151
I have to work now, Su Ryeon.
Let's talk later.

422
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:49,387
Yoon Hee.

423
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:56,116
You don't...

424
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,458
keep any secrets from me, do you?

425
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,073
Nothing like that.

426
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:05,518
What do I have to hide from you?

427
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:10,562
You still don't trust me?

428
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,813
I do.

429
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,605
I trust you, Yoon Hee.

430
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,492
Ten billion dollars?

431
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,471
How much is that? Thousand, million...

432
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:40,216
Ten trillion won?

433
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,700
Ten trillion?

434
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,128
After Logan died,

435
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,146
ten trillion won just disappeared?

436
00:30:50,226 --> 00:30:51,684
Exactly.

437
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:53,554
No doubt.

438
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:57,252
Whoever killed Logan also took that money.

439
00:30:57,332 --> 00:31:00,135
That's why they killed Logan.

440
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:05,222
There must be a reason why
they killed a rich American heir.

441
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:06,814
Wait a minute.

442
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,271
Did Chairman Joo do this?

443
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,050
Why?

444
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:14,592
Did Chairman Joo kill Logan?

445
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:16,993
What are you saying?

446
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:19,656
Don't pick on innocent people.

447
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:23,163
This is what my gut tells me.

448
00:31:23,503 --> 00:31:27,000
Logan was totally scammed by Yoon Hee.

449
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,977
Yoon Hee took it?

450
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:33,065
If not, where did she get the money
to buy a place and open a shop?

451
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:34,734
The deposit alone is crazy high.

452
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:38,228
It looked like Su Ryeon
suspected her too earlier.

453
00:31:38,308 --> 00:31:41,052
Wow. She has guts.

454
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,462
How did she swipe 10 billion dollars?

455
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:47,398
Anyway, I wonder if Chairman Joo knows.

456
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,661
We've identified the person
who came to Korea with Logan Lee.

457
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:54,750
What does he do?

458
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,510
He's a Korean-Japanese who lives in Japan.

459
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:58,284
Japan?

460
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,100
His name is Baek Jun Ki, right?

461
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,506
Yes, sir. I think he's still in Seoul.

462
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:04,789
Locate him right now.

463
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:06,691
I want to see his face.

464
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,750
It couldn't be. No... Right?

465
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,585
There's no way.

466
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,990
Share all my performance videos...

467
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,814
that have never been disclosed
on web portals.

468
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:30,829
Also, hire some people who can publish
favourable articles and comments.

469
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,940
"The Prima Donna
who Faced an Unfortunate End."

470
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:36,862
That would be an appropriate title.

471
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:41,074
Let everyone know
that Cheon Seo Jin is back.

472
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,872
Yes, ma'am.

473
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,698
By the way,

474
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:48,630
Eun Byeol got disqualified
at SNU's performance test...

475
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,728
for cheating.

476
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,466
Disqualified? Why?

477
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:57,712
Ro Na had put her cell phone
inside Eun Byeol's pocket.

478
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:01,022
She's been disqualified too.

479
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,517
I doubt Ro Na did something so cheeky.

480
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,525
Someone must have wanted
to get rid of the two at the same time.

481
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:14,793
It's Joo Dan Tae, that jerk's doing again.

482
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:58,418
Jenny!

483
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,270
What do you think you're doing?
Are you out of your mind?

484
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,291
Let go! Let go of me!

485
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:19,857
Why are you doing this?

486
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:21,616
Why would you kill yourself
when I haven't?

487
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:23,635
I got unfairly disqualified,
but I'm staying strong.

488
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:25,596
So why would you go
and try to kill yourself?

489
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:27,257
I can't live like you!

490
00:34:27,643 --> 00:34:29,838
I can't stand living
as a murderer's child.

491
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,640
What are you talking about?

492
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,191
Tell me, Jenny. Did something happen?

493
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:38,361
My dad killed a person.

494
00:34:40,383 --> 00:34:42,409
And he's been in prison for that.

495
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,958
What if the kids find out?

496
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:48,205
I'll be bullied again.

497
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:50,038
I'll be treated like vermin.

498
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:53,438
I don't want to go back to that.

499
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,285
I already know what it is like.

500
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:58,080
I'd rather die.

501
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:02,728
Don't worry.

502
00:35:03,162 --> 00:35:04,830
There's no way they'll find out.

503
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,461
Joo Seok Kyung knows.

504
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:12,960
It's only a matter of time
before everyone at school knows.

505
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,756
Is that why
you messed up the test yesterday?

506
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:18,643
How did you deal with it?

507
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:22,615
I'm so scared and anxious.
It's driving me crazy.

508
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:29,182
I fear being bullied
more than failing to go to college.

509
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,481
This is a nightmare. I'm losing my mind.

510
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,929
Don't cry. You didn't do anything wrong.

511
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:42,405
You have a test tomorrow too.
You'll lose your voice.

512
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:49,022
We can't let them
walk all over us anymore.

513
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:03,259
I'd love to subscribe to some newspapers,
but I don't know how to sign up.

514
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:05,600
Can you do it for me?
For the next 200 years.

515
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:10,095
Look, the director came himself.

516
00:36:10,175 --> 00:36:11,998
Are you planning
to get into politics later?

517
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,254
Let's have a drink together and work hard.

518
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,913
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

519
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:27,461
You see, I want provocative headlines.

520
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:29,523
-Throw in some quotation marks too.
-Quotation marks.

521
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:30,938
-"Cultural resources."
-"Cultural resources."

522
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:32,806
-That's the keyword.
-Okay.

523
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:34,675
Okay. Good.

524
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:36,145
("Discovery of Cultural Assets
Puts Development on Hold")

525
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:37,304
Here you go.

526
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,702
With the Opyeong District development
put on hold,

527
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:48,561
there's no land left available
in the Seoul Metropolitan Area.

528
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:52,004
But Cheonsoo District
is up for development at any time.

529
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,681
So please show some support
in the Assembly.

530
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:57,654
-Of course.
-We can do anything for you.

531
00:36:57,735 --> 00:37:00,625
-You can rest assured.
-Don't worry about it.

532
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:03,391
-Let's drink.
-Sure.

533
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,220
Thank you again.

534
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,525
That was easy.

535
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,626
So when will it be announced?

536
00:37:26,982 --> 00:37:28,957
They're going to bide their time.

537
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:33,772
I've taken care of the reporters,
so don't worry about the press.

538
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:36,545
If Cheonsoo District is reselected,

539
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,974
Cheong A Constructions
will be the constructor.

540
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:44,602
The stock prices will soar,
and we'll be raking in money.

541
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:49,766
But you don't own much land
in Cheonsoo District, do you?

542
00:37:49,846 --> 00:37:52,096
I thought Na Ae Gyo
sold all the land to us.

543
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:54,077
I'll have to take everything back...

544
00:37:54,158 --> 00:37:57,182
from Shim Su Ryeon,
that wench, one by one.

545
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:01,622
Let's celebrate with a drink.
We should call Ha Yoon Chul too.

546
00:38:01,702 --> 00:38:02,829
I heard something.

547
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:07,098
When Logan died,
a huge amount of money disappeared.

548
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,961
Did you know?

549
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,236
What are you talking about?

550
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:13,334
Logan had left his money
with Oh Yoon Hee temporarily.

551
00:38:13,414 --> 00:38:14,885
So when he died unexpectedly,

552
00:38:15,288 --> 00:38:19,442
all his money apparently
became Oh Yoon Hee's.

553
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,026
Ten billion dollars.

554
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:26,247
Oh Yoon Hee? Ten billion?

555
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:33,395
Ten billion.

556
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:37,222
Okay, I'll be right there.

557
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,260
(Cheon Seo Jin's Special Performance
in the US)

558
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,348
What are you doing out here? It's cold.

559
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:06,666
Ms. Jin.

560
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,486
What were you doing?

561
00:39:10,283 --> 00:39:11,670
Nothing.

562
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:16,217
Why were you watching this?

563
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:19,965
A video of Mom's performance popped up.

564
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:23,238
It's my first time watching it.
Give me my phone.

565
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:25,785
I can't even see my mom now.
At least let me...

566
00:39:26,637 --> 00:39:28,757
"Mom"? Who's your mom?

567
00:39:29,194 --> 00:39:31,294
This woman left you. Did you forget?

568
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:34,487
I'm the one with you now.
I'm your real mom.

569
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,075
Me. Jin Bun Hong!

570
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:39,024
What did I say will happen
if you betray me?

571
00:39:39,104 --> 00:39:41,666
You stupid girl.
How many times did I tell you?

572
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,291
I said not to mention your mom.

573
00:39:43,371 --> 00:39:44,563
Is that so hard?

574
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:47,582
How will you get into college
with that stupid brain?

575
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:51,336
Don't make me lose my mind again.
Understood?

576
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:53,373
Answer me!

577
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:56,192
Understood?

578
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:05,132
It's cold.

579
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:08,207
What if you catch a cold?

580
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:10,079
Let's go home.

581
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,986
Mom will make you a hot bowl of udon.

582
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,628
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

583
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,021
Good work, everyone.

584
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:23,371
Tonight is on me, so let's drink.

585
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:27,346
After being in the slammer
and returning to society,

586
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,665
I realized how sweet liquor tasted.

587
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:32,755
This is honey in there.

588
00:40:32,835 --> 00:40:35,765
If I were still stuck there,
I would've killed you...

589
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:39,331
-We were there too.
-We were all there with you.

590
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,201
Dan Tae!

591
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,010
How long has it been?

592
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:51,114
Twenty-five years? No, 27 years?

593
00:40:51,924 --> 00:40:53,881
It has been so long.

594
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:57,490
Do I know you?

595
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,547
It's me, Jun Ki. Baek Jun Ki.

596
00:41:00,423 --> 00:41:01,801
Did you forget about me?

597
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:04,760
Baek Jun Ki?

598
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,958
That's right.

599
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:07,788
Who is he?

600
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:11,530
Who is this new face
who's so close to Chairman Joo?

601
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,561
Hello.

602
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,313
I was surprised
to see someone I liked so much.

603
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:17,935
May I join you for a bit?

604
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,010
Hey. Wait. I don't think...

605
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,884
I lived in the same house as Dan Tae
ever since I was a child.

606
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:24,927
We're like brothers.

607
00:41:25,408 --> 00:41:26,481
Isn't that right?

608
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:28,237
I'm Baek Jun Ki.

609
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:31,636
You can call me "Mr. Baek" for short.

610
00:41:31,716 --> 00:41:32,908
Mr. Baek.

611
00:41:33,378 --> 00:41:35,578
You have a great personality.

612
00:41:35,658 --> 00:41:37,663
It has been a while
since I've been in Korea,

613
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:39,393
so I really wanted to see you.

614
00:41:39,473 --> 00:41:41,015
What are the chances, seeing you here?

615
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:42,146
Have a drink.

616
00:41:42,226 --> 00:41:44,442
It's the first time since Japan, right?

617
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:48,823
It must be fate. Don't you agree?

618
00:41:48,903 --> 00:41:51,731
Anyway, it's nice to meet you, Baek.

619
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:55,396
He never tells us
anything about his time in Japan.

620
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:57,118
We were super curious.

621
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:59,445
So? Will you tell us some stories?

622
00:42:00,178 --> 00:42:01,222
Shall I?

623
00:42:01,665 --> 00:42:02,801
Let's drink.

624
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:03,986
It'll take a while.

625
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:10,718
Let's chat.

626
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:12,346
When Dan Tae was in Japan...

627
00:42:12,426 --> 00:42:14,794
Wait, let's talk.

628
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:16,102
Shall we?

629
00:42:17,253 --> 00:42:19,213
He must have a lot to say
since it has been a while.

630
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:20,345
I'll be right back.

631
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,093
-What's your problem?
-Stop that.

632
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:30,294
You'll wrinkle my suit.

633
00:42:31,494 --> 00:42:33,276
You know I hate wrinkled clothes.

634
00:42:34,895 --> 00:42:37,135
Anyway, you've changed a lot.
You're unrecognisable.

635
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:38,719
Your shoes are spotless.

636
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:40,938
How did you get out? Who let you out?

637
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:42,130
Why?

638
00:42:43,015 --> 00:42:45,333
Did you think I'd rot away
in that dark mental hospital...

639
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:46,968
for the rest of my life?

640
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:50,979
Is that why you took my name
so confidently?

641
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:53,785
After killing my parents too.

642
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,557
How could you think
of living as Joo Dan Tae?

643
00:42:57,637 --> 00:43:00,330
-You're shameless.
-I asked how you got out!

644
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,299
A man named Logan came to see me.

645
00:43:05,174 --> 00:43:09,550
He said someone stole my identity
and was living a lavish life.

646
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:11,316
He asked if I was bitter.

647
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:18,571
I never imagined
you were living like this as a chairman.

648
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,632
Talk about a success story.

649
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:28,305
I can't see that beggar
from before anywhere.

650
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:33,244
You must not like hearing that.

651
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:38,166
But I think those people in there
would really want to know.

652
00:43:38,844 --> 00:43:39,927
Shut it.

653
00:43:40,007 --> 00:43:42,646
Thank the stars you're alive and get lost.

654
00:43:42,726 --> 00:43:44,224
You won't get a second miracle.

655
00:43:44,304 --> 00:43:45,720
Come on, now!

656
00:43:49,729 --> 00:43:52,672
I'm big enough to block that much.

657
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,823
You seem to be in a bad mood,

658
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:01,489
so I'll leave for now.

659
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:03,388
See you again.

660
00:44:03,468 --> 00:44:06,236
There's a lot I want to talk about.

661
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:17,342
Darn it.

662
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:26,291
Follow the guy walking out now.

663
00:44:26,371 --> 00:44:28,410
Find out where he lives and whom he sees.

664
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,164
Darn it.

665
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:38,022
You lost him?

666
00:44:38,945 --> 00:44:41,344
You idiot. You call that an excuse?

667
00:44:41,424 --> 00:44:43,587
I want your resignation tomorrow!

668
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,398
You're finally home.

669
00:44:50,453 --> 00:44:51,746
You...

670
00:44:52,506 --> 00:44:54,278
Why are you here?

671
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,245
Seo Jin, you have a beautiful home.

672
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,460
What a phenomenal view.

673
00:45:02,573 --> 00:45:04,561
I wanted to live in a place like this.

674
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:06,211
Hey. You...

675
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,300
What is wrong with you?

676
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,780
I know we said
we'd stay out of each other's lives,

677
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,845
but you should've given me a heads up.

678
00:45:12,925 --> 00:45:15,869
Seo Jin, are you sure
I can stay here for a few days?

679
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:19,755
I know Dan Tae said yes,
but I hate being a burden.

680
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:21,433
What are you talking about?

681
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:22,730
When did I say yes?

682
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:26,333
Well... It's only for a few days.
How could we say no?

683
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,862
Did you forget what it says in our manual?

684
00:45:29,942 --> 00:45:32,467
"We smile kindly to each other
when others are around."

685
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:35,757
I'm doing my best
to be nice to your guest.

686
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:37,890
Thanks a bunch.

687
00:45:38,643 --> 00:45:40,754
Let's discuss the details tomorrow.

688
00:45:40,834 --> 00:45:42,901
I'm very tired.

689
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,601
You are the bomb.

690
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:54,932
Hey, are you insane?

691
00:45:55,012 --> 00:45:56,573
How dare you come here?

692
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,757
Please watch how you speak.

693
00:45:59,368 --> 00:46:02,391
My heart still beats like crazy
whenever I see you...

694
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:04,240
because I'm reminded of that day.

695
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,152
I want to rest too.

696
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:09,753
You should rest as well.

697
00:46:10,433 --> 00:46:11,723
You don't look well.

698
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:14,230
Should I take that room?

699
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:49,141
You audacious brat.
You have the nerve to threaten me?

700
00:46:49,872 --> 00:46:51,961
How dare you come here?

701
00:46:53,075 --> 00:46:55,970
Do you think you can...

702
00:47:02,792 --> 00:47:04,004
How is it going?

703
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:07,614
I expected this much...

704
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:09,488
when I came here.

705
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,544
Can't you be a little more creative?

706
00:47:13,624 --> 00:47:14,855
You louse.

707
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:23,256
Use your brain a little, will you?

708
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:25,119
Okay?

709
00:47:30,692 --> 00:47:32,035
Get lost, will you?

710
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:34,047
I'm tired.

711
00:47:43,149 --> 00:47:45,474
Seriously. Take this. Here.

712
00:48:31,747 --> 00:48:34,891
He must have something huge on Dan Tae.

713
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,904
I know you can do that much for me.

714
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:48,797
I really want to go to Seoul National
University with my brother.

715
00:48:49,248 --> 00:48:51,462
Make sure
he can take the performance test again.

716
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:54,009
You said you'd do anything for me.

717
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:58,371
I'm really grateful
for what you did to Ro Na.

718
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:00,686
Just use your connections again
for Seok Hoon...

719
00:49:00,766 --> 00:49:02,094
Joo Seok Kyung!

720
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:04,919
Seok Hoon.

721
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:07,894
Have you and Dad been scheming?

722
00:49:08,787 --> 00:49:12,352
Did you ask him to get Ro Na disqualified?

723
00:49:14,853 --> 00:49:16,411
Tell me the truth.

724
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:18,357
Just pretend you don't know.

725
00:49:19,825 --> 00:49:21,612
Why do you have to live like this?

726
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,912
When are you going to stop?

727
00:49:23,992 --> 00:49:25,833
Why is going to university
so important to you?

728
00:49:26,303 --> 00:49:28,540
It's not about university.

729
00:49:29,888 --> 00:49:31,153
Then what is it?

730
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,239
I hate Mom.

731
00:49:33,897 --> 00:49:35,469
It's driving me crazy.

732
00:49:36,067 --> 00:49:38,085
Mom is back, but I still feel lonely.

733
00:49:38,165 --> 00:49:40,358
I want her to only think about me,
but she doesn't.

734
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:41,651
To her,

735
00:49:42,867 --> 00:49:44,226
Ro Na means more than me.

736
00:49:44,306 --> 00:49:47,187
She doesn't care a bit about what I want.

737
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:48,405
That's because...

738
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:51,598
what you want is ridiculous.

739
00:49:51,678 --> 00:49:54,540
Who gives you the right
to interfere in someone else's life?

740
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,656
For both Ro Na and Eun Byeol,

741
00:49:57,813 --> 00:49:59,874
Seoul National University was a dream.

742
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:02,746
Think about your own sister,
who's right next to you.

743
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:05,125
This isn't the time for dating around.

744
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:14,828
I was praying I was wrong.

745
00:50:16,385 --> 00:50:18,026
Was it really your doing?

746
00:50:19,968 --> 00:50:22,155
If you must trample
on others to climb higher,

747
00:50:22,235 --> 00:50:24,642
can you really be proud of yourself?

748
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:26,462
I don't care.

749
00:50:26,951 --> 00:50:28,958
What's so wrong
with getting what I want while I can?

750
00:50:29,038 --> 00:50:31,526
When Dad was arrested,
no one sympathized with us.

751
00:50:31,606 --> 00:50:34,453
If Dad has the power to do it,
why should I say no?

752
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,100
The Seoul National University interview
is today.

753
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:41,678
You can't go. Give up.

754
00:50:42,745 --> 00:50:45,491
Says who? Who are you to decide that?

755
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:47,043
I can't let you go
to Seoul National University.

756
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:49,290
Too bad. I will.

757
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,042
Everything will be okay
as long as you just let it go.

758
00:51:01,557 --> 00:51:03,736
You can do that much for me, can't you?

759
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:08,265
If you really love me,
please do that for me.

760
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:10,387
Don't you even feel sorry for me?

761
00:51:11,006 --> 00:51:14,438
Please. Please let me go.

762
00:51:14,993 --> 00:51:17,887
If I miss the interview,
I won't be admitted.

763
00:51:18,218 --> 00:51:20,615
You don't have to feel bad. Just leave.

764
00:51:21,717 --> 00:51:23,534
Are you out of your mind?

765
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:26,253
Mom, I have to go to the interview.

766
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,586
Please open the door, Mom.

767
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:36,281
Open up!

768
00:51:36,716 --> 00:51:40,266
-Don't let her out no matter what.
-I have to go to the interview!

769
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,409
Open up!

770
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,650
-Are you okay?
-Mom!

771
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,823
-I'm okay. Don't worry.
-This isn't funny.

772
00:51:49,903 --> 00:51:51,541
Open up!

773
00:51:52,397 --> 00:51:55,025
I have to go to the interview.

774
00:51:55,105 --> 00:51:57,142
Mom, I have to...

775
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,531
Shim Su Ryeon,
what do you think you're doing?

776
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:14,282
Come any closer, and I'll slit his throat.

777
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:19,881
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from my daughter?

778
00:52:19,961 --> 00:52:22,737
Your daughter? Don't be ridiculous.

779
00:52:22,817 --> 00:52:24,883
You're not even related.
You're just her step-mom.

780
00:52:24,963 --> 00:52:28,063
You're right. You should be grateful
that you're related to her.

781
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:30,627
There's only one reason
I'm keeping you alive.

782
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:35,447
Being your blood
might prove useful to my kids someday.

783
00:52:37,146 --> 00:52:39,050
Don't ruin Seok Kyung any further.

784
00:52:39,386 --> 00:52:42,396
If you're really her father,
leave her alone.

785
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,778
Are you okay, sir?

786
00:52:52,858 --> 00:52:54,285
Can't you do a better job?

787
00:52:54,646 --> 00:52:55,869
You little...

788
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,501
I can't believe him.

789
00:53:16,682 --> 00:53:18,820
Get dressed. Let's go.

790
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,916
Are you serious, Mom?

791
00:53:22,997 --> 00:53:25,811
Thank you. Thank you so much.

792
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,890
(Dogok Station)

793
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,022
Where are we going?

794
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:39,197
Mom.

795
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,284
Mom!

796
00:53:48,933 --> 00:53:50,841
Why did you bring me here?

797
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,080
(School Violence Committee)

798
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,247
Mom, what are you doing?

799
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:11,201
Let us begin...

800
00:54:11,803 --> 00:54:14,195
Cheong A Arts High School's
school violence committee meeting.

801
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:18,883
If you have ever been
bullied by Joo Seok Kyung,

802
00:54:19,293 --> 00:54:20,351
please raise your hand.

803
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,529
Oh, dear.

804
00:54:31,495 --> 00:54:33,282
What do you think you're doing?

805
00:54:33,362 --> 00:54:34,981
You were all bullies like me.

806
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:37,949
And now you're putting
all the blame on me?

807
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:41,858
You threatened us
into bullying other kids.

808
00:54:41,938 --> 00:54:45,720
You threatened that your dad
would kick us out of SNU Club.

809
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,692
Your word is law at school.
What else could we do?

810
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:51,162
Tell us the truth.

811
00:54:51,506 --> 00:54:54,520
You framed me
at the performance test, didn't you?

812
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,825
Do you have proof?

813
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:58,458
Can you prove that I did that?

814
00:54:58,538 --> 00:54:59,706
I heard you say it.

815
00:55:00,192 --> 00:55:02,596
You asked Dad to get Ro Na disqualified.

816
00:55:02,676 --> 00:55:03,801
Seok Hoon.

817
00:55:03,881 --> 00:55:06,684
You shook me up
before the test on purpose.

818
00:55:07,294 --> 00:55:09,087
Blame your sensitivity.

819
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:10,436
Joo Seok Kyung!

820
00:55:11,399 --> 00:55:12,600
Apologize.

821
00:55:13,776 --> 00:55:16,332
If you sincerely apologize
for what you've done,

822
00:55:16,412 --> 00:55:18,859
you'll be able
to avoid the worst punishment.

823
00:55:21,576 --> 00:55:22,691
This is your last chance.

824
00:55:25,574 --> 00:55:26,902
Okay.

825
00:55:27,767 --> 00:55:29,267
I'll sincerely apologize.

826
00:55:31,935 --> 00:55:33,690
I'm so sorry, guys.

827
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,568

pushovers like you.

You guys do whatever you're told to.

830

I think you should really start thinking
for yourselves.

831
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,246
And you, Jenny.

832
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:51,743
I'm so sorry for telling you
that your dad is a murderer.

833

Seok Kyung!

834
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,846
I didn't expect you to get so shocked.

835
00:56:00,926 --> 00:56:03,052
I just thought you should know.

836
00:56:03,132 --> 00:56:04,582
I don't understand
why I should be criticized.

837
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:07,252
How could you, you little...

838
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:08,396
Yes.

839
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:10,769
You're right.

840
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:17,728
My dad has been convicted of murder.

841

But...

842
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,127
he paid for what he did
for the past six years.

843
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,258
I don't know why I should be criticized
by you, of all people.

844
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:30,506
You're no different from me after all.

845
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,782
Wait a second.

846
00:56:36,552 --> 00:56:39,503

What did you just say?

853
00:57:15,135 --> 00:57:16,222
I'm expelled?

854
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:18,967

Good for you. You did the right thing.

Dad. You said you wanted me
to do something for you.

867
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:56,672
What is it?

868
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,997
What do you want me to do?

Jenny...

876
00:59:21,654 --> 00:59:25,140
reported Seok Kyung
to the school violence committee.

877
00:59:26,223 --> 00:59:28,070
She claims she ruined her exam...

878
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:31,234
because she found out
her dad's a murderer.

879
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:35,472
Were you aware of this?

880
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:42,158
You knew all along
that I told Seok Kyung.

881
00:59:42,271 --> 00:59:47,093
And you stuck close, calling me "sir"
and bowing to me? Is that it?

882
00:59:47,173 --> 00:59:48,645
Tell me!

883
00:59:48,725 --> 00:59:52,732
I'm sure you wanted to get rid of me
because I made your precious princess cry!

884
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:03,505
Yes. I wanted to kill you.

885
01:00:05,596 --> 01:00:07,970
I was so resentful, I wanted to kill you.

886
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,010
Much more than
how my daughter's heart broke,

887
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:16,019
mine broke a hundred,
a thousand times more, right here!

888
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:22,355
My heart hurt enough
that I felt it was being torn.

889
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,937
Can't I feel that way?

890
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,789
I'm a dad too.

891
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:32,641
What did you say, punk?

892
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:39,360
To be honest, when you told Seok Kyung,

893
01:00:39,855 --> 01:00:42,171
didn't you mean for it to reach me?

894
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:45,475
Since I'm the murderer.

895
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,446
Not you.

896
01:00:50,223 --> 01:00:51,467
But...

897
01:00:52,122 --> 01:00:53,723
I will keep my word.

898
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:57,877
As long as you don't betray me.

899
01:01:04,112 --> 01:01:05,426
You are...

900
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:08,965
so very straightforward, Mr. Yoo.

901
01:01:09,414 --> 01:01:12,440
This is why I like you so much.

902
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,433
We've known each other for many years.

903
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:20,353
It's for the better.

904
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:23,602
I couldn't lie to my daughter forever.

905
01:01:25,226 --> 01:01:27,265
My wife has a fiery temper,

906
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:31,004
and I barely managed to stop her
from coming after you.

907
01:01:31,495 --> 01:01:33,147
I deserve some praise for that.

908
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:40,046
I apologize instead
for what Seok Kyung did.

909
01:01:40,627 --> 01:01:45,112
She got her temper from me,
and she's so impatient.

910
01:01:46,972 --> 01:01:48,164
Here.

911
01:01:49,286 --> 01:01:51,001
Thank you.

912
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,091
Stand up straight now.

913
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:58,399
Chairman Joo, let's play!

914
01:01:59,942 --> 01:02:02,309
Come on, Mr. Baek.

915
01:02:04,435 --> 01:02:05,480
Hi.

916
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,745
We met outside.

917
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,356
He said he's scheduled to see you.

918
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:13,790
I heard that you two are living together.

919
01:02:14,806 --> 01:02:16,396
I'm here to walk you home.

920
01:02:16,476 --> 01:02:18,560
I asked your wife
to cook us something nice.

921
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,396
Can Kyu Jin join you, then?

922
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:24,114
I haven't seen Seo Jin in a while.
Can I come?

923
01:02:24,194 --> 01:02:25,714
-No, you...
-Kyu Jin.

924
01:02:26,091 --> 01:02:28,257
You can come. Can't he?

925
01:02:28,772 --> 01:02:30,498
My goodness.

926
01:02:30,578 --> 01:02:33,704
You're like a brother I lost
during the war 70 years ago.

927
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:35,577
Where were you all this while?

928
01:02:35,657 --> 01:02:38,028
-I was right here.
-Were you?

929
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:41,225
-Dong Pil, let's go.
-Let's go.

930
01:02:41,305 --> 01:02:42,558
Let's go!

931

(Cheong A Group)

932
01:02:44,516 --> 01:02:48,089
Mr. Baek, get close. Let's do a love shot.

933
01:02:48,169 --> 01:02:50,075
Come on, move in close.

934
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,473
Check everything.
It's all about the plating.

935
01:02:54,553 --> 01:02:57,720
Pink flowers, purple flowers,
beautifully and harmoniously.

936
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,888
Yes, there.

937
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:03,034
Seo Jin. When did you prepare all this?

938
01:03:03,114 --> 01:03:04,334
You're the best.

939
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:06,232
I get upset too easily.

940
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:08,885
Even more so after being in jail.

941
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:10,718
It has that effect.

942
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,945
-The effect...
-I heard.

943
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:17,153
Thanks to you, Eun Byeol was disqualified.

944
01:03:17,523 --> 01:03:19,077
You did something gutsy.

945
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:23,125
Was the card I was holding
not much of a threat?

946
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:24,733
That was...

947
01:03:25,037 --> 01:03:28,212
So, is the food to your liking?

948
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:30,672
Of course, it is.

949
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:32,775
I love it,

950
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:36,037
but I'm not sure
if Dan Tae's enjoying himself.

951
01:03:36,117 --> 01:03:40,648
Why wouldn't he be?
This is his favourite course meal.

952
01:03:41,066 --> 01:03:42,695
He has such expensive taste,

953
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:47,168
he's known not to eat anything
that wasn't cooked by a hotel chef.

954
01:03:47,248 --> 01:03:50,227
What? Haven't you changed a bit too much?

955
01:03:50,614 --> 01:03:52,923
You used to love silkworm larva,
chicken gizzard,

956
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:55,086
pigskin, stuff like that.

957
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:56,624
Silkworm larva?

958
01:03:56,704 --> 01:03:58,856
My honey hates things like that.

959
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:02,145
But then, he has changed a lot.

960
01:04:02,512 --> 01:04:05,528
He used to wear the same pair of sneakers.

961
01:04:06,123 --> 01:04:08,633
Now he wears nice suits and shoes.

962
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:12,745
I'm surprised
by how much someone can change.

963
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:16,250
Gosh. I can't imagine any of that.

964
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:17,826
I'm so curious!

965
01:04:18,164 --> 01:04:20,992
Jun Ki, do you have any old photos?

966
01:04:21,072 --> 01:04:22,514
There's nothing of the sort!

967
01:04:22,594 --> 01:04:25,297
Why isn't there? There is.

968
01:04:27,074 --> 01:04:28,372
-Let's see.
-Show us.

969
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:31,372
You in your dark ages.

970
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:33,695
Come on! This is gold!

971
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:41,098
Come on. What is it? Show us...

972
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:42,676
Know when to stop.

973
01:04:42,756 --> 01:04:43,806
My gosh.

974
01:04:44,238 --> 01:04:48,230
Will you show us a photo
of your dark ages?

975
01:04:48,526 --> 01:04:52,050
Yes, Chairman Joo. Show us.

976
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,819
Show us!

977
01:04:53,899 --> 01:04:55,807
Show us! Show...

978
01:04:56,211 --> 01:04:58,170
-Honey!
-I said stop it!

979
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,489
How could he throw you down?

980
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:10,287
What was that about? He's so nasty.

981
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:12,527
Do you think...

982
01:05:13,228 --> 01:05:16,390
he got a whole new face
to look like what he does now?

983
01:05:18,343 --> 01:05:19,676
My goodness.

984
01:05:19,756 --> 01:05:23,462
We used to call him Dan Tae
the Small-minded.

985
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:26,270
What? He's small-minded and nasty?

986
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:27,650
He is!

987
01:05:31,106 --> 01:05:33,008

988

991
01:05:41,328 --> 01:05:42,663
Did you take a look?

992
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,174
They're just curious.
You didn't have to ruin the mood.

993
01:05:48,254 --> 01:05:50,984
What are you up to? What is it you want?

994
01:05:51,064 --> 01:05:53,879
Stop playing around and speak up.

995
01:05:55,112 --> 01:05:58,577
Why do you feel so wronged enough
to be this angry?

996
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:02,595
One would think I took something from you.

997
01:06:03,136 --> 01:06:06,746
You took my family's riches
and lived a nice life with my name.

998
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,574
You should know to give back now.

999
01:06:24,103 --> 01:06:27,593
Give your little brother
some pocket money for his struggles.

1000
01:06:28,161 --> 01:06:30,700
Let's have silkworm larva and soju,
your favourite.

1001
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:31,960
On me.

1002
01:06:32,526 --> 01:06:35,597
Memories will come flooding back.
Wouldn't that be nice?

1003
01:06:36,027 --> 01:06:38,042
What are you two doing there?

1004
01:06:38,886 --> 01:06:40,943
I don't want to see the photo anymore.

1005
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,168
Let's just have some fun.

1006
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,394
I'm coming. I'll be right there.

1007
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:49,914
Come along.

1008
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:51,821
Come on.

1009
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:59,422
I'll make you regret not dying...

1010
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:01,716
with your parents back then.

1011
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,229

What are you going to do with this?

1017
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,640
I'll put lot 27 in Cheonsoo District...

1018
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:52,670
in your name.

1019
01:08:53,289 --> 01:08:56,348
You can trust me.
I'll turn your life around.

1020
01:09:00,718 --> 01:09:01,747
Did you eat?

1021
01:09:02,853 --> 01:09:03,945
Let's eat together then.

1022

Following the discovery
of valuable cultural resources,

1023
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:18,736
the Opyeong District development
has been cancelled.

1024
01:09:18,816 --> 01:09:22,306
The Ministry of Land held an emergency
briefing to look for alternatives.

1025
01:09:22,387 --> 01:09:25,756
Cheonsoo District is once again
being considered as a strong candidate.

1026
01:09:25,836 --> 01:09:27,178

("Cheonsoo District
Considered for Development")

1028
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,025
-Nice.
-Congratulations, Mr. Joo.

1029
01:09:34,105 --> 01:09:35,855
Thank you.

1030
01:09:36,269 --> 01:09:37,448
Congratulations, Kyu Jin.

1031
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,212
Let's drink.

1032

-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1033
01:09:44,052 --> 01:09:45,637
Experts say...

1034
01:09:45,717 --> 01:09:48,329
Cheonsoo District
is appropriate for development...

1035
01:09:48,409 --> 01:09:52,025
Some people are
just luckier than others.

1036
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,878
Many hope that the development plan...

1037
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,728
will be implemented soon.

1038
01:09:57,774 --> 01:10:00,150
How are things between you and Seok Kyung?

1039
01:10:01,578 --> 01:10:05,014
Maybe you should've at leas
let her graduate.

1040
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,580
If she can't graduate,
she can't go to college this year.

1041
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:14,019
Logan once told me...

1042
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:18,149
once I decided to get Seol A's revenge,

1043
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:22,117
I wouldn't be able to go back
to being Seok Hoon and Seo Kyung's mom.

1044
01:10:24,983 --> 01:10:26,400
But I disagree.

1045
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:31,027
I believe the twins will understand
and forgive me someday.

1046
01:10:38,424 --> 01:10:39,874
Hi, Hye In. It's Mom.

1047
01:10:39,954 --> 01:10:42,452
Mom, I'm almost done with my rehab.

1048
01:10:42,532 --> 01:10:43,921
I can go to Korea soon.

1049
01:10:44,001 --> 01:10:47,227
Really?
Do you have your doctor's permission?

1050
01:10:47,681 --> 01:10:50,311
Yes. I can't wait to see you.

1051
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:54,338
By the way, why haven't I heard anything
from Logan in a while?

1052
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:56,095
Please tell him I feel hurt.

1053
01:10:56,647 --> 01:10:57,754
Well...

1054
01:10:58,698 --> 01:11:00,244
He's very busy.

1055
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:05,016
I miss you so much.

1056
01:11:05,353 --> 01:11:06,628
I can't wait until you're here.

1057
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:09,522
Me neither. I have to go, Mom.

1058
01:11:10,205 --> 01:11:11,518
Talk to you later.

1059
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,893
Is Hye In coming back?

1060
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,342
Her treatment is almost over.

1061
01:11:20,715 --> 01:11:22,325
I should look after her.

1062
01:11:23,181 --> 01:11:25,591
She doesn't know
about what happened to Logan, right?

1063
01:11:26,974 --> 01:11:30,360
He took such good care of her.
She liked him so much.

1064
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,500
I'll tell her once she gets here.

1065
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,376
Su Ryeon.

1066
01:11:39,893 --> 01:11:43,704
You said Joo Dan Tae switched Seol A
and Hye In, right?

1067
01:11:44,459 --> 01:11:46,704
Which hospital was it?

1068
01:11:47,217 --> 01:11:48,669
Why are you asking?

1069
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:52,663
I'm wondering
if I could find Hye In's biological mom.

1070
01:11:52,743 --> 01:11:54,173
Why would you find her?

1071
01:11:54,922 --> 01:11:57,638
She gave up her baby
after getting paid by Joo Dan Tae.

1072
01:11:57,718 --> 01:11:59,556
Who knows if she regrets it?

1073
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,832
I'll ask around quietly.

1074
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,295

Ms. Shim Su Ryeon?

1077
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:12,687
I remember her.

1078
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:15,994
Her condition was serious
when she was transferred here from the US.

1079
01:12:16,074 --> 01:12:18,387
She was hospitalized here
for quite a while.

1080
01:12:19,031 --> 01:12:22,091
Could I have a look
at her medical records?

1081
01:12:23,111 --> 01:12:24,635
Her baby got switched...

1082
01:12:25,094 --> 01:12:26,932
while she was in the incubator.

1083
01:12:27,586 --> 01:12:28,942
At my clinic?

1084
01:12:30,064 --> 01:12:31,995
That can't be possible.

1085
01:12:32,075 --> 01:12:33,916
It's already been confirmed.

1086
01:12:34,285 --> 01:12:37,070
I'd like to contact the other mother.

1087
01:12:37,906 --> 01:12:39,730
Even if that really happened,

1088
01:12:40,203 --> 01:12:43,341
I can't give you
my patient's personal information.

1089
01:12:43,421 --> 01:12:46,709
Your clinic is responsible
for what happened to the babies.

1090
01:12:47,675 --> 01:12:49,352
And you refuse to cooperate?

1091
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:57,400
Then I'll have to come back
with the police.

1092

around the same time as Ms. Shim.

are not held responsible.

By any chance,

1099

does the record say
Ms. Shim gave birth to twins?

1100

No. It says she gave birth to a baby girl.
