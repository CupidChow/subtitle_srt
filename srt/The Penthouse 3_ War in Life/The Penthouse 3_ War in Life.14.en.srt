inappropriately used clips...)

00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,684

and the Pohang earthquake.)

(Final Episode)

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,097
Why are you interfering with my life
every step of the way?

11
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:29,364
If only you hadn't left me
with no other options,

12
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:31,668
Ha Yoon Chul wouldn't have died.

13
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:33,072
He shouldn't have abandoned me...

14
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:35,920
for his daughter's sake!

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,316
Mom was really the one who killed Dad?

16
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:47,510
After all I've done for Mom...

17
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:51,089
How is she still a monster?

18
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,506
Now, do you believe?

19
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:00,855
I'm sorry you had to see that.

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,397
Is this the police?

21
00:01:13,798 --> 00:01:15,636
I'm reporting a murderer.

22
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:17,956
I know who really killed Oh Yoon Hee.

23
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:19,654
I saw it.

24
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:24,986
My mom killing Oh Yoon Hee.

25
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,974
It's over, Cheon Seo Jin.

26
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,038
You finally made the foolish choice...

27
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:59,406
of being abandoned
even by your own daughter.

28
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:01,270
What?

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,306
Eun Byeol has been watching.

30
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:12,571
Your lies.

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,677
Your dirty wrongdoings. All of them.

32
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,768
It was Eun Byeol
who reported you to the police.

33
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,606
Shim Su Ryeon.

34
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,966
Without you,

35
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,831
my life would have been perfect.

36
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,391
If you hadn't come into my life,

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,765
my family
would not have been ripped apart,

38
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:55,200
and I never would've gotten involved
with scum like Dan Tae.

39
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:56,945
Eun Byeol and I...

40
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,500
Her dad too.

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,191
We could've been happy.

42
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,849
Happy?

43
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,769
You don't deserve happiness.

44
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,285
You will never enjoy happiness
for the rest of your life.

45
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,268
I can't go down like this.

46
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,681
I refuse to die by myself!

47
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,789
Seo Jin, don't do this.

48
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,017
Don't do this. No.

49
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,660
No!

50
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:45,603
No! Mom!

51
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,348
Don't do it.

52
00:03:47,414 --> 00:03:49,042
-Su Ryeon!
-Su Ryeon.

53
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,204
-Get her.
-Su Ryeon!

54
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:55,057
No. It wasn't me.

55
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:58,262
I didn't do it. I didn't push her.

56
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:00,820
Su Ryeon!

57
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,195
Call for a rescue team. Hurry.

58
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,784
-This way.
-She went that way.

59
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,618
-Su Ryeon!
-It's too dangerous.

60
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:15,612
-Su Ryeon!
-You need to calm down.

61
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:17,777
-Su Ryeon!
-Calm down.

62
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:19,485
Su Ryeon!

63
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:22,468
Su Ryeon!

64
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:45,199
An unprecedented murder
has the nation talking.

65
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:47,565
Shim Su Ryeon,
a famous CEO of a furniture company,

66
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:50,846
fell from a cliff in Gimpo today
and has yet to be found.

67
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:53,254
Dozens of divers are searching for her,

68
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,441
but they have been unable to find her.

69
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:58,755
It has been four hours
since she went missing.

70
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:00,600
The police are interrogating
Cheon Seo Jin,

71
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,550
-who was arrested at the site.
-It wasn't me!

72
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:05,390
She is suspected of murdering her rival
Oh Yoon Hee,

73
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:08,635
and the police are interrogating her
about that case as well.

74
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:12,335
The search for Shim Su Ryeon
has been ongoing for three days.

75
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:15,015
Experts say the likelihood
that she survived...

76
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,163
is very low.

77
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:22,003
This case, which displayed
how far a person's ambition can go,

78
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,022
makes us reflect
on the last days of those...

79
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:26,386
who lost their lives.

80
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,430
(Courthouse)

81
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,762
Do you admit to murdering Oh Yoon Hee?

82
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,776
We submit into evidence
the video from the dash-cam...

83
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:50,635
on the day of the incident.

84
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:51,922
Play it.

85
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,066
Seo Jin.

86
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:09,594
Seo Jin.

87
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,951
(Defence Counsel)

88
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,328
Oh, my gosh.

89
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:35,326
She really killed her.

90
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:38,773
The defendant also pushed Shim Su Ryeon
off of a cliff...

91
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,557
and intentionally murdered her.

92
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:42,136
Do you admit it?

93
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,090
I don't recall.

94
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:49,370
The defendant is suffering
from early onset dementia.

95
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,940
According to an expert
from the Cheong A Medical Center,

96
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:54,775
she can't even recognize
her only daughter.

97
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,374
She is severely mentally incapacitated.

98
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,507
Questions like that are meaningless.

99
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,417
I agree.

100
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:05,392
I'd like to call to the stand a witness
who knows...

101
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:07,686
the defendant's state the best.

102
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,128
I'll allow it.

103
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,419
(Defence Counsel)

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,754
(Defence Counsel, Defendant)

105
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,353
(Witness Stand)

106
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,424
What is your relationship
with the defendant?

107
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:52,974
I'm her daughter.

108
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,069
Then you must have seen her
from up close until recently.

109
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:02,877
Is it true that
the defendant suffers from dementia?

110
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,380
(Defendant)

111
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,534
No, she isn't. She's lying.

112
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,138
My mom is acting.

113
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,553
My mom remembers everything.

114
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:25,196
She remembers.
That's why she killed Ms. Shim.

115
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:27,873
Because she knew everything
that my mom did.

116
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:32,539
My mom was never honest
with even her own daughter.

117
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:34,973
Not even once.

118
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:38,627
I don't know her.

119
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:41,089
I have no idea what she's talking about.

120
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:45,093
You were at Gimpo Cliff
during the incident, correct?

121
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,958
Can you tell the court
exactly what you saw?

122
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,246
The witness
is the defendant's direct relative.

123
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:55,509
The witness may refuse to testify.

124
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,125
Correct.

125
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,990
You don't have to answer that.

126
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:00,643
You may refuse to testify.

127
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,925
(Witness Stand)

128
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:05,907
No. I will testify.

129
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,843
(Defendant)

130
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,929
That day,
I was there at the site of the incident.

131
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:15,718
I watched everything my mom did
from beginning to end.

132
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,751
My mom...

133
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,292
ruthlessly shoved Ms. Shim
off the cliff...

134
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:28,279
as Ms. Shim desperately begged
for her life.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,838
(Defendant)

136
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:37,150
Silence in the court!

137
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:38,317
The witness was...

138
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:41,659
at a great distance from the incident.

139
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:44,383
It is unreasonable to say
she saw exactly what happened.

140
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:48,131
The victim's death was the result
of their physical altercation.

141
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:50,908
It was an unintended accident.

142
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,666
It was not an accident!

143
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:55,211
My mom intentionally pushed Ms. Shim,

144
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:58,134
and Ms. Shim didn't do anything
to threaten her.

145
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,134
(Defendant)

146
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,949
That person is lying.

147
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:06,462
I did not kill anyone.

148
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,345
I saw it!

149
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:11,012
I saw clearly it with my own eyes.

150
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,355
Even when my mom pushed my grandfather
down the stairs...

151
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:19,253
and killed him
to become director of Cheong A Foundation.

152
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,065
When she pushed Ms. Oh Yoon Hee
with the car and killed her.

153
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:24,810
I was at the scene each time!

154
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:27,074
My mom killed people...

155
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:29,411
in front of me three times.

156
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,992
My mom is a murderer.

157
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:42,584
While she was mentally capable,

158
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,395
she killed innocent people
to feed her greed.

159
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:49,014
If you saw these things yourself,

160
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:51,959
why have you kept quiet until now?

161
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,998
Because I was the root cause...

162
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,092
of this tragedy.

163
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,934
My mom wanted to get me
into Cheong A Arts High School,

164
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,962
so she forged my grades.

165
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,597
She wanted to get me
into Seoul National University,

166
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:10,746
so she harassed Ms. Oh endlessly.

167
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:13,664
She wanted to make me director
of Cheong A Foundation,

168
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,635
so she killed my grandfather.

169
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:22,215
The root cause
of all of my mom's crimes was me.

170
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,384
That was why
I could never speak the truth.

171
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,343
Please forgive me too.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,337
I have never once...

173
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,351
beaten Ms. Oh's daughter
with my singing skills.

174
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:40,039
That was why my mom was always nervous.

175
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:43,050
In case
I couldn't become the best as she was.

176
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:45,824
In case I couldn't become
the best classical singer.

177
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,894
Now,

178
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,921
I want to end it all.

179
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,488
Eun Byeol.

180
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:15,729
Mom.

181
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,833
You can relax now.

182
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:25,366
I can never fulfill your expectations.

183
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,904
I'm never going to sing again.

184
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,002
Please.

185
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,005
Don't make a sin anymore because of me.

186
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,573
I'll take the punishment too.

187
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,856
No! No! No!

188
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:59,332
No! Eun Byeol!

189
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:00,879
Take her away!

190
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:03,433
Eun Byeol!

191
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,013
No!

192
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:08,020
Eun Byeol!

193
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:12,677
Mom. Let's never meet again
while we're alive.

194
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:18,754
Eun Byeol! No! It wasn't because of you.

195
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,666
It was all my fault.

196
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:24,749
I made all those choices for you.

197
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:26,839
Eun Byeol!

198
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,422
Eun Byeol.

199
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,049
(Witness Stand)

200
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:40,202
Eun Byeol!

201
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:45,344
Eun Byeol!

202
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,324
The defendant Cheon Seo Jin...

203
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,888
killed Oh Yoon Hee and Shim Su Ryeon...

204
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:58,381
with intention
while she was of sound mind.

205
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:01,709
After committing heinous crimes,
instead of showing remorse,

206
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,290
she tried to evade punishment
by faking dementia.

207
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:07,313
Your crimes are very grave and evil.

208
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,148
For those reasons, I give you...

209
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,773
the maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

210
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,470
(Three years later)

211
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,950
Soprano Bae Ro Na has been...

212
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:30,727
working in Italy
after her early graduation from Juilliard,

213
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:32,574
and she returned to Korea
to a great welcome.

214
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,045
She is youngest recipient of...

215
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:38,226
The Golden Goose Award
that goes to the best soprano.

216
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,081
She was invited to perform in Korea,

217
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,395
and her first concert will happen soon.

218
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,495
Tickets were sold out
one minute after sales began,

219
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:48,652
proving she's a rising force
on the classical music scene.

220
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:50,949
I'm standing outside the hall
where prima Donna Ms. Bae...

221
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,115
-will perform soon.
-Are you trying to skin me?

222
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,473
What's this? I'm bruised all over.

223
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:58,663
What have you done?

224
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:01,361
I'm sorry, Chairman.
What I was doing was...

225
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,644
Do you see that soprano on TV?

226
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,540
She's a close friend of mine.

227
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,365
I practically raised her.

228
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:10,189
I can't believe
she came back a raging success.

229
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:11,798
I haven't seen her in three years.

230
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:14,285
How are you close
if you haven't seen her in three years?

231
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:16,217
Do your job, will you?

232
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,650
What will you do about this?

233
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,538
I'm going to a hot spring tomorrow.

234
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:21,122
I'm sorry, sir.

235
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:24,029
When you visit next time, I'll give you...

236
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:26,058
a full-body oil massage for free.

237
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,978
So, did you think
about the investment opportunity...

238
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,314
I mentioned last time?

239
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,828
If this business works out,

240
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:36,535
the money
you can't even spend before you die...

241
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,097
will gain wings.

242
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:40,153
I don't ask for much.

243
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:42,653
Just a little.
Give me five million dollars...

244
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,870
Five million dollars?
For something like this?

245
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,164
-Did his heart stop?
-What?

246
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,168
Don't touch him!

247
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:57,650
I can save him.

248
00:15:59,187 --> 00:16:00,376
I'll do it.

249
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,806
This is the moment I've been waiting for.

250
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,436
He's alive!

251
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,590
(Chance Baths)

252
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,426
Sir! You can't die!

253
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,676
Get up, Kyu Jin.

254
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:33,953
You must save him.

255
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,541
If you save him,

256
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:39,086
your life will be rosy again.

257
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:41,335
You'll get a huge investment,

258
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,384
and the chairman will support you forever.

259
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,652
Stay strong.

260
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:47,905
Let's go!

261
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:49,903
Please help him.

262
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,905
(Operation Room)

263
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:54,995
What happened to my dad?

264
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,489
Are you his wife?

265
00:16:58,555 --> 00:16:59,811
I'm his daughter.

266
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:03,234
I saved the chairman's life.

267
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:07,896
The doctor just said
he miraculously escaped the worst.

268
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:11,389
My gosh. Thank you so much.

269
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:14,945
It was a dire emergency
and he could've lost his life,

270
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:17,720
but I quickly administered first aid,

271
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,592
gave him CPR, and with all my strength,

272
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:24,037
I brought him to the hospital...

273
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:27,425
within the time limit
and that was crucial to his recovery.

274
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:31,122
When I got the call,
I was so afraid he would die.

275
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,644
I was out of sorts,
so I grabbed whatever I could.

276
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,255
It's my token of thanks,
so please don't refuse it.

277
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,880
Why would you give me a gift?

278
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:42,531
You could...

279
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:45,953
thank me later with... What's this?

280
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,350
They're sweet potatoes
that we grew in our garden,

281
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,087
and homemade doenjang too.

282
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:54,758
Sweet potatoes and doenjang?

283
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,047
Yes.

284
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:03,676
You must be all about the noblesse oblige.

285
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:07,336
I respect your humility
and simple lifestyle.

286
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:10,711
The chairman must be very busy.

287
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:12,514
Does he have a weekend farm?

288
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,065
My dad is...

289
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,972
the chairman
of Yangchon-ri's Farmers' Association.

290
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,145
My mom is the head
of the Women's Association.

291
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,860
You must be very tired.

292
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:36,502
Chinese bush clover wine.

293
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:40,953
Yangchon-ri's...

294
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:43,192
Farmers'...

295
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,379
Association's chairman?

296
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,090
(Operation Room)

297
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,895
(Haeyeon Group,
creating a future together.)

298
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:56,859
Miheung Group's Chairman Ma...

299
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:59,073
invited you to the party
for his book release.

300
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,276
I don't attend pointless gatherings.

301
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,665
-Then I'll send flowers instead.
-Yes.

302
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:07,476
Tomorrow, the first group of people...

303
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,691
will move
into Cheonsoo District's Simoon Palace.

304
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,548
Will you attend the party?

305
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:14,582
You should be there.

306
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:17,232
You're moving into the penthouse
on the 130th floor.

307
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:21,041
Including some stores in the mall,
you bought quite a few lots.

308
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:24,402
How much rent will you make each month?

309
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:28,057
You might end up with more cash than me.

310
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:32,382
Don't say that.
I'll never reach your level.

311
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:34,820
You donated to a welfare center again?

312
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:36,913
As much as ten million dollars.

313
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:41,075
You're so generous.

314
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:42,867
I like that.

315
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:46,736
Of all the Hera Club members,
it looks like...

316
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,266
you're the true victor.

317
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:53,063
You're the only person to move into
the problematic Cheonsoo District.

318
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,074
I owe that all to you.

319
00:19:57,011 --> 00:19:59,619
I'll focus on my work
until my husband's released.

320
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,391
I'll make a lot
and spend it on good causes.

321
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:02,691
Like you.

322
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,249
Shall I join you on the factory tour?

323
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:08,320
No. You move into your new place tomorrow.

324
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:09,771
Go and pack.

325
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:16,072
One hundred percent
pollution-free Alaskan ice,

326
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:17,715
Iglus.

327
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,799
Alaskan ice.

328
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:22,029
The very best.

329
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,365
Awake the primal power within.

330
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,876
Pollution-free Alaskan ice, Iglus.

331
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,793
What is this ice?

332
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:33,960
It's nature-made,
100-percent pure organic ice.

333
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,841
Listen. Before humans existed on earth,

334
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:40,711
there were beings
like the T-Rex and mammoths.

335
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:42,110
Where did they all go?

336
00:20:42,414 --> 00:20:44,450
They all died and were buried.

337
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:46,950
But they didn't just disappear.

338
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:49,425
Remnants were left in the ice.

339
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:54,116
So this ice is full of minerals
which we also call minerals.

340
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:57,972
Also, there's the primal power of life.

341
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:02,330
This ice isn't meant to be melted.
It doesn't melt!

342
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:06,324
You're meant to chew and eat it.

343
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,901
Young lady over there. Eat this ice...

344
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:13,121
and you'll get right
into Seoul National University.

345
00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:17,538
Sir. Eat some of this ice and you will...

346
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:20,689
have a handsome son in no time.

347
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,049
Sounds good!

348
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,343
My gosh.

349
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:25,191
Lee Kyu Jin!

350
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:27,528
Hello!

351
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:31,669
Ma'am, eat this ice...

352
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:34,961
and the price
of your apartment will go up!

353
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,791
(Iglus)

354
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,191
Why call me over here when I'm busy?

355
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:50,097
Sang A. This business will be a huge hit.

356
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:54,583
I'll sell Alaskan ice in Korea,
and you'll think it's stupid but it's not.

357
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,756
Do you see all those people?

358
00:21:56,822 --> 00:22:01,071
When this takes off,
you can live in a penthouse!

359
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:04,273
Who says only Kang Ma Ri
can afford a penthouse?

360
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:06,112
So what?

361
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,393
What do you think?

362
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:12,895
The money I gave you as alimony.

363
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:14,762
Invest that in this business.

364
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:17,999
My gosh.
You're still getting into such nonsense.

365
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:20,537
No wonder
your family and relatives too cut you off.

366
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:23,111
Do you need to do more time in prison
to wake up?

367
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,460
Then what?

368
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,469
However hard I try,

369
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:29,815
I can't find someone rich
and connected like Chairman Song.

370
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,161
Oh, no.

371
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:41,174
-Sang A.
-Hey, what are you doing?

372
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:44,176
Forever love.

373
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:48,046
That's him! Get him!

374
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:49,373
He took all my money!

375
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:53,144
You gave minimum wage to your assistant,
and then you take even that.

376
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,682
Lee Kyu Jin. You've been accused of fraud.

377
00:22:56,748 --> 00:22:59,181
Just five seconds. No, ten more!

378
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,708
I haven't wrapped it up!

379
00:23:00,774 --> 00:23:01,896
Let's go.

380
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:04,990
You ungrateful scum!

381
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:08,738
After I've made a man out of a nobody.

382
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,628
Give me my money back.

383
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:12,964
I would've rather spent that money
on crypto-currency.

384
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,169
You jerk!

385
00:23:14,235 --> 00:23:17,539
Promise me you won't cheat!

386
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,915
Think of me as going to the army.

387
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,603
Don't forget about me!

388
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,704
That thief.

389
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:28,100
Stealing my heart till the end.

390
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:47,926
Again.
You have to resonate the maschera there.

391
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:49,087
Open up your diaphragm,

392
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:51,955
and throw your sound far,
as if you are drawing a parabola.

393
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,902
The higher the note gets,
the lower the breathing.

394
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:57,580
Lower the hood and rub your vocal cords.

395
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:58,634
Watch.

396
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,339
You're just a baby teacher.

397
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,455
You don't need to try so hard.

398
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:11,385
Just pass the time and leave.

399
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:14,616
And then if I get fired?
Will you take responsibility?

400
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,981
For me to pay next month's rent,
plus tuition, I can't get fired.

401
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:20,503
So I have to work hard.

402
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:24,054
I heard you're the daughter
of that terrorist Joo Dan Tae.

403
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:30,860
I don't know how you dug into my past,

404
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,946
but your parents let me teach you
even with all that knowledge.

405
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:38,352
You both won your first music competition
after getting lessons from me.

406
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,553
Then I was worth your money, no?

407
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,592
I want to teach you both well.

408
00:24:44,658 --> 00:24:47,074
Let's get another trophy
in this competition, okay?

409
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,628
We got this. From the top.

410
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,830
(From Joo Seok Hoon: 3,000 dollars)

411
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,035
If you send me money one more time,
then I won't let it go.

412
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,742
Here you go.

413
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,691
Seok Kyung. Have you cleaned the griddle?

414
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:22,283
You know we have a group of 50 today,
right? You better hurry.

415
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:23,653
Today will be a tough day.

416
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,411
Then grill me some meat after work.

417
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:27,581
-Pork belly and spare rib roast.
-Okay.

418
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:28,929
Nice.

419
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:36,259
Welcome. How many?

420
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:37,800
-For two.
-Over here, please.

421
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:38,978
Thank you.

(BBQ Restaurant)

423
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,084
You shouldn't be nice to someone
like that.

424
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,450
What if you're nice to him
and he comes back tomorrow?

425
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:22,249
Just for today.

426
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:25,849
I felt a little bad for him.

427
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,733
Is he someone you know?

428
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:31,136
He owned a hardware store
in this neighbourhood for a long time.

429
00:26:31,202 --> 00:26:34,270
But then his wife left,
and he lived with his daughter.

430
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:38,270
He's been like that ever since
she passed away from an illness.

431
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,747
He cared so much about his daughter.

432
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,299
Thank you. You'll be blessed.

433
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:48,971
Sure.

434
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,949
Can I bring him some more meat?

435
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:53,196
No.

436
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,445
I'll buy.

437
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:57,882
Okay then.
I'll bring out a bottle of soju.

438
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:11,770

You better brace yourself
because we're training hard from today.

447

Our teacher is such a perfectionist.

448
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:41,398
Eun Byeol, I brought some fruit.
Can we do this after we eat?

449
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:46,015
I even brought some rice cake
because you're so skinny.

450
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:49,028
No. I'm on a diet right now...

451

has made me gain weight.

You just nod and don't even have
the courtesy to answer?

I see you dressed up
to meet your daughter.

She's never visited you.

Did you tell her?

When it comes to laryngeal cancer,
management after surgery is crucial.

Why in her name every time?

I'm happy as long as Eun Byeol uses them.

492
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,932
You're being discharged soon, right?

493
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:43,186
Are you going to go see Eun Byeol?

494
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:44,518
No.

495
00:33:44,584 --> 00:33:48,529
I promised not to show up
in front of her again.

496
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,204
The person she needs is...

497
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:55,017
not me, but her mom.

498
00:33:57,315 --> 00:34:01,023
I want to make another bag for her
before I leave the hospital.

499
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,500
I hope it'll help Eun Byeol...

500
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,909
forgive her mom.

501
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:12,645
It's painful to hate someone.

502
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:17,064
Seeing Eun Byeol suffer...

503
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:19,734
is the last thing I want.

504
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:22,097
I'm sure she will forgive her mom.

505
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:26,432
You've been trying so hard
to bring them together for three years.

506
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:29,128
Hats, clothes, socks...

507
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:32,135
You've sent her so many things
that you made with love.

508
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:37,153
Can you get me some fabrics
that I can use for making a bag?

509
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,920
This time,
I'll make one for Eun Byeol's mom too.

510
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:03,426
What are you listening to?

511
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:07,134
Ro Na.

512
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,286
I love this song too.

513
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,017
You're early.

514
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,900
I'm 30 minutes early too.

515
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:18,098
I'm jet-lagged.

516
00:35:18,488 --> 00:35:20,502
I woke up early
and have been walking around.

517
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:25,387
You haven't been in Seoul
in three years, right?

518
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:26,700
That's right.

519
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:29,053
When I left, I didn't want to come back.

520
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:31,731
But it's nice to be back here.

521
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,125
I must've missed it.

522
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,927
What have you been doing here?

523
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:38,664
I went to see Mom and checked out
the venue. I've been quite busy.

524
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:41,143
When did you get back?

525
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,567
Me? Last night.

526
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,000
If the world-famous prima Donna
needs me as her accompanist,

527
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:50,008
I should, of course,
fly to her right away.

528
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:51,804
You're kidding.

529
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:56,224
It was almost impossible to schedule
the concert because you're so busy.

530
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,644
Even when I visited Vienna last year,
you were too busy to meet me.

531
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,506
I had a concert that day,
and you didn't tell me in advance.

532
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:05,546
Here's your menu.

533
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,576
What should we get?

534
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:11,626
Pasta.

535
00:36:14,432 --> 00:36:15,932
You promised me to buy it.

536
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:19,301
I've been fasting all day for it.

537
00:36:20,673 --> 00:36:23,499
Don't tell me you forgot your promise.

538
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:26,881
Do you want to get pasta with me tomorrow?

539
00:36:26,947 --> 00:36:29,136
I can wait for you
by the entrance after class.

540
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:30,903
I'm busy tomorrow.

541
00:36:35,123 --> 00:36:36,846
I can wait.

542
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:43,151
No way.

543
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:46,317
I've waited for you for four years.

544
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:50,808
Two plates of pasta, please.

545
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,808
What kind of pasta do you want?

546
00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:55,839
Should I recommend something?

547
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,823
Rose pasta is our signature dish.

548
00:37:00,513 --> 00:37:01,575
Sounds good.

549
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:03,541
We'll have two of that.

550
00:37:04,203 --> 00:37:05,339
Sure.

551
00:37:06,422 --> 00:37:08,271
Ms. Bae, it's an honour to meet you.

552
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:11,206
I'm a huge fan.
Could you give me an autograph?

553
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,401
My name is Lee Byung Yoon.

554
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:19,815
I'm joining the military next week.

555
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:21,296
This will really cheer me up.

556
00:37:21,362 --> 00:37:24,162
(To Byung Yoon, Ro Na)

557
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,820
Thank you. Good luck.

558
00:37:27,886 --> 00:37:28,987
It's an honour.

559
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,872
Are you sure
you're not straining yourself?

560
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:42,475
Why do you keep such a busy schedule?

561
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,703
How many operas and recitals
have you done this year only?

562
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:47,087
I enjoy singing.

563
00:37:47,944 --> 00:37:49,484
It takes my mind off things.

564
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:51,940
Are you going to stay in Italy?

565
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:53,164
Yes.

566
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:56,829
What about you?
Are you going to stay in Austria?

567
00:37:58,311 --> 00:38:00,606
Yes, probably.

568
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,492
I have many concerts coming up.

569
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:06,103
Right.

570
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:08,342
I have something for you.

571
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:12,737
I bought it in Vienna for you.

572
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:17,851
It's beautiful.

573
00:38:19,272 --> 00:38:20,390
Thank you.

574
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,478
What's this?

575
00:38:26,335 --> 00:38:28,034
The key to my place in Vienna.

576
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:29,975
You can come anytime.

577
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:35,462
-What?
-You'll perform there this winter.

578
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:39,218
Even if I'm not there,
wait for me at my place.

579
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:42,285
If you leave without seeing me again,

580
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:44,828
I'll get really angry.

581
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,648
Don't do that again.

582
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:53,478
I ran like crazy
as soon as the concert was over,

583
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:56,255
but I was told
you were already on the plane.

584
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:57,961
Do you know how disappointed I was?

585
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,954
Still, I saw all your concerts.

586
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:05,668
You played all Rachmaninoff
and Chopin etudes.

587
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:07,046
It was amazing.

588
00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:12,441
It was to see your concerts
that I went to Vienna,

589
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:16,004
although I had to get back
for other plans.

590
00:39:22,353 --> 00:39:23,464
I missed you.

591
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:26,660
Ro Na.

592
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:30,642
Me too.

593
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:32,931
I missed you, too.

594
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,679
Thank you for agreeing
to be my accompanist.

595
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,728
I had asked you to be my accompanist...

596
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:44,271
if I did a solo...

597
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:47,265
at our high school graduation.

598
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:48,323
And finally...

599

(Soprano Bae Ro Na Recital

602
00:40:49,132 --> 00:40:50,213
Ro Na.

603
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,304
-Oh, my.
-Look at you.

604
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,895
My best friend came back as a superstar
after three years.

"The next Jo Su Mi,
the genius prima Donna"...

606
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:01,787
The media is going crazy.

607
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:03,233
I feel distant.

608
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:04,625
You're being silly.

609
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:08,445
I hear you'll be studying in Italy
next month.

610
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:11,196
She, of course, wants to be where you are.

611
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,611
Please keep a close eye on her.

612
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:15,251
Don't worry.

613
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:18,243
I'll make sure she works hard.

614
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,857
Don't book hotel rooms and stay with us.

615
00:41:24,923 --> 00:41:27,199
We recently moved.

616
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:29,150
To the penthouse of Simoon Palace.

617
00:41:29,216 --> 00:41:31,685
It's still a little messy,
but the view is amazing.

618
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,677
I prepared your favourite food too.

619
00:41:33,743 --> 00:41:36,873
Really? I miss home-cooked food.

620
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:43,219
Oh, my. Look who's here.
Seok Hoon, is that you?

621
00:41:43,285 --> 00:41:46,622
My gosh. Look how dashing you've become.

622
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:49,703
You two make such a cute couple.

623
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:53,223
It's your first time performing together,
isn't it?

624
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:56,661
I begged her like crazy.
She kept refusing.

625
00:41:59,474 --> 00:42:03,248
I wish your moms could've seen this.

626
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,177
Why are you saying that?

627
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:08,465
Be understanding.
She's going through menopause.

628
00:42:09,353 --> 00:42:12,454
We lost Yoon Hee and Su Ryeon
so needlessly.

629
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:16,590
But you two grew up so well.
I'm so grateful.

630
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:17,868
Thank you.

631
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:21,097
They have to perform soon.
Stop that, will you?

632
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,127
See you after the performance.
Break a leg.

633
00:42:23,193 --> 00:42:25,354
You have to come over afterwards.
I'll be waiting.

634
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,569
See you later.

(Beyond Korea into the World)

636
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,650
Blue roses.

637
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:38,728
Yes. Someone sends them
to all of my performances.

638
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:40,399
I don't know who though.

639
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:43,976
Those were my mom's favourite.

640
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:50,313
Don't you remember?
Mom used to like blue roses.

641
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:53,549
You're right.

642
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:55,377
What do blue roses mean?

643
00:42:57,924 --> 00:42:59,128
A miracle.

644
00:43:01,232 --> 00:43:02,356
A miracle.

645
00:43:08,272 --> 00:43:09,951
Do your best, both of you.

646
00:43:10,953 --> 00:43:13,124
I have to work, so I can't watch though.

647
00:43:13,764 --> 00:43:16,281
Why are the tickets so expensive?

648
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:18,262
What, is good music only for the rich?

649
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,475

Let's have dinner together tonight.

652
00:43:26,786 --> 00:43:28,876
Jenny's mom says she'll cook for us.

653
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:31,785
Sure. Whatever.

654
00:43:35,617 --> 00:43:37,807
She's just putting on an act.

655
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:40,601
I sent her a ticket. She'll be there.

656
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,889
You did? So did I.

657
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,039
What is wrong with you?

658
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:51,108
Ms. Shim passed away
three years ago already.

659
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:54,856
But I feel like she'll show up
out of nowhere.

660
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,982
Salute!

661
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:00,589
I was discharged today.

662
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:03,075
I ran right over as soon as I arrived.

663
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,277
Did you really get discharged?

664
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:08,705
You're the only one
who takes three years to get discharged.

665
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,498
How could you fail to adapt
that you had to go three times?

666
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:13,531
Regardless, I did It, didn't I?

667
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:15,664
I'm qualified to go out with you now,
right?

668
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,894
Dream on.

669
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,688
How did you get a ticket?

670
00:44:18,754 --> 00:44:20,175
Did you click like crazy
even while in the army?

671
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,614
I saved up my allowance diligently
and bought it.

672
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,375
That's right. I have a gift.

673
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:25,828
You didn't need to get me...

674
00:44:25,894 --> 00:44:27,850
Ma'am, these are your favourites.

675
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,984
Thank you very much
for taking care of my mom.

676
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:33,996
She had a really hard time
after the divorce.

677
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:35,494
Thank you for finding her a place to live.

678
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,572
I'll repay you as soon as I make money.

679
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:39,500
They say boys become men in the army.

680
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:41,752
Who knew Kyu Jin's son
would become so polite?

681
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:43,461
Now, I've seen it all.

682
00:44:44,122 --> 00:44:45,427
Min Hyuk!

683
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,290
My son.

684
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,938
Is it really you?

685
00:44:52,004 --> 00:44:53,647
Why are you here so late?

686
00:44:53,713 --> 00:44:56,463
I'm sorry. My dear son.

687
00:44:56,529 --> 00:44:58,377
-Have you eaten?
-Of course.

688
00:44:58,443 --> 00:45:00,925
-I've missed you so much.
-You've lost so much weight.

689
00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:03,032
Didn't they feed you in the army?

690
00:45:12,317 --> 00:45:14,130
-What is it?
-What?

691
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,289
Nothing. I thought I saw someone.

692
00:45:39,577 --> 00:45:42,511
Mr. Lee. How have you been?

693
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:44,761
It's been too long.

694
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:46,818
It has.

695
00:45:48,477 --> 00:45:49,858
Are you ready?

696
00:45:51,072 --> 00:45:52,565
Congrats on your first recital.

697
00:45:56,497 --> 00:45:58,279
Thank you for inviting me.

698
00:45:59,227 --> 00:46:00,672
I feel so proud.

699
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:03,925
I'm sure your mom
would be very proud of you.

700
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,829
Seeing you smile makes me happy.

701
00:46:10,888 --> 00:46:15,280
I thought you'd still be sad
because of Ms. Shim.

702
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,469
There is someone who supported me...

703
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:49,271
both financially and emotionally,
which is the reason I'm here today.

704
00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:53,778
This recital was only possible
because of him.

705
00:46:54,468 --> 00:46:56,486
Let me introduce to you
the director of Simoon Art Center,

706
00:46:56,552 --> 00:46:58,101
Mr. Logan Lee.

707
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:08,168
Thank you.

708
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:12,806
There was someone very precious to me.

709
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,548
Her name was Min Seol A.

710
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,265
She was very talented.

711
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:22,959
I want to make her dream come true.

712
00:47:23,025 --> 00:47:24,759
Thus, Simoon Art Center...

713
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:28,310
will continue to produce
more and more great musicians...

714
00:47:28,376 --> 00:47:30,772
and support them fully.

715
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:56,022
I was reminded of someone
as soon as I walked onto the stage.

716
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,518
My mother.

717
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:04,567
Today is the anniversary of her passing.

718
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:11,297
My mother was the strongest person
that I knew.

719
00:48:12,379 --> 00:48:15,066
There was nothing she wouldn't do for me.

720
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:18,984
Ro Na, you can do it.

721
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,795
Are you going to give up like this?

722
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:24,082
I don't know if I can do it.
I don't think I can.

723
00:48:24,499 --> 00:48:26,507
Ro Na, don't forget.

724
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:30,207
You have the best voice here.

725
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:31,655
No one...

726
00:48:33,215 --> 00:48:35,138
can sing as well as you.

727
00:48:36,335 --> 00:48:38,214
I'd like to sing this song,

728
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,290
which my mom loved,
for her at my first recital.

739
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,759
Eun Byeol, why are you so pretty today?

740
00:53:12,825 --> 00:53:13,905
-Do I look pretty?
-Yes!

741
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:15,751
Good. I dressed up.

742
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,928
Why did you dress up
to perform at a prison?

743
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:21,720
You even make us practice doubly hard.

744
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:24,596
Because there's someone there
that is very hard to please.

745
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:26,850
You'll get told off terribly
if you make a mistake.

746
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:29,093
Really? Who's that?

747
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:32,574
The best singer in the world.

748
00:53:33,754 --> 00:53:35,672
I haven't seen her in three years.

749
00:53:35,738 --> 00:53:37,326
Our concert's just two hours away.

750
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:40,016
-I see.
-You go ahead.

751
00:53:40,082 --> 00:53:41,214
Join us soon.

752

(I'm sorry for everything.
I won't burden my daughter.)

755
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,174
(Eun Byeol, don't live like me.
You must be happy. I love you.)

756
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,031
I'm sorry for everything.

757
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,935
I won't burden my daughter.

758
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:30,216
Eun Byeol.

759
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,426
Don't live like me.

760
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:40,851
You must be happy.

761
00:54:45,547 --> 00:54:46,721
I love you.

762
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:19,550
(Welcome back to Korea!)

763
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:34,620
Will you come with me, Logan?

764
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,060
(Three years ago)

765
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,128
Yoon Chul.

766
00:57:08,916 --> 00:57:10,133
Do you recognize me?

767
00:57:11,026 --> 00:57:13,721
Who did this? It was Seo Jin, wasn't it?

768
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,990
Why did you foolishly come here
on your own?

769
00:57:17,056 --> 00:57:18,227
Su Ryeon.

770
00:57:20,426 --> 00:57:23,050
Do one last thing for me.

771
00:57:25,266 --> 00:57:26,358
Seo Jin.

772
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:29,879
Don't kill her.

773
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:32,031
As Eun Byeol's mom,

774
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:35,933
let her live somehow, somewhere.

775
00:57:38,396 --> 00:57:41,894
She wasn't evil from the start.

776
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:46,652
She met someone like me...

777
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,049
and she turned spiteful.

778
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,863
I will...

779
00:57:57,426 --> 00:57:59,487
pay for everything she did.

780
00:58:00,547 --> 00:58:01,672
Yoon Chul.

781
00:58:02,585 --> 00:58:03,810
Yoon Chul!

782
00:58:05,297 --> 00:58:06,751
Yoon Chul!

783
00:58:46,638 --> 00:58:48,181
It's hard, isn't it?

784
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:50,384
Hang in there a bit longer.

785
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:53,846
Let's make her pay
for Yoon Chul's death too.

786
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:58,232
Were all the choices I made so far...

787
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,332
good and right?

788
00:59:02,173 --> 00:59:04,871
Why would you say that?

789
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:08,065
If I hadn't decided to get revenge,

790
00:59:09,114 --> 00:59:13,196
Yoon Hee and Dr. Ha wouldn't have died.

791
00:59:15,195 --> 00:59:16,953
Because I wanted revenge,

792
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,649
too many people died,

793
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,823
and kids lost their parents.

794
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,602
I feel like everything is my fault.

795
00:59:29,668 --> 00:59:32,697
No. That is not true.

796
00:59:32,763 --> 00:59:34,473
If you hadn't punished Dan Tae,

797
00:59:34,539 --> 00:59:38,017
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung
can't have lead normal lives.

798
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:39,372
It's not...

799
00:59:40,017 --> 00:59:41,976
your fault at all.

800
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,928
I think...

801
00:59:47,763 --> 00:59:50,109
I wasn't completely human either.

802
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,880
Don't worry.

803
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,764
I won't stop here.

804
01:00:01,645 --> 01:00:03,365
We still have Seo Jin to deal with.

805
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,147
We're almost there.

806
01:00:08,618 --> 01:00:11,601
Once we're done, let's leave together.

807
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:13,169
I don't care where to.

808
01:00:13,923 --> 01:00:15,160
If it's with you,

809
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:17,872
whether it's paradise or purgatory,

810
01:00:18,973 --> 01:00:20,206
I don't mind.

811
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,646
It's time to call Seo Jin.

812
01:00:26,846 --> 01:00:29,080
Before she goes abroad,

813
01:00:29,146 --> 01:00:31,313
we must call her to the Gimpo cliff.

814
01:00:31,809 --> 01:00:34,897
You go to Yoon Chul's funeral
and get Eun Byeol.

815
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:37,190
We must hurry.

816
01:00:38,473 --> 01:00:41,564
It's a steep and high cliff.
That worries me a lot.

817
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,904
Wear this.

818
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,686
What's this?

819
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:53,158
It's a specially-made life jacket.

820
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:55,866
Even if you get swept away by the rapids,

821
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,816
it'll help you float up.

822
01:00:57,882 --> 01:00:59,224
And here's...

823
01:01:01,394 --> 01:01:02,819
a GPS tracker.

824
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,206
If worse comes to worst,

825
01:01:05,272 --> 01:01:07,740
we'll be able to find you soon.

826
01:01:07,806 --> 01:01:09,060
Thank you.

827
01:01:09,996 --> 01:01:11,433
I'll hold on to it.

828
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,497
Please stay safe.

829
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,290
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

830
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,101
Remember this.

831
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:42,673
Wherever you are, I'm with you.

832
01:01:44,376 --> 01:01:45,458
I'll always...

833
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,707
have your back.

834
01:02:40,113 --> 01:02:41,511
Still no luck?

835
01:02:41,897 --> 01:02:44,689
She's been missing for hours.
What's taking so long?

836
01:02:44,755 --> 01:02:47,162
There's no signal from her GPS tracker.

837
01:02:47,228 --> 01:02:48,869
Something must have gone wrong.

838
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:51,413
What do you mean, there's no signal?

839
01:02:52,551 --> 01:02:54,921
No. I can't let this happen.

840
01:02:54,987 --> 01:02:56,756
We must find her.

841
01:02:56,822 --> 01:02:59,744
We must find Su Ryeon no matter what.

842
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:12,755
The search for Ms. Shim Su Ryeon
has been going on for three days.

843
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:18,124
Experts say there is little chance
that she is still alive.

844
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:22,159
This incident shows
how far human greed can go.

845
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:25,632
It teaches us
the consequences of forgetting...

846
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:26,982
values in life.

847
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,581
Ms. Shim's body has just been found.

848
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,740
(Police)

849
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,492
I can't die like this.

850
01:06:00,035 --> 01:06:01,907
I can't die alone!

851
01:06:10,964 --> 01:06:12,294
I don't want that either.

852
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:18,336
Cheon Seo Jin. No! Don't do this.

853
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,619
For a while,
I dreamed of living happily with you.

854
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:51,494
I believed Seol A sent you to me.

855
01:06:52,372 --> 01:06:55,646
I felt so safe
and comfortable in your arms.

856
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:04,290
There were many moments
when I felt I never wanted to leave you.

857
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,650
But I've lost too many people I love...

858
01:07:10,664 --> 01:07:13,382
to keep on dreaming with you.

859
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:18,244
Na Ae Gyo.

860
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:22,250
Yoon Hee.

861
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,771
Dr. Ha.

862
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,620
I'm going to meet them
and beg for their forgiveness.

863
01:07:41,007 --> 01:07:43,913
I don't think we died in vain.

864
01:07:45,054 --> 01:07:47,864
Through our deaths,
we protected our children.

865
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,707
You told me you had promised Seol A
that you'd make me happy.

866
01:07:56,269 --> 01:07:58,364
Thank you for keeping that promise.

867
01:07:59,925 --> 01:08:03,774
Thanks to you, I shamelessly lived...

868
01:08:04,745 --> 01:08:06,680
a happy life.

869
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:20,020
I'm sorry.

870
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,420
I'm so sorry.

871
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,270
(Shim Su Ryeon)

872
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,340
(Shim Su Ryeon, Oh Yoon Hee)

873
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:51,794
(Dear Mom, I'm sorry and I love you.)

874
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,464
(Please tell Seol A
that I'm sorry and I love her.)

875
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,184
(I'm glad you're my mom. I love you.)

876
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,830
(Seok Kyung)

877
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:26,290
(Logan Lee)

878
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:32,472
Mr. Lee.

879
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,968
How have you been?

880
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,411
It's been too long.

881
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:46,050
(Logan Lee)

882
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,507
Thank you for inviting me.

883
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,910
Seeing you smile...

884
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:55,590
makes me happy.

885
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:58,849
I hope...

886
01:10:00,317 --> 01:10:01,601
you're not in pain anymore.

887
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,695
There is someone who supported me...

888
01:10:20,761 --> 01:10:24,796
both financially and emotionally,
which is the reason I'm here today.

889
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:29,396
Without him, today's concert
wouldn't have been possible.

890
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,744
I present to you
the director of Simoon Arts Center,

891
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:34,454
Logan Lee.

892
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,774
Poor man.

893
01:10:51,128 --> 01:10:52,852
How dejected he must have been...

894
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:55,028
to have his bone marrow cancer relapse.

895
01:10:55,363 --> 01:10:57,135
I heard he kept it a secret
even to his family...

896
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:58,958
and gave up on treatment.

897
01:10:59,024 --> 01:11:01,813
What does a life
without Su Ryeon mean to him?

898
01:11:01,879 --> 01:11:04,411
He truly cared for her.

899
01:11:05,131 --> 01:11:07,858
But he helped prepare
for Ro Na's performance...

900
01:11:07,924 --> 01:11:10,378
until the very end.

901
01:11:11,841 --> 01:11:14,237
You didn't see Su Ryeon on the day
of their engagement, did you?

902
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,239
She was breathtakingly beautiful.

903
01:11:16,926 --> 01:11:19,870
I'd never seen such a beautiful couple.

904
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:23,545
When I think about it,

905
01:11:24,589 --> 01:11:27,553
I feel like Min Seol A,
who died unjustly at Hera Palace,

906
01:11:28,306 --> 01:11:30,959
called those two up to the sky.

907
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,900
(Remembering Logan Lee)

908
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:00,545
Will you come with me, Logan?

909
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:14,009
What took you so long?

910
01:13:15,018 --> 01:13:16,591
I've missed you so much.

911
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:22,855
Thank you for coming to get me.

912
01:13:41,815 --> 01:13:43,833
We have people we need to meet.

913
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,337
Who?

914
01:13:47,908 --> 01:13:50,794
You'll be happy to see them too.

915
01:13:52,283 --> 01:13:55,459
I don't know where to start.

916
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:06,252
I'm nervous. I've waited for too long.

917
01:14:07,353 --> 01:14:08,779
Let's go meet them.

918
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,650
(Thank you for supporting
and watching The Penthouse 3.)

919
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,750
=The Penthouse 3=

920
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:48,110
(From next week,
"One the Woman" will air.)

921
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:55,910
(The Penthouse 3, Thank you for watching.)
