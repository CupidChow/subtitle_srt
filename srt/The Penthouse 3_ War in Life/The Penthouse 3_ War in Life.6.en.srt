4
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:17,621
Where have you been?
Why did you only show up now?

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,399
My real name is Joo Dan Tae.

6
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:22,026
You were just as beautiful then.

7
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,505
It's been a while, Ha Yoon Chul.

8
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:25,990
Who on earth are you?
Why are you doing this to me?

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,896
Put me behind bars like Dad.

10
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:29,579
You're not even my real mom, so why not?

11
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:32,107
Will you care about me
only when I'm dead too?

12
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:33,462
You're no longer my daughter.

13
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:34,705
Where's Seok Kyung right now?

14
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,521
Eun Byeol has been kidnapped by Ms. Jin.

15
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,167
Eun Byeol, wake up!

16
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,786
I need to tell Su Ryeon.

17
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,431
That Seok Kyung
is her biological daughter.

18
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,743
You put up a good fight
against me all your life.

19
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:46,275
Still, the winner is me, Oh Yoon Hee.

20
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:48,308
She tried to kill Eun Byeol and me.

21
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:50,768
Oh Yoon Hee could've followed Eun Byeol
to kill her.

22
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:54,149
I've put Oh Yoon Hee's shares
in your name.

23
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,123
Congratulations
on becoming the center director.

Congratulations, honey.

29
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,980
Director Cheon,
first of all, congratulations.

30
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,118
Many are praising
your comeback performance...

31
00:02:01,198 --> 00:02:02,769
at your inauguration ceremony today.

32
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,308
How do you maintain your voice
in such perfect condition?

33
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:09,125
Even after I retired,
music is everything to me.

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,955
I'd like to dedicate
today's performance...

35
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:14,322
to all my fans in the country.

36
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:16,298
From now on, I'm going to commit myself...

37
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:19,370
to raising Korean classical singing
to a world-class level.

38
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,189
Your daughter
recently had an unfortunate experience.

39
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,879
Is it true that
the kidnapper is your old rival?

40
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:27,778
Rumour has it that...

41
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,320
she's also the ghost singer
who forced you to retire.

42
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:33,819
Sir, you seem
to be starting a rumour yourself.

43
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:35,244
The kidnapper is just...

44
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:38,406
one of my wife's classmates
who admired my wife.

45
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,556
I do sympathize with her wish...

46
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:47,751
to get her incompetent daughter
into Seoul National University.

47
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:49,362
But I can never forgive her...

48
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:53,364
for committing such a horrible crime
out of a sense of inferiority.

49
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:56,731
Not all students should strive
to get into Seoul National University.

50
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:59,188
To prevent this tragedy
from occurring again,

51
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:02,700
it's time we reformed
our education system.

52
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,288

Didn't I say
you didn't have to attend the ceremony?

56
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:24,615
This is prima Donna Cheon Seo Jin's
comeback performance.

57
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:26,371
Her husband should, of course, be there.

58
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:30,315
Come to think of it,
you're one lucky woman.

59
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:32,140
With Oh Yoon Hee dead,

60
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,609
the truth of the ghost singer
is buried forever.

61

I feel sorry for that poor woman.

62
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,844
You must know why Cheong A Group's stock
prices have skyrocketed.

63
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:45,156
Cheong A Arts Center has attracted
500 million dollars from abroad.

64
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:47,906
Out of which,
how much is from Oh Yoon Hee?

65
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:50,635
I have a question.

66
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:54,713
How come Oh Yoon Hee's shares
have become yours overnight?

67
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:58,034
It's almost as if
you've been waiting for her to die.

68
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,392
What about you?

69
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:05,390
Why did Jin Bun Hong lie
at the press conference?

70
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,988
You think I don't know who's behind her?

71
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,754
I'll never forgive you
for messing with my daughter using her.

72
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:13,996
Be prepared.

73
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:17,654
If you know that,
why are you letting it slide?

74
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:22,472
The worse Oh Yoon Hee looks,

75
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,852
the more beneficial it is to you.

76
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,615
Is that it?

77
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:29,824
We're in the same boat now.

78
00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:33,685
As the shareholders of Cheong A Group,
we have no choice but to help each other.

79
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,972
You don't want the boat
we're in to sink, do you?

You're here. Everything seems fine.

85
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:06,575
Her memory has returned, too.

86
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:08,300
Thank you.

87
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,001
Thank you so much.

88
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:15,811
Eun Byeol, are you okay?

89
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:17,720
I'm so relieved that you woke up.

90
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,586
You have no idea how worried I was.

91
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:22,692
I have great news.

92
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,415
You...

93
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:27,055
got into Seoul National University.

94
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,596
It was proved that Bae Ro Na cheated,

95
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,226
so the professors unanimously agreed
to accept you back.

96
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:36,388
What's wrong? Aren't you happy?

97
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:39,343
Seoul National University
has been your dream.

98
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,607
You don't have to worry
about anything anymore.

99
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,766
Leave all the bad memories behind...

100
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,431
Those eyes are haunting me.

101
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:48,617
What eyes?

102
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,422
Ro Na's mom's eyes right before she died.

103
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,174
If you make eye contact
with a dying person,

104
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,775
you're supposed to lose your soul.

105
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,440
That means, soon, I'll either go insane,

106
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,123
die, or become a monster.

107
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:06,851
What do you mean?

108
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,559
Where did you see Ro Na's mom?

109
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:13,595
Why did you do it?

110
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,547
What?

111
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,531
You killed her.

112
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:22,917
You pushed her off the cliff
with your car.

113
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,463
Eun Byeol! Wake up!

114
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,442
Eun Byeol! Please wake up!

115
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,798
Stop it!

116
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:39,810
She's still in the car!

117
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:44,377
Ms. Oh. You can't leave me.

118
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:46,905
Please save me.

119
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:49,359
Eun Byeol!

120
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:54,217
I got you.

121
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:55,415
Here...

122
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:01,996
Seo Jin! Help...

123
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,590
Goodbye.

124
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:33,795
She tried to save me.

125
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,337
She kept trying to wake me up
and never left me.

126
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:40,313
How could you kill someone
who was trying to save me?

127
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,595
How could you?

128
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:44,268
No! You're mistaken.

129
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:49,749
You must've had a nightmare.

130
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,725
I'll ask for a sedative.

131
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:53,695
Thanks to Ro Na,

132
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,046
I was finally able
to get free from Ms. Jin.

133
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,353
But I've betrayed her again.

134
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:04,267
I killed the woman who saved me!

135
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,219
I did it for you.

136
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:11,121
For me?

137
00:08:13,437 --> 00:08:16,204
You killed Grandpa and Ms. Oh for me?

138
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:20,996
Life isn't that easy.

139
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:22,884
You win some, you lose some.

140
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:25,032
How long will you throw tantrums
like a child?

141
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:27,044
Do you know what I did to get back here?

142
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:29,047
Do you know the humiliation I suffered?

143
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,922
I was treated like garbage in prison
for the first time in my life.

144
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,374
I was insulted by scums of the earth.

145
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:36,110
But I hung in there and survived.

146
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,359
That's what you need to do! You can do it!

147
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:42,028
I can't do it. I just can't...

148
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:46,759
What if Ro Na's mom follows me
for the rest of my life?

149
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:48,438
What if I go crazy?

150
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:50,579
I'm scared.

151
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,532
I'm terrified.

152
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,732
Stop being weak!

153
00:08:57,457 --> 00:08:59,616
If you can't handle it,
turn me in yourself.

154
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:02,607
If you want me to go back to jail,
turn me in!

155
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:07,234
Mom... I want to live.

156
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:09,791
Get me that drug.

157
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:13,456
You remember that drug from before
that erased my memory.

158
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,326
Get that for me.

159
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,647
Then I'll forget everything.

160
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,927
That's the only way I can live.

161
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,998
I want to go to SNU.

162
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:28,417
I want to get a boyfriend.

163
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,558

who did the best she could for you?
Isn't that a given?

That's insane. I must've lost my mind.

200

I'm sure Eun Byeol will beat this.

She wanted to give it to you
for your birthday.

She knitted it every night
without taking a break.

00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:26,910
Something's not right.

329
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,397
Tell me what it is.

330
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:32,619
Honey!

331
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:38,152
-Where are you going now?
-To the gym.

332
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:39,396
Don't lie.

333
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:42,213
We've been married for 20 years.
You can't dupe me.

334
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:43,964
Why are you acting out of character?

335
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:45,283
Leave me alone.

336
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:46,769
Yoo Dong Pil!

337
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:49,432
Don't suffer on your own and talk to me!

338
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,009
I got bit...

339
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:54,531
well and truly by Joo Dan Tae.

340
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:57,047
-What?
-I think...

341
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,580
Joo Dan Tae killed Oh Yoon Hee.

342
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:04,245
Yoon Hee was murdered?

343
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:07,273
But I took the blame for it.

344
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:11,583
He knew I hid Kim Mi Sook's body
in the fountain...

345
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,526
and trapped me.

346
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:17,128
He could frame me
for Oh Yoon Hee's murder.

347
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:22,078
So I disposed of her body in the lake.

348
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:27,005
Oh, no. My gosh.

349
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:32,551
Honey. No one knows
what Chairman Joo will do to Jenny.

350
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,758
You know what he does to people
who betray him.

351
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,665
He said after Yoon Hee, we're next.

352
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:40,048
No. I can't let that happen to Jenny.

353
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:42,764
Even if I rot in prison
for the rest of my life,

354
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,269
I can't let him touch Jenny.

355
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:45,746
We must protect her.

356
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:47,076
I will kill that punk.

357
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:48,447
No, honey. Don't go.

358
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,248
Think only of Jenny.

359
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,080
We must lie low.

360
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,700
You're less of a person than her.

361
00:20:57,294 --> 00:20:58,590
You should be ashamed.

362
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,827
If it means I can protect my family,

363
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,547
I'll side with not only Dan Tae
but the devil too!

364
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,501
I would willingly give my heart!

365
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:10,309
No. We won't side with the devil again.

366
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:11,747
That won't happen.

367
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,918
I was pretty famous in Jincheon myself.

368
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:34,117
("Paradise Lost")

369
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:39,477
(10 billion dollars)

370
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:49,097
Shim Su Ryeon
had Logan's 10 billion dollars.

371
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,848
Did he love her enough
to give her all that money?

372
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,107
What is she to him?

373
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:15,496
Hi, it's me. What are you doing?

374
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,438
Oh, thanks. That's enough.

375
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:19,885
That'll do. Cheers.

376
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:28,749
I was bored. I'm glad you called.

377
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:31,192
Hera Palace has been weird lately.

378
00:22:31,272 --> 00:22:33,739
I'm too scared to drink even at home.

379
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:36,602
Because someone called Oh Yoon Hee died?

380
00:22:38,178 --> 00:22:40,714
You won't know the full story.

381
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:43,832
Oh Yoon Hee
was Hera Palace's troublemaker.

382
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:47,415
There never was a quiet day
since she moved in.

383
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:49,377
All the residents disliked her.

384
00:22:49,457 --> 00:22:51,063
All but Su Ryeon.

385
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:54,396
The two seemed pretty close.

386
00:22:54,476 --> 00:22:56,468
It was no joke.

387
00:22:56,548 --> 00:22:59,816
She coddled the woman
who killed her own daughter.

388
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:04,469
Shim Su Ryeon had a child
before she was married.

389
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,884
Oh Yoon Hee pushed the girl...

390
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:08,712
and she fell to her death.

391
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:11,681
The fountain was covered in blood.

392
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,736
It was such a dreadful sight.

393
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,498
It must've been hard on Su Ryeon.

394
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,710
Bad things kept happening to people
around her.

395
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,215
That must be just her luck.

396
00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:26,419
Her mother died
as soon as she got married,

397
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:28,233
then her father died of heartache.

398
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:31,761
Then the great Simoon Construction
went belly up.

399
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:35,587
I think Chairman Joo and her
just weren't a good match.

400
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,309
Hey.

401
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:43,474
Are you interested in her?

402
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:47,326
What man wouldn't be interested in a woman
as beautiful as her?

403
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:50,970
Our parents were very close,

404
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:53,209
and she was my first love.

405
00:23:53,776 --> 00:23:57,979
Hey. Traitor Ha, Seo Jin,
Joo Dan Tae, Shim Su Ryeon, and you?

406
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,015
That's the worst kind of mess.

407
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:03,919
Plus, you said you and Dan Tae
were closer than brothers.

408
00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:06,414
We're really tight.

409
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,002
Enough to share everything.

410
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:11,628
How cool.

411
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:18,212
Then tell me a little dirty secret
from Dan Tae's past.

412
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:22,119
I really won't tell anyone
that I heard it from you.

413
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:25,642
Look at me.
I'm really good at keeping secrets.

414
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:28,837
He's interested in Shim Su Ryeon?

415
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:39,178
I'm sorry, Su Ryeon.

416
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:42,936
I need you to save me.

417
00:24:45,825 --> 00:24:49,062
I don't even know where to start.

418
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:50,322
It began...

419
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:53,615
with a woman called Kim Mi Sook.

420
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:54,994
Let me ask something first.

421
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:59,720
Why did your husband kill Kim Mi Sook?

422
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,465
You knew about that?

423
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:05,019
Jenny's dad had no reason
or motivation to kill her.

424
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,541
If he took the fall for murder,

425
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:09,227
there's only one answer.

426
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,499
Joo Dan Tae.

427
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:15,260
You're right. Joo Dan Tae killed her.

428
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,569
My husband took the fall
and did time in prison.

429
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:25,479
He made a deal with that punk
so his daughter could have a nice house.

430
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,115
Now he might have to take the fall
for Yoon Hee's murder too.

431
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:32,289
What are you saying?

432
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:36,023
Yoon Hee fell foul with Joo Dan Tae.

433
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:39,195
Dan Tae had put Yoon Hee's body...

434
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,583
in the fountain downstairs.

435
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:46,353
And now he's saying that
my husband killed her.

436
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,884
Dan Tae killed Yoon Hee?

437
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,047
It wasn't an accident?

438
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:52,209
I guess so.

439
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:53,649
Though I have no proof.

440
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:56,637
I'm sure it involves Yoon Hee's death.

441
00:25:56,717 --> 00:25:59,069
It doesn't make any sense.

442
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:02,929
Yoon Hee's body
was pulled out of the water.

443
00:26:04,757 --> 00:26:07,695
Yoo Dong Pil, that dummy,

444
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:10,808
disposed of Yoon Hee's body...

445
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:13,709
by throwing it in the water.

446
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:17,328
He had to
because Joo Dan Tae was blackmailing him.

447
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,004
Everyone is insane!

448
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:21,146
Everyone's gone insane!

449
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:23,455
I know I did something
that cannot be forgiven.

450
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,208
I am not going to make excuses.

451
00:26:26,288 --> 00:26:28,106
I am begging you.

452
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,987
But not for my husband's life.

453
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:31,304
What I want...

454
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:35,441
is to kill that scumbag Joo Dan Tae
with my own hands.

455
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,702
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

456
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:40,253
Please let me help you uncover...

457
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,377
the truth behind Yoon Hee's death.

458
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,323
I'll help you.

459
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:50,348
I'm not afraid of humiliation or death.

460
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:53,309
I can't live...

461
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,606
in such a submissive manner anymore.

462
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:59,054
If it's true that
he got rid of Yoon Hee's body,

463
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,027
how am I supposed to believe you?

464
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,678
When he did something so animalistic?

465
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:07,096
Your husband's an animal.

466
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:11,842
I can't believe it.

467
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,231
What will it take for you to trust me?

468
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:18,989
What should I do?

469
00:27:28,497 --> 00:27:30,772
The one and only card I have in my life,

470
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,625
I will use it for Yoon Hee.

471
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:36,507
Will you trust me then?

472
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:41,887
(Ma Ri Sauna)

473
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:43,571
It's been a while.

474
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:46,286
I thought you closed permanently.
Are you open again?

475
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:47,326
Well...

476
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:51,840
There's something important
I need to tell all of you.

477
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,620
Chairman Song.

478
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:57,521
That promise you made
that you would one day help me out.

479
00:27:58,179 --> 00:27:59,590
It still stands, right?

480
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:03,130
Have you seen me break a promise?

481
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,653
What do you need it for?

482
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:07,714
I...

483
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:11,523
I have a sister whom I owe a lot to.

484
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,265
A little while ago,
she was murdered by someone.

485
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:16,386
Murdered?

486
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,722
Did you catch the culprit?

487
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:21,007
I have a feeling as to who it is,

488
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:25,145
but I can't do anything
because I don't have evidence against him.

489
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,690
Please help me catch him.

490

-Yes.

Joo Dan Tae was in Gimpo that day?

652
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:49,930
Does that mean...

653
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:54,058
Jin Bun Hong teamed up with Joo Dan Tae
and made a false statement?

654
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,139
That's right.

655
00:37:57,729 --> 00:38:00,816
Yoon Hee was killed by Joon Dan Tae,
wasn't she?

656
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,219
Well, what now?

657
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,875
Do we bring this to the police right away?

658
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,143
We should take action
before he can destroy any evidence.

659
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:11,336
No.

660
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:14,276
Legal punishment
doesn't mean anything anymore.

661
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:18,271
We've already done that before.

662
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:20,472
After all our efforts
to put them behind bars,

663
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:22,303
they all got released one by one.

664
00:38:22,957 --> 00:38:25,255
We let them get away
with what they did ourselves.

665
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:29,128
I trusted the useless law...

666
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:31,947
and lost so many people in my life
as a result...

667
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:35,733
while the guilty ones walk free.

668
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:38,306
Then what's your plan?

669
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:40,996
Only a demon...

670
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:44,182
can handle a demon.

671
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:48,221
You don't have to die
to end up in the pit of fire.

672
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:53,747
(Joo Dan Tae)

673
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:54,877
(Yoo Dong Pil)

674
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:55,853
(Gave birth to twins?)

675
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,199
Yoon Hee made this?

676
00:38:58,577 --> 00:39:02,780
That day, Yoon Hee told me
she had something important to tell me.

677
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,944
And she was followed by Joo Dan Tae.

678
00:39:05,024 --> 00:39:07,736
To stop her from telling you something?

679
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:09,915
That's the only possible explanation
for now.

680
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:11,410
What was she going to tell you?

681
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,580
Why did he have to kill her
to shut her mouth?

682
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,736
Why go that far?

683
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:17,228
I don't know.

684
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:20,336
Everything's tangled up right now.

685
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:23,746
But I'll untangle it by all means.

686
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,092
On Yoon Hee's behalf.

687
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:30,304
To me, Cheon Seo Jin
seems just as suspicious as Joo Dan Tae.

688
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:32,699
But she's a victim in this case.

689
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:34,767
She also benefited more than anyone.

690
00:39:36,492 --> 00:39:37,667
That's right.

691
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:41,175
See how Cheong A Group's stock prices
skyrocketed today.

692
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,161
Those scum.

693
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:45,348
So there is more than one person
to go after.

694
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:50,842
By the way,
who's the person in the red circle?

695
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:54,994
"Baek Jun Ki?"

696
00:39:55,074 --> 00:39:56,332
(Entered Korea with Logan Lee)

697
00:39:57,994 --> 00:40:00,599
Baek Jun Ki. I'll start with you.

698
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:02,855
I need to find out who you are.

699
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:10,994
I lost again.

700
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,861
Seo Jin told me to come over.

701
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,510
She said she'd be here soon.

702
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,913
Please have a seat. I'll get you some tea.

703
00:41:14,697 --> 00:41:16,637
(Baek Jun Ki)

704
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,300
(VIP Dealer Yoon Jae Pil)

705
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:24,467
Ms. Cheon, you're back.

706
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:30,912
Eun Byeol will be discharged soon
so get her room ready.

707
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:44,590
What were you doing here without me?

708
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,862
You wouldn't pick up your phone,
so I had no choice but to come over.

709
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:49,377
Is Eun Byeol coming home?

710
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:53,236
I heard she was too ill
to be questioned by the police.

711
00:41:53,632 --> 00:41:55,041
She must be feeling better now.

712
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:56,555
Her treatment isn't over.

713
00:41:56,635 --> 00:42:00,104
Are you going to sit back
and watch Yoon Hee lose her reputation?

714
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:03,788
Eun Byeol has to open her mouth
for the truth to come out.

715
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:06,173
There you go again. Please stop now.

716
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,196
Only Oh Yoon Hee knows the truth.

717
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,650
Ask her when you see her
in your dream, or...

718
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,168
leave right now.

719
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:16,557
It wasn't a coincidence.

720
00:42:16,915 --> 00:42:19,264
You becoming the director
of Cheong A Arts Center...

721
00:42:19,344 --> 00:42:21,231
or Eun Byeol getting into SNU.

722
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:24,294
It's become clear now.

723
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:25,934
What are you implying?

724
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:29,289
You know my alibi better than anyone.

725
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:31,968
I was with you the entire time
on the day Eun Byeol was kidnapped.

726
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:36,231
No. You were away for ten minutes.

727
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:39,128
Are you saying...

728
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,633
I killed Oh Yoon Hee
during those ten minutes?

729
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:43,985
I don't believe you.

730
00:42:44,476 --> 00:42:47,250
Wake up Eun Byeol
so that the police can question her.

731
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,963
Leave the sick girl alone.

732
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:52,419
Oh Yoon Hee hurt my kid to get back at me.

733
00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:55,390
She even killed a person for her kid.

734
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:57,279
Her criminal record proves it.

735
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,593
Watch your mouth.

736
00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:00,975
You'd do anything for your kid as well.

737
00:43:01,055 --> 00:43:02,579
I'm a victim.

738
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:05,477
I still can't forgive Oh Yoon Hee
for what she did to Eun Byeol.

739
00:43:05,557 --> 00:43:08,505
My only regret is that
I couldn't put her behind bars myself.

740
00:43:11,107 --> 00:43:12,730
But I do feel sorry...

741
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,802
for her untimely death.

742
00:43:19,337 --> 00:43:21,358
She sure was good
at sweet-talking to you and Logan.

743
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:22,531
I'll give her that.

744
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:23,933
Mark my words.

745
00:43:25,148 --> 00:43:27,717
Even though Yoon Hee
can't be brought back to life,

746
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:31,397
I'll get to the bottom
of why and how Yoon Hee died...

747
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:33,264
by all means.

748
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:37,266
I'll risk my life to find out...

749
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,910
who made her end up in that freezing lake.

750
00:43:42,592 --> 00:43:43,666
Go ahead.

751
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:46,144
Whatever I say,

752
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:49,771
you won't believe me, Shim Su Ryeon.

753
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:05,556
Is that why she came here?

754
00:44:16,398 --> 00:44:19,128
What does Baek Jun Ki
have that she's looking for?

755
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:29,985
Did you want to see me, sir?

756
00:44:30,065 --> 00:44:30,951
Yes.

757
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:34,040
My offer regarding Baek Jun Ki...

758
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,248
Have you given it some thought?

759
00:44:35,328 --> 00:44:36,732
I'm still thinking.

760
00:44:37,053 --> 00:44:38,058
Have a seat.

761
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:44,536
I'll make the decision easier for you.

762
00:44:44,952 --> 00:44:46,640
I've come up with a way...

763
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:49,716
to take care of it without getting blood
on our hands.

764
00:44:50,328 --> 00:44:51,753
What is it?

765
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:58,570
Baek Jun Ki is crazy about gambling.

766
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:02,118
He used to empty out his parents' safe
before he was 20...

767
00:45:02,198 --> 00:45:03,991
and blow it all on gambling.

768
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:08,266
Even while he was locked up,
I made sure he could play now and then.

769
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:12,806
His addiction
should be much more severe by now.

770
00:45:14,593 --> 00:45:18,174
He has a tendency to lose it
if he runs out of money.

771
00:45:18,254 --> 00:45:19,800
If you use that well,

772
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:22,029
it'll be much easier than you think.

773
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:38,081
Ten.

774
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:40,220
Eight.

775
00:45:41,724 --> 00:45:42,820
Banker.

776
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:53,050
Insufficient funds.

777
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:11,157
Bring me some money. I'm all out.

778
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,527
What?

779
00:46:14,366 --> 00:46:15,976
You won't do that for me?

780
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:19,197
You don't care if I talk, is that it?

781
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:24,448
You brought me to Korea,
so you need to take care of me.

782
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,495
I hate waiting, so make it quick.

783
00:46:41,955 --> 00:46:44,145
-Ro Na.
-Eun Byeol.

784
00:46:45,243 --> 00:46:47,112
I hear you're going home soon.

785
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:49,308
I heard you've recovered a lot.

786
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,407
I'm so glad.

787
00:46:51,837 --> 00:46:53,089
What is it?

788
00:46:53,169 --> 00:46:55,096
I've been waiting for you to wake up.

789
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:56,864
Let's go to the police.

790
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,855
If it's too hard for you,
you can just fill out a statement.

791
00:46:59,935 --> 00:47:02,229
That I took you to my home to help you,

792
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:05,089
and that my mom didn't kidnap you...

793
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:07,500
What are you talking about?

794
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,871
You helped me?

795
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:13,509
I'm speechless.
Since when were we so close?

796
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:15,426
What's wrong with you?

797
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:17,550
Don't you remember?

798
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:21,379
When Ms. Jin hurt you at the school,

799
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:23,585
Seok Hoon and I got you out.

800
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:28,021
Did you hurt your head or something?

801
00:47:28,355 --> 00:47:31,508
Or are you making stuff up
because you're desperate?

802
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:35,740
I saw it on the news...

803
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,207
that your mom kidnapped me
and tried to kill me.

804
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:40,642
That's ridiculous.

805
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:43,094
Why would my mom kill you?

806
00:47:43,174 --> 00:47:46,333
She was probably angry
that you didn't get into SNU.

807
00:47:46,413 --> 00:47:49,823
Everyone says
your mom was the Admissions Murderer.

808
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:53,703
How could you of all people say that?

809
00:47:53,783 --> 00:47:56,199
My mom went to help you.

810
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:57,978
That's why she died!

811
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:00,302
Your mom...

812
00:48:00,382 --> 00:48:02,832
even killed Seol A
to get you into Cheong A Arts High School.

813
00:48:02,912 --> 00:48:05,284
She would've done anything
to get you into SNU.

814
00:48:13,648 --> 00:48:15,544
I'll beg you, Eun Byeol.

815
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:17,300
Please tell the truth.

816
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,112
That Ms. Jin took you.

817
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:21,559
You got into SNU,
so it doesn't matter to you!

818
00:48:23,035 --> 00:48:25,916
I'm not here to argue
about you getting into SNU.

819
00:48:27,365 --> 00:48:28,664
Give me a break.

820
00:48:28,744 --> 00:48:31,757
You sound like I'm lying
because I want to go to SNU.

821
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,626
Are you that jealous that I got in?

822
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:38,353
You don't get into a college
because you're talented.

823
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,616
They know
who will get more financial support.

824
00:48:42,696 --> 00:48:44,315
They can tell.

825
00:48:45,793 --> 00:48:47,502
You witch.

826
00:48:55,387 --> 00:48:56,849
Let go!

827
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,594
What are you doing?

828
00:49:00,674 --> 00:49:01,684
Hey!

829
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:05,186
Hey! Ro Na! Stop it right now!

830
00:49:06,499 --> 00:49:07,837
Have you lost your mind?

831
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:10,424
How could you attack a patient
in a hospital?

832
00:49:10,504 --> 00:49:12,314
Get out before I call the police.

833
00:49:12,966 --> 00:49:14,918
Are you trying to disgrace your late mom?

834
00:49:17,995 --> 00:49:19,656
I was a fool.

835
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:23,427
I never should've helped someone like you.

836
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,327
If I hadn't,

837
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:27,910
my mom wouldn't have died.

838
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,773
If you do this, I won't show you mercy.

839
00:49:40,052 --> 00:49:42,181
I'll restore my mom's reputation,

840
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:45,849
and I'll get you out of SNU.

841
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:48,448
Whatever I do...

842
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:52,038
from now on is all your fault.

843
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,258
She still hasn't learned her lesson.

844
00:50:02,257 --> 00:50:04,924
My baby. You must've been scared.

845
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:08,539
I'm okay.

846
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,582
Thank goodness I came.

847
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:13,784
Don't worry.

848
00:50:14,374 --> 00:50:16,580
She's just like her mom.

849
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:22,259
But...

850
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:25,140
Do you really not remember anything?

851
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,776
What?

852
00:50:27,112 --> 00:50:30,017
Ro Na's mom dragging you away
and trying to kill you.

853
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,976
No, I don't. I found out from the news.

854
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:35,480
Really?

855
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,136
It's better to forget bad memories.

856
00:50:39,216 --> 00:50:40,930
It's late. Go to sleep.

857
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,323
I came to tuck you in.

858
00:51:01,816 --> 00:51:03,479
Wait a little while.

859
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:07,991
I'll erase all the bad memories,
my sweet baby.

860
00:51:12,797 --> 00:51:16,996
We should love each other
and get along like we used to.

861
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:31,674
Hey.

862
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:48,682
What took you so long? I said to hurry.

863
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:51,302
Give me the money.

864
00:51:57,324 --> 00:52:00,472
I warned you that only I can call.

865
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:06,970
I had no choice. It was urgent.

866
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,304
Did you blow all the money
that Logan gave you?

867
00:52:09,384 --> 00:52:11,141
I bottomed out today.

868
00:52:11,613 --> 00:52:13,163
I started out well,

869
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:15,554
but I lost it all in the last hand.

870
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:17,133
This is the last time.

871
00:52:17,655 --> 00:52:20,118
Do I look like someone
who runs errands like this?

872
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:22,982
What if someone sees me?

873
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:26,131
Didn't you know
I was like this when we joined forces?

874
00:52:26,854 --> 00:52:30,313
You said you'd let me gamble
as much as I want for life.

875
00:52:30,393 --> 00:52:32,632
I even fooled Logan and came to Korea.

876
00:52:32,712 --> 00:52:34,920
You shouldn't make me worry about money.

877
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,909
Must I regret betraying the rich boy...

878
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,476
and teaming up with you already?

879
00:52:44,347 --> 00:52:45,617
(Su Ryeon)

880
00:52:49,762 --> 00:52:50,802
Take it.

881
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:52,900
Su Ryeon searched your room.

882
00:52:53,525 --> 00:52:55,057
I think she suspects you.

883
00:52:56,618 --> 00:52:57,702
Hello?

884
00:52:58,494 --> 00:52:59,684
Is something wrong?

885
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:03,062
Sorry for calling so late. It's urgent.

886
00:53:03,412 --> 00:53:05,796
I need you to go to the police station
right now.

887
00:53:05,876 --> 00:53:08,189
The police station? Why?

888
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:11,423
They need you to give a statement
about Logan's death.

889
00:53:11,503 --> 00:53:12,771
A witness statement?

890
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,791
Isn't the case closed already?

891
00:53:15,871 --> 00:53:17,589
They found new evidence.

892
00:53:19,057 --> 00:53:22,223
They found remnants of a bag in the car
that wasn't Logan's.

893
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,851
They found something suspicious
in the bag.

894
00:53:25,284 --> 00:53:28,971
They say the killer
may have been someone else, not Dan Tae.

895
00:53:29,051 --> 00:53:30,430
There's another killer?

896
00:53:32,044 --> 00:53:33,469
I don't know the details.

897
00:53:33,999 --> 00:53:36,850
You need to work with the police
on the investigation first.

898
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:42,048
Okay. I'll let you know after I get back.

899
00:53:52,206 --> 00:53:53,401
What happened?

900
00:53:54,306 --> 00:53:55,540
Did you deceive me?

901
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:59,431
This was your plan
from the get-go, wasn't it?

902
00:54:00,357 --> 00:54:01,751
What did Su Ryeon say?

903
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:04,327
That I'm about
to be accused of the murder.

904
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,403
What was in that bag?

905
00:54:06,483 --> 00:54:08,343
Did you put in explosives or something?

906
00:54:08,423 --> 00:54:09,746
Don't be ridiculous.

907
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:12,614
You must've seen what was inside.

908
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:16,509
Were you trying to kill Logan
without telling me?

909
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:18,174
What are you talking about?

910
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:23,082
Then why are you nervous?
Dan Tae is the killer.

911
00:54:23,162 --> 00:54:26,122
In other words, they'll find nothing
even if they investigate you.

912
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,879
If you're thinking
of stabbing me in the back,

913
00:54:30,959 --> 00:54:33,008
I'll tell Su Ryeon everything.

914
00:54:34,763 --> 00:54:38,051
That you knew
Logan was going to die that day.

915
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:43,673
You idiot.

916
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:46,062
Do you think she'll leave you alone?

917
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:48,619
We showed our cards already.

918
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:52,716
Watch yourself unless you want to go back
to the mental hospital.

919
00:54:52,796 --> 00:54:54,796
Tell the police only what you have to.

920
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,584
If you slip,

921
00:54:58,191 --> 00:54:59,393
you and I both die.

922
00:55:00,787 --> 00:55:01,891
Follow me.

923
00:55:12,347 --> 00:55:13,750
You'd better not mess up.

924
00:56:08,605 --> 00:56:10,820
When you were Na Ae Gyo,

925
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:12,818
I thought you were cool.

926
00:56:12,898 --> 00:56:14,329
What do you mean?

927
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:17,170
To be honest, I almost fell for you.

928
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,372
You were proud, full of confidence,

929
00:56:19,452 --> 00:56:20,644
and spoke your mind.

930
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:22,175
That wasn't me.

931
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:25,117
It was me pretending to be Ae Gyo.

932
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:28,988
From now on, you should live like her,
like Na Ae Gyo.

933
00:56:29,866 --> 00:56:32,791
Don't stay stuck in the penthouse
just being a good mom.

934
00:57:36,457 --> 00:57:38,474
I'm still full of questions,

935
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:41,697
but one thing is sure.

936
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:45,016
Who I must kill.

937
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:52,113
Can I do this?

938
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,878
Yoon Hee, help me.

939
00:58:00,386 --> 00:58:01,890
I miss you.

940
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,178
Yoon Hee.

941
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:10,977
Yoon Hee!

942
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,354
Yoon Hee!

943
00:58:19,232 --> 00:58:20,839
Yoon Hee!

944
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:27,374
Yoon Hee!

945
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,237
(6 months later)

946
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:40,713
Come and eat!

947
00:58:40,793 --> 00:58:43,119
I'm coming.

948
00:58:43,423 --> 00:58:44,837
Why is it just you?

949
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:46,501
Come and eat.

950
00:58:46,581 --> 00:58:48,847
Yes, I'm here too.

951
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:49,915
Good.

952
00:58:50,378 --> 00:58:52,076
What's your schedule for the day?

953
00:58:52,156 --> 00:58:54,079
Class finishes at six,
then I have a lesson.

954
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,424
-Ro Na?
-I'm applying for an audition.

955
00:58:56,504 --> 00:58:59,967
Again?
What's the point if you always apply?

956
00:59:00,047 --> 00:59:01,928
You never reach the audition stage.

957
00:59:02,008 --> 00:59:04,634
They don't care for you
because you're a killer's daughter.

958
00:59:04,714 --> 00:59:09,246
Ms. Cheon and the media
are doing all they can to tear you down.

959
00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:10,920
How will you ever pass an audition?

960
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,841
Still, I should keep trying.

961
00:59:12,921 --> 00:59:14,622
It's so infuriating.

962
00:59:14,702 --> 00:59:17,261
Why don't you just quit singing?

963
00:59:17,341 --> 00:59:20,144
You're smart. It might be quicker
for you to get into med school.

964
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:22,508
Why should she quit?

965
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:24,314
You should learn from her.

966
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,473
You need this kind of tenacity
to become something eventually.

967
00:59:27,553 --> 00:59:28,762
Eat up, Ro Na.

968
00:59:28,842 --> 00:59:30,271
You're comparing us over breakfast?

969
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:31,879
I'm sick of it.

970
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:34,534
How do you act
like you might change but never do?

971
00:59:34,614 --> 00:59:37,967
A person must be consistent.

972
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:40,531
Eat up quickly. I have to go out.

973
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:43,380
Why are you so busy these days?
You come home late too.

974
00:59:44,128 --> 00:59:45,613
Do you have a boyfriend?

975
00:59:45,693 --> 00:59:47,262
Don't be silly.

976
00:59:47,342 --> 00:59:49,035
I'm sick of men now.

977
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:51,057
I got a job.

978
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:53,151
A job?

979
01:00:02,861 --> 01:00:04,598
-Honey.
-Don't talk to me...

980
01:00:04,678 --> 01:00:05,814
until you sign the divorce papers.

981
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,080
Jenny.

982
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,184
Honey.

983
01:00:13,552 --> 01:00:14,788
Welcome.

984
01:00:15,268 --> 01:00:16,675
Do we have the VIP room?

985
01:00:16,755 --> 01:00:18,055
Yes, you do.

986
01:00:19,985 --> 01:00:21,146
Ma Ri.

987
01:00:25,224 --> 01:00:28,579
Why do you care so much about your looks?

988
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:31,148
Are you separated from your husband...

989
01:00:31,443 --> 01:00:33,195
because you have a man?

990
01:00:35,468 --> 01:00:37,120
Did you hear a mad dog bark?

991
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:38,810
A what?

992
01:00:40,894 --> 01:00:42,597
My husband says...

993
01:00:42,887 --> 01:00:46,051
Mr. Yoo's acting like a poor bachelor.

994
01:00:47,296 --> 01:00:49,486
You're not divorced or amicably separated,

995
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:52,863
so why bunk with Ro Na
when you have your own home?

996
01:00:52,943 --> 01:00:55,006
Who's bunking with whom?

997
01:00:55,086 --> 01:00:57,750
Ro Na lives alone,
so I just go over to cook for her.

998
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:01,403
You should cook for Mr. Yoo too
since you live across the hall.

999
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:03,946
He's the CEO of Cheong A Constructions.

1000
01:01:04,026 --> 01:01:05,166
I feel sorry for him.

1001
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,006
If you feel that bad for him,
you can live with him.

1002
01:01:08,086 --> 01:01:09,004
What?

1003
01:01:09,084 --> 01:01:11,444
Whether he's the CEO
of Cheong A Constructions or whatever,

1004
01:01:11,524 --> 01:01:13,253
you can take him in.

1005
01:01:16,594 --> 01:01:18,979
Did she really fall out of love for him?

1006
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:21,146
She loved him so much.

1007
01:01:21,226 --> 01:01:22,480
What happened?

1008
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:28,214
The materials used
to build the Cheonsoo District apartments.

1009
01:01:28,294 --> 01:01:30,484
Could you please order them from us?

1010
01:01:31,266 --> 01:01:32,643
Please, Mr. Lee.

1011
01:01:32,962 --> 01:01:34,171
-Please, sir.
-Please sir.

1012
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:36,782
It's not like I have any influence.

1013
01:01:36,862 --> 01:01:38,582
But you do.

1014
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:41,589
You're CEO of Cheong A Investment
and Development.

1015
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:45,010
I heard you're the Cheong A heavyweight.

1016
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,543
I'm no heavyweight.

1017
01:01:46,991 --> 01:01:50,303
I'm such a fair person.

1018
01:01:50,383 --> 01:01:52,755
I don't care for shortcuts or favours.

1019
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:55,892
I heard your son
attends Seoul National University.

1020
01:01:55,972 --> 01:01:58,439
How did you manage
to raise such a great son?

1021
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:00,505
I'm so very jealous.

1022
01:02:00,607 --> 01:02:03,733
Isn't it easy to get into
Seoul National University nowadays?

1023
01:02:03,813 --> 01:02:06,533
But how did you hear about that too?

1024
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:07,913
Darn it!

1025
01:02:07,993 --> 01:02:09,780
I'm not in rehab after an injury.

1026
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,883
Get out.

1027
01:02:11,605 --> 01:02:12,819
-Mr. Oh.
-Yes?

1028
01:02:12,899 --> 01:02:14,151
Give it to me.

1029
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,326
Come on.

1030
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:24,423
Let's eat. It's on me.

1031
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:27,309
The food there was nice.

1032
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:28,520
Yes.

1033
01:02:30,082 --> 01:02:32,904
Secretary Cho, make me a milk coffee.

1034
01:02:34,105 --> 01:02:36,664
What good food are you eating...

1035
01:02:37,202 --> 01:02:39,378
that your skin is so nicely oiled?

1036
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:40,952
Don't be like that.

1037
01:02:41,032 --> 01:02:44,171
I have so much work to do
that I'm losing weight.

1038
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:45,321
Look at me.

1039
01:02:46,635 --> 01:02:48,967
About Cheonsoo District.

1040
01:02:49,256 --> 01:02:51,961
We should get a famous private school
to move there.

1041
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:56,233
So today, after much work, I arranged
a meeting with the Minister of Education.

1042
01:02:56,313 --> 01:02:58,572
Chairman Joo, back me up.

1043
01:02:58,652 --> 01:03:00,546
So what if you build apartment complexes?

1044
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:03,016
It's worth nothing without a good school.

1045
01:03:03,096 --> 01:03:06,509
I'm in the middle of making a deal
to move a boys' and girls' high school.

1046
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:09,669
Already? Then it's game over.

1047
01:03:10,143 --> 01:03:13,585
The moment that happens,
the housing prices will skyrocket.

1048
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:17,208
Why don't we recruit
a private elementary school too?

1049
01:03:17,288 --> 01:03:20,752
Area One of Cheonsoo District
that we're trying to bid for.

1050
01:03:20,832 --> 01:03:23,023
Dohae Construction
seems to be showing interest.

1051
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:24,472
It's Dohae again?

1052
01:03:24,552 --> 01:03:26,558
They've been getting on my nerves.

1053
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:30,551
I heard they have a lobbyist
working for them.

1054
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:34,323
I asked around,
and I just can't figure out who it is.

1055
01:03:34,403 --> 01:03:35,603
Don't mind them.

1056
01:03:35,683 --> 01:03:38,693
They're a new company
that can't keep up with us.

1057
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,390
There's no way they can beat
the great Cheong A Constructions.

1058
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:47,008
Whenever you speak with such confidence,

1059
01:03:47,517 --> 01:03:48,914
Kyu Jin feels really uneasy.

1060
01:03:49,661 --> 01:03:51,416
What is this feeling?

1061
01:03:59,263 --> 01:04:01,199
You two look so beautiful.

1062
01:04:02,012 --> 01:04:04,613
You've been winning all contests,

1063
01:04:04,693 --> 01:04:07,410
and you're also famous
for being SNU's queen.

1064
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:11,799
You must be familiar with the praise
that you are a born-to-be star...

1065
01:04:11,879 --> 01:04:13,261
who has both talent and beauty.

1066
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:14,627
You flatter me.

1067
01:04:14,707 --> 01:04:17,140
I still need to learn and work hard.

1068
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,139
My goal is
not to harm my mother's reputation.

1069
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:22,754
I heard that Cheong A Arts Center,
the biggest in size in Asia,

1070
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:25,899
is hosting the first audition
to find its resident musician?

1071
01:04:25,979 --> 01:04:27,057
Yes.

1072
01:04:27,137 --> 01:04:29,158
If you are selected
as Cheong A's resident musician,

1073
01:04:29,238 --> 01:04:31,890
not only will we host three concerts
for that person every week,

1074
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:35,374
but provide any support needed...

1075
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,620
for that person
to grow into an international musician.

1076
01:04:38,384 --> 01:04:40,504
The application will open today.

1077
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:42,541
I will try my best
to make it the fairest audition...

1078
01:04:42,621 --> 01:04:46,182
where only the talent matters.

1079
01:04:50,197 --> 01:04:51,657
I'm here to apply.

1080
01:04:51,737 --> 01:04:52,807
Okay.

1081
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,149
You're applying?
You didn't even get into college.

1082
01:05:02,664 --> 01:05:04,521
I don't think
there's a requirement on education.

1083
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:07,743
If a vocalist who's supposed to make
the world's most beautiful sounds...

1084
01:05:07,823 --> 01:05:10,471
got to her current place
only by harming others,

1085
01:05:11,091 --> 01:05:13,381
aren't those the sounds of an evil being?

1086
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:20,367
You're the one to say.

1087
01:05:21,172 --> 01:05:23,904
My shoulders still have wounds...

1088
01:05:24,381 --> 01:05:26,810
from when you slammed them
with your trophies.

1089
01:05:27,482 --> 01:05:29,362
It'll be much quicker if you quit.

1090
01:05:29,845 --> 01:05:31,838
I see
you still can't acknowledge you lost.

1091
01:05:31,918 --> 01:05:34,828
It's not over yet for who the best is.

1092
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:39,139
No matter how hard you try to stop me,
I will never give up.

1093
01:05:40,092 --> 01:05:43,178
I swear I will step on Ha Eun Byeol
and become the best.

1094
01:05:43,685 --> 01:05:46,700
Then I will prove to the world...

1095
01:05:47,142 --> 01:05:49,159
that my skills are not fake.

1096
01:06:03,617 --> 01:06:06,547
(Application)

1097
01:06:21,826 --> 01:06:23,958
-Let's toast.
-Cheers!

1098
01:06:32,627 --> 01:06:34,897
Minister,
in order to bring the rent prices...

1099
01:06:34,977 --> 01:06:37,337
at Cheonsoo District to a level
even higher than those at Gangnam,

1100
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:39,826
we really need
to move Gangnam's Eighth District.

1101
01:06:39,906 --> 01:06:43,168
We will provide for free
33,000 square metres of land

1102
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:46,803
in the First District,
which is the richest area of all.

1103
01:06:46,883 --> 01:06:49,229
Thirty-three thousand
square metres for free! Let's go!

1104
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:53,358
I heard your daughter...

1105
01:06:53,785 --> 01:06:56,204
is in her prime for marriage.

1106
01:06:58,838 --> 01:07:00,216
She's in eighth grade.

1107
01:07:00,544 --> 01:07:02,555
I see. That's what I mean.

1108
01:07:02,635 --> 01:07:04,514
Soon she'll be in her senior year
in high school.

1109
01:07:04,594 --> 01:07:06,600
And soon it'll be time
for her to get married.

1110
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,810
That's why
we already prepared everything for you...

1111
01:07:08,906 --> 01:07:10,975
with a huge apartment
in Cheonsoo District's best area...

1112
01:07:11,055 --> 01:07:13,833
so that you can win in advance.

1113
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:14,972
It's the Royal Floor.

1114
01:07:15,052 --> 01:07:17,956
The chance
to buy the place is one in 3,000.

1115
01:07:18,036 --> 01:07:19,280
Jackpot!

1116
01:07:24,817 --> 01:07:26,884
You did your research.

1117
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,062
I'm thoroughly impressed.

1118
01:07:37,399 --> 01:07:39,165
Let's have a drink!

1119
01:07:39,245 --> 01:07:40,599
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1120
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:43,025
Live together, be happy together.

1121
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:45,905
-Live together, be happy together.
-Live together, be happy together.

1122
01:07:45,997 --> 01:07:47,144
Cheers!

1123
01:07:48,973 --> 01:07:50,417
Not bad.

1124
01:07:52,555 --> 01:07:54,257
Minister, have another drink.

1125
01:08:01,184 --> 01:08:02,640
Come right now.

1126
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,335
I can't. I'm at a gathering.

1127
01:08:04,782 --> 01:08:06,621
You don't need to be there.

1128
01:08:06,701 --> 01:08:07,781
However,

1129
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:10,633
you do need to be here.

1130
01:08:10,713 --> 01:08:12,094
You're keeping an eye on me?

1131
01:08:13,064 --> 01:08:14,404
Where are you right now?

1132
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,500
Sorry, I'm late.

1133
01:08:37,402 --> 01:08:38,537
Hello.

1134
01:08:40,752 --> 01:08:42,400
I'm honoured to meet you like this.

1135
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,171
Status report?

1136
01:09:22,831 --> 01:09:23,944
The worst.

1137
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:26,201
I can't regenerate the skin.

1138
01:09:26,933 --> 01:09:28,211
Chances of survival?

1139
01:09:29,528 --> 01:09:31,081
Less than ten percent.

1140
01:09:31,161 --> 01:09:32,813
What have you done in the past six months?

1141
01:09:32,893 --> 01:09:34,530
We don't have time. Hurry up!

1142
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,083
I'm trying my best.

1143
01:09:38,163 --> 01:09:40,363
I'm the one who wants to save him
more than anyone else!

1144
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:47,226
What on earth
is your relationship with this person?

1145
01:09:47,306 --> 01:09:49,230
Why is this person lying here?

1146
01:09:51,101 --> 01:09:52,599
It's been six months.

1147
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:55,740
How much longer are you going
to stay hidden and give orders?

1148
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:58,520
Show yourself.

1149
01:10:00,233 --> 01:10:01,464
Who...

1150
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:03,981
are you?

1151
01:10:12,717 --> 01:10:14,196
You can meet me...

1152
01:10:14,771 --> 01:10:16,491
when the patient wakes up.

1153
01:10:17,383 --> 01:10:18,897
So bring him back to life.

1154
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:20,777
Ha Yoon Chul.

1155
01:10:29,147 --> 01:10:30,692
(Seven months ago)

1156
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:32,905
I'm going to go use the bathroom.

1157
01:10:33,275 --> 01:10:35,093
I'll wait at the parking lot.

1158
01:10:50,165 --> 01:10:51,210
What is this?

1159
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,800
Joo Dan Tae got out of jail today.

1160
01:10:54,386 --> 01:10:55,622
He's after Logan.

1161
01:10:56,076 --> 01:10:58,467
Given that Secretary Cho
just bought a bomb,

1162
01:10:58,547 --> 01:10:59,985
today is the day.

1163
01:11:00,065 --> 01:11:03,451
So this will prove that Logan died?

1164
01:11:05,604 --> 01:11:08,200
Leave this in the car when you get out.

1165
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:10,665
Be careful.

1166
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:16,351
Keep your promise that you'll
give me money to last me a lifetime.

1167
01:11:26,127 --> 01:11:28,647
I'm going to go smoke a cigarette.

1168
01:11:29,342 --> 01:11:30,476
I'm a bit nervous.

1169
01:11:30,968 --> 01:11:32,237
Sure. Go ahead.

1170
01:12:28,248 --> 01:12:29,720
Get Logan's body no matter what.

1171
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,485
He needs to be kept alive.

1172
01:12:42,737 --> 01:12:44,740
Everyone will think Logan died.

1173
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:45,981
Tell your boss...

1174
01:12:46,774 --> 01:12:48,171
to keep his promise.

1175
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:49,397
(Secretary Do)

1176
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:15,728
Logan.

1177
01:13:26,187 --> 01:13:28,984
Save Logan, no matter what.

1178
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:31,292
I'm not expecting him to properly function
like a human being.

1179
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:32,795
I just need him alive.

1180
01:13:33,147 --> 01:13:34,202
That's all.

1181
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,483
That's why I got you out of jail.

1182
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:12,898
=The Penthouse 3=.

1183
01:14:12,978 --> 01:14:14,683
You must do better than me.

1184
01:14:14,763 --> 01:14:15,912
An audition? I'll win.

1185
01:14:15,992 --> 01:14:17,410
Accept me as your dad.

1186
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:19,022
I can't do this anymore. Let's break up.

1187
01:14:19,102 --> 01:14:22,195
I'm not a moron like you.
I'm not afraid of Joo Dan Tae at all.

1188
01:14:22,275 --> 01:14:23,953
-What will be your collateral?
-The penthouse.

1189
01:14:24,033 --> 01:14:26,462
You know why my mom died.
What's the truth of that day?

1190
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:28,603
I have something urgent to tell you.
I'll save her no matter what.

1191
01:14:28,683 --> 01:14:30,365
The Dohae Construction lobbyist.
That's me.

1192
01:14:30,445 --> 01:14:33,006
I can kill Joo Dan Tae
and take off whenever I want.

1193
01:14:33,086 --> 01:14:34,315
You don't deserve to live.

1194
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:36,786
I'll make sure
you can't do anything anymore.

1195
01:14:40,527 --> 01:14:45,457
