00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,310
(The Penthouse 3)

2

(All characters, organizations,
places, and events are fictional.)

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,760
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,760
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,700
We will now start auditioning...

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,200
for the Cheong A Arts Center
resident musician.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,700
Bae Ro Na's talent was top-notch.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,580
You were the one who invited Clark,
Shim Su Ryeon?

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,080
This place is for orphans. Just like you.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,990
I did everything you asked, so why?

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,290
Seok Kyung and Seol A are twins?

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,420
Do you not care if you never see
your biological child ever again?

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,950
Don't look for me anymore.
I won't let Dad catch me.

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,850
Shim Su Ryeon.
Why not leave her to me this time?

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,560
What does it say
on that trash can next to Logan?

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,460
-Penthouse?
-Ordering Baek Jun Ki...

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,200
to blow up Logan's car
and keeping him locked up like this.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,820
I didn't know you were such a scary woman.

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,890
=Episode 9=

20
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,900
Hi, Son.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,680
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,612
I thought you should know.

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,812
Your mom did something horrible.

24
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:29,500
She had...

25
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,522
locked up Logan in the penthouse.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,974
Isn't Logan dead?

27
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,843
He's barely breathing.

28
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:42,063
In the penthouse's helper room.

29
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:45,927
Didn't you think something was off?

30
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:50,241
Not at all. Why would Mom do such a thing?

31
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:52,838
She has a good reason.

32
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:58,230
Logan took Min Seol A's bone marrow
and abandoned her.

33
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:00,142
Logan was nothing more...

34
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,016
than the target of revenge for Seol A.

35
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:06,761
Anyway, I plan to move back
into the penthouse soon...

36
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:09,427
since this was originally my home anyway.

37
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,703
I should get the bedroom redone.

38
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,566
I'm going to hop in the shower.

39
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,172
Please pick up, Mom.

40
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,120
The person you have reached...

41
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,120
(Living Gositel)

42
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,346
James knows I'm here.

43
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,164
Give me a minute.

44
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:40,984
That was brave of you.

45
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:44,595
You conspired with Su Ryeon to kill Logan?

46
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:46,544
Did she lure you with money?

47
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:50,470
Or did you hope to become her new lover?

48
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,721
You were the one who dragged me in there.

49
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,866
Why did you get me out of prison?

50
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:58,385
Was this your plan all along?

51
00:02:58,465 --> 00:03:01,343
How could a mom use her daughter
to threaten me?

52
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:03,714
-And you call yourself a mom?
-What about you?

53
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:06,490
Did you stab me in the back
for Eun Byeol's sake?

54
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,220
Because of you,

55
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,446
she lived with that monster.

56
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:15,617
You betrayed me and split us up,
so you must pay the price.

57
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:16,719
That is...

58
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:18,726
poetic justice.

59
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:24,069
You killed Yoon Hee, didn't you?

60
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,071
Yoon Hee?

61
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,604
Didn't you kill her?

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,750
Because you betrayed her and dumped her.

63
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,923
Carry that guilt with you
for the rest of your life.

64
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:42,102
If you survive, that is.

65
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:46,025
Seo Jin. I will never forgive you.

66
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:49,117
Seo Jin. I'll get you for this!

67
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,896
Seo Jin!

68
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:52,757
Seo Jin!

69
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:54,737
(Living Gositel)

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,458
Let him go.

71
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,500
Please, sir. Do get in the car.

72
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,694
I'll explain everything on the way.

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,610
You're really something, Cheon Seo Jin.

74
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,634
You really tricked James.

75
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:19,034
Is it now time to celebrate?

76
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,953
No wonder...

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,684
we make such great partners.

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,215
That's right.

79
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,347
There's one thing I want to know.

80
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:36,242
Why do you want
to get at Shim Su Ryeon so badly?

81
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:37,905
The almighty Cheon Seo Jin.

82
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:42,126
She was the one woman
who really made me care.

83
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:43,933
Shim Su Ryeon.

84
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,516
Will there ever be a day better than this?

85
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:54,071
I panicked
when I heard that Logan was alive,

86
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:56,202
but thanks to that,
we got rid of Su Ryeon,

87
00:04:56,282 --> 00:05:00,160
Logan Lee, Jun Ki,
and Yoon Chul all in one fell swoop.

88
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:06,110
We got rid of everyone who was a nuisance.

89
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,582
I'm going to drink until I get drunk.

90
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,995
You're sure...

91
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,272
Logan won't wake up, right?

92
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,847
I personally injected him with the poison.

93
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:24,757
His heart stopped. He won't last a day.

94
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,060
He was going to die anyway.

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,228
That's right.

96
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,650
What did you do with Jun Ki?

97
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,807
I told a certain someone
that he desperately missed...

98
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:36,355
where he used to be.

99
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,864
Do you mean the mental hospital in Japan?

100
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:40,128
Yes.

101
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,134
But then again,

102
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,245
that's a better fit for him.

103
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,695
It was a great move
to tie Su Ryeon and Logan together.

104
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:56,611
You really are impressive.

105
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:07,219
So you were the one behind
Jun Ki coming here.

106
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:10,761
You found out that
I planned to kill Logan...

107
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:15,237
and got him out and locked him up
and made a deal with Logan's family?

108
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:16,996
You are psychotic.

109
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,619
You'll end up killing me
if I don't kill you first.

110
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:23,429
I need to stay on my toes.

111
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,299
Was the view from the penthouse this nice?

112
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:30,961
Su Ryeon...

113
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:34,286
enjoyed a lot of pretty things,

114
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,971
so she should have no regrets
in this life.

115
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:42,438
You're next, Dan Tae.

116
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:45,440
Enjoy this as much as you can.

117
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:49,584
I'll take everything you have very soon.

118
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,349
Logan.

119
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:11,823
Su Ryeon.

120
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:44,311
I've missed you.

121
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:10,788
Is it really you?

122
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:12,423
Yes.

123
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,752
What happened?

124
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:31,094
Why didn't you tell me if you were alive?

125
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,810
How can I die and leave you?

126
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:37,148
I'll explain everything.

127
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:40,638
I'm sorry it took me so long to come.

128
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:42,785
You're alive, so it's fine.

129
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:45,901
I prayed so earnestly...

130
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:49,075
that you'd be alive in any shape or form.

131
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:56,739
Dr. Ha. What are you doing here?

132
00:08:58,334 --> 00:08:59,886
He helped me...

133
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,427
meet you.

134
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,613
You did well so far, Logan.

135
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,794
In just 24 hours,

136
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,362
you will feel very comfortable.

137
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,284
Maybe I imagined it.

138
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,351
So why did you waste your precious life...

139
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:53,790
by falling in love
with someone like Su Ryeon?

140
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,645
What a waste of your money and youth.

141
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:00,232
But don't be too upset.

142
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:02,898
I'll send Su Ryeon to you very soon.

143
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,811
What happened? Who did this?

144
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:45,648
This causes heart failure.

145
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,050
Let me give you an antidote. Hang on.

146
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:58,944
Stay with me, Logan.

147
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,621
It was Seo Jin.

148
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:07,906
What?

149
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,081
The person who locked me in here...

150
00:11:12,231 --> 00:11:13,807
was Seo Jin.

151
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,900
Seo Jin?

152
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:20,641
Alex.

153
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,933
Please call Alex.

154
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:27,743
Logan.

155
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:29,772
Wake up, Logan.

156
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:31,141
Darn it.

157
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,579
Wake up, Logan.

158
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,799
You can't die.

159
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:44,758
Hey. What is going on, man? Where's Logan?

160
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,464
The situation is bad.

161
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,934
I gave him an antidote immediately,

162
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:51,859
but he was poisoned.

163
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:54,628
What? Poisoned? Who?

164
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,679
Cheon Seo Jin, that crazy lady?

165
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:59,391
Oh, no. I'm going to kill this woman.

166
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,088
I won't let this happen.

167
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,998
Calm down.
You won't find out anything this way.

168
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:06,702
I'm not waiting any longer.

169
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:08,524
What if Logan dies?

170
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,319
You're going to be held responsible?

171
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:12,033
Darn it.

172
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,539
Think why Logan told me to tell just you.

173
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:24,252
If you get carried away,
you'll ruin all of Logan's plans.

174
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,181
He cheated death many times
to get this far.

175
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,621
Please. Let Logan do what he wants.

176
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:37,474
Darn it.

177
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,762
Darn it.

178
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,651
Cheon Seo Jin will do something tomorrow.

179
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,964
I think she'll move Logan somewhere.

180
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:51,353
I don't know where that is.

181
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:55,371
Right now, all I can do is
wish he gets through it.

182
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:58,435
Cheon Seo Jin. And Joo Dan Tae.

183
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,828
I'll kill them all.

184
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:06,151
I'll use all my family's money,
down to the last penny if I have to,

185
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:08,337
to make sure they're both dead.

186
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,942
I swear to God!

187
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:37,786
Bring that this way.

188
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:39,005
Okay.

189
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,373
What's that?

190
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:42,618
What's going on?

191
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,046
Is that furniture?

192
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:47,307
Did you get a new couch? Which one?

193
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:52,651
It must be a new model.

194
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,224
I'm so jealous.

195
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,833
My gosh.
How can something look so luxurious?

196
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,686
I just changed the couch.

197
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:10,268
It's luxury at its peak.

198
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:13,376
It totally upgrades the whole house.

199
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:17,257
The interior looks so different.

200
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:19,442
Smile a bit, Su Ryeon.

201
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:53,562
Ms. Cheon, he was just brought in.

202
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:56,432
He seems to be unconscious.

203
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,185
Good job.

204
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:04,317
At exactly 7:00 PM,
bring Su Ryeon to the helper room.

205
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:06,900
You must be on time. Make no mistakes.

206
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:08,817
I'll compensate you handsomely.

207
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:12,995
Ma'am, you need to come over.

208
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:16,163
There's a weird smell
coming from behind the hall.

209
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:17,375
There is?

210
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,389
-Who are you?
-Shim Su Ryeon.

211
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:46,212
You revenge your daughter's death...

212
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:50,211
by doing this to our Logan?

213
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:52,043
Logan?

214
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:55,665
Logan? What are you talking about?

215
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,968
I didn't know you were such a scary woman.

216
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:02,342
Poor Logan.

217
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:05,753
Tricked by the woman he loves.

218
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,383
Logan!

219
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,584
His heart stopped.

220
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:15,207
Take him to the hospital!

221
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,418
And bring her too!

222
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:19,786
Come on in!

223
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:22,995
Let me see Logan.

224
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:24,887
Please let me see Logan!

225
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:27,253
Logan! Let me see him!

226
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,653
Let me see him!

227
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:30,643
Logan!

228
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:43,089
-Logan.
-Turn the ambulance around.

229
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,321
What's going on?

230
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,392
Call Alex for me.

231
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:50,358
Don't tell the rest of the family.

232
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:52,803
Tell Alex to do as I asked.

233
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:55,229
Do not touch a hair on Su Ryeon's body.

234
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:01,904
Hey. Thanks for making it, little bro.

235
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:04,387
But do we really have to keep this
a secret?

236
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:07,457
For now.
You know what our parents are like.

237
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:10,651
If they know it was Dan Tae and Seo Jin,

238
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,133
would they let them live?

239
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:14,013
My plan will become a mess.

240
00:17:14,104 --> 00:17:16,621
All right.
But we should still tell Grandma, though,

241
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,341
because, you know, she's pretty upset.

242
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:21,777
Leave it to me.

243
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,366
All right.

244
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:27,501
And don't worry about this place,

245
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:30,016
because I got this place on lock-down,
all right?

246
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:33,703
Nobody can get in here
besides me and my people, all right?

247
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:36,475
Thanks, bro.

248
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,567
Yes.

249
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:51,553
Let go.

250
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:53,870
You're being fooled.

251
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,154
Please take me to Logan.

252
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:59,185
I need to see how he's doing
with my own eyes.

253
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:00,379
I beg you.

254
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,808
You must've been in so much pain.

255
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:05,753
How could they do this to someone?

256
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:09,461
I'm fine.

257
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:11,794
I'm alive.

258
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,136
Seeing you...

259
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:16,246
made it worthwhile.

260
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:19,432
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

261
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:21,990
I can never forgive them.

262
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,713
There is no more mercy.

263
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,097
They went after the wrong person.

264
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,581
I will make them regret it.

265
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:34,576
I never imagined that
the person who confined me...

266
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:36,561
was Cheon Seo Jin.

267
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:39,850
Even less that she'd rope in Dr. Ha.

268
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:42,884
In return for springing me from prison,

269
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:44,863
she made me work for Dan Tae.

270
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:46,555
Then she told me to treat Logan.

271
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:48,377
To keep him barely alive.

272
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:51,583
To hide her identity,

273
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:55,178
she even used Eun Byeol to blackmail me.

274
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:57,562
How could a human being do such a thing?

275
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:04,846
For now, let's pretend I'm dead.

276
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:07,520
Do as you planned.

277
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,253
What will you do?

278
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:14,193
I have to find Seok Kyung first.

279
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,091
Seok Kyung is...

280
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,291
my real daughter.

281
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,797
Seok Kyung?

282
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:27,161
Dan Tae killed Yoon Hee
because she tried to reveal that.

283
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:28,697
I'm not positive,

284
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,868
but I think Seo Jin's involved too.

285
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:33,806
It's all my fault.

286
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:38,343
I asked Yoon Hee to find your daughter.

287
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:40,297
Because of me,

288
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,404
she's dead.

289
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:47,972
So that her death isn't in vain,
we must reveal the truth.

290
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:53,165
In my own way, I will get revenge
that will devastate them.

291
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,059
Count me in.

292
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:57,619
Let me help.

293
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:06,669
Mr. Lee.

294
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,206
Seok Hoon.

295
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,393
Mom. Are you all right?

296
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:13,024
Is everything okay?

297
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:15,379
What on earth is going on?

298
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,204
What happened to Mom?

299
00:20:58,641 --> 00:20:59,920
I wonder.

300
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:04,333
Considering what she did to Logan,

301
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:07,387
his family won't let her off lightly.

302
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,007
She went way too far.

303
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:12,958
All because of a dead girl.

304
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,614
This penthouse...

305
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:18,245
is in our name, yours and mine.

306
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:21,486
Now only true family members are left.

307
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:24,069
You promised never to hurt Mom.

308
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:26,495
Don't forget that.

309
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:31,580
Don't you worry. I didn't touch your mom.

310
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:34,549
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

311
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:36,285
Logan's family took her.

312
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:42,237
Be careful
so your dad doesn't suspect you.

313
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:44,692
He'll trust you
because you're his only blood.

314
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,754
Do not make the first move.

315
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,771
Be careful until we find Seok Kyung.

316
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:51,867
So...

317
00:21:52,842 --> 00:21:53,905
Shall we get to work?

318
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:59,748
Did Seok Kyung call you?

319
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:03,358
I still can't seem to reach her.

320
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:06,186
I assume she's busy
getting used to her life abroad.

321
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:07,489
I'm sure she's doing fine.

322
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,307
You really are my son,
with that tender heart of yours.

323
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,371
Don't worry about trivial things.

324
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:17,876
Just enjoy what you will soon have.

325
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:20,426
You're the only one I trust, Dad.

326
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:51,458
Yes. Where's Seok Kyung?

327
00:22:52,591 --> 00:22:55,055
You still haven't found her?

328
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:59,735
I'm sure she'll come crawling back
since she's out of money.

329
00:23:00,136 --> 00:23:01,247
Come down now.

330
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,228
What are you doing?

331
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:15,452
What about you?

332
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,273
You think you can kill your father
with something like this?

333
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:21,161
-Come with me.
-Let me go.

334
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:22,521
-Come with me!
-Let go!

335
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,009
Who are you to intervene in my life?

336
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:26,261
Let go!

337
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:30,893
Seok Kyung.

338
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,206
Take her to the hospital first.
She seems like she's hurt.

339
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:41,771
I didn't bring her in because I like her.

340
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:43,811
I just didn't want her to get hurt
at Hera Palace.

341
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:46,246
Thank you.

342
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,563
Where are you hurt? How much?

343
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:52,461
You look horrible.

344
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:54,445
Let's go to the hospital.

345
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:57,539
It's nothing.

346
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:58,853
It is something.

347
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:01,186
None of my bones are broken,
and I'm not bleeding!

348
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:05,847
Why are you making me worry?

349
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:09,311
Do you know how worried Mom and I were?
Why didn't you call?

350
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:11,386
Where have you been?

351
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:13,703
You should have come looking for me
if something had happened.

352
00:24:13,783 --> 00:24:15,597
Why are you worrying about me now?

353
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:19,255
You wouldn't have cared if I died.

354
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:22,302
Don't say that.

355
00:24:22,382 --> 00:24:24,806
I'm not even your birth sister.

356
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,002
You...

357
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,599
How did you...

358
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,635
Dad told me.

359
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:34,789
That's why he did this to me.

360
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:36,795
Because I'm not his daughter.

361
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:40,991
It's why he sabotaged
my relationship with Mom.

362
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:43,377
It's why he used me
to take over the penthouse.

363
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:46,193
It's why he took all the money
under my name.

364
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:47,789
That was why.

365
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,440
Because I'm Mom's daughter.

366
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,445
Shim Su Ryeon's daughter.

367
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,902
Because I'm Min Seol A's twin.

368
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:59,053
So what?

369
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:02,148
That doesn't mean anything.

370
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:03,984
How is it nothing?

371
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:07,809
It means you and I are strangers.

372
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:10,745
We walk different paths.

373
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:12,836
That changes nothing.

374
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:16,923
You're my sister till death.
I'll protect you no matter what.

375
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:18,850
Dad will never hurt you.

376
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:21,478
I won't let him. So listen to me!

377
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:27,548
I know you're working for him.

378
00:25:28,473 --> 00:25:30,232
Are you planning on inheriting it
all yourself?

379
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:33,992
Is that why you kicked Mom out
and are staying by Dad's side?

380
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:35,634
I know you don't mean that.

381
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:37,388
You know me better than that.

382
00:25:38,106 --> 00:25:40,429
Does saying that make you feel better?
Are you stupid?

383
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,896
Let go!

384
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,294
Let go!

385
00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:52,182
I said let go! Please!

386
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:04,947
It was me.

387
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:07,524
It's okay. I know it was hard.

388
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:19,546
Who owns...

389
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:21,432
Dohae Construction again?

390
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:24,404
It was bought by Logan's company.

391
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:28,713
Shim Su Ryeon is sure
you're the man behind it.

392
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:31,187
Which is why we helped her.

393
00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:38,848
As promised,

394
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:41,333
I will give you the development rights...

395
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,532
for Cheonsoo District.

396
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:48,360
Then can I assume that from today...

397
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,186
Dohae Construction will no longer be
involved with Cheonsoo District?

398
00:26:52,656 --> 00:26:54,093
Of course.

399
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,089
That was clean.

400
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,940
I'm sorry about Logan.

401
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:06,187
I really wished he would survive
and let the truth be known.

402
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:07,752
Still...

403
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:11,893
I'm relieved...

404
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:14,610
he was able to die
in the care of his family.

405
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,697
My family...

406
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:20,393
is planning
on returning to the States now.

407
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,617
How are you going to deal with...

408
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,778
Shim Su Ryeon and Ha Yoon Chul?

409
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:29,037
My family will deal with that.

410
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:30,414
Alex,

411
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,489
Logan's brother,
will be taking care of it.

412
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,041
The punishment won't be light.

413
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:45,388
Sorry for misunderstanding you
all this time.

414
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:50,762
You two will be rewarded soon.

415
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:13,968
How did everything work out
so smoothly like this?

416
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:18,574
Chairman Joo, you continue to astound me.

417
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:21,713
When Cheong A Constructions
is chosen to lead the Cheonsoo project,

418
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:25,043
Cheong A group's stock price, which
has been falling, shall also rise again.

419
00:28:25,123 --> 00:28:27,195
I will try my best...

420
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:29,413
to make it hit the highest price
in the country.

421
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:33,401
Some say it's already been decided
as a land transaction permit area.

422
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:43,423
Okay, then.

423
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:46,906
Thank you for all your work so far.

424
00:28:54,411 --> 00:28:57,339
Doesn't money smell great?

425
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,330
What about Yoon Chul?
Don't you have anything?

426
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:05,275
That's right.
Did something happen to Dr. Ha?

427
00:29:05,355 --> 00:29:06,616
I can't seem to reach him.

428
00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:09,062
I think by now...

429
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:12,388
he's become fish food
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

430
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:13,449
Fish food?

431
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:15,467
It was Shim Su Ryeon...

432
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:17,093
who blew up Logan's car.

433
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:21,161
It seems she had locked him up
in the penthouse and tortured him.

434
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:23,678
Logan was the last target...

435
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:25,638
for her daughter's revenge.

436
00:29:25,718 --> 00:29:28,709
And Ha Yoon Chul helped her.

437
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:30,886
-What?
-Wait.

438
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:32,632
That doesn't make any sense.

439
00:29:32,712 --> 00:29:34,558
Forget Shim Su Ryeon for a second.

440
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:36,809
Why would Ha Yoon Chul do that?

441
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:38,477
What did Logan ever do to him?

442
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:40,024
I'm sure it was for money.

443
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:42,861
Shim Su Ryeon offered him
a great deal of money.

444
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:46,983
How bold of her to do that to an American
who is part of a conglomerate.

445
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:49,095
How sad.

446
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:51,885
Although we did end up with more money
thanks to that.

447
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:54,245
I heard you both worked very hard.

448
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:58,831
I hope you can keep it up
until the construction ends.

449
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:03,296
And this is an extra gift
from Cheong A Group.

450
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:13,124
This couple sure is generous.

451
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:15,463
They really know how to play.

452
00:30:16,754 --> 00:30:18,514
Cheers. Here.

453
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:27,565
Stay here for a while.

454
00:30:28,114 --> 00:30:29,900
It'll keep you out of Dad's radar.

455
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,251
How's the wound?

456
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:36,911
I told you I'm fine.

457
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:43,223
Go now. I want to rest.

458
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:45,909
Let's meet Mom in the evening.
I'll call her.

459
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:49,672
-I don't want to.
-Why?

460
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:52,523
You want her to keep worrying?

461
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:54,777
We looked all over the retreat center
that day because of you.

462
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:56,172
Mom's in a dark place right now.

463
00:30:56,252 --> 00:31:00,023
After Ro Na's mom died,
she's been fighting Dad day and night.

464
00:31:00,103 --> 00:31:01,780
Is this about her again?

465
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,933
Stop talking about Ro Na's mom.
I'm sick of hearing it.

466
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,841
It's not like I killed her.

467
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:09,684
You didn't, but you played a part.

468
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:12,977
She found out you were Mom's daughter...

469
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:16,441
and was chased by Dad.
That's how she passed away.

470
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:18,049
What?

471
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:19,498
You of all people...

472
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,938
shouldn't talk that way about her death.

473
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:26,290
She was even falsely accused
of kidnapping Eun Byeol.

474
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:29,357
Because of Ms. Jin's lie.

475
00:31:31,094 --> 00:31:32,178
Ms. Jin?

476
00:31:32,714 --> 00:31:34,366
How about that tteokbokki?

477
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:39,489
What are you doing here?

478
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,406
Let go of me. I'm busy.

479
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,981
Ha Eun Byeol.

480
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:44,840
Are you looking for her?

481
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:48,426
Do you know where my Eun Byeol is?

482
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:52,449
I told Ms. Jin that...

483
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:56,232
Eun Byeol was at Ro Na's place.

484
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:58,024
What?

485
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:01,719
I also kept you and Ro Na
at that tteokbokki place for her.

486
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:07,204
If only I hadn't told her,
none of this would've happened.

487
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:13,005
Did Ro Na's mom die because of me?

488
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:15,893
Did you really do that?

489
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,149
Tell me exactly what happened.

490
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:19,711
You tell me.

491
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:21,650
Is Mom in danger?

492
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,525
What did Dad do to her?

493
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:29,476
Why isn't Su Ryeon picking up?

494
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:33,383
She handed over Dohae Construction's
development rights so suddenly too.

495
00:32:35,948 --> 00:32:37,160
Gosh, you startled me.

496
00:32:39,134 --> 00:32:40,982
What are you doing? I'm busy.

497
00:32:41,062 --> 00:32:42,051
Hey!

498
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:43,264
Let go.

499
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:45,374
I have nothing to say to you.

500
00:32:45,454 --> 00:32:48,963
Unless Joo Dan Tae threatens to kill me,
I'll never make a deal with you.

501
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:50,791
What's all this?

502
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,320
Let's flee.

503
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,327
What?

504
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:00,979
I already booked flights.

505
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:02,868
I also found a school for Jenny.

506
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:06,549
With this money,
we can support Jenny abroad.

507
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:10,523
We'll make a fresh new start
where no one can find us.

508
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:14,272
Don't tell me
this money is from Joo Dan Tae.

509
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:17,335
Did he give away money
to celebrate his new rights?

510
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:19,957
Cheonsoo District was going to be
developed by Cheong A anyway.

511
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:22,117
That way, we can sell our land
at a higher price too.

512
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:26,142
Cut ties with Shim Su Ryeon.
We're leaving this place.

513
00:33:27,181 --> 00:33:28,961
(Korea Air, Passport)

514
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:32,780
Are you even human?

515
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:35,246
After destroying a family,
what are you saying now?

516
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:37,247
"We'll make a fresh new start?"

517
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:40,685
I still can't face Ro Na.

518
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:42,397
I feel too guilty.

519
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:44,351
I only care about my own child.

520
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:46,086
We'll pay Ro Na, okay?

521
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,088
A person died!

522
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:52,043
To Ro Na, Yoon Hee meant the world.

523
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:55,281
With her whole world gone,
what meaning does money have?

524
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,189
-Ma Ri.
-Su Ryeon is missing.

525
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,306
You know where she is, don't you?

526
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:04,193
Joo Dan Tae, that jerk,
might have kidnapped and blackmailed her.

527
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:08,178
Otherwise, why would Dohae Construction
give up so easily?

528
00:34:08,258 --> 00:34:11,812
What does that matter
when we can keep the money?

529
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:15,262
No way.

530
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:19,658
Have you been working with Joo Dan Tae
for money all this time?

531
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,150
You're a jerk!

532
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:26,537
You can never flee.

533
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:30,341
Pay for what you did to Yoon Hee first.

534
00:34:30,421 --> 00:34:33,976
Confess everything
Joo Dan Tae has ever done.

535
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,821
If anything happens to Su Ryeon,

536
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:42,089
I'll put you behind bars
with my own two hands.

537
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:45,004
You're becoming just like Joo Dan Tae.

538
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,255
Get it together!

539
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,441
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

540
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:59,634
Why isn't Ms. Shim here yet?

541
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:02,272
Her phone is turned off too.

542
00:35:02,749 --> 00:35:04,680
-Goodness.
-This is bad.

543
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,862
Well...

544
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:09,878
I'm not sure if I should tell you this,

545
00:35:10,853 --> 00:35:12,604
but Ms. Shim is...

546
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,871
being suspected of murder, kidnapping,

547
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:18,404
and holding a person captive,
and is on the run.

548
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,918
-What?
-My gosh.

549
00:35:20,998 --> 00:35:24,045
In addition to the shameful fact
that she used to work as a hostess,

550
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,977
if this gets out to the press,

551
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:30,530
Cheong A Foundation's reputation
will be irreparably harmed.

552
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,000
There's no point in waiting any longer.

553
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,488
Let's take a vote already.

554
00:35:36,575 --> 00:35:40,106
If you think Director Shim Su Ryeon
should be dismissed,

555
00:35:40,186 --> 00:35:41,322
raise your hand.

556
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:47,054
All right. By unanimous consent,

557
00:35:47,134 --> 00:35:50,446
Director Shim Su Ryeon is dismissed.

558
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:54,693
Let's elect the new director immediately.

559
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:57,734
Our former director, Ms. Cheon,
is with us anyway.

560
00:35:57,814 --> 00:35:59,554
-That sounds good.
-Great.

561
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:00,815
Me?

562
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,867
If you give me a second chance,

563
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:10,813
I'll devote my body and soul
to Cheong A Foundation.

564
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:24,021
Put this office back...

565
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:26,235
to its original state
before my inauguration ceremony.

566
00:36:26,315 --> 00:36:27,570
Yes, ma'am.

567
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,779
Welcome back, Ms. Cheon.

568
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,682
We should work together...

569
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:35,345
-to grow Cheong A Foundation.
-I know.

570
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:36,681
(Cheon Myung Soo, Sixth director)

571
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,029
Father, I'm back...

572
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,963
at Cheong A Foundation
that you left for me.

573
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:07,679
It's not me.

574
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,313
I swear!

575
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,938
This was all set up by Cheon Seo Jin.

576
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:16,305
I just did as she said.

577
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,238
I was fooled!

578
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:30,207
Are you confessing?

579
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:35,786
-Logan.
-What?

580
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,029
Are you surprised?

581
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:40,867
Because I'm alive?

582
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:46,407
How could you...

583
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:49,840
betray my trust like this?

584
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:58,201
I was trying to help you.

585
00:38:00,373 --> 00:38:05,023
Killing Joo Dan Tae was never your plan.

586
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:08,252
You weren't the least bit interested
in your parents' revenge.

587
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,807
Did you only pretend
to want to kill him...

588
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:14,977
to approach me?

589
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:17,935
Why? Were you after my money?

590
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:20,741
Is that why
you teamed up with Cheon Seo Jin?

591
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:21,808
No.

592
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:24,772
I was grateful to you
for getting me out of the loony bin.

593
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:26,102
I mean it.

594
00:38:27,368 --> 00:38:29,030
But Cheon Seo Jin's offer...

595
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:31,646
was hard to resist.

596
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:33,905
Did she pay off your gambling debts?

597
00:38:34,693 --> 00:38:37,187
She promised half the profits.

598
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:38,459
If everything worked out,

599
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,575
I thought it could make up
for all the injustice in my life.

600
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:45,353
You and Joo Dan Tae...

601
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:47,955
didn't just share a name.

602
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:49,882
Both of you are...

603
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:52,384
scumbags.

604
00:38:53,744 --> 00:38:57,383
So I'm thinking of sending you back there.

605
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,430
Yes, there. That place.

606
00:39:01,518 --> 00:39:02,579
Do you understand?

607
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:11,790
You'll rot there
for the rest of your life.

608
00:39:12,905 --> 00:39:14,899
You're crazy. You're out of your mind.

609
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,866
I'm sorry, Logan.

610
00:39:16,946 --> 00:39:18,193
Take him away!

611
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,128
I'm sorry.

612
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:22,060
I'm sorry, Logan.

613
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,352
No.

614
00:39:25,388 --> 00:39:28,729
Logan! I don't want to go back there.

615
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:29,835
Logan!

616
00:39:30,547 --> 00:39:32,298
Don't lock me up again!

617
00:39:33,444 --> 00:39:34,923
No!

618
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:51,445
You found Seok Kyung?

619
00:39:51,914 --> 00:39:54,892
Where is she now?
Bring her to me right now.

620
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:57,132
No. I'll come to you.

621
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:59,244
She's not ready to see you yet.

622
00:39:59,324 --> 00:40:02,273
She's very confused. Give her some time.

623
00:40:02,353 --> 00:40:04,973
How can she not be ready
to see her own mom?

624
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:07,320
Tell Seok Kyung this.

625
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,904
I'm waiting for her like I always have.

626
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,206
She can come to me anytime.

627
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,922
By the way, Seok Kyung told me
something important today.

628
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:15,413
On the day Ms. Oh died,

629
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:17,489
Seok Kyung met Ms. Jin.

630
00:40:18,254 --> 00:40:21,001
It's certain that
Ms. Jin kidnapped Eun Byeol.

631
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:22,982
Seok Hoon?

632
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,377
I'll call you back.

633
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:34,927
Finally.

634
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,233
Finally, this place became mine.

635
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:42,666
I'm going to tear down this shop...

636
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,802
and build
a Cheonsoo District landmark here.

637
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:48,189
Why does it have to be here?

638
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:49,616
This is...

639
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,082
where I used to live.

640
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,346
Your paternal grandmother...

641
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:56,794
lived here.

642
00:40:58,101 --> 00:40:59,451
My paternal grandmother?

643
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:01,248
Wasn't this
my maternal grandfather's land?

644
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:02,283
No.

645
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:05,769
It's where my family and I lived.

646
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,525
At 27 Cheonsoo District.

647
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,138
And...

648
00:41:12,824 --> 00:41:14,498
this is where my mother...

649
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:16,994
is buried.

650
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:20,687
Mom.

651
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:22,231
Jun Ki.

652
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:24,859
Jun Ki.

653
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:27,625
You must stay alive.

654
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:31,117
Make lots of money and succeed.

655
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:35,445
Build a big house for all to see,

656
00:41:36,215 --> 00:41:39,063
and you must live...

657
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,980
as a rich man.

658
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,542
No. Please, no Mom.

659
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:46,176
Don't die.

660
00:41:47,482 --> 00:41:50,133
You can't leave me.

661
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:56,948
Jun Hee. Please, wake up.

662
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:00,123
Breathe.

663
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:14,796
Everything began here,

664
00:42:16,238 --> 00:42:18,330
and it's time for me to complete it.

665
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:24,766
First, I plan to erect
a Zeus Tower in memory of my mother.

666
00:42:25,237 --> 00:42:29,256
It will be lit 24 hours a day
and visible from anywhere.

667
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:32,137
It'll be the tallest building
in the world.

668
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:34,295
And all of this...

669
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:37,079
is yours, Seok Hoon.

670
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:40,152
Picture it.

671
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:43,119
How amazing is this?

672
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:50,057
Aren't you thankful
you were born as my son?

673
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,476
We must find Jin Bun Hong first.

674
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:07,941
She holds the key
to the truth of that night.

675
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:10,862
Do you know where she lives?

676
00:43:10,942 --> 00:43:14,221
No, I don't. But I know how to find her.

677
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:16,017
Leave it to me.

678
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:18,206
I have a question.

679
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:21,755
Why did you help Logan?

680
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:25,685
Because of Yoon Hee.

681
00:43:29,761 --> 00:43:31,068
Because I felt like...

682
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:34,180
that was what Yoon Hee would've done.

683
00:43:45,841 --> 00:43:47,371
The person you have reached...

684
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:53,141
The person you have reached...

685
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:56,280
Eun Byeol, pick up.

686
00:43:56,695 --> 00:43:59,494
Eun Byeol, where are you?

687
00:44:00,317 --> 00:44:02,990
Eun Byeol, why can't I reach you?

688
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,246
Is something okay?

689
00:44:04,326 --> 00:44:06,961
I'm at Hera Palace. Make some time for me.

690
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,851
(Eun Byeol, pick up.)

691
00:44:14,341 --> 00:44:16,401
(Eun Byeol)

692
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:24,706
Eun Byeol, I heard you failed
the Cheong A Arts Center audition.

693
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:27,089
An SNU grad lost to a high school grad?

694
00:44:27,594 --> 00:44:29,247
I heard Ro Na was amazing.

695
00:44:29,327 --> 00:44:31,528
Did you see the posts by the kids
who were at the audition?

696
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:33,527
Want to see a video of her audition?

697
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:34,611
Yes.

698
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:41,021
(Cheong A Arts Center
Artist in Residence Audition)

699
00:44:44,006 --> 00:44:46,118
Awesome, right? Isn't she incredible?

700
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:49,964
She's really good.

701
00:44:50,044 --> 00:44:52,044
(Cheong A Arts Center Artist
in Residence Audition)

702
00:44:54,707 --> 00:44:57,562
Eun Byeol! Please wake up!

703
00:44:57,642 --> 00:44:58,815
Eun Byeol!

704
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:03,764
No! Please wake up, Eun Byeol!

705
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,471
We'll die, Eun Byeol!

706
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:09,208
Eun Byeol! Please!

707
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:14,625
Eun Byeol! Please wake up!

708
00:45:15,636 --> 00:45:17,530
Eun Byeol! Please wake up!

709
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,503
What's wrong? What is it?

710
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,674
Look at me.

711
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:22,419
Are you okay?

712
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:27,182
When did you all get here?

713
00:45:27,882 --> 00:45:31,088
What do you mean?
We've been studying for finals.

714
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:33,060
What? I was?

715
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,915
Wow. Look at you weaselling out of this.

716
00:45:35,995 --> 00:45:38,175
-You're a great actress.
-You guys...

717
00:45:45,254 --> 00:45:47,449
Eun Byeol! Are you okay?

718
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:50,579
Ms. Jin.

719
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:56,801
Drink up.

720
00:45:57,644 --> 00:45:59,634
Why are you so pale?

721
00:45:59,714 --> 00:46:01,475
Have you been eating?

722
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:05,710
This just won't do. Let's go to my place.

723
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,364
I'll make you all of your favourite foods.

724
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:12,510
Ms. Jin.
Can you get me some more of that drug?

725
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,621
The drug?

726
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:17,779
Well... It's not that easy.

727
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,547
Please. For me.

728
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:23,000
No one cares about me as much as you do.

729
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,770
I feel like my head will explode
without it.

730
00:46:26,336 --> 00:46:28,390
Please get it for me.

731
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,114
Okay, I will.

732
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,113
There's nothing I won't do for you.

733
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:37,979
Don't worry. I'll get it for you.

734
00:47:16,723 --> 00:47:20,004
They stopped the clinical test
because that drug was too dangerous.

735
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:21,887
People showed signs of early dementia.

736
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:23,091
It's too dangerous.

737
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:24,488
Do you know that?

738
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:30,117
Why do you care? I said it doesn't matter.

739
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:33,707
Get me as much as you can next time,
got it?

740
00:47:35,824 --> 00:47:38,816
You knew that, but you gave that garbage
to my daughter anyway?

741
00:47:40,217 --> 00:47:42,275
What? Dr. Ha?

742
00:47:43,725 --> 00:47:45,013
Eun Byeol wanted it.

743
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,826
She asked for it first.

744
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,578
Don't lie to me.

745
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,542
Do you think I believe you?

746
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:53,641
You ruined my daughter.

747
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:54,945
Her parents ruined her.

748
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,990
She's miserable
if she's with the two of you.

749
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,708
I'll protect her. I won't lose her!

750
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:25,620
Hey. What are you doing here?

751
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,977
Shouldn't you be making dinner?

752
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:32,071
I don't want to go home
because I don't want to see Kyu Jin,

753
00:48:32,151 --> 00:48:34,701
but I have absolutely nowhere else to go.

754
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:36,494
My life has been in vain.

755
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,248
I had to serve my in-laws...

756
00:48:38,328 --> 00:48:40,793
and support my husband all my life,
so I don't know how to have fun.

757
00:48:40,873 --> 00:48:42,313
And I don't know how to do anything.

758
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:45,402
Why did I live like this?

759
00:48:45,482 --> 00:48:46,649
Listen to this woman.

760
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:50,236
I want to make him pay big time,

761
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:53,005
but I have no clue what I should do.

762
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,035
Get up.

763
00:48:56,755 --> 00:48:59,625
-What?
-I'll teach you, so come with me.

764
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:05,135
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

765
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:06,945
This woman...

766
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:09,479
Does she know what time it is?

767
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:13,510
Her child and the family
were all she ever knew.

768
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,906
But now, she's always out
and doesn't keep house at all.

769
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:19,097
What is wrong with her?

770
00:49:22,351 --> 00:49:24,096
Honey! Where are you?

771
00:49:26,811 --> 00:49:27,823
What?

772
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:31,076
Hey! Where are you?

773
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:35,931
I'll come to you right now...

774
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:47,950
Do you think that jerk will care
just because I do this?

775
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:51,110
See? Your phone is blowing up.

776
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,064
Goodness. He is going crazy.

777
00:49:57,771 --> 00:50:00,922
Stay here for two hours, okay?

778
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:14,314
What is this?

779
00:50:14,697 --> 00:50:15,711
Soju.

780
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:20,766
You need to smell like alcohol
to make Kyu Jin mad.

781
00:50:20,846 --> 00:50:24,142
Yes. Ma Ri!

782
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:25,162
Gosh.

783
00:50:25,242 --> 00:50:27,626
I've already looked up to you...

784
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:30,134
May I love you?

785
00:50:30,214 --> 00:50:32,703
My gosh! Ma Ri!

786
00:50:42,364 --> 00:50:45,151
Who are you people?
Why did you bring me here?

787
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:47,371
Do you want to die? Untie me!

788
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:52,218
What deal did you make with Joo Dan Tae?

789
00:50:52,631 --> 00:50:56,613
Did he promise to give you Eun Byeol
if you do as he says?

790
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:58,640
What deal would I make with Joo Dan Tae?

791
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,898
Why would I do business with that fool?

792
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:03,609
Eun Byeol is my daughter anyway.

793
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:05,894
Do you think you can take her from me?

794
00:51:05,974 --> 00:51:08,836
I'm the one who loves Eun Byeol
more than you two.

795
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:12,152
You never visited her
since you were released from prison.

796
00:51:12,232 --> 00:51:14,482
All you cared about was getting revenge.

797
00:51:16,732 --> 00:51:18,889
-You crazy...
-That day,

798
00:51:19,306 --> 00:51:21,040
you abducted Eun Byeol,

799
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,326
and Yoon Hee died trying to go after you.

800
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,670
Tell me everything you know.

801
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,542
-What happened that night?
-I don't know.

802
00:51:27,622 --> 00:51:30,285
-Tell me!
-I don't know anything!

803
00:51:30,937 --> 00:51:33,277
I had nothing to do
with Oh Yoon Hee's death.

804
00:51:34,097 --> 00:51:35,327
Long time no see.

805
00:51:35,972 --> 00:51:37,132
Ms. Jin Bun Hong.

806
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:43,490
Logan?

807
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:46,725
You're alive?

808
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:48,351
I am.

809
00:51:48,918 --> 00:51:51,097
Thanks to these two here.

810
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,441
Who did this to you?

811
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:57,987
Joo Dan Tae.

812
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:01,024
He set a bomb to get rid of me.

813
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:04,303
You sided with someone like that,

814
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:08,281
talked to the press,
turned Oh Yoon Hee into a criminal,

815
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:11,420
and even tarnished my reputation.

816
00:52:12,264 --> 00:52:13,635
How could you...

817
00:52:14,577 --> 00:52:17,001
betray me of all people?

818
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:19,687
How could you?

819
00:52:20,113 --> 00:52:22,452
Didn't you come to Korea to help me?

820
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,268
I really had no idea...

821
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,461
that Joo Dan Tae
would do something that dreadful.

822
00:52:29,023 --> 00:52:31,820
The only thing I wanted was Eun Byeol.

823
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:34,051
I know.

824
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,690
It's because of Michelle,
your dead daughter.

825
00:52:38,983 --> 00:52:40,104
But guess what?

826
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:45,040
Michelle didn't die because of you.

827
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,960
That night,
the person who left her outdoors...

828
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,300
was your drunk husband.

829
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,523
No.

830
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,858
She died because of me.

831
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,172
I ran away.

832
00:52:58,252 --> 00:52:59,993
Because I was scared of my husband.

833
00:53:00,483 --> 00:53:02,280
I left the poor thing behind.

834
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:06,686
Her hands...

835
00:53:07,945 --> 00:53:10,205
Her face was so cold.

836
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:13,932
If I'd gotten to her sooner,
I could've saved her.

837
00:53:16,656 --> 00:53:18,738
I won't leave her alone ever again.

838
00:53:18,818 --> 00:53:21,064
No. Eun Byeol can't be alone either.

839
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:22,243
I must go to her!

840
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:24,270
Pull yourself together, you lunatic!

841
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,751
Eun Byeol isn't your daughter!

842
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:28,155
No! She is my daughter!

843
00:53:28,235 --> 00:53:32,032
She sleeps in my arms,
she smiles brightly at me,

844
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:34,675
and she tells me everything.

845
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:38,559
She likes the food I cook,

846
00:53:38,857 --> 00:53:41,588
and she waits and waits for me.

847
00:53:41,668 --> 00:53:43,100
You are out of your mind.

848
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,722
I won't let you near Eun Byeol again!

849
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:47,244
Logan!

850
00:53:47,571 --> 00:53:50,442
Logan! Please help me.

851
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:53,363
Let me see Eun Byeol.

852
00:53:53,443 --> 00:53:55,891
She means more than my life.

853
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:57,616
Please help me, Logan!

854
00:53:57,696 --> 00:53:58,703
That...

855
00:53:59,158 --> 00:54:01,585
depends on what you do.

856
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:05,254
Tell me everything that happened that day.

857
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,609
Tell her, Ms. Jin.

858
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:15,724
That day...

859
00:54:19,157 --> 00:54:21,561
Oh Yoon Hee drove after me.

860
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:25,486
So I called Joo Dan Tae.

861
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:27,030
I found Eun Byeol.

862
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,024
I'm being followed by Oh Yoon Hee.

863
00:54:30,104 --> 00:54:31,353
Help me.

864
00:54:31,433 --> 00:54:33,732
Oh Yoon Hee is there?

865
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:37,770
Then I should, of course, help you.

866
00:54:38,228 --> 00:54:40,475
I'll send you an address. Lure her there.

867
00:54:46,252 --> 00:54:48,648
I met him in an isolated spot.

868
00:54:48,728 --> 00:54:50,524
He suddenly tied me up
and took me somewhere.

869
00:54:50,604 --> 00:54:52,393
-I don't know what happened next.
-Let me go!

870
00:54:52,473 --> 00:54:53,640
Don't lie!

871
00:54:54,153 --> 00:54:56,299
Your car was found where Yoon Hee died.

872
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:57,724
I really don't know!

873
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,344
I was locked up somewhere.

874
00:55:00,424 --> 00:55:03,218
He let me go under the condition
that I talk to the media.

875
00:55:03,298 --> 00:55:04,774
That's all.

876
00:55:04,854 --> 00:55:06,560
I can't believe this woman.

877
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:10,443
That day,
when the car was pulled from the water,

878
00:55:10,823 --> 00:55:13,713
the dashboard camera was already gone.

879
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:17,802
Ms. Jin. Look into my eyes as you answer.

880
00:55:17,883 --> 00:55:19,245
That dashboard camera.

881
00:55:20,466 --> 00:55:22,309
Do you really not know where it went?

882
00:55:22,932 --> 00:55:25,237
I don't know where it is.
You can ask the police.

883
00:55:25,317 --> 00:55:26,855
Jin Bun Hong!

884
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,908
Tell me the truth.

885
00:55:33,942 --> 00:55:37,141
I'm giving you one last chance.

886
00:55:42,075 --> 00:55:43,907
The police don't know either.

887
00:55:45,046 --> 00:55:47,628
To hide the fact
that I'd kidnapped Eun Byeol,

888
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:50,168
I hired someone
to get the dashboard camera,

889
00:55:50,248 --> 00:55:51,795
but I haven't seen the footage either.

890
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:54,786
It's a company property,
and I couldn't get into the system.

891
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,333
Then tell me...

892
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:00,584
where that dashboard camera is now.

893
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,556
It has been six months.

894
00:56:15,636 --> 00:56:17,282
Do you think the video's still there?

895
00:56:17,362 --> 00:56:19,230
If it's the last video
before the accident,

896
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:20,655
it'll be there.

897
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,963
Because there's no new footage
to be taped over it.

898
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:25,781
(Login ID, Password)

899
00:56:28,836 --> 00:56:30,154
(Record List)

900
00:56:30,234 --> 00:56:31,301
Eun Byeol!

901
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,529
Get it out!

902
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:35,981
I'll jump aside once it's out,
so get it out!

903
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,207
Free your hand first.

904
00:56:38,287 --> 00:56:39,594
Eun Byeol, wake up.

905
00:56:39,674 --> 00:56:41,886
No, Eun Byeol...

906
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:45,655
No!

907
00:56:51,972 --> 00:56:53,354
Let go.

908
00:57:22,586 --> 00:57:24,004
It was Cheon Seo Jin.

909
00:57:25,081 --> 00:57:26,619
She killed Yoon Hee.

910
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:27,843
She's crazy.

911
00:57:28,422 --> 00:57:29,639
She's crazy.

912
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:32,111
Why would she... Why?

913
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:37,519
She killed Yoon Hee...

914
00:57:38,353 --> 00:57:40,169
and wanted me gone too.

915
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:41,684
To take everything.

916
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:45,964
Do you think Dan Tae and Seo Jin
are working together?

917
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,016
No.

918
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,594
Dan Tae will think he killed Yoon Hee.

919
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,107
But that doesn't cancel out his crimes.

920
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:57,368
To put pressure on Yoo Dong Pil,

921
00:57:58,172 --> 00:58:00,059
he used Yoon Hee's corpse.

922
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:01,973
He killed her twice.

923
00:58:02,268 --> 00:58:04,526
Did Eun Byeol see all this?

924
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,121
Is that why she asked Jin Bun Hong
for the pills?

925
00:58:07,201 --> 00:58:08,456
Cheon Seo Jin...

926
00:58:09,562 --> 00:58:11,333
She got Eun Byeol in this mess.

927
00:58:12,315 --> 00:58:14,143
I will not forgive her.

928
00:58:14,594 --> 00:58:15,878
Never.

929
00:58:17,071 --> 00:58:18,387
They will see...

930
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:21,421
what torture is like.

931
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:37,990
Mr. Yoo, are you all right?

932
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:39,840
Don't mind me.

933
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:46,568
You know that Jenny's now
Cheong A Arts Center's...

934
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,096
Artist in Residence, right?

935
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:52,163
It would've been nice
if you'd attended the party.

936
00:58:52,243 --> 00:58:53,372
Why are you...

937
00:58:54,403 --> 00:58:57,049
always interfering and meddling?

938
00:58:57,129 --> 00:58:59,525
Jenny did really well that day.

939
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:05,244
Look. You wanted to see, didn't you?

940
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,047
She was dazzling at the audition.

941
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,724
(Official Video)

942
00:59:10,804 --> 00:59:14,008
Jenny always said she's like her dad.

943
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,475
That's why she's loyal and softhearted.

944
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:24,042
A daughter takes after her dad.
Would she take after a passing dog?

945
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:28,688
Jenny likes you a lot.

946
00:59:29,713 --> 00:59:32,589
She always looks at her photo with you
before bed.

947
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,271
She misses you.

948
00:59:35,453 --> 00:59:37,209
I don't know what's going on,

949
00:59:37,923 --> 00:59:40,865
but if you speak earnestly to her
and Ms. Kang,

950
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:42,380
won't they understand?

951
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,517
Tell me whatever you need. I'll help.

952
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:53,074
You shouldn't drink too much either.

953
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,465
You jerk.

954
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:12,421
Yoo Dong Pil.

955
01:00:13,513 --> 01:00:16,324
You are the biggest scumbag.

956
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:43,087
I don't deserve it,

957
01:00:44,138 --> 01:00:46,162
but I'm going to be your father for once.

958
01:00:46,717 --> 01:00:47,973
Just this once.

959
01:01:43,013 --> 01:01:45,321
Kang Ma Ri.

960
01:01:46,733 --> 01:01:48,291
What should I do first?

961
01:01:48,781 --> 01:01:50,383
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

962
01:01:50,848 --> 01:01:52,298
Then I'll gladly be punished.

963

(115 posts, 237 following, 98 followers)

965
01:02:11,344 --> 01:02:14,109
Mom, let's take a photo together.

966
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,246
Sure.

967
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:18,663
One, two, three.

968
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:27,562
No rabbit looks like that.

969
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,472
Isn't it adorable?

970
01:02:38,078 --> 01:02:39,507
It's cute.

971
01:02:52,877 --> 01:02:54,134
Where have you been?

972
01:02:55,753 --> 01:02:57,415
It's too early to be walking around.

973
01:02:57,825 --> 01:02:59,292
If Joo Dan Tae finds you...

974
01:02:59,372 --> 01:03:00,803
Can I ask you for a favour?

975
01:03:02,868 --> 01:03:03,899
I saved this money...

976
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,329
for Ro Na.

977
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:08,497
Please hand it to her for me.

978
01:03:12,765 --> 01:03:15,193
Why don't you do it yourself?
Even though you're late.

979
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,270
You can still be her father.

980
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:22,507
I heard from Yoon Hee.

981
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:24,998
I don't deserve to be a dad.

982
01:03:25,078 --> 01:03:26,674
Ro Na wouldn't want that either.

983
01:03:27,252 --> 01:03:28,346
However,

984
01:03:29,118 --> 01:03:31,578
I will spend the rest of my life
trying to destroy...

985
01:03:31,658 --> 01:03:33,306
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin
for Yoon Hee.

986
01:03:33,386 --> 01:03:35,217
I'll do whatever it takes.

987
01:03:35,852 --> 01:03:39,196
I will avenge Yoon Hee's death
with my own hands.

988
01:03:41,555 --> 01:03:43,283
At least Yoon Hee won't be lonely.

989
01:03:44,423 --> 01:03:49,073
You and I both want to pay her back
for what we owe her.

01:03:51,963 --> 01:03:55,085
If anything happens to me,

991
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,162
promise you'll take care of Ro Na.

992
01:03:58,173 --> 01:04:01,528
Stay by her side till the end.

Hello?

995
01:04:21,793 --> 01:04:23,373
Hello? Are you there?

996
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:29,102
Seok Kyung?

997
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:32,616
It's you, isn't it?

998
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:35,463
Where are you? I'll come.

999

-We should meet...
-I have something to tell you.

1000
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:40,697
Director Cheon Myung Soo...

1001
01:04:41,114 --> 01:04:42,933
didn't die of a heart attack.

1002
01:04:44,126 --> 01:04:45,456
Someone killed him.

1003
01:04:48,446 --> 01:04:49,709
It was Cheon Seo Jin.

1004
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:55,202
What are you saying all of a sudden?

1005
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:56,919
I saw her in the video.

1006
01:04:56,999 --> 01:04:58,743
Eun Byeol had it.

1007
01:04:58,823 --> 01:05:00,378
Eun Byeol is the witness.

1008
01:05:03,843 --> 01:05:07,513
I hope you succeed
in whatever it is you're trying to do.

1009
01:05:09,483 --> 01:05:12,089
Seok Kyung.

1010
01:05:31,603 --> 01:05:34,243
Eun Byeol, you'll come
to my inauguration party today, right?

1011
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:41,787
What are you doing?

1012
01:05:42,353 --> 01:05:44,104
Can't you see I'm eating?

1013
01:05:44,184 --> 01:05:46,741
I'm starving.
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

1014
01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:48,107
What are you talking about?

1015
01:05:48,187 --> 01:05:51,343
You just ate.
You ate a whole bowl of curry.

1016
01:05:53,313 --> 01:05:55,877
I did? When?

1017
01:06:01,983 --> 01:06:03,341
Eun Byeol!

1018
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:06,701
Get Eun Byeol out first!

1019
01:06:08,936 --> 01:06:10,042
Quickly!

1020
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:12,986
My leg!

1021
01:06:13,066 --> 01:06:15,462
I'll jump aside once it's out,
so get it out!

1022
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:17,072
Quickly! Cheon Seo Jin!

1023
01:06:17,152 --> 01:06:19,356
My leg!

1024

Eun Byeol!

1026
01:06:23,672 --> 01:06:25,784
Don't touch me!

1027
01:06:28,863 --> 01:06:31,453
What's wrong with you?
What are you saying?

1028
01:06:33,233 --> 01:06:35,208
What did I just say?

1029
01:06:36,523 --> 01:06:37,542
You don't remember?

1030
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:43,217
My head's been hurting lately.

1031
01:06:44,048 --> 01:06:46,847
Right, it's your inauguration today.

1032
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:48,354
Be pretty.

1033
01:06:48,891 --> 01:06:50,622
I should go get ready as well.

1034
01:06:56,993 --> 01:06:59,053
Eun Byeol, why this again?

1035
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:01,791
I thought you'd forgotten it all.

1036
01:07:05,863 --> 01:07:08,328
It's all because of the stress
from that audition.

1037
01:07:08,408 --> 01:07:09,778
Because of Bae Ro Na.

1038
01:07:12,243 --> 01:07:14,033
It's going to be fine, right?

1039
01:07:14,808 --> 01:07:15,981
Yes.

1040
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,573
Everything will be fine soon.

1041
01:07:19,624 --> 01:07:20,831
My Eun Byeol...

1042
01:07:22,253 --> 01:07:24,069
is meant to lead the Cheong A Foundation.

Thank you.

1046
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:14,695
Today, I was born again.

1047
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:17,657
When I stepped down
as the director of Cheong A Foundation,

1048
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:21,311
I thought I died.

1049
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:25,736
But you've brought me back to life.

1050
01:08:26,843 --> 01:08:29,472
I will think of the rest of my life
as something extra...

1051
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:32,502
and sacrifice myself for education.

1052
01:08:33,077 --> 01:08:36,514
From now on, Cheong A Foundation
will be even better than before...

1053
01:08:36,594 --> 01:08:39,857
and grow
into the best private foundation...

1054
01:08:39,937 --> 01:08:41,221
in all of Korea.

Thank you.

1059
01:09:05,123 --> 01:09:07,050
Why did you want to come here?

1060
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:09,450
We have nothing to do
with the Cheong A Foundation anymore.

1061

The kids have graduated.

1062
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:14,470
Has following me ever done you any harm?

1063
01:09:14,893 --> 01:09:16,050
No.

1064
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,892
Then just pay close attention.

1065
01:09:18,972 --> 01:09:21,418
Something fun is about to happen.

1066
01:09:22,721 --> 01:09:25,064

1151
01:15:11,816 --> 01:15:13,588
How dare you mess with me?

1152
01:15:13,668 --> 01:15:15,423
Look who's talking.

1153
01:15:16,997 --> 01:15:19,592
Didn't we agree to bury that for good?

1154
01:15:19,672 --> 01:15:21,161
After asking me to get rid of Baek Jun Ki,

1155
01:15:21,241 --> 01:15:22,748
how could you stab me in the back
like this?

1156
01:15:22,828 --> 01:15:26,625
Ruining my ceremony would harm
Cheong A Group too. Don't you know that?

1157
01:15:26,705 --> 01:15:28,320
That's nonsense!

1158
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,851
Why are you digging up the past then?

1159
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:33,275
Do you have proof that I killed my father?

1160
01:15:35,669 --> 01:15:36,947
Get off me!

1161
01:15:39,276 --> 01:15:40,922
Let go!

1162
01:15:54,677 --> 01:15:55,947
Get off me!

1163
01:16:38,133 --> 01:16:41,218
=The Penthouse 3=

1164
01:16:41,298 --> 01:16:44,663
We're all here
to punish Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

1165
01:16:44,743 --> 01:16:46,734
-Wanted?
-You have three days.

1166
01:16:46,814 --> 01:16:48,243
-It's Baek Jun Ki.
-I'm going to die?

1167
01:16:48,323 --> 01:16:49,685
Are you scared? That mean witch.

1168
01:16:49,765 --> 01:16:51,920
-What brings you here?
-I want to take you somewhere.

1169
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,744
My sweet girl. I miss you.

1170
01:16:53,824 --> 01:16:55,481
-It's 500 million dollars.
-Five hundred million dollars?

1171
01:16:55,561 --> 01:16:56,712
I'm not going!

1172
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:57,792
The fight is on.

1173
01:16:57,872 --> 01:17:00,105
I trust neither the police nor the court.

1174
01:17:00,185 --> 01:17:01,830
I'll punish them myself.
