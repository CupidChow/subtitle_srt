Previously on The Penthouse 3.

4
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:15,702
Don't act like you know me.

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,469
I don't want to see you again!

6
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,225
If anything happens to me,

7
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:21,154
promise you'll take care of Ro Na.

8
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:23,365
He'll rot there for the rest of his life.

9
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:24,983
Mr. Baek Jun Ki?

10
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:26,629
Baek... Baek Jun Ki?

11
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,893
Logan is alive. Mom's just fine too.

12
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:31,189
I can't let it end like this.

13
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,644
I want to go back!

14
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:37,736
Why is this so special
that everyone's fighting to keep this?

15
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:41,244
So that there's no more fighting,
we must end this place too.

16
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:43,695
I'll erase all your bad memories, Mom.

17
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,593
The two must experience
what living in torment is like.

18
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:48,308
I'm here for the money
he borrowed from us.

19
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:50,381
I'm the chairwoman of Cheong A Group!

20
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,376
Did you know that
Cheong A Constructions...

21
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:53,683
filed for bankruptcy?

22
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:54,966
Ms. Cheon!

23
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:56,284
Where should I take you?

24
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:59,315
Hera Palace.

25
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:01,254
Take me to Hera Palace in Samseong-dong.

Eun Byeol.

There you are.

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,683
I've been looking everywhere for you.

34
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:28,881
Ms. Cheon.

35
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:30,151
We have no time to lose.

36
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,438
It's my inauguration ceremony today.

37
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:33,662
Our outfits are ready.

38
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:35,577
Come. We'll be late.

39
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:39,367
Ms. Cheon, let go of me.
I'm not Eun Byeol.

40
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:42,500
Why won't you listen to me? Do as I say!

41
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:45,105
You're my daughter.
You must attend the ceremony.

42
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:48,058
Everything I have will be yours. Come now.

43
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:49,688
Come! Hurry!

44
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:51,700
Listen to me!

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,152
-Ms. Cheon, why are you...
-Come!

46
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:55,633
-Come, Eun Byeol.
-I'm not Eun Byeol.

47
00:01:55,713 --> 00:01:57,697
Hurry. Come.

48
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:01,522
Stop it, Seo Jin.

49
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:03,206
Why are you here?

50
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:04,909
Are you here to take Eun Byeol
away from me?

51
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:07,578
You can't! I'll never let that happen!

52
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,038
What are you doing?
She's not your daughter!

53
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:14,184
Yes, she is! You can't take her away!

54
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,324
Eun Byeol, come to your mom.

55
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,733
Ro Na, run, now!

56
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:21,514
No! Eun Byeol!

57
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:23,544
-Get it together, Seo Jin!
-Eun Byeol!

58
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:26,697
Ro Na, are you okay?

59
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:29,428
Are you out of your mind?
Where are you taking her?

60
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:31,134
She's my daughter!

61
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:32,706
Ro Na!

62
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,380
Mr. Ha, are you okay?

63
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:42,086
Eun Byeol!

64
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,819
We don't have time for this.
Come with me now.

65
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,405
Why are you so stubborn?

66
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:48,962
-Eun Byeol!
-Ms. Cheon.

67
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,382
Come with me.

68
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,142
Eun Byeol!

69
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,851
What happened here?

70
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:37,093
What a mess.

71
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:45,459
Ro Na! Dr. Ha!

72
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:48,121
Oh, my. Excuse me!

73
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:50,713
We need help! Quickly!

74
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,588
Hello? Some people got badly injured.

75
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,453
At the community room in Hera Palace.

76
00:03:57,732 --> 00:04:00,453
Please come over right now.

77
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,759
I did it all by myself.

78
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:20,951
I don't have a family.

79
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,258
My mom is dead,

80
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,920
and it's been a while
since I cut ties with my brother.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,689
So just send me to prison.

82
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:30,155
Seok Kyung.

83
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:39,664
Why did you call them?

84
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:42,673
I have nothing to do with them.
I don't know them.

85
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:45,483
I'm Seok Kyung's mom.

86
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:48,458
Mom? She's not my mom.

87
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,529
I'm not your daughter. We're strangers.

88
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:51,909
Give it a rest.

89
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:55,030
What is Seok Kyung doing here?

90
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,898
Your daughter
helped the fugitive Joo Dan Tae...

91
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:59,498
flee to Japan.

92
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,678
She even took the boat with him...

93
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:04,270
and went to Japan. We've confirmed that.

94
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,728
Now, why don't you tell us the truth?

95
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:11,847
Were you really acting alone?

96
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:14,917
Where did you get the money
to help him flee?

97
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,280
I have a lot of money.

98
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:20,769
My real mom left me
quite a big inheritance.

99
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,289
This lady and my dad
got divorced years ago,

100
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:24,907
and I lived with my dad.

101
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:27,688
He kept begging me, so I had to help him.

102
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:30,232
Is it a crime for a daughter
to help her dad?

103
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:33,494
So, where in Japan did you send him?

104
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,004
I don't know.

105
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,803
I split after I saw him arrive in Japan.

106
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:40,097
Stop lying.

107
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:44,048
If you won't even believe me,
why do you bother asking?

108
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:50,206
If you want to investigate properly,
get rid of these people first.

109
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:52,560
Otherwise, I won't say a peep.

110
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:54,867
Do you think this is a game?

111
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:57,337
So just lock me up!

112
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,122
I helped my dad run away.

113
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:03,360
Why are you bringing in people
who have nothing to do with it...

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,619
and humiliating me?

115
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,975
It's a mental hospital in Fukuoka.

116
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,930
I'm sure he's there.

117
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:18,328
Ask Interpol for cooperation
and send Joo Dan Tae's description.

118
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:19,593
Yes, sir.

119
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:22,742
We may have more questions for you
at a later time.

120
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:23,906
I understand.

121
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:26,491
-Get ready to travel.
-Yes, sir.

122
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,127
-Get off.
-Where are you going now?

123
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:33,740
Does running away like a child
solve everything?

124
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,713
I said I'll take responsibility.

125
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:39,128
I said I'll go to jail for it.
Why is everyone stopping me?

126
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,621
How did you know?

127
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:43,314
How did you know to go to Busan Port?

128
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:45,801
I heard Seok Hoon
talk on the phone with you.

129
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:47,734
Are you saying you followed Mom?

130
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,858
Why did you go to Japan? Have you no fear?

131
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:51,777
I wanted to see it for myself.

132
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:53,842
I wanted to see Dad's demise.

133
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,771
The mental hospital
was nicer than I expected.

134
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,614
I'll never see him again.

135
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,610
It was only right that I saw him off.

136
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,981
Don't worry about me.
I'm legally his daughter,

137
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:07,769
so they can't punish me
for helping him flee.

138
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:10,596
How could you go somewhere
so dangerous alone?

139
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:13,730
Do you know how worried we were
when you disappeared?

140
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,756
Why were you worried
about a spoiled brat like me?

141
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:20,052
You know I'll survive no matter what
because I take after Dad.

142
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:21,564
Must you talk like that?

143
00:07:21,644 --> 00:07:23,934
I can't help it. This is who I am.

144
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,338
Have you eaten?

145
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,185
Let's go eat.

146
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,205
You've lost weight.

147
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:45,477
Just eat.

148
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:49,558
You need your energy
to fight with me or hate me.

149
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:50,691
Here.

150
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:55,196
You want me to eat and get lost, right?

151
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:58,106
Fine. I'll eat then.

152
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:10,005
You were my daughter from the start.

153
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,583
There wasn't a moment
when you and Seok Hoon weren't my kids.

154
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,637
It wasn't your fault
that you grew up under Dan Tae,

155
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:20,551
unaware of anything.

156
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:23,605
No. It was my fault.

157
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,190
Seol A almost died because of me.

158
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:31,752
I was the one who set the van on fire.

159
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,787
I was the one
who locked her in there and ran.

160
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,821
It's my fault that Ro Na's mom died too.

161
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:42,373
Someone like me isn't worthy
of being your daughter.

162
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,771
I hate myself so much,
it's driving me crazy.

163
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:48,767
How could I insist
that I'm your daughter now?

164
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,818
So? Will you run away again?

165
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,322
Will you keep running away
without repenting?

166
00:08:57,714 --> 00:08:59,527
You did it.

167
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:02,369
It may hurt, but face it. Don't avoid it.

168
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:04,125
That way, there will be a way back.

169
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,486
My daughter grew up a lot
while I was away.

170
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:23,744
Let's go home. I
fixed up your room nicely.

171
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,864
I was wrong.

172
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,639
I'm sorry, Mom.

173
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,102
I was so wrong.

174
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,987
I've missed you so much.

175
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,528
I missed you so much,
I thought I was going to die.

176
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,700
(Jenny's mother)

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,181
Hello?

178
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:03,866
Why won't your mom pick up?

179
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:06,742
It's terrible.
There was an accident at Hera Palace.

180
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,865
What do you mean,

181
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,667
there was an accident?

182
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:19,092
-How are the vitals?
-They're weak.

183
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:21,201
We'll begin. Forceps.

184
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:22,507
The BP is dropping.

185
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:24,882
-It's dangerous.
-We'll start right away.

186
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,017
-Hi.
-What happened?

187
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,905
My gosh. Dr. Ha was badly injured.

188
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:44,424
It was that witch Seo Jin's fault.

189
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:47,695
His head is bleeding badly.
He's in surgery now.

190
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,226
Why was Seo Jin at Hera Palace?

191
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:53,980
My point exactly.
I think she has completely snapped.

192
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,980
She was calling Ro Na "Eun Byeol"
and said she'd take her.

193
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,153
She caused a big scene,
which resulted in this mess.

194
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:01,674
How's Ro Na?

195
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,621
Thankfully, she wasn't injured.

196
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:05,948
Where's Seo Jin?

197
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,367
Let go. I have to go see my mom.

198
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:19,339
She's out of surgery
and is in recovery now.

199
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:23,879
The chandelier fell from the ceiling
but she lucked out and survived.

200
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,578
Your mom is just incredible.

201
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:28,834
She's putting on an act...

202
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:31,329
because the company went under
and she's cornered, isn't she?

203
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:32,824
She's faking being crazy.

204
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,853
-What?
-Even still.

205
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,696
Mistaking Ro Na for her daughter?
That was a bit much.

206
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:39,381
How could she make a mistake like that?

207
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:43,605
Or did something really happen
to her brain?

208
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:46,770
Shut it! What do you know?

209
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:56,017
Wake up, Seo Jin. Wake up right now.

210
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:58,180
You can't fool me.

211
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,427
Wake up!

212
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:01,947
What are you doing?

213
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:04,590
My mom is sick right now.

214
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:07,230
Your mom is putting on an act.

215
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,884
She's about to lose everything,
so she's pretending to be crazy.

216
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:15,573
Hey! Ms. Shim!

217
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:19,443
That's so cold.

218
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:21,571
Drop the act.

219
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:24,339
Do you think this will let you
avoid being investigated?

220
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,688
Being mentally unstable won't work.

221
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,062
I said to stop!

222
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:32,143
My mom really is sick.
Don't you see she's hurt?

223
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:34,747
I won't let anyone mistreat my mom.

224
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:38,262
I'm her guardian from now on.
Get out of here right now!

225
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,103
Get rid of this woman.

226
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:45,093
And don't let anyone
come into this room. No one!

227
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:46,434
You need to go.

228
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:47,844
Let go of me!

229
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,556
I'll walk out on my own.

230
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:53,431
Don't think it's over, Seo Jin.

231
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,372
I'll follow you to the ends of the earth
and destroy you.

232
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,838
Mom. Are you okay?

233
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,001
What happened to you?

234
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:12,042
Who are you?

235
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,174
Mom.

236
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:17,623
Do you know me?

237
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,009
Where am I?

238
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:26,554
-Mom.
-What is this?

239
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:28,149
Why are you doing this?

240
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:29,503
Mom!

241
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,091
Snap out of it, Mom. Stop playing with me.

242
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:35,374
Mom, stop it.

243
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:38,473
Mom...

244
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,931
-Who are you people?
-Move!

245
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,079
Cheon Seo Jin!

246
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:55,732
No!

247
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:58,382
-Stop it!
-Drop the act.

248
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,101
-No!
-Get away!

249
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:03,116
-Those of you outside, get in here!
-No! Stop it! Mom!

250
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,499
-Stop doing that to my mom!
-Get away.

251
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:08,824
-Get away!
-Drag her out here!

252
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:11,635
-No! Get away!
-Hey.

253
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:14,368
-Get back!
-Get her!

254
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:22,585
His vitals are dropping.

255
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:24,368
Give him more morphine and get more blood.

256
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,404
Yes, doctor.

257
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,217
Thank goodness you weren't hurt more.

258
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:34,610
How is Mr. Ha doing?

259
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,361
He's in surgery.

260
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,425
He'll be okay, right?

261
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:42,653
He has to be okay.

262
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,049
Of course.

263
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:47,123
He'll get through the surgery and wake up.

264
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,357
Don't worry.

265
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:51,641
He got hurt instead of me.

266
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:55,153
Trying to save me.

267
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:58,894
What should I do?

268
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:08,753
If something were to happen to him,
I won't be able to stand it.

269
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,673
I can't lose both Mom and him too.

270
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,160
I'd feel too guilty.

271
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,813
That won't happen.

272
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:18,702
Dr. Ha's a strong person.

273
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:20,815
He'll get through this.

274
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,530
(Intensive Care)

275
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,958
I think she's temporarily confused
due to the accident.

276
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,159
They'll run some in-depth tests tomorrow.

277
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,168
What about my dad? Is he in bad shape?

278
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:51,674
The surgery's taking longer than expected.

279
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:54,815
He was hurt badly in the head.
We'll hear more after the surgery.

280
00:15:56,107 --> 00:15:57,192
It was my fault.

281
00:15:57,646 --> 00:16:00,776
Both Mom and Dad, everything.

282
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,942
It was my fault.

283
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:09,594
How long will you stay here for?

284
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:12,193
Can you do this to someone
who just got out of surgery?

285
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:15,121
Why? Are you hungry?

286
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:16,855
Come here.

287
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,184
You can join us for some Chinese.

288
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:21,818
What you're doing
is called illegal collecting.

289
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,630
If I call the police,
they will take you all in!

290
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:29,186
Call the police, then.

291
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,177
Don't touch the girl.

292
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,151
Why come to us about Chairman Joo's debt?

293
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,284
Why is it us
when he has two legitimate kids?

294
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:41,324
Cheon Seo Jin's his wife.

295
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:44,339
Who told her to be his guarantor?

296
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:48,069
Where's Joo Dan Tae?
Where are you hiding him?

297
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:50,801
You little punk.

298
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:53,504
No, don't.

299
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,591
Unless Joo Dan Tae dies,

300
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:03,987
Cheon Seo Jin or her daughter...

301
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:07,496
will have to pay us back
until the day they die.

302
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:08,631
Okay?

303
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:14,796
You can't get away from us.

304
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:18,754
So go and find Joo Dan Tae!

305
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:19,978
Don't!

306
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:21,150
Move!

307
00:17:22,678 --> 00:17:23,958
Stop it!

308
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,747
Where's Joo Dan Tae?

309
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,838
Where is he, punk?

310
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:30,223
You have a pretty face.

311
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:32,396
You could be worth a lot.

312
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:35,777
Where do you want to go?

313
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:37,908
Where is he?

314
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:42,543
-My ear!
-Get her off him.

315
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:45,501
Grab her!

316
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,311
Hey!

317
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:48,774
Maybe she's not crazy.

318
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:53,813
Will you all just get out?

319
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:55,706
Get out! Get out of here!

320
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:57,123
-Leave!
-Where's our money?

321
00:17:57,203 --> 00:17:59,200
I'll call the police!

322
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,936
-Get out!
-Stop it!

323
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:02,277
Get out!

324
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:04,431
Get out! Leave!

325
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:07,926
Cheon Seo Jin!
I'll be back for my money, okay?

326
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:11,590
It's okay, Mom.

327
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:16,955
Mom!

328
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:19,657
It's okay. Don't worry.

329
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:33,765
Mr. Baek, it's time
for your psychological treatment.

330
00:18:58,808 --> 00:18:59,984
Get him!

331
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,216
Get off me!

332
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:31,477
Let go of me.

333
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:32,561
Let go!

334
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:14,911
Find him. Where did he go?

335
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:39,031
Shim Su Ryeon, Logan Lee.
This time, I'll kill you for real.

336
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,045
Eat up, even if you don't want to.

337
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,634
Don't you lift a finger for a while.

338
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:48,039
I'll do everything for you.

339
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,265
Drink some water.
Slow down or you'll get sick.

340
00:20:50,345 --> 00:20:51,875
I'm not a patient.

341
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:53,697
How are you not a patient?

342
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,468
You fell down a staircase.

343
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,266
There's no medicine for shock,
and I'm so worried.

344
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:04,994
I got your medicine.

345
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:07,917
What are you doing here?
You're not welcome.

346
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:09,668
Ro Na's suffering already.

347
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:12,903
Do you hope to be let off
by bringing her medicine?

348
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:15,118
Does that cancel out all you did?

349
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:16,350
Did I say that?

350
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:19,763
Neither you nor Ro Na
will accept my apology.

351
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:22,232
You hate me and won't forgive me.
I know that.

352
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:23,747
Then why bother coming here?

353
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:26,063
Did you come to stare at a sick person?

354
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:28,822
We don't need your apology, so get lost.

355
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:31,973
You evil brat.

356
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:34,480
Do it anyway.

357
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:41,800
Whether I accept it or not is up to me.

358
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:45,179
You should apologize. Until I accept it.

359
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:47,575
Apologize and ask for forgiveness.

360
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:52,354
Look back and think about
what you did to my mom and me.

361
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,153
Think about what happens next after that.

362
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,561
Let's go.

363
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:18,636
Hello? Will you let me out?

364
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:23,284
You murderer.

365
00:22:23,364 --> 00:22:25,566
How dare you come here so shamelessly?

366
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:28,543
-Joo Seok Kyung!
-I don't believe you're not guilty.

367
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:30,311
You killed my mom.

368
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,881
(Go away, murderer.)

369
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:39,319
Get rid of a mud-fish for me.

370
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,280
(Cheong A Group)

371
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,671
Do whatever it takes
to make Ro Na ruin her exam.

372
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:47,054
Don't worry. Dad will sort it out for you.

373
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:52,913
-Ms. Kang.
-Yes?

374
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:55,132
Can you take me to the hospital?

375
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:56,949
What for? Do you feel unwell?

376
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:58,834
I want to visit Dr. Ha.

377
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:01,429
I'll visit him every day.

378
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,558
What's the point in doing that
when he's not awake yet?

379
00:23:04,638 --> 00:23:06,224
You're not well yourself.

380
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:10,005
Just in case. He might be able to hear.

381
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,582
If I do something,
it might help him wake up sooner.

382
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:16,544
Yes. You're right.

383
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:17,933
Okay.

384
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:20,205
Watch your step. Take your time.

385
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:33,808
-Jenny, let's go.
-Okay.

386
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,583
-Walk slowly.
-Carefully.

387
00:23:38,536 --> 00:23:40,114
Let's go.

388
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:55,256
The brain damage is worse than I thought.

389
00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:58,670
It was a dangerous spot,
so I couldn't do anything.

390
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:02,465
Is it possible that he won't wake up?

391
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:03,922
We must...

392
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,217
wait and see to find out.

393
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:17,191
After what she did to Dr. Ha,

394
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:19,773
Cheon Seo Jin asked for police protection.

395
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:25,954
The loan sharks were thrown out
of the hospital this morning.

396
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,663
She's being protected
when she should be punished.

397
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:31,491
It makes no sense.

398
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,845
Let's just release the last part
of the dash-cam footage.

399
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,689
I won't make the same mistake twice.

400
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:41,496
Cheon Seo Jin
will use her weak condition...

401
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:43,551
to get away with her crime again.

402
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:46,814
I will send her to the fiery pit
with my own hands.

403
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:49,254
We have a problem.

404
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:52,504
Joo Dan Tae escaped
from the Japanese mental hospital.

405
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:53,683
What?

406
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,280
Okay.

407
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:03,753
What a persistent guy.

408
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,907
I gave him one last chance
to repent until he dies,

409
00:25:06,987 --> 00:25:08,372
and even that he lets go.

410
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:12,213
Joo Dan Tae will come back to Korea.

411
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,595
Then you may be put in danger.

412
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:17,036
That's something I must face.

413
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:19,969
If this game can end...

414
00:25:20,277 --> 00:25:22,390
only when one of us dies,

415
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:24,387
I won't hide.

416
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,827
Since he has no money and no passport,

417
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:29,277
it will be hard for him
to return to Korea all by himself.

418
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:32,033
Who do you think he'll call first?

419
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:44,829
Son.

420
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:46,791
Are you okay?

421
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,093
Where are you?

422
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:52,497
Do you have any idea
how worried we've been?

423
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:54,921
Shim Su Ryeon locked me up
in a mental hospital.

424
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:57,287
I barely escaped.

425
00:25:58,111 --> 00:25:59,239
Mom did?

426
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:02,566
No way.

427
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,516
Are you hurt?

428
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:08,761
You didn't hear anything from your mom?

429
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:10,559
I heard Logan came back to life.

430
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:14,008
Do you really have no idea
what those two scumbags...

431
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:15,240
are planning?

432
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,972
It's been a while since they met.

433
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:23,756
Mom is planning
on going back to the US with Logan.

434
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:25,130
Darn it!

435
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,562
She does this to me,
and then she wants to be happy on her own?

436
00:26:30,516 --> 00:26:33,080
Seok Hoon, help me out.

437
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:37,231
I never killed Ro Na's mom.

438
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:41,104
I saw with my own eyes, Cheon Seo Jin
pushing the car off the cliff.

439
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:43,196
I'm innocent.

440
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:47,707
Unless you want to be the son
of a murderer, you have to help me out.

441
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,694
I can only make things right
if I make it back.

442
00:26:51,774 --> 00:26:54,612
Seok Hoon, you have to trust me.

443
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,585
How can I help?

444
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:00,186
Help me get back to Korea.

445
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:02,598
I must get back to Hera Palace.

446
00:27:02,678 --> 00:27:04,205
Even if I die, I'll die there.

447
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:06,486
In the castle I built with my own hands.

448
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:10,485
You're the only one
I can ask for a favour.

449
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,493
I have a friend in Fukuoka.

450
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:14,480
I'll call him.

451
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,858
Go to Hakata now.

452
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:19,376
I'll prepare the money
and fake passport as well.

453
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,195
Thank you, Seok Hoon. Really.

454
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,204
Come back safe first. Then we can think
about what to do next.

455
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,060
I'll find a ship that leaves the earliest.

456
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:32,192
See you tomorrow at dawn at Busan Port.

457
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:35,646
Seok Hoon. I can...

458
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:38,394
trust you, right?

459
00:27:39,718 --> 00:27:40,991
Of course.

460
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:43,512
I'm your only son.

461
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:47,047
Okay. Understood.

462
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:58,800
You were exactly right.

463
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:05,755
I'm sorry
to ask you to do this, Seok Hoon.

464
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:10,696
I gave up on him a long time ago.

465
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:13,054
I feel no compassion or remorse.

466
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:14,675
If I could,

467
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:18,015
I want to end him with my hands.

468
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:22,765
You stay here. Let me do the rest.

469
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:24,396
No. I'm coming.

470
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:27,941
Dad will find out soon enough,

471
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:31,106
what it's like
to be abandoned by your child.

472
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:36,483
As Joo Dan Tae escaped, the
coastal security has been strengthened.

473
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:38,749
Police officers
will be surrounding Busan Port.

474
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:41,103
We can't let the police take Joo Dan Tae.

475
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:43,173
We have to catch him first.

476
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,118
We must hurry
if we want to make it to Busan Port.

477
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,900
(Ye Ji)

478
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,137
Hey!

479
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,431
Search the area. Now!

480
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,766
Joo Dan Tae must have known.

481
00:30:30,846 --> 00:30:32,252
What a rat.

482
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:57,129
Joo Seok Hoon.

483
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,729
I knew I couldn't trust you.

484
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,407
You betray me
and team up with Shim Su Ryeon?

485
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:44,263
I think he already escaped Busan Port.

486
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:46,094
He got on a fishing boat, that's for sure.

487
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:48,594
I checked the picture of him on that boat.

488
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,495
He must have escaped
before the smuggling ship got here.

489
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:55,199
It did cross my mind,
but I didn't know he would doubt you too.

490
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:58,868
Seok Hoon was just a way for him
to come back to Korea.

491
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:01,158
If we just wait,
he's probably going to get back at us.

492
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:02,266
He'll try to use...

493
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:04,539
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung
when he's in danger.

494
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,674
The kids shouldn't get hurt.

495
00:32:07,444 --> 00:32:10,106
He's a master of crime and disguise.

496
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:13,252
If he really tries to hide,
there is no way of finding him.

497
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,236
The police also have no idea where he is.

498
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:17,495
He said that
he must come back to Hera Palace.

499
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:19,562
That even if he dies, he'd die there.

500
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,837
So he really wants
to make Hera Palace his grave?

501
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,151
Then there's only one thing
that we can do.

502
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:31,465
What is it?

503
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,348
Set a trap.

504
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,282
So that he can't hide anywhere
on this planet.

505
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:39,134
So that he'll walk into his own grave.

506
00:32:39,784 --> 00:32:41,262
Let the world know...

507
00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:44,887
exactly how ugly
and vicious this man Joo Dan Tae is.

508
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,351
This is breaking news.

509
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:51,702
We are met with shock...

510
00:32:51,782 --> 00:32:54,951
as the past crimes of Joo Dan Tae,
the CEO who killed Oh Yoon Hee,

511
00:32:55,031 --> 00:32:56,599
continues to be revealed one by one.

512
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:59,545
Do you remember the gruesome shooting...

513
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:02,216
that killed the genius pianist
based out of New York?

514
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:05,021
Would you believe it if we said...

515
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:08,101
that the murder was meticulously planned
by a psychopath...

516
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:09,824
just so he could marry a woman?

517
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,749
As the murderer behind a 20-year-old case
that almost went cold...

518
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:15,557
has been brought to the surface,

519
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:18,539
the man is now wanted nationwide.

520
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:20,622
Please take a good look at his face.

521
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:24,125
Joo Dan Tae. His real name is Baek Jun Ki.

522
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:27,237
The Korean-American
real estate investor James Lee...

523
00:33:27,317 --> 00:33:30,432
said today that he would reward anyone
who reported the runaway...

524
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:32,713
with two million dollars.

525
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:35,422
-What a...
-That's the highest amount ever.

526
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:37,528
Joo Dan Tae allegedly
blew up the car of...

527
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:39,567
-Darn it.
-the CEO of Logan Lee Corporation.

528
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:42,184
He is also suspected
to have been involved...

529
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:43,730
in the Osaka family murder...

530
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,393
that shocked the Korean-Japanese community
27 years ago.

531
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:48,351
Chairman Joo Dan Tae...

532
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:51,730
Please open the door.
I'm from the front desk.

533
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:53,490
Darn it.

534
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,032
Did you say you needed a toothbrush?

535
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
(Chairman Joo
Turns Out To Be Two-faced Psychopath)

536
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,436
Darn it.

537
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:08,412
It's Joo Dan Tae!

538
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,335
Joo Dan Tae...

539
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:13,094
Hello? Police?

540
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:14,877
Joo Dan Tae just ran away from here.

541
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:16,246
(Busan Lucky Motel)

542
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:18,788
This afternoon, at a motel in Busan,

543
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:21,766
the police lifted fingerprints
of Chairman Joo, who is on the run.

544
00:34:21,846 --> 00:34:25,088
It's become clear that
he has smuggled himself back into Korea.

545
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:27,961
-Joo Dan Tae is such a jerk.
-The search is still going on.

546
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,710
(I'm hungry. Please help me.)

547
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:51,592
(One pack of gum for 20 cents)

548
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,589
(Help me. My little sister is starving.)

549
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:56,594
-Hi, have you been waiting long?
-Not at all.

550
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:58,568
Oh, my.

551
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:02,138
A pack of gum, sir?

552
00:35:02,218 --> 00:35:03,584
Hey, go away!

553
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:05,916
My goodness.

554
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:08,874
What an annoying boy.

555
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:10,825
A pack of gum?

556
00:35:10,905 --> 00:35:12,463
I said, go away!

557
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,793
I can't believe this.

558
00:35:25,604 --> 00:35:27,443
-Let go!
-What are you doing?

559
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:29,680
-Please!
-Take him away.

560
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,226
-You little brat.
-My gosh.

561
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,009
-Where's the money?
-I don't have any.

562
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:38,664
-Is it here?
-No, it isn't.

563
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,543
-There it is.
-No! Give it back!

564
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:44,669
Why did you lie?

565
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,959
Give it back! It's my money!

566
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,479
Have you seen this man?
He has a burn on his face.

567
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,819
I don't think so.

568
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,860
-Excuse me?
-Go away!

569
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:29,251
Calm down! Stay still!

570
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,163
Isn't he the man from the news?

571
00:36:36,243 --> 00:36:38,215
Hurry up and catch him!

572
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:54,755
I can't let it end like this.

573
00:36:55,832 --> 00:36:57,820
I'll survive no matter what.

574
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,829
I'm never going back to my begging days.

575
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:13,426
I won't die on the street, never.

576
00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:25,374
The penthouse is mine.

577
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,493
I'm...

578
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:33,444
going back there no matter what.

579
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:45,391
Please wake up.

580
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:47,809
If you leave me like this,

581
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:50,337
I'll never forgive you.

582
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,543
Dad.

583
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,270
(Dongbu Police Station)

584
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,693
My goodness.
Because I chose the wrong man,

585
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:46,284
I've been bullied
by my in-laws all my life,

586
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:49,724
and now I'm going in and out of prison.

587
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:51,286
Look who's talking.

588
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:54,918
I, Lee Kyu Jin, was born
to a prestigious family of lawyers...

589
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:58,320
and used to live in luxury at Hera Palace.

590
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:00,881
And look what happened to me now.

591
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:04,146
In luxury, my foot.
You were just Chairman Joo's minion.

592
00:39:04,226 --> 00:39:07,159
A minion? Hey, how could you say that?

593
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,862
What? Deny it if you can!

594
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:11,333
You're not smart like Dr. Ha...

595
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:13,401
or strong like Mr. Yoo.

596
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:15,268
You're a mama's boy all the way.

597
00:39:15,348 --> 00:39:17,927
I should never have married...

598
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,423
a rough woman like you!

599
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:23,543
My goodness. This is why
you should never marry a spoiled brat.

600
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:25,780
I'd rather keep a dog!

601
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,995
A dog? A spoiled brat?

602
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,996
-Are you serious?
-What?

603
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,122
Look at you two.

604
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:35,540
You're obviously
having a lot of fun in here.

605
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,627
Ma Ri, what brings you here?

606
00:39:39,512 --> 00:39:42,348
Are you here to help us?

607
00:39:42,428 --> 00:39:43,676
Why would I?

608
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,677
You two got in trouble while on probation.

609
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:47,522
How could I possibly help you?

610
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,624
I brought a message from Min Hyuk.

611
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,925

615
00:40:06,357 --> 00:40:08,223
"because both of you are so bad."

"But right now..."

617
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:12,780
I hate myself more than anyone else.

618
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:15,463
I want to be reborn.

619
00:40:16,054 --> 00:40:17,553
I want to become a real man.

Wait a second.
Min Hyuk is joining the military?

623
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:28,984
Min Hyuk! No!

624
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:31,433
How are you going to survive
in the military?

625
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:34,042
This is too much!

626
00:40:34,122 --> 00:40:36,884
By the way, Kyu Jin,
Su Ryeon bought your apartment.

627
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:41,618
-What?
-Su Ryeon is planning a business.

628
00:40:41,698 --> 00:40:44,697
She's buying an apartment on every floor.

629
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:46,924
I heard she paid the market price.

630
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:48,399
I see. Good.

631
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,065
Did you put our apartment up for sale
behind my back?

632
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:52,701
To take all the money?

633
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:57,058
You pocketed 500 million dollars.
Are you in the position to say that?

634
00:40:57,138 --> 00:41:00,603
You punk! You're a thief!
I want a divorce!

635
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:04,716
What did you just say?
What does that make my mom?

636
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,529
I'll tell her everything!

637
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:09,846
-I want a divorce too!
-I don't need this ring anymore!

638
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:13,185
It's good that
their son is joining the military.

639
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:15,658
-Please take care of them.
-What did you just say?

640
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:17,384
-Take it back!
-I can't!

641
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,517
Mom, here.

642
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,434
Mom.

643
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,911
Where's my daughter?

644
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,817
Who are you?

645
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,646
Bring my daughter to me!
Bring her right now!

646
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,537
Your daughter is here.

647
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:41,017
I'm Eun Byeol. Don't you remember me?

648
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:43,548
Is my husband here yet?

649
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,833
He's a neurosurgeon
at Cheong A Medical Center.

650
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:53,038
He's been quite busy lately.

651
00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:56,565
But if he knew I'm unwell,
he'd hurry over and look after me.

652
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,888
I'll tell Dad to come over right now.

653
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:01,264
Who's your dad?

654
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,232
Who's your dad? Who do you think you are?

655
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:08,210
According to the test results,
she's in the late stage of Alzheimer's.

656
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,897
-Her environment changed suddenly.
-You need to eat.

657
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:14,377
The shock from it
seems to have caused her condition.

658
00:42:14,457 --> 00:42:15,644
I'll try calling him.

659
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:17,407
Can I have a look at her chart?

660
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:19,493
Mom, look at me.

661
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:23,455
Her hippo-campus has shrunk drastically.

662
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:27,030
Where am I?

663
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:28,981
Where am I?

664
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,705
Where am I?

665
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:34,051
Given her condition,
it will be impossible to interrogate her.

666
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:36,722
-Can I get a doctor's note?
-You don't have to eat.

667
00:42:36,802 --> 00:42:38,964
-I'll call a nurse.
-Sure.

668
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:42,226
Mom, look at me.

669
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:46,047
I booked flights for you.

670
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:48,478
An acceptance letter arrived
from the Juilliard School too.

671
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:51,020
Forget everything
and focus on your studies now.

672
00:42:54,122 --> 00:42:55,475
I leave in two weeks?

673
00:42:55,555 --> 00:42:58,807
It's a boarding school,
so there isn't much to prepare.

674
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:02,485
Leave early so you can learn the language
and adapt yourself.

675
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,293
I'll dispose of your apartment.

676
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,005
I want to wait until Mr. Ha wakes up.

677
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,178
Once I know he's fine, I'll do as you say.

678
00:43:14,552 --> 00:43:16,132
It might take...

679
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:21,365
much longer for Dr. Ha
to wake up than we expect.

680
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:23,832
I'll let you know as soon as he does.

681
00:43:24,194 --> 00:43:27,835
So don't worry about us and just leave.

682
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,032
There's a time for everything,
be it singing or studying.

683
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,029
Hye In will pick you up at the airport.

684
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,466
Please...

685
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,521
look after Mr. Ha.

686
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,288
What happened with what I asked?

687
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,678
I just do what you tell me to.

688
00:44:13,758 --> 00:44:16,898
I purchased five units today too.

689
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:19,922
Here.

690

(Property Sale Agreement)

691
00:44:23,743 --> 00:44:26,640
Why are you buying up so many units?

692
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,416
You're paying a premium
although prices dropped.

693
00:44:29,496 --> 00:44:33,327
Buy up the remaining units
if they show a willingness to sell.

694
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:35,830
Sell yours to me too.

695
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:38,917
Why don't you get a lot
in Cheonsoo District?

696
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,029
Why are you doing this?

697
00:44:43,468 --> 00:44:46,624
Why are you buying up units
in this wretched Hera Palace?

698
00:44:46,704 --> 00:44:48,658
So many people died in it.

699
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,145
I hope it never happens,

700
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,962
but I want to prepare for the worst.

701
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,924
Dan Tae was obsessive about Hera Palace.

702
00:45:03,585 --> 00:45:07,663
I feel like he'll do something
if he thinks it's over for him.

703
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,506
Do you actually think that?

704
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,518
But then again,
he has no regard at all for human life.

705
00:45:18,598 --> 00:45:21,606
Who knows? He may set fire to it today.

706
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,793
But given how no one has heard from him,

707
00:45:26,873 --> 00:45:28,958
maybe he died somewhere.

708
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:31,565
Maybe he starved to death
or was struck by lightning.

709
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,323
I think something happened.

710
00:45:33,403 --> 00:45:36,115
There's a two-million-dollar reward
out for him.

711
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:38,678
If he died,
we would've found at least his body.

712
00:45:39,855 --> 00:45:41,105
That's why...

713
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,212
I plan to draw him into Hera Palace.

714
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:47,507
How?

715
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,067
I'm...

716
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,333
getting engaged to Logan next week.

717
00:45:57,695 --> 00:45:59,879
You are? Really?

718
00:46:01,194 --> 00:46:02,753
That's great.

719
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,866
I told Ma Ri about our engagement.

720
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,597
Just in case,

721
00:46:13,677 --> 00:46:16,520
I've bought up over 90 percent
of the units in Hera Palace.

722
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,024
It should be almost empty by next week.

723
00:46:20,187 --> 00:46:22,528
Dan Tae will return to Hera Palace.

724
00:46:22,608 --> 00:46:24,947
If we say we're getting engaged there,

725
00:46:25,027 --> 00:46:26,979
which he values as much as his life,

726
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:28,822
he'll make that D-day.

727
00:46:29,258 --> 00:46:31,038
I'll kill him.

728
00:46:31,346 --> 00:46:33,935
Please stand back where it's safe.

729
00:46:34,015 --> 00:46:36,365
I'm the one he's after.

730
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:38,762
He's coming back to kill me.

731
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,517
I promise...

732
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,942
I won't let Dan Tae kill me.

733
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,722
How's Seo Jin doing?

734
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,889
She's getting worse and worse.

735
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:07,112
She doesn't recognize Eun Byeol.

736
00:47:07,626 --> 00:47:11,003
The tests show early onset dementia.

737
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,141
Early onset dementia?

738
00:47:14,221 --> 00:47:15,260
Yes.

739
00:47:21,996 --> 00:47:24,743
This is her chart.

740
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,568
We're monitoring her 24 hours a day.

741
00:47:27,648 --> 00:47:29,571
It doesn't look like she's pretending.

742
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:31,154
I don't believe it.

743
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,686
The investigation has been stayed.

744
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:35,838
She got a restraining order
against the loan sharks.

745
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:37,365
The timing is just too suspicious.

746
00:47:38,266 --> 00:47:41,306
Well, I think
we should keep watching for now.

747
00:47:41,386 --> 00:47:43,540
We have a week
until the engagement ceremony.

748
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:48,366
I hope Dan Tae does
what we assume he will.

751
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,745
Hey. Why are you standing there
all awkward?

752
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:39,042
What?

753
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,372
What did I do?

754
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,665
Darn it.

755
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,620
Tell me right away
if Joo Dan Tae shows up.

756

is a whopping two million dollars.

I'm going out for a smoke.

760
00:49:46,807 --> 00:49:48,593
Long time no see, Secretary Cho.

761
00:49:48,673 --> 00:49:51,900
Sir. What happened to your face?

762
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,662
That's not important.

763
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,041
I'm starving. Do you have any food?

764
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:15,730
Do you like the food?

765
00:50:18,245 --> 00:50:20,068
There are cops everywhere outside.

766
00:50:20,148 --> 00:50:21,724
We can't let them hear you.

767

Where have you been?

768
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:27,323
There's a national manhunt for you.

769
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:30,348
You'll betray me too, won't you?

770

There's a two-million-dollar reward
on my head.

Didn't you come here...

773
00:50:37,975 --> 00:50:39,637

774

Did you hear that Ms. Shim and Logan
are getting engaged?

780
00:51:07,142 --> 00:51:08,524
What? Engaged?

781
00:51:09,343 --> 00:51:12,711
They're having a small ceremony
with just close friends next week.

782
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:15,432
-Where?
-I hear it will be at Hera Palace.

783
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,453
At Hera Palace?

784
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,145
Those jerks.

785
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:23,674
Why are they getting engaged
at my Hera Palace?

786
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,562
They did this to me,
but they're happily getting engaged?

787
00:51:27,642 --> 00:51:29,493
I can't let that happen.

788
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:31,831
They're the reason I'm in this mess.

789

-Secretary Cho.
-Yes?

790
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:36,082
Get me some explosives.

791
00:51:36,162 --> 00:51:38,483
Something more powerful
than the ones we used on Logan.

792
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:41,204
About ten claymore explosives
over five kilograms each should work.

793
00:51:41,284 --> 00:51:43,689
Pardon? What do you plan to do?

794
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,637
You jerk.

795
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:51,356
You can do it, right?

796
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:52,551
Yes, sir.

797
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,687
I'll kill them for real this time.

798

Is this...

804
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,610
really the only option?

805
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,418
It could kill too many people.

00:54:54,011 --> 00:54:55,891
He bought an explosive device...

816
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:07,318
Why did you do something
I didn't tell you to?

817
00:55:07,398 --> 00:55:11,980
You know I hate traitors
more than anything.

818
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,319
After all those beatings,
you still didn't get it.

819
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:04,440
Congratulations on the engagement, Logan.
You look great today.

820
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,342
Thank you.

821
00:56:06,422 --> 00:56:08,023
The kids are travelling.

822
00:56:08,103 --> 00:56:10,132
It's a farewell party
for Ro Na and Min Hyuk.

823
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:14,620
I'm so upset that so few people
were invited to this lovely event.

824
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,655
Hera Palace was always full of people.

825
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,719
Now I'm the only Hera Club member left.

826
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,975
You are.

827
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,883
Take care of everything for us today.

828
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:31,656
I will.

829
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,577
The statue of Hera
looks even more beautiful today.

830
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,698
It's such a waste.

831
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:44,718
It would've been loved forever
if it never got blood on it.

832
00:56:45,886 --> 00:56:47,036
Don't you agree?

833
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,505
I'm ready.

834
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,306
You look amazing.

835
00:58:59,857 --> 00:59:01,522
Of all the brides I ever saw,

836
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:03,529
you're the most beautiful.

837
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,157
Thank you.

838
00:59:11,565 --> 00:59:13,727
Let's hurry.
Let's not keep the people waiting.

839
00:59:43,255 --> 00:59:45,210
I love you, Su Ryeon.

840
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:03,795
Don't worry too much.

841
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:06,898
It will be fine.

842
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:13,560
(Number Withheld)

843
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,030
(Number Withheld)

844
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,921
(Speaker)

845
01:02:23,023 --> 01:02:26,564
Shim Su Ryeon.
You look even more beautiful today.

846
01:02:27,304 --> 01:02:29,489
Logan beside you looks pretty good too.

847
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,138
Come to the penthouse right now.
I'll give you five minutes.

848
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,748
But you have to come alone.

849
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:39,479
If you don't listen,

850
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:42,596
I might just blow Hera Palace up.

851
01:02:46,949 --> 01:02:50,319
I set up some bombs here and there.

852
01:02:52,753 --> 01:02:55,055
I miss you, so come quickly.

853
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,026
Ring the emergency bell!
It's an emergency.

854
01:03:10,106 --> 01:03:11,588
Evacuate all residents. Now!

855
01:03:11,668 --> 01:03:12,853
What happened?

856
01:03:12,933 --> 01:03:14,877
There are bombs in Hera Palace.

857
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,199
Evacuate the residents first.

858
01:03:17,279 --> 01:03:19,364
-We don't have time!
-What? Bombs?

859
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,112
Ring the emergency bell. Quickly.

860
01:03:23,192 --> 01:03:24,484
Attention all residents.

861
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,775
There is a bomb in Hera Palace.

862
01:03:26,855 --> 01:03:29,128
Please evacuate promptly.

863
01:03:29,734 --> 01:03:31,050
I repeat.

864
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,112
There is a bomb in Hera Palace.

865
01:03:33,192 --> 01:03:35,308
Promptly evacuate the building.

866
01:03:35,388 --> 01:03:38,117
Don't take anything. Just leave. Quickly!

867
01:03:39,536 --> 01:03:42,043
Cover her so she doesn't get hurt.

868
01:03:42,123 --> 01:03:44,336
-Mom!
-Get out of here!

869
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:46,906
What happened?

870
01:03:46,986 --> 01:03:48,505
Why are you here? You were on a trip!

871
01:03:48,585 --> 01:03:49,998
I knew this was going to happen.

872
01:03:50,078 --> 01:03:52,226
I knew something was up
when you pushed us out the door.

873
01:03:52,306 --> 01:03:53,922
A bomb? Where?

874
01:03:54,002 --> 01:03:55,854
It was Dad, wasn't it?
The one who set up the bomb.

875
01:03:55,934 --> 01:03:57,793
Is my mom okay?

876
01:03:57,873 --> 01:03:59,559
She'll help us buy more time.

877
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:01,055
We need to evacuate everyone.

878
01:04:01,135 --> 01:04:02,890
If not, we all die. Now!

879
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,989
The elderly and children go first.

880
01:04:05,069 --> 01:04:06,186
Quickly!

881
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:09,876
Those of you who didn't get
on the elevator, use those stairs.

882
01:04:09,956 --> 01:04:11,563
Slow down so no one gets hurt!

883
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:13,170
Quickly! Come this way!

884
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,960
Be careful, everyone.

885
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,507
Thank you for coming
to my engagement party, Joo Dan Tae.

886
01:05:05,627 --> 01:05:08,156
You finally showed up.

887
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:11,881
At last.

888
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:15,239
I can kill you with my own hands.

889
01:05:15,729 --> 01:05:18,712
Do you really think that can happen?

890
01:05:19,137 --> 01:05:22,501
Congratulations
on your engagement to Logan.

891
01:05:22,581 --> 01:05:25,489
I prepared a last-minute present.

892
01:05:25,569 --> 01:05:27,224
I wonder if you'll like it.

893
01:05:28,814 --> 01:05:30,775
If I press this button,

894
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:35,019
it will set off the bombs
in the fountain and the penthouse.

895
01:05:35,522 --> 01:05:37,978
They're much stronger than the ones
I set up in Logan's car last time.

896
01:05:38,058 --> 01:05:39,536
You can look forward to them.

897
01:05:39,616 --> 01:05:40,795
Boom.

898
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:43,818
Boom.

899
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:46,126
You crazy jerk.

900
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:51,071
If you want to die, die alone.

901
01:05:51,151 --> 01:05:53,639
Why should I be the only one to die?

902
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:55,936
What did I do wrong?

903
01:05:56,778 --> 01:05:59,547
Do you know that it was your dad...

904
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:02,178
who killed my mom and sister?

905
01:06:02,565 --> 01:06:06,125
Your father, who worked for Simoon
Construction, took away my house.

906
01:06:06,205 --> 01:06:09,548
What's so wrong
with taking back what was taken from me?

907
01:06:09,628 --> 01:06:12,925
Lot 27 of Cheonsoo District
always belonged to my dad.

908
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:16,297
It was your parents
who lived on that land without permission.

909
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:19,715
The demolition accident
was all Baek Joon Ki's father.

910
01:06:19,795 --> 01:06:21,328
My dad knew nothing.

911
01:06:21,408 --> 01:06:22,888
Don't make excuses!

912
01:06:26,173 --> 01:06:28,778
The noble Shim Su Ryeon...

913
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:31,324
never admits to doing anything wrong
even until the end.

914
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,501
Don't move.

915
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,652
How dare you defile my Hera Palace?

916
01:06:36,173 --> 01:06:39,285
Only I can have this place.
Only I can destroy it.

917
01:06:39,365 --> 01:06:42,351
If I can't have it, no one can.
You understand?

918
01:06:44,738 --> 01:06:47,682
Dying alone felt lonely.

919
01:06:47,763 --> 01:06:51,444
It comforts me
to know that it will be with you.

920
01:06:52,048 --> 01:06:54,656
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

921
01:06:54,736 --> 01:06:58,138
That's the perfect outfit for you
to wear to the fiery pit.

922
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:08,778
Drop the remote.

923
01:07:09,241 --> 01:07:12,864
You think you can shoot me?

924
01:07:12,944 --> 01:07:15,904
I will press the button
the moment you pull the trigger.

925
01:07:15,984 --> 01:07:20,692
Then Hera Palace will disappear
in the blink of an eye.

926
01:07:21,173 --> 01:07:23,664
Come on. Shoot me!

927
01:07:29,054 --> 01:07:30,672
I said, drop the remote!

928
01:07:30,752 --> 01:07:32,961
And I said you'll die
if you keep challenging me.

929
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:34,949
Just like your ex-husband.

930
01:07:35,029 --> 01:07:38,224
Just like Min Seol A.
Just like Oh Yoon Hee!

931
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,877
Shoot me!

932
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:52,559
This is for all the innocent lives
you took away!

933
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:54,065
You're crazy!

934
01:07:54,486 --> 01:07:56,442
How dare you shoot at me,
the mighty Joo Dan Tae?

935
01:07:58,694 --> 01:08:01,347
Are you still obsessed with that name?

936
01:08:36,289 --> 01:08:37,433
This is you paying...

937
01:08:38,169 --> 01:08:40,891
for all the crimes you've committed.

938
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:57,239
Drop the remote!

939
01:09:57,319 --> 01:10:00,822
Shim Su Ryeon, let's go together...

940
01:10:01,602 --> 01:10:02,724
to the fiery pit.

941
01:12:56,466 --> 01:12:59,216
=The Penthouse 3=

942
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:00,871
Mom, please don't die.

943
01:13:00,951 --> 01:13:02,433
Please survive!

944
01:13:02,513 --> 01:13:03,890
Mommy loves you so much.

945
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:06,053
You died a death that you deserved.

946
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:07,525
Cheon Seo Jin is the only one left.

947
01:13:07,605 --> 01:13:08,872
What if he dies because of me?

948
01:13:08,952 --> 01:13:10,726
Live happily, Ro Na.

949
01:13:10,806 --> 01:13:11,758
Mom!

950
01:13:11,838 --> 01:13:13,211
I'll save Eun Byeol.

951
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:14,850
I must push forward.

952
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:17,707
I'm Cheon Seo Jin.
