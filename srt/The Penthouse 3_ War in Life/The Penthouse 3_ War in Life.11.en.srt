(All characters, organizations, places,

3
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,810
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,882
We're all here to punish Joo Dan Tae
and Cheon Seo Jin.

5
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:21,363
First, we need to turn the two
against each other completely.

6
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:23,999
Nothing's better than money.
Two hundred million dollars.

7
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,890
-I want 500 million dollars.
-Are you kidding me?

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,349
I plan to dry up
all of Joo Dan Tae's funds.

9
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:33,050
It's a picture of Dan Tae
following Oh Yoon Hee's car in his.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,654
Circulate this to every media company.

11
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,323
Move as quickly as possible
so it can be breaking news.

12
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,424
I'll kill you, Seo Jin.

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,977
I've looked up a boat
that smuggles people to China.

14
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:42,552
They're all gone.

15
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:45,273
The final winner is you, Cheon Seo Jin.

16
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:48,129
I'll erase all your bad memories.

17
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:50,308
I've been saving all my pills
just for you.

18

=Episode 11=

19
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:14,097
We're leaving soon, so stay in here.

20
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:15,342
In here?

21
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:18,079
Yes.

22
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,415
Darn it.

23
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:37,298
He'll rot there for the rest of his life.

24
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:39,161
He'll pay for what he's done.

25
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:41,632
I don't know how long he'll live,

26
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:44,899
but he'll wish he was dead, for sure.

27
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,654
What?

28
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:00,639
What is this?

29
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,228
Let's go.

30
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:28,024
Let's get going.

31
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,058
Hey, you.

32
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:43,645
Hey, you.

33
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:46,462
Where am I?

34
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,395
What is this place?

35
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,859
Hey.

36
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,145
Are you awake,

37
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:58,862
Mr. Baek Jun Ki?

38
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,571
Baek... Baek Jun Ki?

39
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,724
What...

40
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:08,758
Baek Jun Ki.

41
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:14,928
What is this place?

42
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:16,432
Why am I here?

43
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:18,332
What is this?

44
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:20,230
Hey! Unlock this!

45
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:24,618
Hey.

46
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:34,338
Seok Kyung?

47
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:36,939
Was it you?

48
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:39,666
To get revenge?

49
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,882
You really are Su Ryeon's daughter.

50
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:45,167
Is this how you repay me for raising you?

51
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:47,300
Is that what your mom taught you?

52
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,037
I learned it from you.

53
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,459
You know I'm your Mini-Me.

54
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,972
You locked me up and dumped me
because I didn't share your genes.

55
00:04:57,052 --> 00:04:58,760
What could I have learned from you?

56
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:02,227
How does it feel?

57
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:03,976
Don't tell me...

58
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:07,286
you want to treat me like a daughter
now that you're locked up.

59
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,028
I don't care what people say.
I'm not ashamed.

60
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:15,652
I raised my enemy's child
to the best of my ability for 20 years.

61
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,314
I even decided to kill Ro Na
so that you'd win the Grand Prize...

62
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:22,036
at the Cheong A Art Festival.
That's not all.

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,181
I had your competition eliminated
one after another...

64
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:27,465
since you were too dumb
to get into SNU on your own.

65
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:29,006
For you!

66
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,294
Did you forget?

67
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:34,255
Even your birth dad
couldn't have done all that.

68
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,920
What more do you want from me?

69
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,889
I never asked for that.

70
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,123
You're the one
who turned me into a monster.

71
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:47,828
Because of you, I killed my twin sister
and harassed and hated my mom.

72
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:50,960
I can't even go to my mom because of you.

73
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:52,597
What?

74
00:05:54,124 --> 00:05:57,046
I despise you so much.

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,767
If you hated me so much,
you should've abandoned me.

76
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,080
Why did you live like that? Why?

77
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:06,052
I don't have time to chit-chat with you.

78
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,766
Get me out of here now.

79
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:11,318
I have a lot of work to do in Seoul.

80
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:12,821
I can't do that.

81
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:16,815
I wasn't the one who sent you here.
It was Logan.

82
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,000
He doesn't know I'm here.

83
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:20,787
I happened to find out, so I followed you.

84
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:21,989
Logan?

85
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:25,539
What do you mean, Logan?

86
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:30,116
That's right. I guess you don't know yet.

87
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:31,877
Logan is alive.

88
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:33,399
Mom's just fine too.

89
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:37,432
I bet they're back in the penthouse
by now.

90
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:39,547
Su Ryeon came back?

91
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:42,334
How is that woman alive? How?

92
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:46,005
How could she die?
She'd be too angry to die.

93
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:50,464
Her husband, daughter,
and friend all died by your hands.

94
00:06:56,888 --> 00:07:00,659
I came to say bye.
I thought it was my duty as your daughter.

95
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:03,676
Goodbye forever.

96
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,544
Seok Kyung. Wait.

97
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,783
Don't do this. Please don't.

98
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:13,843
We were close.

99
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,577
I must've lost my mind for a minute.

100
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:19,833
I sent you there not because I hated you,

101
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:22,134
but because I was mad at your mom.

102
00:07:22,214 --> 00:07:25,092
So I took it out on you, that's all.

103
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:28,044
You know how much Daddy loves you.

104
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:30,659
I always liked you
and looked out for you...

105
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:33,093
more than Seok Hoon, my flesh and blood.

106
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:36,804
Seok Kyung. Please get me out of here.

107
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:38,861
I'm sorry for everything.

108
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:42,832
Seok Hoon, you,
and I can go back to the way things were.

109
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:44,381
I'll make it happen.

110
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:48,048
I'll fix everything.
Absolutely everything. Seok Kyung.

111
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:53,035
How pathetic.

112
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:56,464
Do you think I came here just to see that?

113
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,287
You've lost. Give up.

114
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,245
In both Korea and Japan,

115
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,658
you're a murderer and a fugitive.

116
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,933
It's probably more comfortable
to stay in there.

117
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:14,353
I won't come by again.

118
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:20,165
Live the rest of your life as Baek Jun Ki.

119
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,873
Seok Kyung!

120
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:27,672
You can't just go!

121
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:30,442
Seok Kyung!
You have to get me out of here!

122
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,874
Seok Kyung! Seok Kyung!

123
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:37,272
Seok Kyung!

124
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:41,704
Hey, Logan.

125
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:45,683
You really want me to take care
of Baek Jun Ki and Jin Bun Hong...

126
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,132
just like you said to?

127
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:51,173
Baek Jun Ki betrayed me
and joined Seo Jin,

128
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:54,339
but he's a victim too.
Dan Tae killed his parents.

129
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,917
He was locked up in a mental hospital
and gave up on life for 27 years.

130
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:00,386
So?

131
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,251
I may give him another chance...

132
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:05,199
once he loses his gambling addiction.

133
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,740
Step aside. I need to talk to Logan.

134
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,974
Logan! Please!
Don't send me to my husband.

135
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:14,817
I'd rather die by your hands
right here and now.

136
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,732
I don't want to be beaten to death
in the house where my daughter died.

137
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:20,147
I'm begging you.

138
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,838
I won't do anything to Eun Byeol.

139
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:25,762
I'll just watch from afar. I swear.

140
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:28,909
Eun Byeol is my life.

141
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,404
I'll die if I can't see her.

142
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:35,977
I may have lost Michelle,
but I can make Eun Byeol happy.

143
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:39,342
I can't send her to that woman Seo Jin.

144
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:41,492
Look.

145
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:44,705
Get psychiatric treatment first.

146
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,304
And you can never go near Eun Byeol
ever again.

147
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:53,251
I'll decide what to do with you
after you complete your treatment.

148
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,146
-No.
-Mr. Hong.

149
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:57,414
No. Please, I'm begging you.

150
00:09:57,494 --> 00:09:58,936
Logan! No.

151
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,189
No. Logan!

152
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:04,969
-I feel sorry for her too.
-Logan!

153
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:07,595
She left home
to escape from her abusive husband.

154
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,500
Her daughter, Michelle,

155
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,716
waited for her to come home...

156
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:14,886
and froze to death.

157
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:17,697
Michelle...

158
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,277
looked a lot like Eun Byeol.

159
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:23,499
Alex.

160
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:25,052
Yes?

161
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:29,468
I need you to do something
before you go back to the US.

162
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:01,501
My goodness.

163
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:03,916
Did you prepare all this yourself?

164
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,215
You did a beautiful job.

165
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:08,351
Do you like it?

166
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,617
Of course, I love it.

167
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:12,479
I can't believe this.

168
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,918
Mom, shall we drink?

169
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:17,205
Sounds good.

170
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,751
You made a good choice.

171
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:33,493
It's so sweet.

172
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,116
This is...

173
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,164
the happiest day of my life.

174
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:14,188
I feel terribly bad for Ro Na's mom
who saved my life,

175
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,697
but don't remember anything.

176
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:21,291
If you forget all the bad memories,
you can be happy too, Mom.

177
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,453
Then you won't have to do
any more bad things for me,

178
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:28,359
and you won't feel tormented.

179
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,156
I'll make that happen.

180
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:33,889
By the way,

181
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,935
how's your headache? Has it gone?

182
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,961
It's gone away completely.

183
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,330
That's a relief.

184
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,741
Who's that?

185
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:46,924
I'll go and see.

186
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:01,743
Mom, it's our photo.

187
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,653
Our portrait?

188
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:07,587
Let's see.

189
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,988
-My gosh.
-Don't we look lovely?

190
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:15,614
Eun Byeol, how come you're so pretty?

191
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,512
You might not remember even me one day.

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,801
When that day comes, I'll look after you.

193
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,933
I'll be your mom.

194
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:28,952
I won't ever leave you.

195
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:30,117
I promise.

196
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,240
You look so happy.

197
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,092
You bet I am.

198
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,075
I was sitting with you.

199
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,308
Where should we hang this?

200
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:41,745
Well...

201
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:46,430
Secretary Do, I'm chatting with Eun Byeol.

202
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,542
Unless it's urgent...

203
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:50,826
Rumours are spreading that
Cheong A Constructions will go bankrupt.

204
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:53,051
Financiers heard
of the financial problems.

205
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,552
Stop it somehow.

206
00:13:58,632 --> 00:14:02,106
Stall the banks and media
for as long as you can.

207
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:05,092
Alex called
about buying Cheong A Constructions.

208
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:06,325
What shall I do?

209
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,000
Alex?

210
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:18,049
I didn't know you were interested
in buying Cheong A Constructions.

211
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:21,727
Yeah. I've been in contact
with Mr. Joo for a while.

212
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,159
Didn't you know?

213
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:26,911
I guess there's no business talk
between the two of you...

214
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,505
under the same roof.

215
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:32,560
My husband was in charge
of the construction business.

216
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,769
It's the perfect opportunity
for your father to enter Korea.

217
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:40,841
Cheong A Constructions
is quite hot right now.

218
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,725
Because of Cheonsoo District.

219
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:46,186
That may be true, but unfortunately,

220
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:50,296
Mr. Joo Dan Tae has been involved
with some unwanted attention.

221
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:54,199
So I don't know if I should go through
with this contract anymore.

222
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:05,805
The Cheonsoo District project
has huge merit.

223
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:08,174
You'll regret losing out on it.

224
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:09,282
Yeah?

225
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,008
Well, if it's such a sweet business,

226
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:13,965
then why are you trying to sell?

227
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:17,312
Because I want to focus
on culture and arts.

228
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:20,099
I don't have the energy
to run a construction business too.

229
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:25,032
The Cheonsoo District project
has already broken ground.

230
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:27,325
If they can take on the existing team,

231
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:30,309
many people other than you
would want to buy the company.

232
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:41,672
One.

233
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:45,296
I do have one condition.

234
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:48,380
If for any reason,

235
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,759
you happen to be involved
in any form of crime,

236
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:54,889
you best know this contract is dead.

237
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:57,471
What crime?

238
00:15:58,227 --> 00:16:00,986
Don't worry. That'll never happen.

239
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:03,996
Well, good, then. Name your price.

240
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,975
Three billion dollars.
I don't think that's a bad price.

241
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,313
If you think so.

242
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:15,854
So the Cheong A Group presidential
inauguration is coming up, right?

243
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:20,644
So why don't we announce
the takeover of Cheong A Constructions...

244
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:22,064
on the same day?

245
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:26,796
Can you give me a 30-percent
down payment?

246
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:28,417
Whatever you want.

247
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,134
Goodbye.

248
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:55,284
You did well.

249
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:58,299
We'll go bankrupt
if we don't pay the bills this week.

250
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,029
I think we can get through it.

251
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,277
Logan helped me in many ways.

252
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,678
Things will get sorted out
easier than I thought.

253
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:08,496
Logan Lee was actually a benefactor.

254
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,690
You still haven't located Dan Tae?

255
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:15,337
Even the police are looking for him.

256
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,499
You'd better stay in hiding, Joo Dan Tae.

257
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,931
Don't suddenly show up and ruin it for me.

258
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:30,117
Now, am I left
with just one more problem?

259
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:33,257
Bae Ro Na.

260
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:40,699
Can you open the door?
I'd like to interview you, Ms. Bae.

261
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:44,219
Ms. Bae, come outside.
We just want to confirm something.

262
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:47,718
Is it true you bribed the pianist
at the arts center audition?

263
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:50,920
We got a report that those
who auditioned were all connected.

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,136
Comment on that.

265
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:54,311
There's also talk that
you threatened Ms. Cheon.

266
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:55,553
What's the truth?

267
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,026
-Ms. Bae.
-Ms. Bae.

268
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:58,318
-Ms. Bae.
-Ms. Bae.

269
00:17:58,398 --> 00:17:59,778
-Is it true?
-Say something.

270
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,866
-Did you threaten...
-Come outside and talk.

271
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:03,526
-Shoot.
-You people!

272
00:18:03,606 --> 00:18:05,485
What are you all doing here?

273
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:08,320
Why are you yelling at a door
with no one behind it?

274
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,771
Who let you in? How did you come inside?

275
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:15,302
Since when did Hera Palace's security
become this useless?

276
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:18,265
This is an invasion of privacy.
So what, if you're reporters?

277
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:21,369
Can you torture someone
about groundless rumours?

278
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:23,235
Shall I report you to the police?

279
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:24,843
Jenny, did you call security?

280
00:18:24,923 --> 00:18:26,493
What's taking them so long?

281
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,590
-Here they come.
-Get this lot out of here!

282
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,620
How are we gonna live in peace
with security this lax?

283
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,926
I apologize.

284
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:36,934
Get out of here, okay?

285
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,221
Get out, now!

286
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:40,007
Come on, drag them out!

287
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,558
-Come along.
-Wait.

288
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:43,395
-Get out of here!
-Just a moment!

289
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:45,631
How did you come in? Get out!

290
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:46,949
-Let go.
-Move!

291
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,619
Get out now.

292
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:51,057
-Okay.
-Walk!

293
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,108
I swear Cheon Seo Jin called them.

294
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:58,509
She thinks she can do what she wants
because you're not around.

295
00:18:58,589 --> 00:18:59,978
She must've lost her mind.

296
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:03,568
How else could she even think
of going after that little girl?

297
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:06,094
It looks like Seo Jin went too far.

298
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:10,007
I'll let Ro Na take care of the reporters.

299
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,206
Mom.

300
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:17,429
She checked out already.

301
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,550
Where did she vanish to?
Do you have any guesses?

302
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,140
I'll track the phone and credit card
I gave her.

303
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:30,068
Why did you ask to see me?

304
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:34,990
I saw on the news
what Joo Dan Tae did to your mom.

305
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,600
You must be in shock.

306
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:40,536
I was very worried.

307
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:44,411
Thank you for worrying about me.

308
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,088
Sure.

309
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,391
I asked to see you to discuss a detail
in the artist in residence contract.

310
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:53,870
I'll send you abroad to study.

311
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,169
This is a great and special benefit.

312
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,524
Italy or the US.

313
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,310
Where will you go?

314
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,905
Why are you trying to send me away?

315
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:06,536
What do you want to hide?

316
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:10,023
You sent the reporters to my house,
didn't you?

317
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,037
You act like you're being generous,

318
00:20:12,117 --> 00:20:14,375
but you want me to back off, do you?

319
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:16,314
You want to disparage my name...

320
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:19,804
to block me from working in this industry,
is that it?

321
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:22,550
Misunderstanding one's intent.

322
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:24,841
You're just like your mom.

323
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:26,951
I have no intention
of going abroad to study.

324
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:31,544
There's something I must stay here and do.

325
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,643
Something you must do?

326
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:35,396
Clear my mom's name.

327
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,864
-Wait.
-No, you can't go inside.

328
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:44,613
I called them.

329
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:50,984
Thank you for coming.

330
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:53,881
You seemed to be curious about me.

331
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:57,086
I thought it best I explain,
so I asked you all to come here.

332
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,734
Where Center Director Cheon is too.

333
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,897
What do you think you're doing?

334
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:12,435
Today, I will reveal
the last moments of my mom...

335
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:14,932
who was called the Admissions Murderer.

336
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,246
-What do you mean?
-Is there a video?

337
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:20,517
-What is this about?
-Show their face. Ms. Cheon?

338
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:22,448
Three people appear in this video.

339
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:27,226
My mom, Chairman Joo Dan Tae, and...

340
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,115
Center Director Cheon.

341
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:31,900
-What?
-No way.

342
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,738
-What?
-Is that true?

343
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:35,276
What happened?

344
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:39,340
I reached the location
after Oh Yoon Hee fell.

345
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,685
I didn't see anything.

346
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:43,053
That's a lie.

347
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:46,475
Center Director Cheon was there
when my mom was alive.

348
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,452
And she stayed silent until now.

349
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:50,732
My mom was called an abductor...

350
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:54,314
and Admissions Murderer,
and you said nothing.

351
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,150
Why was that?

352
00:21:56,623 --> 00:21:59,769
Were you
working with the murderer, Joo Dan Tae?

353
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,831
Or did you help him murder my mom?

354
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:04,093
What are you...

355
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:08,670
What are you talking about?

356
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:10,722
It's not true.

357
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:12,214
I'm a victim.

358
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:15,433
Joo Dan Tae did everything on his own.

359
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:18,484
Really? Are you sure?

360
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,062
Yoon Hee!

361
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:23,765
-Hey, get that!
-Film it!

362
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,832
Hurry up!

363
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:31,998
-She was trying to save Eun Byeol.
-Make sure you get everything.

364
00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:34,270
-I'm getting everything.
-Oh, my.

365
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:37,004
Oh, no!

366
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:40,967
There is a car standing precariously
over the edge of a cliff.

367
00:22:41,047 --> 00:22:44,631
It looks like it's about to fall off
at any moment.

368
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,038
This is the dashboard cam footage...

369
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:50,400
from the Ha Eun Byeol Abduction Case
which became the talk of the town.

370
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,842
Stop it!

371
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:54,284
Eun Byeol is in the car!

372
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:56,198
Eun Byeol!

373
00:22:57,588 --> 00:23:01,166
-Get Eun Byeol out first!
-Oh Yoon Hee!

374
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,039
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

375
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:06,418
Get her out!

376
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,943
I'll move when you get her out,
so do it now!

377
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:10,739
Hold on a second!

378
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:12,109
Eun Byeol, wake up!

379
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:14,929
Oh, no. Eun Byeol...

380
00:23:21,845 --> 00:23:24,792
The dashcam footage from the case
where Oh Yoon Hee was suspected...

381
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:27,432
to have abducted her daughter's friend
has been revealed.

382
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:30,013
In the footage, after Chairman Joo Dan Tae
of Cheong A Group...

383
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:32,291
is seen pushing Oh and disappearing,

384
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,502
we are able to see that
Oh was still alive...

385
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:36,180
thus causing controversy.

386
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,028
Ms. Oh Yoon Hee has gone
from an assailant to a victim,

387
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:40,397
and until the moments before her death,

388
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:43,070
she did everything she could
to help her daughter's friend...

389
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,668
shocking many people.

390
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:47,070
As it turns out, the person
who was with Oh until the end...

391
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,926
was Chairman Joo Dan Tae's wife,
Center Director Cheon Seo Jin.

392
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:53,053
With the reveal that
she was a witness in the case,

393
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,803
the fact that she had taken
a passive stance regarding Oh,

394
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:58,666
who saved her daughter's life,
has turned into suspicion.

395
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:00,413
-Eun Byeol.
-After the fact that Oh Yoon Hee...

396
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:02,225
was falsely charged
had been brought to light,

397
00:24:02,305 --> 00:24:04,115
people have begun to raise their voices
for an investigation.

398
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:05,989
-Why are you watching this?
-Some say...

399
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,465
The dashcam video
doesn't show you pushing Ro Na's mom.

400
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:12,251
-Thank goodness. Right?
-What?

401
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:14,591
You know that I remember everything.

402
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,499
I was just pretending to have forgotten.

403
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,346
Don't you dare say that to anyone.

404
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:21,248
The culprit has been revealed anyway.
It's Joo Dan Tae.

405
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:23,775
But reporters will still harass you.

406
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:27,358
See? People are already calling.

407
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,625
Turn off your phone too.
There's no need to create trouble.

408
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:33,677
The best thing to do right now
is to ignore it.

409
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:36,712
Once the Cheong A Group Chairman
Inauguration ceremony ends,

410
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:40,281
-I can handle everything.
-How?

411
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:42,689
I told you! The culprit is Chairman Joo.

412
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,871
So don't worry about anything
and just trust me.

413
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,245
Do you understand what I'm saying?

414
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:11,114
Why isn't the medicine working?

415
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:14,755
She needs to lose her memory
before the investigation.

416
00:25:16,192 --> 00:25:17,559
What happened?

417
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:19,972
How did Ro Na get her hands
on the dashboard camera footage?

418
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,926
You said it was broken,
so how did they fix it?

419
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:24,480
The police received a tip
under the name Jin Bun Hong.

420
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,488
It seems that they recovered it
through digital forensics.

421
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:31,176
Jin Bun Hong, that witch!

422
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:34,187
How much of it was filmed?

423
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,844
Was what was covered on the news
everything? What about after that?

424
00:25:36,924 --> 00:25:39,386
The moment when Oh Yoon Hee fell
wasn't on it.

425
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:40,646
The footage seems to have been edited,

426
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:43,510
but the edge of the cliff can't be seen
from the angle of the camera.

427
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,669
They may have chosen
not to reveal that part of it.

428
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:48,283
If that's the case,
they would've called you in already.

429
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:51,453
Seeing as to how nobody has called,
what you saw was probably all of it.

430
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:53,500
You can relax.

431
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:56,763
Jin Bun Hong's about to ruin...

432
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:58,922
my plan to make Joo Dan Tae
take the fall for everything.

433
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:00,633
Why did this happen now?

434
00:26:00,987 --> 00:26:01,998
What about Jin Bun Hong?

435
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:04,688
She went totally off the grid
after the press conference.

436
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,685
I gave her 500 million dollars,
but she stabbed me in the back?

437
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:10,737
Do you think...

438
00:26:12,268 --> 00:26:14,549
she gave Joo Dan Tae that footage too?

439
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:16,464
And received money from both sides?

440
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,459
She's a conniving woman.
I wouldn't put it past her.

441
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,653
What if Joo Dan Tae has the latter half...

442
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:25,667
of that footage?

443
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:28,179
What if he took it and ran?

444
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:31,374
He'll come back.

445
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:33,345
I'm sure of it.

446
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:35,614
Joo Dan Tae.

447
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:43,215
Cheon Seo Jin...

448
00:26:43,595 --> 00:26:46,282
will do anything she can to hold out
until the inauguration ceremony.

449
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:50,150
She is deluded enough to think that
as the leader of Cheong A Group,

450
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:53,211
she will have the power
to cover this whole thing up.

451
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:56,374
Since she believes that Su Ryeon and I
are gone for good,

452
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:58,750
I'm sure she will do that.

453
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:01,134
Come tomorrow, Cheon Seo Jin...

454
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,303
will also find out the truth.

455
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:06,890
That Yoon Hee didn't just die.

456
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:09,484
That killing Yoon Hee...

457
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:13,249
was the biggest mistake in her life.

458
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:52,035
I've told the reporters that...

459
00:27:52,115 --> 00:27:54,141
you will hold a press conference
after the inauguration ceremony.

460
00:27:54,221 --> 00:27:56,168
Good job. What about the sale
of Cheong A Constructions?

461
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:58,364
I set a meeting for 10:00 AM.

462
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:01,266
You have to sign the promissory note
within the day, so it's urgent.

463
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,588
Pay back the loan
as soon as the down payment comes in.

464
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:05,165
Once we get the three billion dollars,

465
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:07,849
our financial difficulties
will be resolved immediately.

466
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,532
What about Eun Byeol?

467
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:12,032
She'll be going to the ceremony
straight from the practice room.

468
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:14,027
Make sure she has bodyguards with her.

469
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:16,845
Joo Dan Tae might show up.

470
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,212
We need to finish the deal
before the ceremony.

471
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:23,030
Make sure there are no issues.

472
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,377
Yes, ma'am.

473
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:32,765
I just need to get through today. If I do,

474
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:36,564
everything will go back
into place perfectly.

475
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:50,485
How annoying. Give me the keys.

476
00:29:10,077 --> 00:29:11,585
There's a hole in the tire!

477
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:13,853
What's going on?

478
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:21,912
Dad?

479
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:37,451
Alex? I'm about to leave right now.

480
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:39,830
Did you check the contract?

481
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,818
I am so disappointed in you.

482
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:46,941
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to go
and cancel this contract.

483
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,349
What are you talking about?

484
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,640
What do you mean
you're going to cancel the contract?

485
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,253
I specifically said in my terms...

486
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,736
that the owner
should not have any criminal background.

487
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:59,408
But it just so happens to be...

488
00:29:59,488 --> 00:30:02,842
that the person who
was keeping my brother, Logan, captive...

489
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:04,588
happened to be you.

490
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:07,519
Who on earth would say such nonsense?

491
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,092
It's not true.
It's nothing but a baseless rumour!

492
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:11,827
-It was all Shim Su Ryeon's...
-Yes, well...

493
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:14,340
We'll see if it's a rumour or not
pretty darn soon,

494
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,695
but until then, this contract is on hold.

495
00:30:19,232 --> 00:30:20,534
Goodbye.

496
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:23,719

Alex?

499
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:29,972
What on earth did he hear?

500
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:32,545
No, this can't happen.

501
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,259
Without that money,

502
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,331
I can't become the chairman.

503

Why are you in such a rush?

504
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:46,356
Move. I don't have time for this.

505
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:51,095
Were you on your way
to the inauguration ceremony?

506
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:53,300
The ceremony got cancelled.

507

You can't go.

508
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:58,038
Nonsense. Why would it be cancelled?

You want to know why? I'll tell you.

510
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,878
Oh Yoon Hee. You killed her, didn't you?

511
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,115
Why?

512
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:07,593
Why did you kill an innocent woman?

513

It must be quite familiar to you.

You set up this place yourself
to torture Logan.

Here, you gave the order...

531

to keep him barely alive.

and you pushed her off the cliff.

is so precious to you,

00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:41,892
I'll take away your voice
so you can stop lying so shamelessly.

587
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:43,444
No. Don't do that.

590
00:35:49,421 --> 00:35:50,781
Don't do that. Please.

591
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,399
No! Don't!

00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:56,500
No! Please...

593
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,114
What?

594
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:36,516
Is it painful?

595
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,303
Is the pain too much to bear?

596
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:42,947
Didn't you know that...

597
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:45,472
when you made others suffer?

598
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,982
Feel the pain thoroughly.

599
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:52,090
Realize what you've done to others.

600
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:24,620
Stop that.

No. Let's just have something delivered
to our hotel room.

with a private pool.

Mom, aren't you even worried about Dad?

618
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:07,494
I feel so bad being here without him.

619
00:38:07,574 --> 00:38:09,874
Why would I worry about him?

620
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,972
I know he can survive anywhere
in the world.

00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:42,449
Hera Palace is in Samseong-dong.
Why did you come to Namyangju?

650
00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:44,749
I had no choice.

651
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:47,415
I know all realtors
are connected in a network.

652
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:49,922
At such a cheap price,
it'll be sold in no time.

653
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:52,499
And I want the down payment in cash.

654
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:53,862
Please.

655
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:58,962
-Oh, my.
-Lee Kyu Jin.

656
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:01,547
You're under arrest
for embezzling Cheong A Group's funds.

657
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:03,046
Move! Go away!

658
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:04,122
Cuff him.

659
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:05,809
You have the right to remain silent...

660
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:08,702
-and the right to an attorney...
-I'm an attorney myself!

661
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:12,964
My salary used to be paid
by taxpayers too!

662
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:19,294
Mr. Baek Jun Ki.
It's time for your medicine.

663
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,663
Who says I'm Baek Jun Ki?

664
00:40:25,743 --> 00:40:27,370
I'm Joo Dan Tae!

665
00:40:27,778 --> 00:40:29,069
After everything I did...

666
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:31,580
to abandon that name,
to break free from it...

667
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:38,160
How...

668
00:40:40,078 --> 00:40:41,431
How did you...

669
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,659
Where's my money?

670
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:48,120
Give me my money,
and I'll spare your life.

671
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,643
You're not even worth killing.

672
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:55,263
Okay. I'll give it to you.

673
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:57,732
I'll give you the money,
the house, everything.

674
00:40:57,812 --> 00:40:59,690
Don't do this, Jun Ki.

675
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:01,636
This isn't you.

676
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,459
You're a good kid.

677
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,665
I don't need to be good.
Just give me my money!

678
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,701
Hey!

679
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:12,867
Hey!

680
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:19,615
I took in a worthless bum,

681
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:22,187
fed and clothed him,
and made a decent person out of him,

682
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:24,077
and you want money?

683
00:41:24,938 --> 00:41:29,034
This is why
you shouldn't be kind to orphan rats.

684
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,626
You ingrate.

685
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:34,131
I don't owe you anything.

686
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:37,998
You sucked the life out of me.

687
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,237
How could you steal from me...

688
00:41:40,622 --> 00:41:42,421
of all people?

689
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:46,459
You built this nice house
and want to live in luxury by yourself?

690
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:49,054
Give me my money now!

691
00:41:54,297 --> 00:41:57,205
You can just save up again.

692
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,922
That chick Na Ae Gyo is good at begging.

693
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:03,199
You two were an amazing pair.

694
00:42:03,658 --> 00:42:06,118
You'll be millionaires in no time.

695
00:42:08,607 --> 00:42:09,984
Please, I'm begging you.

696
00:42:10,516 --> 00:42:12,559
I didn't eat or buy anything I wanted...

697
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:14,729
and saved every cent I made
from begging...

698
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:17,790
since I was ten years old
and gave it all to you.

699
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:22,489
You said you'd buy me
a house in the middle of Seoul.

700
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:25,173
You said you'd let me...

701
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:28,808
build a house
on the land where my mom died!

702
00:42:29,062 --> 00:42:31,626
What is this annoying loser
babbling about?

703
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:34,634
Where's my money?

704
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:38,249
Where is poor Ae Gyo's money?

705
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:39,900
Shut it, jerk.

706
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,271
Hey.

707
00:42:43,766 --> 00:42:46,765
Wash your sneakers, will you?

708
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:50,200
Seeing these dirty sneakers
kills my appetite.

709
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:51,891
How many times must I tell you that?

710
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:56,332
Don't spread your disease
and get lost, you jerk.

711
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:12,471
Open the safe now!

712
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:13,818
You freak.

713
00:43:13,898 --> 00:43:15,629
Open the safe!

714
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,923
You scumbag.

715
00:43:33,854 --> 00:43:35,463
I can't go down like this.

716
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,181
I did nothing wrong.

717
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,346
All I did was work hard.

718
00:43:40,426 --> 00:43:44,105
I built Hera Palace
by working my fingers to the bone.

719
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:48,885
I won't let jerks like Su Ryeon
and Logan taint it.

720
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:50,685
I need to get out of here.

721
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:52,922
I must get out of here somehow.

722
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:06,294
Hurry! Please send help!

723
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:10,165
-Stop it!
-Bring it.

724
00:44:10,245 --> 00:44:12,155
Stop it!

725
00:44:40,707 --> 00:44:41,894
Let go of me.

726
00:44:42,227 --> 00:44:43,747
You people are dead.

727
00:44:43,827 --> 00:44:46,346
Let go of me!

728
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,385
I want to go back!

729
00:44:49,816 --> 00:44:51,184
Let go.

730
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:06,643
She's fine?

731
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:08,726
Yes. Look.

732
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:14,536
Her MRI and brainwave scans
all came back normal.

733
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:17,681
How about early-stage dementia
or anything unusual?

734
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:19,838
No, nothing.

735
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,916
You're worried for nothing.

736
00:45:21,996 --> 00:45:24,226
Are you sure she took that drug?

737
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:29,931
I didn't take the drug.

738
00:45:30,906 --> 00:45:33,334
I didn't take the drug
that erases memories.

739
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:35,466
So don't worry.

740
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:37,939
Then why did you take them from Bun Hong?

741
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:39,934
It must have been at least 100 pills.

742
00:45:40,014 --> 00:45:41,988
I was going to take them,
but I threw them out.

743
00:45:42,581 --> 00:45:45,110
Did you bug me all day long
just to check that?

744
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:48,069
Are you done? May I go now?

745
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:50,561
It's Mom's inauguration. I'm late.

746
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:54,555
You need to live with me now.
You can't live with Mom.

747
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:56,471
No. Why should I?

748
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:57,948
Mom needs me.

749
00:45:58,028 --> 00:46:00,107
How much worse do you want to get?

750
00:46:00,187 --> 00:46:01,705
If you didn't take that drug,

751
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:03,801
it means you remember.

752
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:07,595
You know what your mom did
to Ro Na's mom on the cliff!

753
00:46:08,651 --> 00:46:12,136
You know everything.
So why won't you say anything?

754
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:13,708
Don't you feel bad for Ro Na?

755
00:46:17,153 --> 00:46:20,334
Exactly. So forget this terrible daughter.

756
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:22,647
I'm a monster who can't be reformed!

757
00:46:23,423 --> 00:46:24,548
Eun Byeol.

758
00:46:24,997 --> 00:46:26,619
Go to Ro Na.

759
00:46:27,015 --> 00:46:29,099
Don't worry about Mom and me.

760
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:31,099
Go be a dad to Ro Na.

761
00:46:32,183 --> 00:46:33,321
She has...

762
00:46:34,217 --> 00:46:36,182
no one else but you now.

763
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:44,886
You knew too?

764
00:46:46,713 --> 00:46:47,911
When Ro Na's mom...

765
00:46:48,494 --> 00:46:50,366
risked her life to save me.

766
00:46:51,246 --> 00:46:52,404
That's when I realized.

767
00:46:53,634 --> 00:46:56,799
That was the only reasonable explanation.

768
00:46:56,879 --> 00:46:58,447
Because I was your daughter.

769
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,078
She liked you a lot.

770
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,000
So go. Just go!

771
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,095
I'm sorry to Ro Na's mom,

772
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,750
but I can't leave Mom.

773
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:17,688
I have to protect her.

774
00:47:18,784 --> 00:47:20,759
If I leave her too,

775
00:47:21,534 --> 00:47:23,857
I'd feel so sorry for Mom.

776
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:26,884
She did it for me.

777
00:47:26,964 --> 00:47:29,154
So how can I hate her?

778
00:47:31,147 --> 00:47:33,806
I'm going to live with Mom,
just the two of us.

779
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:40,881
So don't come to me ever again.

780
00:47:44,623 --> 00:47:45,811
Eun Byeol.

781
00:47:52,857 --> 00:47:55,937
(Cheong A Medical Center)

782
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:29,585
Eun Byeol.

783
00:48:32,797 --> 00:48:34,031
Eun Byeol.

784
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,383
I'm supposed to meet her
at the inauguration.

785
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:29,560
What's wrong with her?

786
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,896
Hey...

787
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:33,963
Eun Byeol.

788
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:36,707
Eun Byeol!

789
00:49:37,217 --> 00:49:39,409
Eun Byeol. Where are you?

790
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:40,483
Eun Byeol!

791
00:49:41,421 --> 00:49:42,376
Eun Byeol...

792
00:49:49,077 --> 00:49:51,193
Logan?

793
00:49:55,377 --> 00:49:57,254
How are you...

794
00:49:57,718 --> 00:49:58,894
I wondered...

795
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:02,808
who had taken me just to torment me.

796
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:06,767
You manipulated Jun Ki
into betraying me...

797
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:09,412
and got Ha Yoon Chul out
to prolong my life?

798
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:11,795
I never even imagined
it would've been you.

799
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:14,922
And then you dumped all the blame
on Su Ryeon?

800
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:17,318
How could you do that?

801
00:50:17,398 --> 00:50:20,434
That's not true. You've been lied to.

802
00:50:20,514 --> 00:50:22,908
Su Ryeon did all of this.

803
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,473
That woman...

804
00:50:24,553 --> 00:50:27,518
tried to kill you
to avenge her daughter's death.

805
00:50:27,598 --> 00:50:29,011
It wasn't me.

806
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,247
Do you still not get it?

807
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:36,929
You're dumber than I thought.

808
00:50:37,407 --> 00:50:39,183
I'm disappointed.

809
00:50:39,986 --> 00:50:41,117
What's going on?

810
00:50:42,836 --> 00:50:45,345
Did you two conspire together
and pretend to be dead?

811
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:49,737
Was I,

812
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,723
Cheon Seo Jin, fooled?

813
00:50:53,412 --> 00:50:54,489
I saw you.

814
00:50:55,274 --> 00:50:57,446
You injected poison into my arm.

815
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:01,236
Fortunately, Ha Yoon Chul saved me.

816
00:51:01,316 --> 00:51:02,392
Ha Yoon Chul?

817
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:05,373
Cheon Seo Jin.

818
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:07,652
You...

819
00:51:08,095 --> 00:51:10,783
You were the person
behind the altered voice.

820
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:12,679
I realized that a little too late.

821
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:15,081
If I'd known,
even if it meant rotting in prison,

822
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:17,052
I wouldn't have accepted your help.

823
00:51:17,386 --> 00:51:20,130
I didn't get to kill you
before Yoon Hee died.

824
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,515
That's my only regret. Do you know that?

825
00:51:27,028 --> 00:51:29,746
The purchase of Cheong A Constructions
is off the table.

826
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:31,698
I don't have to explain, do I?

827
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:35,224
I don't do business with criminals.

828
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:39,257
Oh, and you provided the cause
for the deal to fall through.

829
00:51:39,337 --> 00:51:40,931
Be prepared to pay the penalty.

830
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:44,951
No.

831
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:46,833
I can't go down like this.

832
00:51:46,913 --> 00:51:48,499
You're already ruined.

833
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,082
You failed to repay...

834
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,089
the promissory notes by today.

835
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:55,663
You planned this from the start,
didn't you?

836
00:51:55,743 --> 00:51:57,118
To bring me down.

837
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,734
You brought in Jin Bun Hong
and Baek Jun Ki...

838
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:01,564
to set all this up, didn't you?

839
00:52:02,775 --> 00:52:05,306
I don't want to ruin the likes of you.

840
00:52:09,873 --> 00:52:11,614
Because I will kill you.

841
00:52:16,206 --> 00:52:18,803
The board of directors fired you today.

842
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:21,767
Don't be too upset.

843
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,353
The company's not even worth
a piece of paper now.

844
00:52:25,236 --> 00:52:26,727
I was fired?

845
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:29,528
I will take over Cheong A Arts Center.

846
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:32,524
The 20 percent of shares
that Yoon Hee had...

847
00:52:32,604 --> 00:52:34,222
were in my company's name.

848
00:52:34,302 --> 00:52:35,537
The owner's back.

849
00:52:35,617 --> 00:52:37,114
It's only right you return it to me.

850
00:52:37,194 --> 00:52:38,384
Shut your mouth.

851
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:40,863
I'm the chairwoman of Cheong A Group!

852
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:44,321
The arts center and foundation
are all mine!

853
00:52:44,723 --> 00:52:46,869
I waited for this day for so long!

854
00:52:47,255 --> 00:52:48,602
I will never fall.

855
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:51,127
Secretary Do. Where is he?

856
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:52,718
Summon the directors now!

857
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:55,129
I'll have the inauguration ceremony!

858
00:52:55,593 --> 00:52:57,970
Secretary Do!

859
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:06,446
You finally show yourself,
Ms. Cheon Seo Jin.

860
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:08,307
Who are you people?

861
00:53:11,674 --> 00:53:13,370
You're Joo Dan Tae's wife, aren't you?

862
00:53:14,368 --> 00:53:16,639
I'm here
for the money he borrowed from us.

863
00:53:17,216 --> 00:53:20,690
He looked so desperate,
so I lent him 50 million dollars.

864
00:53:23,865 --> 00:53:26,703
He shouldn't vanish
without repaying his debt.

865
00:53:26,783 --> 00:53:29,985
Why should I give you the money
he borrowed?

866
00:53:30,065 --> 00:53:31,840
I have nothing to do with him.

867
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,644
If his wife has nothing to do with him,

868
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:37,644
then who does have something to do
with him?

869
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,317
Give me that.

870
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,630
Look at this.

871
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:45,661
(Bond of Debt)

872
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:48,270
(Debtor: Joo Dan Tae,
Guarantor: Cheon Seo Jin)

873
00:53:48,665 --> 00:53:50,904
Don't you see you're the guarantor?

874
00:53:50,984 --> 00:53:52,454
That's your seal.

875
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:56,217
I don't know about this.

876
00:53:56,857 --> 00:53:58,647
I never affixed it on this.

877
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,528
You didn't lend the money to me,
so get lost!

878
00:54:01,608 --> 00:54:03,221
Move. Get out of my way!

879
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:06,944
Secretary Do!

880
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:11,912
Cheon Seo Jin. We're the police.

881
00:54:13,742 --> 00:54:16,408
We must question you about Joo Dan Tae,
who's hiding now.

882
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:17,662
Come with us.

883
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:20,077
I don't even know where he is.

884
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:22,049
He's behind all this!

885
00:54:22,129 --> 00:54:23,906
Why are you all doing this to me?

886
00:54:24,254 --> 00:54:26,312
I must get my daughter.
I have no time to waste.

887
00:54:26,392 --> 00:54:28,489
We must force you to come with us, then.
Take her.

888
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:30,238
What are you doing? Let go of me!

889
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:31,822
I said let go of me!

890
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:34,908
They're the worst of the worst
among the loan sharks.

891
00:54:35,478 --> 00:54:36,897
They never give up.

892
00:54:37,677 --> 00:54:39,498
With Joo Dan Tae missing,

893
00:54:40,174 --> 00:54:43,816
Cheon Seo Jin will have to repay his debt
for the rest of her life.

894
00:54:43,896 --> 00:54:46,957
-The interest will snowball.
-I'll kill you all!

895
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:48,415
It's a depressing amount.

896
00:54:49,117 --> 00:54:51,752
She won't even have the freedom
to choose death.

897
00:54:52,548 --> 00:54:53,664
If she dies,

898
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:58,052
Eun Byeol will end up inheriting the debt.

899
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:03,510
Whether she spends the rest of her life
as a fugitive or a debtor,

900
00:55:03,996 --> 00:55:06,137
she'll live in extreme poverty.

901
00:55:08,111 --> 00:55:10,096
Until the moment she dies.

902
00:55:10,176 --> 00:55:11,817
Don't get Eun Byeol involved.

903
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:15,272
I'll persuade her somehow
to get her to leave.

904
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:17,619
Our plans don't involve the kids.

905
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,903
I made them promise.

906
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,149
We can trust them.

907
00:55:22,932 --> 00:55:26,186
Cheon Seo Jin had so much money
she could never spend it all.

908
00:55:27,302 --> 00:55:28,741
Now she has a debt so big...

909
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:31,042
she can never pay it off.

910
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:33,603
I can't let her
spend the rest of her life...

911
00:55:33,683 --> 00:55:35,920
sitting in a cell in comfort.

912
00:55:37,164 --> 00:55:38,894
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin...

913
00:55:39,596 --> 00:55:42,756
must experience
what living in torment is like.

914
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:52,514
The deeds for the penthouse
and Cheonsoo District lot 27.

915
00:55:52,594 --> 00:55:54,672
Dan Tae failed to repay the debt on time,

916
00:55:54,762 --> 00:55:57,559
so legally,
they belong to you now, Ms. Shim.

917
00:55:57,639 --> 00:55:58,866
Thank you, ma'am.

918
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,236
I didn't do anything.

919
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,324
They got what they had coming.

920
00:56:03,752 --> 00:56:05,043
Thank you so much.

921
00:56:05,354 --> 00:56:07,966
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

922
00:56:09,162 --> 00:56:12,630
You saved my life, Ms. Jincheon.

923
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,853
How can I not do this much for you?

924
00:56:17,348 --> 00:56:21,026
Oh, I have to go. I stayed too long.

925
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,683
Will you let me treat you
to a meal one day?

926
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:28,503
If you have the time to do that,
go and check in on your husband.

927
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:31,080
I did hire him a good lawyer,

928
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:34,033
but we'll have to see how things go.

929
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:39,659
Why is this so special...

930
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:42,362
that everyone's fighting to keep this?

931
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:53,217
Don't you feel dizzy
if you're up this high?

932
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:58,629
People must live closer to the ground.

933
00:56:58,709 --> 00:57:00,658
So that there's no more fighting,

934
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,318
we must end this place too.

935
00:57:05,878 --> 00:57:07,166
(Seized)

936
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:20,551

937
00:57:35,527 --> 00:57:38,689
My gosh. This is worthless trash.

00:57:39,687 --> 00:57:41,047
(Grand Award)

939
00:57:52,758 --> 00:57:53,916
Get out the way.

940
00:57:59,697 --> 00:58:01,202
Nice.

941
00:58:01,282 --> 00:58:03,756
-Not bad.
-That was nothing.

942
00:58:03,836 --> 00:58:05,639
-Was that nice?
-Yes.

943
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:07,549
-You must have it in you.
-Try again.

944
00:58:07,629 --> 00:58:09,811
Get out of the way.

00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,725
What are my charges?

947
00:58:22,805 --> 00:58:25,136
Why did you bring me here?

948
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:28,177
You're the fugitive
Joo Dan Tae's accomplice.

949
00:58:28,257 --> 00:58:30,259
That's why you're here.

950
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:31,539
Accomplice?

951
00:58:32,526 --> 00:58:34,602
He and I are total strangers.

952
00:58:34,682 --> 00:58:36,475
We're divorced.

953
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,470
We didn't tell
because we were sworn to secrecy,

954
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,384
but the papers were signed.

955
00:58:40,464 --> 00:58:41,534
You didn't know?

956
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:45,047
The court didn't approve your divorce.

957
00:58:45,183 --> 00:58:48,765
Someone said you were faking a divorce
to avoid repaying debts.

958
00:58:48,845 --> 00:58:49,876
Here.

The petition.

961
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,877
What?

962
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:57,166
(Applicant and witness Shim Su Ryeon)

963
00:58:57,246 --> 00:59:00,177
Shim Su Ryeon. To the very end...

964
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:03,168
Your husband embezzled 500 million
from the company...

965
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,654
and borrowed from loan sharks.

966
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:06,359
You knew about that, didn't you?

967
00:59:06,439 --> 00:59:09,208
He owes over one billion dollars.

968
00:59:09,885 --> 00:59:12,922
There's no way
he spent all that on his own.

969
00:59:13,002 --> 00:59:14,529
Where did you hide it?

970
00:59:15,437 --> 00:59:16,529
You two.

971
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:19,885
Aren't you perfect business partners
before being a married couple?

972
00:59:19,965 --> 00:59:22,465
Joo Dan Tae, that lunatic.

973

Sir.

974

Will you please let me see Eun Byeol?

975

That mad woman Shim Su Ryeon
kidnapped her.

976
00:59:34,389 --> 00:59:36,034
Don't change the subject.

977
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:38,367
Tell me where Joo Dan Tae is.

978
00:59:38,447 --> 00:59:41,926
There's no way
you two are getting out of this.

979
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:44,164
I really don't know!

980
00:59:44,244 --> 00:59:46,943
I never saw or touched the money.

981
00:59:48,845 --> 00:59:50,059
Ms. Cheon.

982
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,868
You can't even run away.

983
00:59:53,948 --> 00:59:55,832
You're banned from leaving the country.

984
00:59:56,942 --> 00:59:59,414
Did you know
that Cheong A Constructions...

985
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:01,312
filed for bankruptcy?

986
01:00:01,392 --> 01:00:02,615
What?

987
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:05,527
Bankruptcy?

988
01:00:09,297 --> 01:00:11,406
How could you do that to Yoon Hee?

989
01:00:13,727 --> 01:00:16,235
You'll lose everything.

990
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:19,470
From money,
which you value more than anything,

991
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,925
to Cheong A Group, Cheong A Foundation,
and Cheong A Arts Center... All of it.

992
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:26,386
Everyone that lent Joo Dan Tae money
has filed a lawsuit against you.

993
01:00:26,466 --> 01:00:29,057
There are over ten people
including Haeyeon Group's Chairman Song.

994
01:00:29,137 --> 01:00:31,706
Ms. Cheon. Are you listening to me?

995
01:00:32,107 --> 01:00:34,377
Stop putting on an act
and cooperate with the investigation.

996
01:00:34,457 --> 01:00:36,120
Listen here, Ms. Cheon.

997
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,642
Ms. Cheon!

998
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:40,524
Ms. Cheon!

999
01:00:42,357 --> 01:00:44,063
Listen here, Ms. Cheon.

1000
01:00:44,143 --> 01:00:45,648
Ms. Cheon!

1001
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:50,653
Ms. Cheon!

1002
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:53,197
It seems like a temporary state of shock.

1003
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:55,384
Her respiration is very unstable too.

1004
01:00:55,464 --> 01:00:58,059
She should try to get some rest.

1005
01:01:00,819 --> 01:01:03,043
Getting questioned
in this state is impossible.

1006
01:01:03,463 --> 01:01:04,621
Let's call it a day.

1007
01:01:05,327 --> 01:01:07,651
Once she gets better,
she will cooperate the best she can.

1008
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,520
She can't leave the country anyway.

1009
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,025
When you receive a call from us,

1010
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:13,118
you have to come right away.

1011
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:14,346
I make sure of it.

1012
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:17,927
(Emergency Medical Center)

1013
01:01:22,785 --> 01:01:24,902
Director Cheon. Are you okay?

1014
01:01:27,047 --> 01:01:28,356
Where am I?

1015
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:29,664
You're in the hospital.

1016
01:01:30,342 --> 01:01:32,337
You collapsed during your questioning.

1017
01:01:32,853 --> 01:01:34,097
Don't you remember?

1018
01:01:37,587 --> 01:01:40,770
What about Eun Byeol? Where's Eun Byeol?

1019
01:01:52,997 --> 01:01:54,501
Mom.

1020
01:01:54,581 --> 01:01:55,850
Eun Byeol!

1021
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:59,516
My dear daughter. Where did you go?

1022
01:01:59,596 --> 01:02:01,528
Do you know how worried I was?

1023
01:02:01,608 --> 01:02:03,820
Is everything okay? Did you get hurt?

1024
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,102
No. I'm fine.

1025
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,919
What about you?
How did you end up at the hospital?

1026
01:02:10,031 --> 01:02:11,498
Are you sick?

1027
01:02:11,578 --> 01:02:14,318
No. I must have had a headache.

1028
01:02:14,801 --> 01:02:17,213
Secretary Do made a fuss for no reason.

1029
01:02:17,293 --> 01:02:18,887
You don't have to worry.

1030
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:21,141
Let's go home.

1031
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:22,290
The thing is...

1032
01:02:23,223 --> 01:02:25,245
I don't think you can go home
for the time being?

1033
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,717
What do you mean? Why?

1034
01:02:28,117 --> 01:02:31,403
Loan sharks came charging into our house
and caused a scene.

1035
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:34,553
It was so scary,
and I couldn't pack anything.

1036
01:02:35,056 --> 01:02:37,207
We can't go home right now.

1037
01:02:41,377 --> 01:02:43,717
I got a place for you to stay
for the time being.

1038
01:03:38,997 --> 01:03:42,407
I'll take care of Eun Byeol
and bring her some place safe.

1039
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:46,377
I thought you might get caught easily
if you were together.

1040
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,737
How can I live in a place like this?

1041
01:03:49,817 --> 01:03:52,042
You want me to sleep
in this smelly, tiny room...

1042
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:54,314
on those dirty blankets?

1043
01:03:55,147 --> 01:03:56,472
Get me a room at a hotel.

1044
01:03:56,747 --> 01:03:58,893
Hotels are easy to track,
so it's dangerous.

1045
01:03:58,973 --> 01:04:01,114
This place is on the outskirts
of the city, so it'll be safer.

1046
01:04:01,194 --> 01:04:03,548
They're tenacious people,
so keep your cell phone off too.

1047
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:06,247
Eun Byeol can never live
in a place like this.

1048
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:08,774
Make sure you take care of her.

1049
01:04:09,627 --> 01:04:12,627
Don't worry about Eun Byeol
and bear with it for the time being.

1050
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,714
My accounts have all been frozen as well,

1051
01:04:17,794 --> 01:04:19,373
so I couldn't get any money.

1052
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:22,552
I'm sorry. This is all I could get.

1053
01:04:25,307 --> 01:04:26,204
Thanks.

1054
01:04:27,887 --> 01:04:29,560
Then get some rest.

1055
01:05:12,113 --> 01:05:13,267
Oh Yoon Hee!

1056
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:17,341
Oh Yoon Hee! Please don't do this!

1057
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:20,673
Go away!

1058
01:05:20,753 --> 01:05:23,616
Don't do this. Oh Yoon Hee!

1059
01:05:24,248 --> 01:05:25,562
Go away, please.

1060
01:05:26,887 --> 01:05:29,834
I really had no idea.

1061
01:05:29,914 --> 01:05:31,989
My husband is the CEO
of Cheong A Industries,

1062
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:33,938
and I'm just a housewife.

1063
01:05:34,018 --> 01:05:35,457
What could I possibly know?

1064
01:05:35,913 --> 01:05:38,896
I just trusted my husband
who told me to take a trip,

1065
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:42,600
and I went on vacation with my son.

1066
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,568
How could a housewife embezzle funds?

1067
01:05:45,648 --> 01:05:47,679
Five hundred million dollars at that?

1068
01:05:47,759 --> 01:05:49,631
How does this make sense?

1069
01:05:50,433 --> 01:05:51,827
Lee Kyu Jin, that jerk,

1070
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:55,013
committed the crime alone,
unbeknownst to me!

1071
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,607
Ko Sang A!

1072
01:05:57,837 --> 01:05:59,024
Ko Sang A!

1073
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:03,471
Hey. How could you do this to me?

1074
01:06:03,551 --> 01:06:05,426
I heard people went crazy
in front of money,

1075
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:06,966
but how could you betray me and run away?

1076
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,902
You even took the only son
of the Lee Clan with you!

1077
01:06:09,982 --> 01:06:12,432
This woman knew about everything!

1078
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:17,503
Even still,
you and I really loved each other.

1079
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,976
I wanted to buy you a nice house!

1080
01:06:21,056 --> 01:06:24,056
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it, woman?

1081
01:06:25,987 --> 01:06:28,921
Did you think
I would go with you willingly?

1082
01:06:29,001 --> 01:06:30,463
I got married into the Lee family,

1083
01:06:30,543 --> 01:06:32,933
and for 20 years,
I lived like a slave for your family.

1084
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:35,669
But you want me to go abroad
and do it some more?

1085
01:06:35,749 --> 01:06:37,064
Five hundred million dollars?

1086
01:06:37,144 --> 01:06:39,425
I wouldn't even do that
for five billion dollars!

1087
01:06:39,505 --> 01:06:41,279
Even if it's a paradise nicer than Hawaii,

1088
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,516
I refuse to live with your family!

1089
01:06:43,596 --> 01:06:46,414
You go ahead and live with your mo
and your sisters!

1090
01:06:46,494 --> 01:06:48,915
I'm going to live with my son.

1091
01:06:50,737 --> 01:06:53,694
Hey, Lee Min Hyuk. Be straight with me.

1092
01:06:53,774 --> 01:06:56,649
If your mom and I get a divorce,
who do you want to live with?

1093
01:06:56,729 --> 01:06:58,976
It's me, right?

1094
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:00,539
What are you talking about?

1095
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:02,657
It's me, right?

1096
01:07:02,737 --> 01:07:05,553
Please stop this already.

1097
01:07:06,285 --> 01:07:07,860
I'm so embarrassed.

1098
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:12,495
I don't want to live with either of you.
I'm going to live alone.

1099
01:07:13,117 --> 01:07:14,246
Darn it.

1100
01:07:23,127 --> 01:07:24,176
What are you doing?

1101
01:07:24,256 --> 01:07:27,200
I should try to sell these
to make some money.

1102
01:07:28,007 --> 01:07:30,263
Figure out a way to send Eun Byeol abroad.

1103
01:07:30,343 --> 01:07:32,733
She can't move around
and stay with other people forever.

1104
01:07:32,813 --> 01:07:34,328
Eun Byeol will refuse to go.

1105
01:07:34,408 --> 01:07:37,410
She keeps demanding that
she wants to be with you...

1106
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:40,009
and refuses to eat or sleep.
All she does is cry.

1107
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:41,293
Don't bring her here.

1108
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,539
She can't come here.

1109
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:47,793
I'm willing to sell my heart
if it means I can get her flight.

1110
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,668
I need to send her abroad at all costs.

1111
01:07:52,997 --> 01:07:54,477
She just needs to do...

1112
01:07:57,237 --> 01:07:58,941
one thing before she goes.

1113
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,499
That's all.

1114
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:06,926
My final wish is to see Eun Byeol succeed.

1115
01:08:07,006 --> 01:08:10,470
If we wait, Eun Byeol will be able
to get back Cheong A Foundation...

1116
01:08:10,968 --> 01:08:12,558
left for us by my father.

1117
01:08:30,664 --> 01:08:32,016
Where should I take you?

1118
01:08:40,472 --> 01:08:42,248
Where do you want to go?

1119
01:08:46,377 --> 01:08:47,548
What?

1120
01:08:48,577 --> 01:08:50,212
Where was I planning to go?

1121
01:08:51,547 --> 01:08:52,613
Ma'am.

1122
01:09:01,717 --> 01:09:02,914
Hera Palace.

1123
01:09:04,427 --> 01:09:06,539
Take me to Hera Palace in Samseong-dong.

1124
01:09:28,347 --> 01:09:29,422
Mom.

1125
01:09:33,817 --> 01:09:35,019
Seok Kyung...

1126
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:36,830
Where is she right now?

1127
01:09:37,767 --> 01:09:38,981
Well...

1128
01:09:40,697 --> 01:09:42,838
I did it all by myself.

1129
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,947
I don't have a family.

1130
01:09:47,027 --> 01:09:50,820
My mom is dead, and it's been a while
since I cut ties with my brother.

1131
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,600
So just send me to prison.

1132
01:09:53,344 --> 01:09:55,250
I did it all by myself, I swear.

1133
01:09:57,287 --> 01:09:58,374
Seok Kyung.

1134
01:10:13,367 --> 01:10:14,518
What was it?

1135
01:10:24,277 --> 01:10:25,807
(Calling)

1136
01:10:26,147 --> 01:10:27,195
Hello?

1137
01:10:28,577 --> 01:10:29,886
Are you there?

1138
01:10:30,252 --> 01:10:31,367
Hello?

1139
01:10:31,447 --> 01:10:34,158
(Seized)

1140
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:35,362
Eun Byeol.

1141
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,511
Eun Byeol, are you there?

1142
01:10:40,606 --> 01:10:41,742
Eun Byeol!

1143
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:46,253
Eun Byeol! Can you hear me?

1144
01:10:50,097 --> 01:10:51,417
Where did she go?

1145
01:10:54,597 --> 01:10:55,698
Eun Byeol!

1146
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:58,158
Eun Byeol!

1147
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:00,952
I don't have time for this.

1148
01:11:01,459 --> 01:11:03,075
-Eun Byeol!
-What?

1149
01:11:03,809 --> 01:11:06,263
Is it okay for her to be here?

1150
01:11:06,343 --> 01:11:08,299
The loan sharks are everywhere.

1151
01:11:08,379 --> 01:11:09,622
Eun Byeol!

1152
01:11:13,217 --> 01:11:14,491
Eun Byeol!

1153
01:11:16,217 --> 01:11:17,488
Eun Byeol!

1154
01:11:18,209 --> 01:11:19,474
Eun Byeol!

1155
01:11:23,197 --> 01:11:24,267
Eun Byeol!

1156
01:11:25,972 --> 01:11:27,158
Eun Byeol!

1157
01:11:28,467 --> 01:11:29,905
Eun Byeol!

1158
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,432
Oh, my goodness.

1159
01:11:31,512 --> 01:11:33,642
-Eun Byeol!
-Oh, dear.

1160
01:11:35,387 --> 01:11:36,386
Eun Byeol!

1161
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,810
Ms. Cheon!

1162
01:11:43,729 --> 01:11:46,543
Where is she? Eun Byeol!

1163
01:11:51,327 --> 01:11:53,186
Dr. Ha, it's me.

1164
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,472
Seo Jin showed up at Hera Palace.

1165
01:11:55,552 --> 01:11:58,606
But there's something off about her.

1166
01:11:59,317 --> 01:12:02,122
Something doesn't feel right.
You should come over right now.

1167
01:12:04,436 --> 01:12:05,642
Eun Byeol.

1168
01:12:06,552 --> 01:12:07,672
Where is she?

1169
01:12:09,287 --> 01:12:10,286
Eun Byeol.

1170
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:12,728
Eun Byeol.

1171
01:12:16,027 --> 01:12:17,159
Eun Byeol.

1172
01:12:19,257 --> 01:12:20,883
There you are.

1173
01:12:21,773 --> 01:12:24,274
I've been looking everywhere for you.

1174
01:12:24,354 --> 01:12:25,547
Ms. Cheon.

1175
01:12:25,627 --> 01:12:26,941
We have no time to lose.

1176
01:12:27,021 --> 01:12:29,104
It's my inauguration ceremony today.

1177
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:30,391
Our outfits are ready.

1178
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,272
Come. We'll be late.

1179
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:34,325
Ms. Cheon, let go of me.

1180
01:12:34,405 --> 01:12:36,111
I'm not Eun Byeol.

1181
01:12:36,191 --> 01:12:38,043
Why won't you listen to me?

1182
01:12:38,123 --> 01:12:39,554
Do as I say!

1183
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:42,082
You're my daughter.
You must attend the ceremony.

1184
01:12:42,162 --> 01:12:44,544
Everything I have will be yours. Come now.

1185
01:12:44,624 --> 01:12:46,234
Come! Hurry!

1186
01:12:46,852 --> 01:12:48,188
Listen to me!

1187
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:49,753
-Ms. Cheon, why are you...
-Come!

1188
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:52,253
-Come, Eun Byeol.
-I'm not Eun Byeol.

1189
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:54,483
Hurry. Come.

1190
01:12:56,918 --> 01:12:58,107
Stop it, Seo Jin.

1191
01:12:58,187 --> 01:12:59,843
Why are you here?

1192
01:12:59,923 --> 01:13:01,524
Are you here
to take Eun Byeol away from me?

1193
01:13:01,604 --> 01:13:04,374
You can't! I'll never let that happen!

1194
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:07,737
What are you doing?
She's not your daughter!

1195
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:11,223
Yes, she is! You can't take her away!

1196
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,308
Move!

1197
01:13:12,766 --> 01:13:15,023
Eun Byeol, come to your mom.

1198
01:13:15,103 --> 01:13:16,561
Ro Na, run, now!

1199
01:13:16,641 --> 01:13:18,128
No! Eun Byeol!

1200
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:20,173
-Get it together, Seo Jin!
-Eun Byeol!

1201
01:13:21,867 --> 01:13:23,104
Ro Na, are you okay?

1202
01:13:23,184 --> 01:13:26,133
Are you out of your mind?
Where are you taking her?

1203
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:27,969
She's my daughter!

1204
01:13:28,049 --> 01:13:29,264
Ro Na!

1205
01:13:33,322 --> 01:13:35,737
Mr. Ha, are you okay?

1206
01:13:36,827 --> 01:13:38,714
Eun Byeol!

1207
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:42,465
We don't have time for this.
Come with me now.

1208
01:13:42,545 --> 01:13:44,072
Why are you so stubborn?

1209
01:13:44,152 --> 01:13:45,775
-Eun Byeol!
-Ms. Cheon.

1210
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:47,134
Come with me.

1211
01:13:48,736 --> 01:13:49,996
Eun Byeol!

1212
01:15:06,027 --> 01:15:08,939
=The Penthouse 3=

1213
01:15:09,354 --> 01:15:11,162
I can't let it end like this.

1214
01:15:11,242 --> 01:15:12,474
I'll go back by all means.

1215
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:13,920
He's coming back to kill me.

1216
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,302
Your life isn't just yours. I love you.

1217
01:15:16,382 --> 01:15:17,877
I'm getting engaged to Logan next week.

1218
01:15:17,957 --> 01:15:20,359
If I can't have it, no one can, okay?

1219
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:21,898
There will be too many victims.

1220
01:15:21,978 --> 01:15:24,304
I'll chase him
to the ends of the earth and destroy him.

1221
01:15:24,384 --> 01:15:27,373
Shim Su Ryeon, I miss you.
Come here quickly.
