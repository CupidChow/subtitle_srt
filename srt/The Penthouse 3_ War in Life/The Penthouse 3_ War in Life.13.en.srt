3
00:00:11,823 --> 00:00:14,016
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

4
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,151
I didn't eat or buy anything I wanted...

5
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,291
and saved every cent I made
from begging since I was ten.

6
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:20,320
You said you'd let me...

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,310
build a house on the land
where my mom died!

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,746
Are you even human?

9
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:27,496
The moment I saw the wedding ring
on his finger,

10
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:29,721
I totally lost my mind.

11
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:32,208
Love? We can start it now.

12
00:00:32,288 --> 00:00:34,870
People with no money
open their hearts to anyone...

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,208
who treats them nicely.

14
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:39,701
Can't you give in a little for Seok Kyung?

15
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:42,900
I really love my daughter a lot.

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,595
Help me!

17
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:46,675
Goodbye, Oh Yoon Hee.

18
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,165
To stab me in the back?

19
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:51,904
You still haven't come to your senses?

20
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:58,381
If you miss your daughter so much,
I'll let you be with her.

21
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,086
Help!

22
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,534
My goodness.

23
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:10,167
I'm way too soft-hearted.

24
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:12,805
Soon a horrible psychopath...

25
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:15,925
will leave the entire nation in shock.

26
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:17,766
Kill me if you can.

Shim Su Ryeon.
You look even more beautiful today.

32
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:55,743
Logan beside you looks pretty good too.

33
00:01:57,997 --> 00:02:01,491
Come to the penthouse right now.
I'll give you five minutes.

34
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:03,554
But you have to come alone.

35
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:05,676
If you don't listen,

36
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:08,929
I might just blow Hera Palace up.

37
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:16,359
I set up some bombs here and there.

38
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:20,951
I miss you, so come quickly.

39
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:32,857
Ring the emergency bell!
It's an emergency.

40
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:34,707
Evacuate all residents. Now!

41
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,903
Ring the emergency bell. Quickly.

42
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,433
Attention all residents.

43
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,581
There is a bomb in Hera Palace.

44
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,872
Please evacuate promptly.

45
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,626
If the elevator's full, take the stairs.

46
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,664
Be careful not to get hurt.

47
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,648
Take the emergency stairs!

48
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,814
This way! Be careful!

49
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:06,287
Move! A person fell!

50
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,938
Easy. Let's go!

51
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:13,381
This way!

52
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,558
Are you okay?

53
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:24,028
-A bomb will set off!
-Run!

54
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:25,968
-Hurry!
-This way!

55
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:29,914
No! Are you okay?

56
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:31,006
Wait!

57
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,419
Go now!

58
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:35,271
Get in the elevator!

59
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,463
Seok Kyung! Why are you standing there?

60
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,056
Let's go.

61
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,881
Mom, please don't die.

62
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,888
You better make it out alive!

63
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:48,758
-First floor.
-Get in!

64
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,001
Hurry.

65
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:52,265
-Go quickly.
-Stop.

66
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:54,497
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

67
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:56,226
Someone's still in there.

68
00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:59,408
Seok Kyung!

69
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,379
Seok Kyung!

70
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:04,976
Are you crazy? It's dangerous!
We don't have time!

71
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:06,886
Let me go. I can't let her die.

72
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:09,179
-No! Wait!
-Gosh.

73
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:11,168
Guys, no!

74
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:12,810
No! Wait!

75
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,702
-Are you okay?
-Thank you.

76
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:17,237
They'll be back soon. Just a second.

77
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:18,593
Jenny!

78
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:20,888
Jenny!

79
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,514
Please wait just a second.

80
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:25,739
Hurry.

81
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:28,094
(Max capacity)

82
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:29,777
-Get in!
-No!

83
00:04:29,857 --> 00:04:31,510
No!

84
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,928
-The emergency stairs!
-Let's run.

85
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:21,193
Thank you for coming
to my engagement party, Joo Dan Tae.

86
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,133
You finally showed up.

87
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:30,628
At last,

88
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:34,093
I can kill you with my own hands.

89
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,594
Do you really think that can happen?

90
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:41,303
Congratulations
on your engagement to Logan.

91
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,335
I prepared a last-minute present.

92
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:46,121
I wonder if you'll like it.

93
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:50,000
If I press this button,

94
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,853
it will set off the bombs in the fountain
and the penthouse.

95
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,666
They're much stronger than the ones
I set up in Logan's car last time.

96
00:05:56,746 --> 00:05:58,261
You can look forward to them.

97
00:05:58,721 --> 00:05:59,793
Boom.

98
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:01,745
Boom.

99
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:02,857
Boom.

100
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:05,079
You crazy jerk.

101
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,926
If you want to die, die alone.

102
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:12,299
Why should I be the only one to die?

103
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,411
What did I do wrong?

104
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:18,249
Do you know that it was your dad...

105
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:21,012
who killed my mom and sister?

106
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:24,831
Your father of Simoon Construction
took away my house.

107
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:28,106
What's so wrong with taking back
what was taken from me?

108
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:31,277
Lot 27 of Cheonsoo District
always belonged to my dad.

109
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,104
It was your parents
who lived on that land without permission.

110
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:38,231
The demolition accident
was all Baek Joon Ki's father.

111
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,058
My dad knew nothing.

112
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,612
Don't make excuses!

113
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:46,586
The noble Shim Su Ryeon...

114
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,121
never admits to doing anything wrong
even until the end.

115
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,260
Don't move.

116
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,348
How dare you defile my Hera Palace?

117
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,034
Only I can have this place.
Only I can destroy it.

118
00:06:57,114 --> 00:07:00,108
If I can't have it, no one can.
You understand?

119
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,943
Dying alone felt lonely.

120
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,182
It comforts me to know that
it will be with you.

121
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:12,345
Nice dress.

122
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:15,860
That's the perfect outfit
for you to wear to the fiery pit.

123
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:27,153
Drop the remote.

124
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:31,010
You think you can shoot me?

125
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,754
I will press the button
the moment you pull the trigger.

126
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:39,114
Then Hera Palace
will disappear in the blink of an eye.

127
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:41,517
Come on. Shoot me!

128
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,613
I said, drop the remote!

129
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:51,217
And I said you'll die
if you keep challenging me.

130
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:52,904
Just like your ex-husband.

131
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:54,500
Just like Min Seol A.

132
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,209
Just like Oh Yoon Hee!

133
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:58,883
Shoot me!

134
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:10,452
This is for
all the innocent lives you took away!

135
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:11,742
You're crazy!

136
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:14,585
How dare you shoot at me,
the mighty Joo Dan Tae?

137
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,132
Are you still obsessed with that name?

138
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:54,721
This is you paying...

139
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:58,250
for all the crimes you've committed.

140
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:13,793
Drop the remote!

141
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:15,148
Shim Su Ryeon,

142
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,460
let's go together...

143
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,526
to the fiery pit.

144
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:19,703
Stop it!

145
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:22,489
Stop it, Joo Dan Tae!

146
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:55,602
Seok Kyung, Seok Hoon.

147
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,794
I love you so much.

148
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:19,566
Su Ryeon!

149
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:22,097
Are you okay?

150
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:24,309
Why did you come here?

151
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:25,974
Why did you come here?

152
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:28,571
We have to get out of here. Hurry.

153
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,297
A little more.

154
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:39,305
I killed Dan Tae.

155
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:40,877
You did nothing wrong.

156
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:43,476
It's all good now. It's over.

157
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,143
What about the others?

158
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,031
We evacuated everyone. They're all safe.

159
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,377
Are you okay?

160
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:21,034
I'll let you live like Shim Su Ryeon.

161
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,946
I'll make so much money
that you can get buried under it.

162
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:29,209
We can buy a house in Gangnam
and build a building.

163
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:32,792
I'll make everyone in the world
kneel at my feet.

164
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:36,493
And we'll have kids?

165
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:37,800
Of course.

166
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,079
A son and a daughter.

167
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:44,251
Our kids will live
in the most expensive...

168
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:46,769
and the highest home in the country.

169
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:48,509
The closest to paradise.

170
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:51,955
Wow. I'm so happy just imagining it.

171
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:10,494
Hera Palace,
the most expensive apartment in Korea...

172
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:13,172
and the symbol of Seoul has collapsed.

173
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,137
The 100-story apartment building
with a shelter...

174
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:16,986
that could house 200 people
during a nuclear war...

175
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:21,383
and boasted infrastructure
that could withstand earthquakes...

176
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:25,427
was destroyed by a suicide bomber.

177
00:16:25,507 --> 00:16:29,018
Chairman Joo Dan Tae
obtained illegal homemade bombs...

178
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:32,055
through Cho, who used to be his secretary.

179
00:16:32,465 --> 00:16:35,539
Cho's body was found this morning.

180
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,566
The cause of death
has not been determined.

181
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,902
More than 90 percent of the residents...

182
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:43,483
had already moved out of Hera Palace.

183
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,533
And thanks to the quick response
of the residents,

184
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:48,607
there was not a single casualty.

185
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:51,572
However, since the residents
were mostly from the upper class,

186
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:54,708
the damage is expected to be astronomical.

187
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:02,203
Joo Dan Tae...

188
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:04,711
threatened me and said...

189
00:17:05,454 --> 00:17:08,022
he had hidden bombs all over Hera Palace.

190
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:13,331
He said they were much stronger
than the ones in Logan's car.

191
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:16,189
He confessed all of that to me.

192
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,016
In other words, it was Joo Dan Tae...

193
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:20,903
who tried to kill Logan.

194
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:31,083
These are photos from the scene.

195
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:34,086
He wore an old man's disguise,
but it's definitely Dan Tae.

196
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,707
Since the suspect is deceased,
we cannot investigate.

197
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:43,032
Also, we found a laptop
in Mr. Cho's mother's home.

198
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:46,363
We've obtained a lot of evidence
of the many crimes...

199
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:48,353
Joo Dan Tae had committed.

200
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,884
It's tragic that
all of this finally surfaced...

201
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:54,821
only after his death.

202
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,410
Dan Tae and I were divorced,

203
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:03,097
but he's the father of my children.

204
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,341
Since this happened
during my engagement ceremony,

205
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,180
I feel partly responsible.

(Hera Palace Compensation
Press Conference)

207
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:14,154
We plan to compensate the residents
of Hera Palace...

208
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:17,121
for the damages suffered
due to Joo Dan Tae's bombing...

209
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:19,841
from our personal funds.

210
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:22,067
Thus, I will donate ten billion dollars...

211
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:25,283
to establish a foundation for the victims.

212
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,946
Moreover, Logan Lee Corporation
will acquire Cheong A Group,

213
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:33,062
which went bankrupt
due to its owner's improper acts...

214
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:36,359
to minimize the loss
suffered by shareholders and employees.

215
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,349
I will also donate my personal funds...

216
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:42,008
and do my best to help the victims...

217
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,191
and with the disaster relief efforts.

218
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:46,460
To the people who suffered...

219
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,761
psychologically and financially
in this accident,

220
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:51,992
I sincerely apologize.

Korean-American businessman Logan Lee...

who announced the takeover
of bankrupt Cheong A Group...

225
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:11,507
stated he'll donate ten billion dollars
to compensate Hera Palace residents.

226
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:14,426
-Oh Ha Young has the story.
-Ten billion dollars?

227
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:18,350
-CEO Logan Lee said...
-That's where the ten billion goes?

228
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,728

The death suit you very well.

232
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,943
I brought the medicine from the hospital.

233
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,372
Good.

234
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:55,237
Shim Su Ryeon
will be watching my every move.

235
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,673
I shouldn't do anything
to make her suspicious.

236
00:19:57,753 --> 00:20:00,444
Whenever my appointment's set,
get my medicine from the hospital.

237
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:01,555
I'll do that.

238
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,771
Also, congratulations.

239
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:06,119
With Joo Dan Tae's death,

240
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:09,091
you no longer have to repay his debt.

241
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,605
You'll be allowed to travel too.

242
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:15,868
Submit a renunciation
of inheritance today.

243
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:22,565
Is this how the heavens are helping me?

244
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:27,918
-Eun Byeol hasn't noticed, right?
-Not at all.

245
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:30,739
Keep your wits about you
and don't mess up around her.

246
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:32,838
She's a sensitive kid.

247
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,435
If she realizes
I didn't take the medicine,

248
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,822
she might feel betrayed
and who knows what she'll do then?

249
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,231
Mom.

250
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:58,984
I'll erase all your bad memories...

251
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,735
so you can always be happy.

252
00:21:04,187 --> 00:21:05,698
I've been saving all my pills...

253
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:08,379
just for you.

254
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:22,439
My goodness. You did a beautiful job.

255
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,825
-Do you like it?
-Of course, I love it.

256
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:27,796
I can't believe this.

257
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,774
Mom, shall we drink?

258
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,452
Sounds good.

259
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,793
Who's that?

260
00:21:56,873 --> 00:21:58,047
I'll go and see.

261
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:42,398
Mom, it's our photo.

262
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,862
Don't we look lovely?

263
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:52,445
Eun Byeol, how come you're so pretty?

264
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:01,302
Her testimony is my only way out now.

265
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,752
If Su Ryeon releases the evidence
that I killed Yoon Hee,

266
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:13,048
Eun Byeol has to say
I have drug-induced early onset dementia.

267
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:14,357
Is that possible?

268
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,193
The police...

269
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:19,458
will make you take tests
when you're under their supervision.

270
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,777
Your current diagnosis won't be enough.

271
00:23:22,324 --> 00:23:24,589
That's why I need Eun Byeol.

272
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,520
I'm unlike any other dementia patient.

273
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,434
My dementia
is a side effect of a medicine.

274
00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:32,202
No doctor can be sure of my condition.

275
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:34,767
More than the opinion
of ten psychiatrists,

276
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,097
Eun Byeol's statement
will have more weight.

277
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,647
What will you do now?

278
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:43,247
First, I need to send Eun Byeol abroad.

279
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:46,614
I can join her
once my travel ban is lifted.

280
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,306
Once I can prove
I'm too mentally unstable...

281
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,278
and my mind won't allow a normal life,

282
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:56,592
not even the law can tie me down.

283
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:16,737
Sir. Are you awake?

284
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,595
Do you hear my voice?

285
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,416
If you can hear me, nod your head.

286
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:29,349
Good.

287
00:24:29,913 --> 00:24:32,901
Sir. Can you say your name?

288
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:34,219
Ha...

289
00:24:35,162 --> 00:24:36,430
Yoon Chul.

290
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:40,546
It seems like he recovered
his consciousness.

291
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:42,570
I thought he'd never wake up.

292
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,751
It looks like his determination
created a miracle.

293
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:48,327
Thank you. You did a great job.

294
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:50,958
-Logan.
-Yes.

295
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:52,445
It's me, Dr. Ha.

296
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:54,609
Well done.

297
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:56,883
Good for you. I knew you'd wake up.

298
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,825
Eun Byeol!

299
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:01,593
Come on! Eun Byeol!

300
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:16,329
Ro Na. Was she badly hurt?

301
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:20,271
Thanks to you, she wasn't.
She was treated as an outpatient.

302
00:25:20,948 --> 00:25:22,514
She's just fine now.

303
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:24,398
That's great.

304
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,357
Thank you.

305
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,249
Thank you so much.

306
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,361
I'll let you talk.

307
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,093
Joo Dan Tae. What happened to him?

308
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,348
He died. In Hera Palace.

309
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:45,529
He got blown up by a bomb he set himself.

310
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:49,051
Is he really dead? Are you sure?

311
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,884
It'll be hard to find his body.

312
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:55,192
It was the world's most dreadful
and pathetic death.

313
00:25:55,882 --> 00:25:57,505
Now only Cheon Seo Jin's left.

314
00:25:58,022 --> 00:25:59,318
Cheon Seo Jin.

315
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:02,463
She put Ro Na in danger.

316
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:04,058
How dare she still...

317
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:07,169
She wasn't badly hurt,
so she was discharged.

318
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:08,980
She's staying in a small apartment.

319
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,507
Now that Dan Tae's dead,

320
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:13,761
the loan sharks are no longer after her.

321
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:18,752
Other than her secretary
who gets her dementia medication,

322
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:20,925
she herself doesn't do much.

323
00:26:21,504 --> 00:26:23,053
Dementia medication?

324
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:26,913
She's showing signs of acute dementia.

325
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:29,439
She can't recognize people,

326
00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:31,735
and she lost whole chunks of memory.

327
00:26:31,815 --> 00:26:33,321
Dementia, just like that?

328
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:36,863
It'll be a lie. It can't be.

329
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:39,172
I don't believe her.

330
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:42,708
She knows we have her killing Yoon Hee
on tape,

331
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:45,512
so she's trying to avoid a trial.

You do it.

346
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:34,112
Is that all you can do?

347
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:35,845
Are you trying to ruin my business?

348
00:27:35,925 --> 00:27:37,832

349

I don't care. Just quit.

Mr. Ma!

362
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:10,792
I heard the rumours.

363
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:16,677
Your family went broke.

Director Cheon Seo Jin...

365
00:28:18,557 --> 00:28:20,191
I mean, your mom...

366
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:23,918
is being chased by loan sharks
and is suffering from bad credit.

367
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:27,828
Looking at you,
it seems like you went super broke.

368
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:30,421
I thought rich people
could live by for three years after.

369
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,280
Maybe that doesn't apply to criminals,
though.

370
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,360
Then are you a young female
head of the house, now?

371
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:38,259
I'm leaving.

372
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:40,407
Don't you need money?

373
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:45,626
When I think about
how your mom used to be,

374
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:47,960
I really don't want to help you.

375
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,749
But I feel so bad for you right now.

376
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,295
You know I have a warm heart.

377
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,711
No, that's okay.

378
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,686
Your words are enough. Thank you.

379
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,109
Even if it's 1,000 dollars a day?

380
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,480
What's the job?

381
00:29:19,054 --> 00:29:21,245
Are you really going
to give me 1,000 dollars?

382
00:29:23,282 --> 00:29:25,294
You have to pass the test first.

383
00:29:25,374 --> 00:29:27,162
I know I can do this well.

384
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,979
But you have to pay me in cash.

385
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,318
Okay.

386
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,501
You should know you're lucky
to have met me today.

387

If you follow what I say,

388
00:29:38,255 --> 00:29:41,158
you can both make use of your major
and make money.

she would stop doing bad things!

I can't see her commit crimes
for me anymore.

So I fed her the drugs so that
she wouldn't remember anything.

00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:43,362
Please don't bully Mom anymore.

495
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:46,823
Just let it go. Just this once.

496
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:50,516
You saw with your own eyes
what your mom did.

497
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:53,836
I can't just let it go.

498
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:59,142
That's why I'm giving you to Ro Na!
I feel bad for Ro Na's mom.

499
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:01,871
Do you think
it was easy for me to let you go?

500
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,334
-But I'm giving it up!
-Ha Eun Byeol!

501
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,019
Mom has already paid for her sins.

502
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,497
What is a bigger punishment
than not being able to remember me?

503
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:12,103
Mom is nervous throughout the day
that she can't even sleep.

504
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:13,602
Isn't that enough?

505
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:18,072
Mom and I...

506
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:21,014
are going to start from the bottom.

507
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:24,068
Even if we starve to death,
I won't ask for your help.

508
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,711
That's not the point here.

509
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,925
I don't want to see you anymore.

510
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:30,260
Don't call and don't come to find me.

511
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,956
Let Mom and I live by ourselves.

512
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:36,602
You can be Ro Na's dad
until the day you die!

513
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:43,943
Eun Byeol.

514
00:36:44,432 --> 00:36:46,234
Eun Byeol.

515
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:52,895
Eun Byeol...

516
00:37:02,323 --> 00:37:06,216
(Cheong A Medical Center)

517
00:37:06,296 --> 00:37:08,220
What about the thing I asked for?

518
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,777
Cheon Seo Jin's hospital records.

519
00:37:10,678 --> 00:37:13,447
Based on the brain wrinkles,
it looks like her dementia has advanced.

520
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:15,497
Not only is
there severe hippocampal atrophy,

521
00:37:15,577 --> 00:37:18,138
but there are also multiple infarcts
in the white matter of the brain.

522
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:20,935
So it's true she has early onset dementia?

523
00:37:21,678 --> 00:37:23,039
Possibility of it being fake?

524
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:25,635
Doctors talk based on test results.

525
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:30,592
She really took those drugs.

526
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:33,939
At this level, she must have
had a hard time in her daily life.

527
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,592
The dosage of the drug
she is taking right now is quite high,

528
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,959
so she must be sleeping all day.

529
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,688
Mom is nervous throughout the day
that she can't even sleep.

530
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:47,259
Hold on. Just one more favour.

531
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:50,531
Seo Jin did an MRI
after a car accident five years ago.

532
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:52,181
Can you find it for me?

533
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:56,085
What do you think?

534
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:57,742
Something's not right.

535
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:01,532
Her recent scan doesn't show
any signs of her surgery.

536
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:05,271
The two scans look completely different.

537
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:06,732
They're not the same person.

538
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:09,087
I knew something was off.

539
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,530
The test results have been tampered with.

540
00:38:15,274 --> 00:38:17,635
Why did you let him see her chart?

541
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,410
There's nothing I can do
to stop a fellow doctor from seeing it.

542
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:34,816
You can't tell anyone
she doesn't have dementia.

543
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:39,195
If you do,
I'll reveal all the bribes you've taken...

544
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,037
from pharmaceutical companies.

545
00:38:45,578 --> 00:38:47,747
Worry about yourself.

546
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:51,488
If this gets out, my career is over.

547
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,516
I have a lot to lose.

548
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:01,550
Who is he to lecture me?

549
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:06,896
You must've been shocked.

550
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:09,943
Why didn't you stay in the hospital
for a few days?

551
00:39:10,023 --> 00:39:11,565
I'd rather be home.

552
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:13,131
I'm worried about the kids too.

553
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:15,304
You don't have to worry about them.

554
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:18,682
Logan booked the entire hotel
so they could rest.

555
00:39:18,762 --> 00:39:21,148
All Hera Palace residents
are staying there.

556
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:23,640
Thank you.

557
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:28,455
I guess this is the end of Joo Dan Tae.

558
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,386
Dr. Ha woke up too. I'm so relieved.

559
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:36,333
Even the doctors were unsure.
It really is a miracle.

560
00:39:36,413 --> 00:39:38,043
How is he doing?

561
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:40,120
Will there be any long-term effects?

562
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,110
When can he leave the hospital?

563
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,437
I'm not sure.

564
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,584
He needs rest.

565
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:48,803
Let's visit him together soon.

566
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:50,673
Sure, let's do that.

567
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:55,361
All we have left is Cheon Seo Jin,
the worst of the worst.

568
00:39:56,014 --> 00:39:59,862
Her condition has deteriorated,
so she'll be given stronger drugs.

569
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,583
She's getting more and more desperate.

570
00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:03,600
She must feel impatient.

571
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,319
Let's reveal the dash-cam footage
and put her behind bars.

572
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:11,059
She'll be sent
to the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry...

573
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:12,887
and undergo a psychiatric evaluation.

574
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:14,540
That's her goal.

575
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,192
Getting away with murder
using her mental condition.

576
00:40:18,272 --> 00:40:19,586
At this rate,

577
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:22,444
even with clear evidence,
her sentence will be reduced...

578
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:25,244
or the execution will be suspended,
releasing her within three years.

579
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:29,287
We can't let her get away
with killing Yoon Hee.

580
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:30,669
No way.

581
00:40:30,749 --> 00:40:33,196
She killed a person,
and Ro Na lost her mom.

582
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:35,379
Three years is not enough!

583
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:37,418
We can't just sit back.

584
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,238
We should find out ourselves.

585
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,988
She threw away all her pills.

586
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:17,376
Cheon Seo Jin has been putting on an act.

587
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:20,045
Eun Byeol is working until late
to make money.

588
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:23,608
How could she pretend to have lost
her memory in front of her kid?

589
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:25,586
She has no conscience whatsoever.

590
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:28,222
She doesn't deserve to be a mom.

591
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:30,311
We'll have to ask the hospital
to test her again.

592
00:41:30,391 --> 00:41:33,612
If someone tampered with the test results
for money,

593
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:35,441
they should be punished as well.

594
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:38,488
Let's reveal the dash-cam footage
immediately.

595
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:43,689
I wanted to keep it a secret for Ro Na
and Eun Byeol's sake.

596
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,703
But there's no reason to anymore.

597
00:41:48,245 --> 00:41:49,730
As soon as Ro Na leaves,

598
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:51,929
I'll send the footage to the press.

599
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,354
Ro Na was very worried about you.

600
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:00,309
She visited you in the ICU every day.

601
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:02,462
She did?

602
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,081
Yes.

603
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:06,644
You may not remember it,

604
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,649
but you must've heard her voice
while you were unconscious.

605
00:42:09,729 --> 00:42:11,503
I'm sure that's why you woke up.

606
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,167
I didn't know that.

607
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,510
I thought she resented me.

608
00:42:19,577 --> 00:42:21,803
Ro Na is leaving for the US to study.

609
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:24,135
She got into the Juilliard School.

610
00:42:25,597 --> 00:42:27,056
When is she leaving?

611
00:42:27,823 --> 00:42:29,098
Tomorrow.

612
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,636
Tomorrow?

613
00:42:32,876 --> 00:42:37,095
We wanted to bring her with us,
but she seemed busy with preparations.

614
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:40,712
Still, she must be relieved
to know that you woke up...

615
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,231
before she leaves.

616
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:46,884
Logan, do me a favour.

617
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:49,146
Please get me out of here.

618
00:42:49,226 --> 00:42:50,618
I want to see Ro Na.

619
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:54,250
This time, I need your help.

620
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,437
("The Temperature of Language")

621
00:42:59,517 --> 00:43:00,652
Welcome.

622
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:16,642
It's been a while, Ro Na.

623
00:43:17,115 --> 00:43:19,341
I did hear that you woke up.

624
00:43:19,948 --> 00:43:22,515
Did you already get discharged?

625
00:43:22,595 --> 00:43:24,723
Yes. I recovered fast.

626
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,498
Ro Na, let me pour you one.

627
00:43:43,616 --> 00:43:45,042
Is it okay to drink?

628
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:48,282
How's your injury?

629
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:54,528
It's fine. The surgery went well.

630
00:43:54,608 --> 00:43:56,380
The wound healed completely.

631
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,575
I just have to finish my treatment.

632
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:03,226
Ro Na, your hair has grown so long.

633
00:44:04,597 --> 00:44:06,636
The dress looks great on you.

634
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:08,869
You look really good in white.

635
00:44:10,198 --> 00:44:11,523
You...

636
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:14,774
take after your mom.

637
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,685
Big eyes, a beautiful voice...

638
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:21,784
You're brave too.

639
00:44:23,656 --> 00:44:26,596
But she said I got my stubbornness
from my dad.

640
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:29,322
My semi-curly hair too.

641
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,413
I'm moving abroad to study tomorrow.

642
00:44:37,493 --> 00:44:39,943
I got into the Juilliard School.

643
00:44:42,485 --> 00:44:45,799
Good job, Ro Na. I'm so happy for you.

644
00:44:45,879 --> 00:44:47,528
How long will you be there?

645
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:49,321
I'm not sure.

646
00:44:50,222 --> 00:44:51,832
It might take a while.

647
00:44:52,504 --> 00:44:54,343
I might even settle there.

648
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:00,245
Why are you sweating so much?

649
00:45:00,776 --> 00:45:02,967
I haven't been outside in a while.

650
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:04,852
It makes me nervous.

651
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:09,111
You must be busy. Thanks for your time.

652
00:45:09,191 --> 00:45:11,843
I just wanted to make sure
you're doing all right.

653
00:45:12,537 --> 00:45:13,911
Let's say goodbye here.

654
00:45:15,365 --> 00:45:16,600
Take care.

655
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,784
Why...

656
00:45:26,296 --> 00:45:28,024
did you do that?

657
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:30,331
Why did you try to protect me?

658
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:33,101
Did you think I'd be grateful?

659
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:39,502
That's not it, Ro Na.

660
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:43,035
I hate you.

661
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,893
I hate you so much.

662
00:45:44,973 --> 00:45:47,187
Do you know how scared I was?

663
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:50,260
That something would happen to you.

664
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,294
That you'd die because of me.

665
00:45:52,978 --> 00:45:55,041
What was I supposed to do?

666
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:56,946
How was I supposed to live?

667
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,737
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

668
00:46:04,817 --> 00:46:09,568
I keep doing things
I have to apologize for.

669
00:46:10,173 --> 00:46:12,570
But I didn't mean to upset you.
I just didn't...

670
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,975
want you to get hurt.

671
00:46:34,877 --> 00:46:36,999
I'm really fine.

672
00:46:38,136 --> 00:46:39,367
So...

673
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:43,307
work hard in the US.

674
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:51,913
Forget about everything...

675
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,117
and live happily, Ro Na.

676
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:20,046
It seems like
he recovered his consciousness.

677

Logan?

678
00:47:22,545 --> 00:47:24,122
Yes, it's me, Dr. Ha.

679
00:47:24,202 --> 00:47:27,462
Why is it so dark?

680
00:47:28,273 --> 00:47:30,013
Please turn on the lights.

681
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:33,981
Can't you...

682
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,183
see anything?

683
00:47:36,263 --> 00:47:39,314
No, I can't.

684
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:42,055
Everything's blurry.

685
00:47:42,135 --> 00:47:44,021
I can see outlines, that's all.

686
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:48,826
Doctor. Please be honest with me.

687
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:51,899
I can handle it.

688
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,386
Well... Your optic nerve was damaged,

689
00:47:57,123 --> 00:47:58,928
so you've lost your eyesight.

690
00:47:59,008 --> 00:48:02,568
We did our best,
but it was in a very dangerous spot.

691
00:48:02,648 --> 00:48:04,616
There was just so much we could do
during surgery.

692
00:48:04,696 --> 00:48:05,877
I'm sorry.

693
00:48:05,957 --> 00:48:07,112
Then...

694
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:10,379
will I die?

695
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:13,516
You'll have extreme migraines.

696
00:48:14,316 --> 00:48:15,566
He'll require...

697
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:18,139
the strongest pain killers
during the time he has left.

698
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,453
I don't want to waste what precious time
I have left...

by the window.

702
00:48:39,365 --> 00:48:41,118
What is she wearing?

703
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:42,661
A white dress.

704
00:48:43,074 --> 00:48:44,859
She looks pretty with her hair down.

705
00:48:45,698 --> 00:48:49,177
I want her to remember me
when I was healthy.

706
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,831
You can do this.

707
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:54,726
I've been here often,

708
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,395

that she tried to feed it to me.

I just acted the way she wanted me to be.

to hide the fact that you killed Yoon Hee.

Please.

00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:40,656
made me the bad one to the end.

825
00:58:42,499 --> 00:58:44,362
Even until the moment you died,

826
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:48,086
you abandoned me.

827
00:59:26,138 --> 00:59:29,338
Eun Byeol, why are you here?
Where's your dad?

828
00:59:29,418 --> 00:59:32,035
I bought fruit because he said he'd visit.

829
00:59:32,115 --> 00:59:33,210
And your mom?

830
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,487
At the hospital.

831
00:59:42,103 --> 00:59:43,539
Ms. Shim!

832
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:59,194
Eun Byeol, come this way.

833
00:59:59,274 --> 01:00:00,628
What's wrong?

834
01:00:01,247 --> 01:00:04,387
Get out of here and call an ambulance.
Now!

835
01:00:33,593 --> 01:00:34,593
(Public Toilet)

836
01:00:40,873 --> 01:00:43,890
It's all done. It can't be turned back.

837
01:00:45,622 --> 01:00:48,560
I have to go forward. Because...

838
01:00:49,572 --> 01:00:51,007
I'm Cheon Seo Jin.

839
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:59,983
(Secretary Do)

840
01:01:03,053 --> 01:01:04,249
It's me.

841
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:06,604
Ha Yoon Chul's dead.

842
01:01:06,684 --> 01:01:08,372
Arrange for me to go abroad.

843
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:10,808
Eun Byeol and I have to go
to whatever country possible.

844
01:01:10,888 --> 01:01:12,123
Hurry.

845
01:01:19,103 --> 01:01:22,203
(Mortuary)

846
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:24,443
(May you rest in peace.)

847
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,197
Dad.

848
01:01:35,168 --> 01:01:37,184
Why are you lying here?

849
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:38,916
It's me.

850
01:01:44,123 --> 01:01:46,673
Wake up and look at me.

851
01:01:47,155 --> 01:01:49,068
Dad!

852
01:01:49,946 --> 01:01:53,958
Dad. I'm sorry.

853
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:57,693
I won't tell you not to visit anymore.

854
01:01:58,383 --> 01:02:03,007
Dad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything.

855
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:06,608
I won't tell you not to visit anymore!

856
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:09,971
So get up, please!

857
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:13,410
Dad.

858
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,268
Get up.

859
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:17,681
I was so mean to you.

860
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:21,581
I'm sorry for that, Dad.

861
01:02:23,883 --> 01:02:25,290
Dad.

862
01:02:26,874 --> 01:02:29,099
Dad...

863
01:02:30,295 --> 01:02:32,022
-Dad.
-What happened?

864
01:02:32,102 --> 01:02:34,034
-Why is he dead?
-I'm here now.

865
01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:35,595
Seo Jin did it.

866
01:02:35,675 --> 01:02:38,012
Cheon Seo Jin left him to die.

867
01:02:43,194 --> 01:02:44,582
Dad.

868
01:02:44,662 --> 01:02:45,938
Dad.

869
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:59,020
(Neurosurgeon Ha Yoon Chul)

870
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,469
I didn't get to pass the gift
Ro Na got for him.

871
01:03:01,549 --> 01:03:02,825
I'm sorry, Dad.

872
01:03:07,223 --> 01:03:09,900
Seo Jin will try to flee overseas.

873
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,793
I must put a travel ban on her.

874
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:13,289
No.

875
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:15,491
Let's let her have her way.

876
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:16,716
What do you mean?

877
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,064
What if we lose her forever?

878
01:03:19,144 --> 01:03:21,195
Then we play our final card.

879
01:03:22,242 --> 01:03:24,133
We should deceive her too.

880
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:26,916
So she confesses her crimes.

881
01:03:33,251 --> 01:03:34,775
Are you all right?

882
01:03:34,855 --> 01:03:36,320
Let go of me.

883
01:03:36,974 --> 01:03:39,041
If you want to talk nonsense, just go.

884
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:40,753
I won't listen to what you say.

885
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,337
Do you still not believe me?

886
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:45,460
Why would someone
who can't remember anything kill Dad?

887
01:03:46,012 --> 01:03:47,943
Mom wasn't even home at the time.

888
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:49,913
She was. She ran away.

889
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:53,000
Your mom remembers everything.
She's lying to you.

890
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,413
That's impossible.

891
01:03:55,109 --> 01:03:56,714
I fed her the drug myself.

892
01:03:56,794 --> 01:03:59,430
The drug that erases your memory.

893
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,478
That's why
she doesn't recognize me either.

894
01:04:01,558 --> 01:04:03,307
I don't know what's going on,

895
01:04:03,387 --> 01:04:05,298
but your mom didn't take the drug.

896
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:07,057
Her MRI was faked.

897
01:04:07,137 --> 01:04:09,420
No!

898
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,018
Eun Byeol.

899
01:04:14,644 --> 01:04:17,734
Ro Na's mom is dead and so is your dad.

900
01:04:18,395 --> 01:04:20,685
Don't you feel bad for them?

901
01:04:20,765 --> 01:04:23,934
How many more must sacrifice
for you to believe me?

902
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,138
Until I see it for myself,

903
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:32,631
I won't believe anything.

904
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:44,945
Dr. Ha was blind,

905
01:04:45,025 --> 01:04:47,925
so it looks like the police
will conclude he lost his footing.

906
01:04:48,845 --> 01:04:49,986
And Shim Su Ryeon?

907
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:51,679
She isn't doing anything.

908
01:04:52,734 --> 01:04:55,051
Then I'll have no problem going abroad.

909
01:04:56,853 --> 01:04:58,038
Eun Byeol.

910
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:01,652
Is she still at the funeral?

911
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:05,181
Yes.
I'll bring her to the airport on time.

912
01:05:06,434 --> 01:05:08,664
You should leave first.

913
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:10,129
So that no one suspects you,

914
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:12,590
I think you should travel
on separate flights.

915
01:05:13,558 --> 01:05:14,745
Let's go.

916
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:20,983
(Eun Byeol)

917
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:26,229
Hello?

918
01:05:27,433 --> 01:05:30,086
Mom!

919
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:33,120
Mom!

920
01:05:36,074 --> 01:05:37,415
Mom!

921
01:05:39,506 --> 01:05:42,366
Hello? What sound is that?

922
01:05:42,446 --> 01:05:44,642
Quit the act, Cheon Seo Jin.

923
01:05:45,319 --> 01:05:48,053
If you want to save your daughter,
get over here now.

924
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:50,041
To where you killed Yoon Hee.

925
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,373
If you're not here within an hour,

926
01:05:55,453 --> 01:05:57,516
you'll never see Eun Byeol again.

927
01:06:05,425 --> 01:06:07,714
Shim Su Ryeon has Eun Byeol.

928
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:09,969
-What?
-Didn't you hear me?

929
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,379
Shim Su Ryeon took Eun Byeol.

930
01:06:13,513 --> 01:06:14,753
I have to go.

931
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,927
You can't. It'll be a trap.

932
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:18,647
Leave this to me and leave the country.

933
01:06:18,727 --> 01:06:20,673
You must leave now
if you're to make the flight.

934
01:06:20,753 --> 01:06:21,791
There's no time.

935
01:06:21,871 --> 01:06:23,637
Su Ryeon killed Dan Tae.

936
01:06:23,717 --> 01:06:25,851
She's capable of anything.

937
01:06:26,975 --> 01:06:28,643
She might kill Eun Byeol too.

938
01:06:28,974 --> 01:06:30,409
I have to go.

939
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:32,828
You can't.
You need to save yourself first.

940
01:06:32,908 --> 01:06:35,714
If you lose this chance,
you might not get another one.

941
01:06:35,794 --> 01:06:37,890
I will save Eun Byeol.

942
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:42,209
Eun Byeol is my daughter! I will save her.

943
01:06:43,274 --> 01:06:44,569
Shim Su Ryeon.

944
01:06:45,647 --> 01:06:48,500
This will end today.

945
01:06:49,643 --> 01:06:51,215
Give me the car keys!

946
01:06:52,162 --> 01:06:53,394
Ms. Cheon!

947
01:06:57,689 --> 01:06:58,928
Eun Byeol.

948
01:07:03,331 --> 01:07:05,986
Eun Byeol, I'm coming.

949
01:07:17,263 --> 01:07:19,534
Shim Su Ryeon, you...

950
01:07:37,513 --> 01:07:39,026
Shim Su Ryeon!

951
01:07:39,882 --> 01:07:41,364
Eun Byeol!

952
01:07:41,444 --> 01:07:42,931
Don't come close.

953
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:45,559
Or your daughter dies here.

954
01:07:48,072 --> 01:07:49,385
What are you doing?

955
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:51,147
Eun Byeol did nothing wrong!

956
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:53,093
I'm the one you want!

957
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:55,766
No!

958
01:07:55,846 --> 01:07:58,761
No! Eun Byeol!

959
01:07:59,436 --> 01:08:02,385
Eun Byeol! No!

960
01:08:02,986 --> 01:08:05,730
Eun Byeol! No!

961
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:07,087
No!

962
01:08:08,522 --> 01:08:10,015
No!

963
01:08:15,011 --> 01:08:16,207
Eun Byeol.

964
01:08:25,116 --> 01:08:26,904
Kudos to your acting...

965
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:30,388
when you're this clear-minded.

966
01:08:30,468 --> 01:08:32,212
Shim Su Ryeon!

967
01:08:32,877 --> 01:08:35,892
Why are you interfering with my life
every step of the way?

968
01:08:35,972 --> 01:08:38,375
Did you think killing Yoon Hee
will solve everything?

969
01:08:38,455 --> 01:08:40,538
Did you think you could keep it a secret
till the end...

970
01:08:40,618 --> 01:08:42,602
as long as you could blame Joo Dan Tae
for it?

971
01:08:42,682 --> 01:08:45,173
Oh Yoon Hee died because of you.

972
01:08:45,253 --> 01:08:48,812
I had to cut your right-hand woman
off to deal with you.

973
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,219
So now you're confessing.

974
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:55,480
Don't act all high and mighty,
as if you're better than us.

975
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,688
If only you hadn't acted
like you were on a high horse...

976
01:08:57,768 --> 01:08:59,611
by forgiving the murderer
who killed Min Seol A,

977
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:03,041
Oh Yoon Hee would have stayed in prison,
and she wouldn't have died.

978
01:09:03,121 --> 01:09:07,494
Did you live all your life
always rationalizing your sins like this?

979
01:09:07,574 --> 01:09:10,012
-Shut up!
-You should pray.

980
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:15,645
I'll make your daughter
pay for all of your sins.

981
01:09:20,979 --> 01:09:22,449
Where's Eun Byeol?

982
01:09:23,302 --> 01:09:24,694
Where is she?

983
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:26,920
Eun Byeol!

984
01:09:28,004 --> 01:09:29,280
Eun Byeol!

985
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,222
Where is Eun Byeol?

986
01:09:32,744 --> 01:09:34,422
Where is my daughter?

987
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:36,137
What did you do to her?

988
01:09:37,793 --> 01:09:39,719
Why did you kill Ha Yoon Chul?

989
01:09:40,537 --> 01:09:42,946
Because he found out
you didn't have dementia?

990
01:09:43,354 --> 01:09:45,918
Because you were afraid
your lies were going to get exposed?

991
01:09:45,998 --> 01:09:47,840
So you killed a man?

992
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,400
Bring me Eun Byeol.

993
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,147
I don't hear anything you're saying!

994
01:09:51,227 --> 01:09:53,641
Depending on how you behave,

995
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:55,827
Eun Byeol may die...

996
01:09:56,552 --> 01:09:57,753
or live.

997
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:07,087
What do you want?

998
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:09,481
You want me to turn myself in?

999
01:10:09,562 --> 01:10:12,414
No way. That's never going to happen.

1000
01:10:13,285 --> 01:10:16,068
If only you hadn't left me
with no other options,

1001
01:10:17,635 --> 01:10:19,474
Ha Yoon Chul wouldn't have died.

1002
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:23,592
He shouldn't have abandoned me
for his daughter's sake!

1003
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:36,954
Mom was really the one who killed Dad?

1004
01:10:37,034 --> 01:10:40,116
After all I've done for Mom,

1005
01:10:40,196 --> 01:10:43,494
how is she still a monster?

1006
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:48,336
Now, do you believe?

1007
01:10:50,491 --> 01:10:51,965
I'm sorry...

1008
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:54,347
you had to see that.

1009
01:11:06,453 --> 01:11:08,116
Is this the police?

1010
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:10,149
I'm reporting a murderer.

1011
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:12,820
I know who really killed Oh Yoon Hee.

1012
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,578
I saw it.

1013
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:21,132
My mom killing Oh Yoon Hee.

1014
01:11:55,793 --> 01:11:57,508
It's over, Cheon Seo Jin.

1015
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,816
You finally made the foolish choice...

1016
01:12:03,376 --> 01:12:05,592
of being abandoned
even by your own daughter.

1017
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:07,333
What?

1018
01:12:09,677 --> 01:12:11,409
Eun Byeol has been watching.

1019
01:12:17,665 --> 01:12:18,979
Your lies.

1020
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:21,967
Your dirty wrongdoings. All of them.

1021
01:12:27,925 --> 01:12:30,075
It was Eun Byeol
who reported you to the police.

1022
01:12:44,201 --> 01:12:45,565
Shim Su Ryeon.

1023
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:48,746
Without you,

1024
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:51,638
my life would have been perfect.

1025
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:55,750
If only you hadn't shown up in my life!

1026
01:12:57,146 --> 01:12:59,320
My family would have remained intact.

1027
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:02,853
I wouldn't have gotten involved
with someone like Joo Dan Tae.

1028
01:13:03,398 --> 01:13:04,668
Eun Byeol and I,

1029
01:13:07,653 --> 01:13:09,371
including Yoon Chul,

1030
01:13:10,564 --> 01:13:12,877
my family could have been happy.

1031
01:13:12,957 --> 01:13:14,182
Happy?

1032
01:13:16,163 --> 01:13:18,198
You don't deserve that.

1033
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:22,745
That will never happen in your life now.

1034
01:13:34,383 --> 01:13:35,991
I can't die like this.

1035
01:13:37,243 --> 01:13:39,199
I can't die alone!

1036
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,470
Cheon Seo Jin. Don't do this.

1037
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,502
-Don't move!
-No!

1038
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:52,954
No!

1039
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:54,680
No, Mom!

1040
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,669
No!

1041
01:13:56,749 --> 01:13:58,045
Su Ryeon!

1042
01:13:59,315 --> 01:14:00,689
Shim Su Ryeon!

1043
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:05,193
Shim Su Ryeon!

1044
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:08,488
No.

1045
01:14:08,568 --> 01:14:11,241
I held on to her.

1046
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:12,552
I swear.

1047
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:14,216
Let's go!

1048
01:14:18,778 --> 01:14:19,996
Eun Byeol!

1049
01:14:20,076 --> 01:14:21,578
Someone has gone over Gimpo cliff.

1050
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:23,721
The suspect has been arrested.

1051
01:14:25,177 --> 01:14:27,394
Stop! You can't go that way.

1052
01:14:27,474 --> 01:14:30,226
-Su Ryeon!
-You can't go that way.

1053
01:14:30,306 --> 01:14:31,507
Su Ryeon!

1054
01:14:31,587 --> 01:14:33,746
-It's dangerous.
-Su Ryeon!

1055
01:14:33,826 --> 01:14:35,571
Calm down. It's dangerous.

1056
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:37,591
-Calm down.
-Stop this.

1057
01:14:37,671 --> 01:14:39,044
Su Ryeon!

1058
01:14:42,913 --> 01:14:44,554
Eun Byeol!

1059
01:15:32,103 --> 01:15:34,919
=The Penthouse 3=

1060
01:15:34,999 --> 01:15:37,288
What do you mean there's no signal?

1061
01:15:37,368 --> 01:15:39,095
-We have to find her.
-I didn't do it!

1062
01:15:39,175 --> 01:15:41,386
The tragedy started with me.

1063
01:15:41,466 --> 01:15:43,453
I don't know who that person is.

1064
01:15:43,533 --> 01:15:44,673
Congratulations on your first performance.

1065
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:45,963
You said you'd buy me pasta.

1066
01:15:46,043 --> 01:15:47,513
I've missed you, Ro Na.

1067
01:15:47,593 --> 01:15:49,866
Don't kill Seo Jin.

1068
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:51,962
I want to end everything now.

1069
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:53,473
I have people I have to meet.

1070
01:15:53,553 --> 01:15:55,171
Will you come with me, Logan?
