(10 hours ago)

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,312
That's nice and sweet.

Drink up.

Are you touched?

10
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,649
No matter how busy I am,
I can always buy you a drink.

Boss.

12
00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:04,628
Chairman Joo is suspecting you.

13
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:06,945
He thinks something's fishy
about the fountain repair work.

14
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:07,960
What?

15
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:09,796
So please...

16
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:14,334
Just stop here, I beg you.

17
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,985
I can't.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,694
The only proof of my innocence is there.

19
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:21,061
I can't let anyone take it.

-Boss!
-I said, I can't!

00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,129
How could you...

22
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:38,193
I don't want you to get hurt.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,391
-Take him to the cottage.
-Yes, sir.

My gosh!

28
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:22,042
You startled me!

29
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:23,142
You're home.

30
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,462
Mr. Joo isn't home yet.

31
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,304
Have this while you wait for him.

32
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:31,957
Put this away.

33
00:02:54,747 --> 00:02:55,947
Why am I so sleepy?

34
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:03,445
You must be tired.

35
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:05,507
Lie down in your bed.

36
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,697
What do we do now?

37
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,728
-What's going on?
-Take her away.

Stop it!

-What happened?
-Have you found Eun Byeol?

60
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,608
Not yet. The CCTV footage shows the car
passing through the Gimpo toll gate.

Yes, that's the car.

Well, this is the driver.

66

We don't have time for this.

67

I do, but I keep getting a bad feeling
in my stomach.

I'm so nervous.

139
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,207
If something happens to my mom,

140
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:34,567
I can't go on living.

She loves you too much
to let anything happen.

I'm sure nothing bad will happen.

145

Nothing.

146
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:06,387

Where's Yoon Hee? Tell me!

150
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,469
No one was here when I came.

151
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:34,650
Eun Byeol was lying here alone.

(Police)

153
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:39,880
I think Yoon Hee fell into the lake.

154
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,818
I heard a loud sound.
I'm sure something happened to her.

155
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,940
Please tell me what you saw
when you got here.

156
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:50,592
The fog was too dense to see much.

157
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:53,794
When I got here, I heard a scream.
So I came running...

158
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:55,525
and Eun Byeol was here alone.

159
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:58,548
Tell the truth!
Did you really not see Yoon Hee?

160
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:04,143
I really didn't see anything.

161
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,166
It looks like two cars fell off the cliff.

162
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:10,236
Please send a search team.

163

If Yoon Hee was in the car...

164
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:13,647
It's late and there's rain
in the forecast...

165
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:15,951
-Over here! Here!
-It won't be easy.

166
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:17,471
Once it gets light out...

167
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:20,697
How can we wait?
A person may die during that time.

168
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:23,102
Please find Yoon Hee quickly. Please.

169
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:25,044
Send in divers...

170
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,920
to search the lake.

171
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:30,836
-Yoon Hee!
-Get back!

172
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,618
Yoon Hee!

173
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:35,797
-Where are you, Yoon Hee?
-Get back!

174
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:37,349
Yoon Hee!

175
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:07,477
(Under Construction)

176
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:10,537
Shall we see...

177
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:13,860
what that punk Yoo Dong Pil
was looking for...

178
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:15,919
in here?

179
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:22,561
Did you find it?

180
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:25,013
It was in Oh Yoon Hee's pocket.

181
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:27,903
Okay.

182
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:30,580
(Test results)

183
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,435
(Shim Su Ryeon, Joo Seok Hoon)

184
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,415
(Subject 1 and Subject A2
are not a match.)

185
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:40,517
(Shim Su Ryeon, Joo Seok Kyung)

186
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,734
(Subject 1 and Subject A2 are a match.)

187
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:44,447
Yoon Hee.

188
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:47,381
I warned you...

189
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,424
to stay out of it.

190
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:53,874
This looks like a key to a safe.

191
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:55,301
A key to a safe?

192
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:12,121
Is this how Logan's riches
come into my possession?

193
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:16,707
This is why I can't fire you.

194
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:18,957
Every once in a while,

195
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:20,934
you're useful.

196
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,688
Yes... Ten billion dollars.

197
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:29,623
Yoon Hee.

198
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,215
We can't search right now.
The winds are too strong.

199
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:34,422
The way down the cliff is too dangerous.

200
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:36,443
What if you miss the golden time
by the time you get there?

201
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:38,444
Are you saying we should all die
looking for her?

202
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:41,760
Everyone will die if we continue.

203
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:45,380
The Dive Unit is getting ready,
so please wait.

204
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,646
Let's pull out!

205
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:51,847
Please...

206
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,916
Oh... Oh...

207
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:28,056
Oh Yoon Hee...

208
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:34,396
Why are you so shocked,

209
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,544
murderer Yoo Dong Pil?

210
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:38,493
Dan Tae.

211
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:43,403
It was bad enough that you hid
Kim Mi Sook's body in the fountain.

212
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,587
Did you kill and bury Yoon Hee as well?

213
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:49,022
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

214
00:15:49,102 --> 00:15:51,105
Who would believe that?

215
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,578
Look at the evidence right now.

216
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:58,027
Dan Tae, you demon.

217
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:01,263
You set this up. You rat.

218
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:02,988
Die, you rat!

219
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,198
You'll kill me too?

220
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:08,092
Just wait, you serial killer.

221
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:09,438
You rat.

222
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,689
What is it? What are you recording?

223
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:18,496
You're not working with this trash,
are you?

224
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:20,834
Help me. This rat needs to die.

225
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,704
Kill me if you can.

226
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:25,809
Your daughter will love that.

227
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,132
She'll love it if her dad becomes famous.

228
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:30,318
Think about Jenny, will you?

229
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:33,503
Don't say Jenny's name
with that disgusting mouth.

230
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,670
Let go of him, Yoo Dong Pil.

231
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,248
I said to let go!

232
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:45,382
How could you do this to me?

233
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:52,891
There was a reason
they never found Kim Mi Sook's body...

234
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,913
that was thrown off of Cheongpyeong Dam.

235
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,833
The body was in this fountain.

236
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:02,307
Why was that?

237
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:05,344
Yes... Was it because of this?

238
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:08,331
-Her cell phone.
-Give me that.

239
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:16,449
She was clutching this with all her might.

240
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,687
There's something amusing in it.

241
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,517
Evidence that I killed her.

242
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,488
Was that why you faked this construction?
To find this?

243
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,151
To stab me in the back?

244
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:37,054
I trusted you though.

245
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:38,883
How could you betray me?

246
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,973
Since when? Since six years ago?

247
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:45,039
You betrayed me first.

248
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,962
Why did you harass Jenny?

249
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:50,102
You promised to protect my family.

250
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:53,498
I had planned to keep my mouth shut
if you had kept your promise.

251
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,573
Why? Why did you harass Jenny?

252
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,259
You...

253
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,033
and Joo Seok Kyung.

254
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,347
I will make the both of you pay.

255
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:07,297
Oh, is that why
you killed my poor Seok Kyung too?

256
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:09,969
What nonsense is that?

257
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,913
Seok Kyung's at the cottage
you fell asleep in last night.

258
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,682
However much you hated her,

259
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,586
that kind of revenge is just dreadful.

260
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:21,992
I never saw Seok Kyung today!

261
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:23,343
The truth doesn't matter.

262
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:25,521
What matters is proof.

263
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:27,829
And the proof is irrefutable.

264
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:30,879
I have proof that...

265
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,584
you were at the cottage
until early morning.

266
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:35,482
I even created a lovely story where...

267
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:38,968
you bought Ha Eun Byeol's tutor
and even murdered Oh Yoon Hee.

268
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:42,510
Joo Dan Tae, you lunatic.

269
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:47,581
No, no. You're the lunatic.

270
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,729
The world will soon be captivated...

271
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:53,727
with the story of a psychopath.

272
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:58,557
"The culprit of the body-less
Cheongpyeong Dam murder..."

273
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,647
"from six years ago struck again."

274
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:04,178
"He killed a neighbour
who'd been harassing his daughter,"

275
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:07,519
"and left her body in
Hera Palace's fountain as if on display."

276
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,143
"He also kidnapped
and detained the ringleader who had..."

277
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:11,678
"bullied his daughter at school,"

278
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:13,957
"and caused her to die a dreadful death."

279
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:17,026
That's nonsense.
I didn't kill Oh Yoon Hee.

280
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:19,287
I didn't kill anyone!

281
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:23,636
You argued with her yesterday morning
by the fountain.

282
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:26,307
I bet most of Hera Palace's residents
saw you.

283
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:29,782
A doting dad found out his daughter
had been bullied at school,

284
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:33,430
and as soon as he was released,
he went after all the bullies.

285
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:38,420
Soon, the police will arrest you
in front of your daughter.

286
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:41,379
Don't worry about your family.

287
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:43,232
I'll kill them all.

288
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:47,720
Let's see.

289
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,106
It's Jenny.

290
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:01,527
Dad, why aren't you coming home?

291
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,914
Are you in trouble again?

292
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:09,031
Do you know how worried Mom and I are,
waiting up for you?

293
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:15,409
Your poor filial daughter Jenny
will be so disappointed.

294
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:18,134
She was reunited with her dad
after six years...

295
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:21,530
and now he has to rot in prison forever.

296
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:27,041
I deserve to die for what I did, sir!

297
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:28,860
Please let my family live.

298
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,398
I was crazy.

299
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:32,541
I'll do anything you want, sir.

300
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:35,170
How can I trust someone who betrayed me?

301
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,269
Go on.

302
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:39,161
Call the police
that we have a serial killer.

303
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,451
Ho Young. No, Ho Young. Don't.

304
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:46,474
My Jenny will really die!

305
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,875
No, sir, please.

306
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,422
Please, give me another chance.

307
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,179
Leave my family alone.

308
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,207
Sir. Chairman Joo.

309
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,990
My life now belongs to you.

310
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:02,440
Please, for old time's sake...

311
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:07,377
I am just too softhearted for my own good.

312
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:10,973
I'm trusting a man
who betrayed me once already.

313
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:12,572
But remember this.

314
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:15,874
Stab me in the back once more,

315
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:19,125
and your wife and daughter all die.

316
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:21,166
Thank you, sir.

317
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:25,155
I will remember your mercy
for the rest of my life.

318
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:26,677
Thank you.

319
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:31,007
First things first,
deal with Yoon Hee's body yourself.

320
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:33,705
I need something to trust you with.

321
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:42,294
Make sure she's found as soon as possible.

322
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:44,777
Let's not leave her in the cold water
for too long.

323
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,560
There are no noticeable injuries.

324
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,204
We'll run a thorough examination
once she wakes up.

325
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:36,932
Thank you.

326
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:48,888
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

327
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,480
Don't worry anymore.

328
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:54,523
Mom will protect you.

329
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,902
It's all over now.

330
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,634
It's really all over.

331
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,949
What happened? Did I fall asleep here?

332
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:36,763
Dad.

333
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,910
Hey. You're up.

334
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,081
Were you so tired
you couldn't wake when I shook you?

335
00:23:43,826 --> 00:23:45,176
I don't remember.

336
00:23:46,744 --> 00:23:48,397
Did I sleep all through the night?

337
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,069
You fell asleep having a snack.

338
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:53,309
It's for the best.
You need to release some stress.

339
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,869
Thanks to you, I watched a movie alone
and spent a boring night.

340
00:23:57,393 --> 00:23:58,495
Sorry.

341
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:01,100
It's fine. Let's have breakfast.
I ordered from a hotel.

342
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:03,599
Everybody else will be freaked out.

343
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,732
I never slept out without telling anyone.

344
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,097
Did Mom call?

345
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:10,228
No. Didn't you tell her you'd be here?

346
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:12,618
I didn't.

347
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:14,544
She doesn't know I'm here.

348
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:25,219
How come neither Mom nor Seok Hoon
called even once?

349
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:28,597
Are they not even worried?

350
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,241
They must be busy with something.

351
00:24:34,627 --> 00:24:37,469
Or are they grateful
the troublemaker's gone?

352
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,844
I'll take you home after breakfast.

353
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:43,747
No. I won't go home.

354
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,166
Why should I go back
when they don't care about me?

355
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:49,128
I'll only be an unwanted guest.

356
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,115
I'll wait and see when they call.

357
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,321
Can I stay here for a while?

358
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:58,678
Of course. Do whatever you want.

359
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:12,107
(Police)

360
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,068
-You can't go inside.
-We're family.

361
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:19,553
Mom. What happened?

362
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:20,899
Why are you here?

363
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,940
Ro Na was too worried to stay at home.

364
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,889
They found Eun Byeol. So where's my mom?

365
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:28,176
Did her car fall into the lake?

366
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:31,143
If they haven't found her yet,
does that mean she's dead?

367
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:34,209
-She can't swim.
-Why would she be dead?

368
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:36,108
They're still searching.
They'll find her soon.

369
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:39,071
I'm scared. I'm scared to death.

370
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,632
Let's brace ourselves and wait.

371
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:44,571
-It's coming up!
-They found something.

372
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:46,165
It's a car!

373
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:03,792
Yoon Hee, please.

374
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:08,007
Mom! Mom! Mom!

375
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:12,578
Mom...

376
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:17,476
Why won't your dad pick up?

377
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,238
-They fell off...
-He slept out without calling.

378
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:21,009
I don't believe this.

379
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:23,157
-It's being pulled up.
-What is he up to?

380
00:26:23,237 --> 00:26:25,015
Mom, look at that.

381
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:28,102
-Isn't that Ro Na's mom?
-They were both in the car.

382
00:26:28,182 --> 00:26:29,816
Ms. Oh kidnapped a neighbour,

383
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:31,596
Cheong A Arts High School
student Ms. Ha...

384
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:32,803
-and fled...
-A kidnapping?

385
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,531
-A kidnapping?
-They fell...

386
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:35,720
What's that about?

387
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,153
-Who is the Ha student?
-Three years ago...

388
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:40,660
-Is it Ha Eun Byeol?
-Cheong A Arts High School...

389
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,657
Ro Na's mom kidnapped Eun Byeol?

390
00:26:42,737 --> 00:26:44,392
That makes no sense.

391
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:47,253
Why would she get into trouble
during probation?

392
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,383
It's said she committed the crime
out of revenge.

393
00:26:49,463 --> 00:26:50,619
-Honey.
-Dad.

394
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:51,896
Where were you all night?

395
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:54,523
Did you watch the news?
It's crazy. They say...

396
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:55,773
Why won't you answer?

397
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:57,606
What's up with your father?

398
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,075
Answer when someone calls.

399
00:27:04,865 --> 00:27:07,239
What's up with your face?
Who did this to you?

400
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,634
Never mind.

401
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:11,608
Was it that jerk Joo Dan Tae?

402
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:16,493
Don't call him that from now on.

403
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:18,872
Should I say scumbag then?

404
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:22,855
Are you done with the job? What happened?

405
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,067
Did you succeed?

406
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:26,982
You said
the body was buried in the fountain.

407
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,724
You said you'd take it out soon.

408
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,982
It's all over.

409
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:32,906
I'm not going to get revenge.

410
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:35,289
I decided to obey Chairman Joo.

411
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:37,509
Did he threaten you?

412
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:40,638
He's the one who beat you up, right?

413
00:27:40,718 --> 00:27:44,516
-I swear that scumbag...
-Just stay the heck out of it!

414
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,998
I'll deal with it.

415
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,793
You don't do anything.

416
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:50,494
Don't go looking for Chairman Joo.

417
00:27:50,574 --> 00:27:55,734
Don't cause any more trouble
trying to uncover the truth.

418
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:57,066
Please!

419
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:03,345
Did you just yell at me?

420
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:11,532
Dad! Dad, come out!

421
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:14,745
Ro Na's mom disappeared in the lake.

422
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:16,352
No one knows where she is.

423
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,518
Are you listening to me? Dad!

424
00:28:19,877 --> 00:28:21,837
Can you...

425
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:32,575
Dad, we have a problem. Come out!

426
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:33,973
Dad!

427
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:36,336
You're driving me crazy.

428
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:43,130
After she was released,

429
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,401
the perpetrator once again
used her perverse maternal love...

430
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:47,718
to kidnap Cheong A Arts High School
student Ms. Ha,

431
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:49,471
causing great shock.

432
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,555
My goodness. That's insane.

433
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:56,731
It hasn't even been that long
since she was released. How dare she?

434
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:58,209
Did she just give up on life?

435
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:01,074
Why would she do that
after starting her business thing?

436
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:03,321
It's true that Ha Eun Byeol
was never fully punished.

437
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:05,084
She never apologized to Bae Ro Na.

438
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:08,086
They were fighting again
at school yesterday.

439
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,614
Ro Na can't forgive, can she?

440
00:29:10,694 --> 00:29:12,224
Serving time
at a reformatory wasn't enough?

441
00:29:12,304 --> 00:29:14,096
What else does she want?

442
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:16,603
Isn't it time she let it go?

443
00:29:16,683 --> 00:29:18,879
She's such a brat.

444
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,006
Even though Ms. Bae
was on the waiting list...

445
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:24,836
-Ms. Oh's crime caused...
-What?

446
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,412
I'm going to school.

447
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:27,703
No.

448
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:29,777
You're both wrong.

449
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:33,550
Things are unravelling very strangely now.

450
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,575
Do you know anything?

451
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:37,638
They still cannot find Ms. Oh.

452
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:41,724
She's not the kind of woman
who can disappear like that.

453
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:43,003
Oh Yoon Hee.

454
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:46,900
Then how should she disappear?

455
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,609
To do that, with all that money?

456
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:51,051
That makes no sense.

457
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:54,417
It's ten billion dollars! Ten billion.

458
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:58,404
Someone like that does something
that will put her on the news?

459
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:01,789
Everyone is paying attention
to Ms. Oh's whereabouts.

460
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:02,869
Amazing.

461
00:30:21,646 --> 00:30:22,710
What is this?

462
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:24,696
I thought it was ten billion.

463
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:27,924
Where is it?

464
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:31,676
What?

465
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,933
How are you here?

466
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:40,131
I'm here.

467
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:44,399
Kyu Jin always appears
when you least expect it.

468
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:46,056
Gosh.

469
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,278
You were going to take the ten billion
without even telling me?

470
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:51,874
I had this weird feeling...

471
00:30:51,954 --> 00:30:54,747
as soon as I heard the news
of Oh Yoon Hee gone missing.

472
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:57,634
Oh Yoon Hee. Did you do it?

473
00:30:57,714 --> 00:30:59,127
What are you talking about?

474
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:01,822
Then why do you have...

475
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:03,831
the key to Oh Yoon Hee's safe?

476
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:05,367
That...

477
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,829
Don't underestimate me.
I'm a lawyer, after all.

478
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:12,207
I'm not interested in the truth.

479
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,226
What I need is money.

480
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:17,604
Half the money for shutting me up.

481
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:19,814
Are you crazy?
Why would I split it halfway with you?

482
00:31:19,894 --> 00:31:24,776
Then should I reveal the truth
about the center to the police...

483
00:31:24,856 --> 00:31:27,763
as to how Oh Yoon Hee's key
ended up in your hands?

484
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:29,559
You're such a weasel.

485
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:33,347
Also, is this all there is?

486
00:31:33,781 --> 00:31:35,235
You said ten billion dollars!

487
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:36,631
Why are you acting out?

488
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,109
Where did all the money go?

489
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:41,857
Anyway, let's split everything...

490
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:44,921
in here in half. Okay?

491
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:48,932
With this, I shall buy
some Cheong A Art Center shares first.

492
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:52,173
I guess I am just meant
to be the Director.

493
00:31:52,797 --> 00:31:56,709
Wow. I never thought
Oh Yoon Hee could ever be helpful to us.

494
00:31:57,256 --> 00:31:58,849
Let's smile, okay?

495
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,024
Ten billion.

496
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:25,422
That Oh Yoon Hee...

497
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:30,456
She toys with you.

498
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:34,303
When did she hide all the money?

499
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:38,245
Can it be...?

500
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:41,577
Could she have taken it out then?

501
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,690
Look into everyone
Oh Yoon Hee met with recently.

502
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,162
Her phone records, activities,
and her mail... Search everything.

503
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:51,311
Yes, sir.

504
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:52,802
Hey.

505
00:32:56,283 --> 00:32:57,268
Here's your tip.

506
00:32:57,783 --> 00:33:00,255
Thank you. Thank you so much.

507
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:06,527
Thank you, Chairman! Thank You.

508
00:33:07,624 --> 00:33:08,816
You did well.

509
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:15,957
Where is that crazy girl right now?

510

(The Kidnapping of Ha Eun Byeol:
Emergency Press Conference)

511
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:34,045
My name is Jin Bun Hong.

512
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:36,484
I am here...

513
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:40,090
to uncover the truth
behind the kidnapping of Ha Eun Byeol...

514
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:42,233
as reported in the news today.

515
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,627
Who kidnapped Ha Eun Byeol?

516
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:46,224
Is it Oh Yoon Hee?

517
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:49,104
Yes, it is.

518
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:54,885
Oh Yoon Hee used her daughter Bae Ro Na...

519
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,467
to confine Eun Byeol in her house.

520
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:04,668
As proof, I share with you
the security footage from Hera Palace.

521
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:07,108
(The Kidnapping of Ha Eun Byeol:
Emergency Press Conference)

522
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:14,309
After learning that truth,

523
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,216
I barely succeeded in saving Eun Byeol
and running away,

524
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:20,301
when I was caught by Oh Yoon Hee.

525
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:24,029
Oh Yoon Hee kept following my car.

526
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:28,522
She eventually followed me to Gimpo.

527
00:34:29,642 --> 00:34:30,768
And then...

528
00:34:31,715 --> 00:34:33,938
she tried to kill Eun Byeol and me...

529
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:36,763
by pushing my car off the cliff.

530
00:34:37,877 --> 00:34:40,451
And I risked my life...

531
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,161
to get Eun Byeol out of the car...

532
00:34:43,724 --> 00:34:45,247
and help her escape.

533
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:49,461
Oh Yoon Hee and I got into a fight.

534
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:54,103
Then she fell off the cliff.

535
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:57,138
Why was Oh Yoon Hee
trying to kill Ha Eun Byeol?

536
00:34:57,218 --> 00:34:58,418
Oh Yoon Hee...

537
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:01,819
deliberately put a phone
in Eun Byeol's pocket...

538
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:05,027
at the SNU vocal performance test,

539
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:06,740
causing her to fail.

540
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,776
I, of course, brought this up to SNU,

541
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:14,310
and Oh Yoon Hee's daughter...

542
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:16,601
was also disqualified for cheating.

543
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,578
So Oh Yoon Hee held a grudge.

544
00:35:19,658 --> 00:35:21,834
She constantly
threatened Eun Byeol and me,

545
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:26,580
saying she'd kill us all.

546
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,796
Then why were you not at the scene?

547
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:32,985
I was scared.

548
00:35:33,658 --> 00:35:35,992
I felt like it was all my fault...

549
00:35:36,496 --> 00:35:38,416
that Eun Byeol ended up like that.

550
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:41,122
So...

551
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:43,516
I ran.

552
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:48,668
I worked as a housekeeper...

553
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:52,507
at the wealthy Korean-American
Logan Lee's house.

554
00:35:53,393 --> 00:35:57,133
Logan Lee colluded with Oh Yoon Hee,

555
00:35:57,913 --> 00:36:01,148
sending me to be Eun Byeol's tutor.

556
00:36:01,707 --> 00:36:05,312
Offering me a great sum of money
I couldn't possibly refuse,

557
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:07,346
he told me...

558
00:36:08,052 --> 00:36:10,195
to destroy Eun Byeol.

559
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:16,711
I knew it was the wrong thing to do,

560
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:20,513
but I drugged Eun Byeol...

561
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,051
to hinder her studying.

562
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,732
Oh Yoon Hee...

563
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:31,487
told me to stop Eun Byeol
from singing ever again...

564
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,480
but I just couldn't do it.

565
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,453
Because Eun Byeol ended up...

566
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:41,585
being a daughter figure to me.

567
00:37:00,173 --> 00:37:01,651
Where's my daughter?

568
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:03,646
Where did you hide my daughter?

569
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,116
Your daughter?

570
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:10,454
You're crazier than I thought.

571
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:13,333
All I did is leave Eun Byeol with you
for a while.

572
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:15,164
And now you think she's your own daughter?

573
00:37:15,244 --> 00:37:18,686
If you laid a finger on Eun Byeol,
Joo Dan Tae,

574
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:20,551
I'll kill you with my own hands!

575
00:37:20,631 --> 00:37:23,025
I didn't lay a finger on her...

576
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,881
and sent her back to her mom.

577
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:27,192
You sent her back?

578
00:37:28,151 --> 00:37:31,506
You promised you'd give her to me.
Did you forget that I helped you?

579
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:33,879
I'm the one who separated Eun Byeol
from Seo Jin.

580
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:37,347
This isn't the time
for worrying about Eun Byeol.

581
00:37:37,698 --> 00:37:40,694
You might get arrested for kidnapping.

582
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,478
Then you'll never be able
to see Eun Byeol again.

583
00:37:43,558 --> 00:37:44,705
Is that okay?

584
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,601
What... What do you want me to do?

585
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:52,736
Hold a press conference immediately...

586
00:37:53,102 --> 00:37:55,506
and announce that
it was all Oh Yoon Hee's doing.

587
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:58,551
That it was Oh Yoon Hee's idea
to kidnap and try to kill Eun Byeol.

588
00:37:58,631 --> 00:38:01,846
You're crazy. How can I trust you?

589
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:03,744
Do you still think I'm on your side?

590
00:38:05,921 --> 00:38:08,164
If you really want Eun Byeol,

591
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:10,786
pin everything on Oh Yoon Hee.

592
00:38:11,187 --> 00:38:16,167
Then I'll make sure Ha Eun Byeol
becomes your daughter.

593
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:20,659
Why don't we say...

594
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:24,057
this concludes our deal?

595
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:31,590
Here are bank transfers...

596
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:34,546
from Oh Yoon Hee to me.

597
00:38:36,255 --> 00:38:39,573
Every time I was tormented by guilt...

598
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:41,480
and told her I wanted to quit,

599
00:38:41,938 --> 00:38:44,203
she threatened to reveal everything...

600
00:38:45,414 --> 00:38:46,983
and shut my mouth.

601
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,253
I sincerely apologize to everyone
in the country.

602
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:57,627
I don't care if I get struck by lightning
or sentenced to death...

603
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,778
as long as...

604
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:03,048
Oh Yoon Hee is punished as well.

605
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:08,614
I don't want Eun Byeol to suffer anymore.

606
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:13,861
I'm really sorry.

607
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:15,861
I'm sorry.

608
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:17,753
I'm sorry.

609
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,949
I'm so sorry.

-What do you mean?

Yoon Hee was only following her
to save Eun Byeol.

What?

627

Oh Yoon Hee could've followed Eun Byeol
to kill her.

even killed Min Seol A.

630

and is missing right now.

How could you talk that way about her?

I know for a fact that Ms. Jin
and Oh Yoon Hee were conspiring.

makes my blood boil.

636

The reason Logan sent Jin Bun Hong
to your place...

637
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:39,472
was to keep an eye on you.

Did you want to ask Eun Byeol
what happened to her?

Yoon Hee is all over the news.

654

She would never do such a thing
to Eun Byeol.

Do you know her so well?

656

I still can't understand
why you changed all of a sudden.

mean anything to you anymore?

00:42:06,198 --> 00:42:09,073
Why did you stand by
and watch Ms. Jin destroy her?

660
00:42:09,564 --> 00:42:12,701
Now that Bae Ro Na survived,
do you suddenly feel guilty?

661
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,823
Do you suddenly feel bad
for what you did to Oh Yoon Hee?

662
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:19,163
I've done my best for you
and Eun Byeol all my life.

663
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:20,772
Isn't that enough?

664
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:23,439
Do you feel wronged?
Is it driving you crazy?

665
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:25,773
Does it break your heart
that Oh Yoon Hee suffered?

666
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:27,327
Too bad.

667
00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:30,812
You'll never see Oh Yoon Hee again.

668
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,115
What do you mean by that?

669
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,619
Don't tell me something happened to her.

670
00:42:41,178 --> 00:42:42,418
Please tell me that's not true.

671
00:42:42,784 --> 00:42:43,914
I'm not sure.

672
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:46,411
Who knows?

673
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:01,597
(Living Gositel)

674
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:09,727
This morning,
it's minus 2.3 degrees Celsius in Seoul.

675
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:11,727
It's the coldest morning this fall.

676
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:15,614
During the day, the cold wind
will stop the temperature from rising.

677
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,999
Today's highs will be around
three degrees Celsius in Seoul,

678
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,027
and the cold wind...

679
00:43:20,927 --> 00:43:22,817
("Human Physiology")

680
00:43:22,997 --> 00:43:26,967
(Yoon Chul, I hope you become
a great doctor. Yours, Yoon Hee)

681
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:31,887
Due to the formation of a cloud band,
some regions will...

682
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,577
see two to three centimetres of snow
for the next few days.

683
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:39,381
North Chungnam will also see less
than five centimetres of snow.

684
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:41,597
From 11:00 AM today...

685
00:43:50,287 --> 00:43:51,406
Yoon Hee.

686
00:43:52,483 --> 00:43:53,848
You're safe, right?

687
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:57,061
Nothing bad happened, right?

688
00:43:57,441 --> 00:43:59,790
The suspect
in the high school girl kidnapping case...

689
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,270
was found dead this afternoon.

690
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:06,139
Her body was found
about 500 metres away...

691
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:08,358
from where the car
fell by a private diver.

692
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:12,906
Apart from the injury caused by the fall,
no signs of murder were found.

693
00:44:13,393 --> 00:44:17,178
The suspect, Ms. Oh,
had served three years in prison...

694
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:19,994
for murdering Cheong A
Arts High School's top student.

695
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,464
But right after her release,

696
00:44:21,544 --> 00:44:23,242
she committed
yet another horrible crime...

697
00:44:23,322 --> 00:44:26,433
out of her obsession with her child.

698
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:28,605
The police will search Ms. Oh's body...

699
00:44:28,685 --> 00:44:31,941
for any evidence related to her crime...

700
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:34,827
and hand over her body to her family.

701
00:44:35,227 --> 00:44:37,018
After acquiring her body,

702
00:44:37,098 --> 00:44:39,398
the police are reviewing footage
from the cars at the scene...

703
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:44,462
and interviewing witnesses
to find out what exactly happened.

704
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:48,748
Based on the recent statement
of the girl's tutor, Ms. Jin,

705
00:44:48,828 --> 00:44:51,146
the police are looking
into whether the obsessive murderer...

706
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:53,348
committed any additional crimes.

707
00:44:53,705 --> 00:44:57,004
The shocking crime committed
by the obsessive murderer...

708
00:44:57,084 --> 00:44:58,114
It's a lie.

709
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,601
It's all a lie!

710
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:34,383
Mom, why is your face so pale?

711
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:36,867
Are you cold?

712
00:45:38,948 --> 00:45:42,355
Seok Hoon,
my mom looks like she's freezing, right?

713
00:45:50,342 --> 00:45:54,484
My beautiful mom, why are you lying here?

714
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,196
Come home with me, okay?

715
00:45:58,479 --> 00:46:00,364
I'll be good from now on.

716
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,880
I won't make you worry.

717
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,778
I'll do as you say.

718
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:06,943
So please wake up right now.

719
00:46:08,193 --> 00:46:10,150
Mom, please.

720
00:46:13,484 --> 00:46:15,661
Ro Na, calm down.

721
00:46:31,108 --> 00:46:32,211
Yoon Hee.

722
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:36,771
Yoon Hee.

723
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,785
It's not true.
It's not true, is it, Yoon Hee?

724
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:44,959
Yoon Hee,
you can't leave me alone like this.

725
00:46:45,492 --> 00:46:46,499
Yoon Hee.

726
00:46:48,311 --> 00:46:49,330
Yoon Hee.

727
00:46:58,813 --> 00:47:00,961
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

728
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:02,410
I'm sorry...

729
00:47:02,835 --> 00:47:05,637
so please get up. Get up, Yoon Hee.

730
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:07,245
Yoon Hee.

731
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:20,252
The family requested an autopsy.

732
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:22,426
Don't worry.

733
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,332
What could they find on a body
that was in the water?

734
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:26,527
You may go.

735
00:47:36,891 --> 00:47:39,957
Dan Tae! It was you, wasn't it?

736
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:41,471
You did it, didn't you?

737
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:44,111
What did I do? Let go of me!

738
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,157
You told Seo Jin...

739
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:48,722
that I was buying shares
of Cheong A Art Center!

740
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:50,575
Do you think I have nothing better to do?

741
00:47:50,655 --> 00:47:52,889
I haven't seen her all day!

742
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:57,120
Then how did she intercept
Yoon Hee's shares just before I got them?

743
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,295
Seo Jin got Yoon Hee's shares?

744
00:48:01,399 --> 00:48:03,620
You really didn't know?

745
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,258
Hey... If Seo Jin gets those shares,

746
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:10,239
it'll flip the table completely!

747
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,050
With her original 15 percent
and Yoon Hee's 20 percent...

748
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:18,592
Seo Jin will become the director
of Cheong A Art center.

749
00:48:23,218 --> 00:48:27,039
Seo Jin took Yoon Hee's shares.

750
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,007
I wanted that! It was mine!

751
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,341
-How did she know Yoon Hee died?
-I wanted it!

752
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:33,900
It was mine!

753
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,714
Things are getting interesting.

754
00:48:37,802 --> 00:48:40,572
I've put Oh Yoon Hee's shares
in your name...

755
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:43,395
and processed it as a donation.

756
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:45,982
Congratulations
on becoming the center director.

757
00:48:46,062 --> 00:48:47,190
Watch your mouth.

758
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,086
It hasn't been officially announced.

759
00:48:49,931 --> 00:48:52,106
Any word from the admissions office
at Seoul University?

760
00:48:52,186 --> 00:48:55,681
Some people are saying
Eun Byeol, the victim, should be saved.

761
00:48:55,761 --> 00:48:58,423
Over 100,000 people
signed the petition as well.

762
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:00,274
Good work.

763
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:03,260
Drive the public sentiment
focused on the community.

764
00:49:04,472 --> 00:49:07,165
Are you not going to the funeral?

765
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:13,577
Why must the victim's mom
go to the perpetrator's funeral?

766
00:49:14,072 --> 00:49:16,471
I'm not that magnanimous.

767
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:39,657
(The late Oh Yoon Hee)

768
00:50:35,939 --> 00:50:37,071
Sang A.

769
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,531
Kyu Jin didn't come?

770
00:50:41,129 --> 00:50:44,993
Someone who does big things
shouldn't go where there's bad energy.

771
00:50:45,073 --> 00:50:47,481
He's the only son of three generations.

772
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:49,942
He should avoid bad energy
as much as he can.

773
00:50:50,022 --> 00:50:51,831
What about Jenny's dad?

774
00:50:51,911 --> 00:50:54,540
He didn't know Yoon Hee.

775
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,909
He fought with someone he didn't know?

776
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,928
Everyone says the two of them
went at it...

777
00:51:00,008 --> 00:51:02,459
grabbing each other
by the collar yesterday.

778
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:05,282
My husband fought with Yoon Hee?

779
00:51:05,731 --> 00:51:06,792
But...

780
00:51:07,156 --> 00:51:11,592
Given the situation,
who will take over Yoon Hee's business?

781
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:14,884
It's in a good location
and has a lot of customers.

782
00:51:14,964 --> 00:51:16,135
I kind of want it.

783
00:51:17,805 --> 00:51:20,291
Are you working on it already?

784
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:22,754
How could you say that right now?

785
00:51:22,834 --> 00:51:24,405
I know.

786
00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:27,272
Why are you getting so mad?
Is it wrong to even talk?

787
00:51:27,352 --> 00:51:29,226
You shouldn't be like that.

788
00:51:29,306 --> 00:51:31,658
Love her or hate her,
she was our neighbour.

789
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:35,453
Don't you feel sorry for Yoon Hee
who died and left her child alone?

790
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:40,252
Mom. I'm going to stay with Ro Na.

791
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:42,699
Jenny. Don't go by yourself.

792
00:51:42,779 --> 00:51:44,073
I'll go with you.

793
00:51:45,641 --> 00:51:50,620
Gosh. Since when were they so close
to Yoon Hee? Give me a break.

794
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,336
Don't you agree, Min Hyuk?

795
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:53,780
Even I'm disappointed...

796
00:51:54,895 --> 00:51:56,089
in you.

797
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,654
-Over here. Hurry!
-This is it.

798
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:17,420
You're Oh Yoon Hee's daughter, right?

799
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,795
People are calling your mom
Admissions Murderer.

800
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:22,557
Your mom killed someone your age
to get you into Cheong A Arts High School.

801
00:52:22,637 --> 00:52:24,032
Don't you feel bad for the girl who died?

802
00:52:24,112 --> 00:52:25,840
Don't you want to say something
to Ha Eun Byeol?

803
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,139
Say a word.

804
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:29,019
What are you doing? This is a funeral!

805
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:31,351
-She lost her mom.
-Shim Su Ryeon?

806
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:33,302
Aren't you Min Seol A's biological mother?

807
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:37,117
If you hadn't gone easy on Oh Yoon Hee,
there never would've been a second victim.

808
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:38,296
What do you say to that?

809
00:52:38,376 --> 00:52:39,917
How was Oh Yoon Hee released?

810
00:52:39,997 --> 00:52:41,207
Was there an improper dealing?

811
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:44,022
Please refrain from statements
that slander the deceased.

812
00:52:44,124 --> 00:52:47,389
What is being reported by the media
is far from the truth.

813
00:52:47,885 --> 00:52:51,555
Oh Yoon Hee
is not the type of person you think.

814
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:54,778
Seok Hoon. Take Ro Na out of here.

815
00:52:54,858 --> 00:52:56,700
-Shim Su Ryeon...
-How do you feel?

816
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,803
Please, comment.

817
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,453
-Ro Na!
-Ro Na.

818
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:07,864
Hey, you! What's going on?

819
00:53:07,944 --> 00:53:09,689
Who are you people?

820
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,885
Get away from her.

821
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:14,549
You jerks. How dare you?

822
00:53:15,768 --> 00:53:17,163
Mom!

823
00:53:17,243 --> 00:53:18,805
Ro Na!

824
00:53:23,457 --> 00:53:25,661
Get out!

825
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,642
You seem to be in a good mood.

826
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:57,736
Is it because that woman Oh Yoon Hee died?

827
00:53:57,816 --> 00:53:59,492
Are you still here?

828
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:03,779
Did you not like the luxury hotel
that I booked for you?

829
00:54:05,021 --> 00:54:06,276
I told you.

830
00:54:06,673 --> 00:54:09,377
I won't step foot outside of here...

831
00:54:10,745 --> 00:54:13,383
until you give me 50 percent
of Cheong A Group's shares.

832
00:54:14,106 --> 00:54:16,641
There isn't much time.
You have until this weekend.

833
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:20,128
If your true identity is revealed,
forget the business in Cheonsoo District.

834
00:54:20,868 --> 00:54:23,125
You won't be able to live in this country.

835
00:54:24,024 --> 00:54:25,397
Is that okay with you?

836
00:54:25,477 --> 00:54:28,109
You need to be reasonable
if you want to negotiate.

837
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:31,450
Should I prove in court
who the real Joo Dan Tae is?

838
00:54:32,324 --> 00:54:35,146
All the bank accounts and property
that you obtained in my name...

839
00:54:35,226 --> 00:54:36,755
will become mine.

840
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,525
You'll return to being the murderer
Baek Jun Ki.

841
00:54:40,605 --> 00:54:44,101
If you don't like that,
you can live as a ghost.

842
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,058
It's not so bad.

843
00:54:49,223 --> 00:54:52,407
♪Hide, hide well♪

844
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:54,928
♪I can see your hair♪

845
00:55:05,587 --> 00:55:07,417
Hey, Mr. Yoo. Where are you?

846
00:55:21,215 --> 00:55:22,442
What?

847
00:55:22,522 --> 00:55:23,935
Why are you so shocked?

848
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:28,001
Didn't you say you'd do everything
I order you to from now on?

849
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:31,168
Did you change your mind already?

850
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,694
No, Mr. Chairman.

851
00:55:34,844 --> 00:55:36,077
I'll do it.

852
00:55:38,697 --> 00:55:39,984
I'm relying on you.

853
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,276
I can't wait to see
how you get rid of that jerk Jun Ki.

854
00:55:49,297 --> 00:55:52,507
(Parking Lot, Procession)

855
00:55:55,779 --> 00:55:59,048
Don't go anywhere. Don't talk to anyone.

856
00:55:59,128 --> 00:56:00,230
I'll go to you now.

857
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,577
What is it?

858
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:04,238
I'll tell you in person.

859
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:05,877
It's very important.

860
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:09,478
Call Seok Kyung
and tell her to come home right now.

861
00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:11,818
And tell her not to answer the phone
if Dan Tae calls.

862
00:56:15,157 --> 00:56:18,627
What could it have been?
What was so important?

863
00:56:19,536 --> 00:56:21,513
Why did she ask for Seok Kyung?

864
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:25,193
What were you keeping from me, Yoon Hee?

865
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:34,156
The phone is turned off.

866
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:41,625
How's Ro Na?

867
00:56:42,718 --> 00:56:45,862
She hasn't slept at all
and won't eat anything.

868
00:56:46,358 --> 00:56:48,710
Stay with her and take care of her.

869
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,375
Don't leave her alone.

870
00:56:52,253 --> 00:56:54,086
Did you try calling Seok Kyung?

871
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,964
No.

872
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,423
Her phone's been off the whole day.

873
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:00,819
And she hasn't come home.

874
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:03,405
She's trying to make us worry.

875
00:57:03,835 --> 00:57:05,492
She decided to act out.

876
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:08,573
She must know if she saw the news,
and she hasn't been by.

877
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:15,695
Don't worry, Mom.

878
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:24,987
(The late Oh Yoon Hee)

879
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,261
Ro Na.

880
00:58:04,556 --> 00:58:05,733
I'm sorry.

881
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,345
I thought...

882
00:58:10,062 --> 00:58:12,699
I'd never show up in front of you again.

883
00:58:14,373 --> 00:58:15,647
How dare you...

884
00:58:16,795 --> 00:58:18,533
show your face here?

885
00:58:19,926 --> 00:58:22,468
What gives you the right to visit my mom?

886
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,335
Do you think...

887
00:58:26,323 --> 00:58:27,949
that little of Mom and me?

888
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:29,793
Ro Na.

889
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,663
What you did to me,

890
00:58:32,364 --> 00:58:33,671
I can put up with.

891
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,233
You bribed my piano accompanist,

892
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:40,730
and you faked Eun Byeol's evidence
and I can accept all that.

893
00:58:41,703 --> 00:58:44,079
You did it for your daughter's sake.

894
00:58:45,136 --> 00:58:46,255
But...

895
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:49,861
you shouldn't have treated my mom
like that.

896
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:52,834
My mom cared so much for you!

897
00:58:55,254 --> 00:58:56,439
I know that...

898
00:58:58,679 --> 00:58:59,958
nothing I say...

899
00:59:01,757 --> 00:59:03,644
can make you forgive me.

900
00:59:05,368 --> 00:59:07,378
But I wanted to ask for it.

901
00:59:09,237 --> 00:59:10,640
From you...

902
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:14,004
and from your mom.

903
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:17,152
Can you...

904
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:20,484
give me one more chance?

905
00:59:23,704 --> 00:59:24,801
A chance?

906
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:27,969
For what?

907
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,915
If my mom never forgave you,

908
00:59:32,351 --> 00:59:34,457
you have no chance with me either.

909
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:38,064
The fact that someone like you
were my dad for even a while...

910
00:59:38,144 --> 00:59:39,864
gives me the creeps!

911
00:59:41,098 --> 00:59:42,667
Don't come here again...

912
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,730
and don't act like you know me.

913
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,564
I don't want to see you again!

914
00:59:49,663 --> 00:59:50,911
Get out.

915
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:54,510
Get out of here!

916
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,053
Get out!

917
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:58,925
Get out of here now!

918
00:59:59,005 --> 01:00:01,735
Get out! Leave.

919
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:04,782
Get out of here.

920
01:00:09,057 --> 01:00:11,853
Get out! Leave!

921
01:00:12,469 --> 01:00:14,322
Leave!

922
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:33,724
Mom.

923
01:00:35,488 --> 01:00:36,812
I'm here.

924
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:41,002
I'm home.

925
01:00:43,053 --> 01:00:44,739
Ro Na's here.

926
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,776
Where are you? Where did you go?

927
01:00:50,278 --> 01:00:53,923
Mom! Mom, where are you?

928
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:57,574
Where did you go?

929
01:01:00,266 --> 01:01:01,371
Mom.

930
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,738
Where are you?

931
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:42,383
Hi!

932
01:01:44,264 --> 01:01:45,378
You're back.

933
01:01:47,482 --> 01:01:48,727
What happened to you?

934
01:01:49,421 --> 01:01:51,984
I couldn't reach you.
Where were you for days?

935
01:01:52,064 --> 01:01:53,709
You were too busy...

936
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:57,556
staying up at someone's funeral
to care if your daughter was alive.

937
01:01:57,636 --> 01:01:59,016
Why are you making a fuss now?

938
01:01:59,096 --> 01:02:01,698
Will you care about me
only when I'm dead too?

939
01:02:01,778 --> 01:02:03,750
Is that all you can say?

940
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,662
You should go and look after Ro Na.

941
01:02:08,742 --> 01:02:09,970
She's an orphan now.

942
01:02:10,721 --> 01:02:12,893
She's a lot like Min Seol A in many ways.

943
01:02:12,973 --> 01:02:14,188
Are you crazy?

944
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,191
Why are you acting like this?

945
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:18,695
Is this how you truly feel?

946
01:02:18,775 --> 01:02:20,962
Why don't you try to be honest for once?

947
01:02:21,382 --> 01:02:23,110
Ro Na's mom is dead.

948
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,332
Aren't you secretly pleased about it?

949
01:02:26,016 --> 01:02:29,956
That woman was punished
for killing your daughter.

950
01:02:31,288 --> 01:02:34,903
Please stop pretending to be good
and show how you really feel.

951
01:02:37,302 --> 01:02:38,842
I won't care anymore...

952
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,922
how you live your life
or what you do with your dad.

953
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,791
You're no longer my daughter.

954
01:02:46,785 --> 01:02:49,202
Now you're showing your true colours.

955
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:53,188
It's not like you treated me
like a daughter!

956
01:02:53,475 --> 01:02:55,725
Ma'am. Ma'am!

957
01:02:56,591 --> 01:02:58,621
Pack Seok Kyung's things
and send her away.

958
01:02:58,701 --> 01:03:00,635
And don't let her in again.

959
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:04,426
Change all the pass-codes
and clear out her room.

960
01:03:04,506 --> 01:03:05,899
Hye In will move into her room.

961
01:03:05,979 --> 01:03:07,299
Hye In?

962
01:03:07,379 --> 01:03:09,376
Oh, is that it?

963
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:12,337
You're throwing me out
to bring home your real kids?

964
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:13,646
Let go of me!

965
01:03:13,726 --> 01:03:15,492
Now you're being honest.

966
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:17,562
You're even worse than Dad.

967
01:03:17,642 --> 01:03:19,919
Dad didn't abandon me at least.

968
01:03:19,999 --> 01:03:21,989
Fine! Sure!

969
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:24,110
If that's what you want, I'll disappear!

970
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,203
Okay?

971
01:03:28,187 --> 01:03:29,285
Move.

972
01:03:35,005 --> 01:03:38,487
Don't even dream of coming back
unless you'll apologize to Mom.

973
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:41,301
Seeing the way you live...

974
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:43,574
makes me sick.

975
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,819
I don't need Mom anyway.

976
01:03:45,899 --> 01:03:48,896
I won't see her again. I won't!

977
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,407
("Paradise Lost")

978
01:04:20,259 --> 01:04:21,896
I bought it for you.

979
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:23,626
Read it when you can't sleep.

980
01:04:27,588 --> 01:04:28,847
Thank you.

981
01:04:29,037 --> 01:04:31,687
("Paradise Lost")

982
01:04:43,997 --> 01:04:46,257
Ms. Shim, you have a visitor.

983
01:04:48,897 --> 01:04:51,657

Do you drink purple tea?

985
01:05:01,557 --> 01:05:02,661
Yes.

986
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:09,163
The tea is actually purple.

987
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:13,188
It's a mysterious colour, just like you.

988
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,675
Are you making progress
with getting your name back?

989
01:05:21,398 --> 01:05:23,312
To put pressure on Joo Dan Tae,

990
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,579
you must
recover your legal identity first.

991
01:05:27,306 --> 01:05:30,120
That's why Logan brought you here.

992
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:34,013
Will you meet with my lawyer
when you're free?

993
01:05:34,998 --> 01:05:36,820
I was locked up for a while,

994
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,294
and everything is scary and new.

995
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,111
Okay, I'll join you.

996
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:44,035
It's what Logan wanted to do.

997
01:05:44,115 --> 01:05:45,567
Of course, I must help.

998
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,136
If...

999
01:05:51,237 --> 01:05:53,058
my parents hadn't died,

1000
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,841
and I was still living as Joo Dan Tae...

1001

You and I...

1002
01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:01,979
Would our fates have also changed?

1003
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:07,910
Never mind. Forget what I just said.

1004
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:15,212
Are you okay? Did you burn yourself?

1005
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:18,437
I'm fine. I'm going to go wash my hands.

1006
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,286
Where did she put it?

1007
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:36,779
Ten billion dollars.

1008
01:06:37,103 --> 01:06:40,275
What about the ten billion dollars
that you cashed up from real estate?

1009
01:06:40,355 --> 01:06:43,379
Is all that money for her too?
That money...

1010
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:46,566
That money
was meant for Seol A to begin with.

1011
01:06:46,646 --> 01:06:48,935
I've never thought of it as mine.

1012

What is this woman to you?

1013
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:53,885
I like her.

1014
01:06:54,403 --> 01:06:57,477
I want to spend my newly-given life
on her.

1015
01:06:57,968 --> 01:07:00,179
My heart. And all my money.

1016
01:07:16,442 --> 01:07:17,726

Didn't you promise you'd do anything
if I got you out of prison?

Are you sure Joo Dan Tae
thinks you're his man?

How many times have I told you?

I'm lying down like a dog
and licking his feet.

1034

Is that good enough?

1035
01:08:58,364 --> 01:09:00,936
You have to make sure Joo Dan Tae
gives you his absolute trust.

Why are you doing this to me?

01:09:10,864 --> 01:09:13,624
You have to earn your money.

1041

No such thing as a free lunch.

1042

Tell me what I need to do.

1043
01:09:23,975 --> 01:09:26,743
But if it's related to Joo Dan Tae,
I won't do it anymore.

1044

It's past midnight.

Go out the back door
to make sure no one follows you.

1048
01:09:37,322 --> 01:09:38,557
I'll give you an hour.

will ruin Chairman Joo's day.

Exactly. This is the best comeback ever!

1062

How can the person who ranked lowest
be the only one to get into SNU?

1063

What's the point
of always being top of class?

1064
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:58,079
You still can't beat the lucky one.

1065
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,609
I'm not the only one who got in.

1066
01:12:03,553 --> 01:12:05,304
No way. There's someone else?

1067

What?

1070
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,773
Has there ever been a case...

1071
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:15,960
where they re-selected
a disqualified candidate?

1072
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,859
Wasn't there a national petition?

1073
01:12:18,939 --> 01:12:21,470
Maybe Ms. Cheon used her network.

1074

than Chairman Joo.

She ended up making the one person
who was bothering her...

1082
01:12:43,843 --> 01:12:47,006
just disappear like that. No?
