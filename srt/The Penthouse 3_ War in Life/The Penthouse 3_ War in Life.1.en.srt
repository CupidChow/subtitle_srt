4
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,764
-Gosh.
-What is all this?

5
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,545
What did you do before coming in here?

6
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:45,261
-Me?
-Yes.

7
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:47,953
Why would you ask
such a miserable question?

8
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:49,908
-Shoot.
-What about you?

9
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:51,503
Are you married?

10
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,983
No, I'm not.

11
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,942
Did you have a bad dream, Chairman?

12
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:59,422
It's uncomfortable sleeping here,
isn't it?

13
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:01,895
How do you expect me
to live in a dump like this?

14
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,566
This is so far from decent,
and why are there so many bugs?

15
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,213
You know, there's a place
they call the penthouse of the prison.

16
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,682
They remodelled it last year,
so it's way more spacious than here,

17
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:15,259
and the bathrooms are clean.

18
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,590
All the rich ones
have gathered there already.

19
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:20,771
If you bribe the guard a little,
it should be enough.

20
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:23,960
The prison penthouse?

21
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,323
Kyu Jin can't do it.

22
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,173
What did you say? You can't do it?

23
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:33,503
I was an attorney at a major law firm.

24
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:36,780
When I was in Gangnam,
I was even an assemblyman.

25
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,517
What use is any of that in prison?

26
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,374
That's not how it works here.

27
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:45,373
But yesterday, and the day before,
and the day before that,

28
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,894
Kyu Jin did all the dishes.

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,317
Why, you...

30
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:52,198
Affair, unbridled love,
unparalleled achievement.

31
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:54,844
I was an attorney
who specialized in doing dishes.

32
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,620
I'll make sure
every dish is sparkling clean.

33
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:58,867
Gosh.

34
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,039
Who does the dishes in the bathroom?

35
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,104
Honey.

36
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,492
Sang A...

37
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,194
Sang A.

38
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,274
Gosh, Sang A.

39
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,055
Sang A, Sang A!

40
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,815
I miss you.

41
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:32,231
Sang A...

42
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:35,525
How is it on your side?

43
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:37,969
How?

44
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:45,903
My dear.

45
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,022
Your neck looks a bit tense.

46
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:54,692
Should I show you
how skilled my hands are?

47
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,786
-Okay.
-Okay?

48
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,918
That's so refreshing. That's great.

49
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,867
Before I came in here,

50
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,569
my nickname was Lumber and Brick.

51
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:15,070
You need more than three hours
to break the brick in my shoulders.

52
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:17,673
Wow, your hands really are skilled.

53
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,805
You have to
really get your pressure points,

54
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:22,948
and relieve the tension there.

55
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:26,365
You must've suffered
from this slipped disc here.

56
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,693
While I'm here,

57
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,911
I'll make sure you recover completely.

58
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:35,651
I've met a great doctor in prison.

59
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:37,561
Of course, I'm an expert.

60
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:40,834
Hey, 4815, bring me the snacks.

61
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,403
Now.

62
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,959
That looks really tasty.

63
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:49,840
(Matdongsan Peanut Crunch Snack)

64
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,165
Here, some special praise.

65
00:04:56,438 --> 00:04:58,096
Gosh.

66
00:04:58,162 --> 00:05:02,394
I wasn't doing all that
just to get this from you,

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,633
but I'll eat it gratefully.

68
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:13,100
5450.

69
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,240
Hang them up on this side.

70
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:17,324
The light's better here.

71
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,965
How do you adjust so well to this place?

72
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:23,512
After coming here,
I never got a good night's sleep.

73
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:25,652
But you eat well, sleep well,

74
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:27,258
and poop well too.

75
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,678
Does prison life suit you?

76
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:32,935
Have you done this before?

77
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:37,555
Everywhere people live, it's all the same.

78
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,247
You want?

79
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,613
Sang A, you have no social skills.

80
00:05:48,543 --> 00:05:52,964
After coming here,
I do feel I lived my life in vain.

81
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:58,697
But have you seen Cheon Seo Jin
at all today?

82
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:02,214
No. She said she had a meeting
with her lawyers in the morning.

83
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,666
But why isn't she back yet?

84
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:06,481
They cut off all our visits
the second they're over.

85
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,477
Our visits are ordinary visits,

86
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:11,890
and she's getting a special,
golden session with her lawyers.

87
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:14,775
And that's exactly what rank is.

88
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,932
Just because we're all wearing
the same clothes in here,

89
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:20,117
it doesn't mean
we're all living the same lives.

90
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:22,921
This place is just like Hera Palace.

91
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:24,939
The one in the penthouse.

92
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,852
The ones on the upper floors, like me.

93
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,688
And the ones on the lower floors,
like you.

94
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:33,467
What? Why am I the lower one?

95
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:36,604
I'm the wife of an Assemblyman.

96
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:42,781
I heard your in-laws
want nothing to do with you.

97
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:47,283
Just shake out the laundry really well
and hang it up,

98
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,684
if you want to survive from here.

99
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,288
(Lawyer Meeting Room)

100
00:06:56,318 --> 00:06:59,828
After the Cheong A Foundation
went over to your mother,

101
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:03,377
I mean, to the lady in Seongbuk-dong,

102
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:05,801
Cheong A Group's stock prices
fell by half.

103
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,841
The shareholders' discontent is growing.

104
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,513
There's even talk
of dismissing the director...

105
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,064
pending the results of the appeal.

106
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:15,781
That's why I'm telling you
to prepare well for the appeal.

107
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,889
I'm telling you to find a way
to get me out on insufficient evidence.

108
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:22,734
That way, I can also recover
my Cheong A Foundation.

109
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:26,446
There's a rumour that the lady
in Seongbuk-dong...

110
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,017
is selling off the Cheong A Foundation.

111
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,965
Apparently, there's already a buyer too.

112
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,142
What?

113
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:35,301
That's absurd.

114
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,715
How dare she do what she wants
with my foundation?

115
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,002
Who's the buyer?

116
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:40,654
That is...

117
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:43,782
Is it...

118
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:47,839
Shim Su Ryeon?

119
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:50,305
(Provisions for the sale
of Cheong A Foundation)

120
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:54,825
I had no idea you'd be selling
the foundation so quickly.

121
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:57,937
I had no interest in it.

122
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,959
It was my husband's obsession.

123
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:02,532
But right now,
the foundation has been ruined...

124
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:03,982
because of my sister.

125
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,993
Why are you trying to buy it now?

126
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,777
Why are you asking something like that?

127
00:08:07,843 --> 00:08:10,527
You were curious about it too, Mom.

128
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:12,503
To be honest, an academic foundation...

129
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,822
won't earn you any money either.

130
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,816
Is it nobles oblige?

131
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,023
Oh, money laundering.

132
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,284
So that's how you ran the foundation
up till now.

133
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,949
And that's why it had done
such outrageously corrupt things.

134
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:31,038
Check the terms.

135
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:34,058
I'd like to finalize the acquisition
right away.

136
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,726
I'll try to sign it as soon as possible.

137
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,787
I have good news, Mom.

138
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,903
What is it?

139
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:47,211
Mr. Ma says...

140
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,388
with the principal's
recommendation letter,

141
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,432
I'll get a free pass
to Seoul University of Music.

142
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:53,258
I was worried,
but I don't have to anymore.

143
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,583
Aren't you happy?

144
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,080
I just have to stay healthy
until the performance test.

145
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:58,426
Seok Kyung.

146
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:02,318
You don't have to go
to Seoul University of Music.

147
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:06,466
And you don't have to sing anymore
if you don't want to.

148
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:09,802
Weren't you singing against your will
because of Dad?

149
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,808
I didn't want to sing
while getting beat up.

150
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:14,789
I didn't mean I hated singing.

151
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,868
I have to go
to Seoul University of Music...

152
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:19,878
before studying abroad
if I want to become a top vocalist.

153
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:22,793
I want you to enjoy doing what you do...

154
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:26,034
rather than just being famous.

155
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:29,453
Don't worry about what others think.

156
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,400
Do what makes you happy.

157
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:34,209
Who succeeds by doing
only what makes them happy?

158
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,624
Dad said...

159
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,636
we must pay our dues somehow
if we don't want to live like pigs.

160
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:43,222
I respect him in that sense.

161
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:45,640
I never saw him sleep
for more than three hours a day.

162
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:47,546
You came early.

163
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:50,066
Hi. You're just on time.

164
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,171
Hello. Have a seat.

165
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:54,800
You called Ro Na too?

166
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,463
The performance test is coming up.

167
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,358
Let's all enjoy some good food.

168
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:03,231
I've been seeing you often lately.

169
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,782
Aren't you working today?

170
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:07,991
It must be nice having time
to kill since you're not going to college.

171
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,399
You're not going to college?

172
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:11,016
Didn't you know?

173
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:13,032
She's not taking the CSAT.

174
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:15,522
She stopped practicing a while ago.

175
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:18,030
Why? You even won the grand prize.

176
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:21,143
When did you decide this?

177
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,468
Why?

178
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:24,715
Why are you getting so worked up?

179
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,055
It's her life.

180
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:33,082
Okay. Let's order the main dishes first.

181
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:34,765
What do you want, Ro Na?

182
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:46,644
This is the money you gave me last time.

183
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,423
I can't accept it.

184
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:50,455
Why not?

185
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:53,046
I'm filling in for your mom
until she gets out.

186
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,843
I'm making money.

187
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,576
I can manage on my own.

188
00:10:57,598 --> 00:11:00,660
Ro Na. You're too talented...

189
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,005
to give up on singing.

190
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:05,325
If you get into the college that you want,

191
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,853
it'll be of great comfort for your mom.

192
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,634
I can't. I'm not that shameless.

193
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,551
You know how I got
into Cheong A Arts High School.

194
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,361
That was not your fault.

195
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:17,110
Your mom is paying for her crime...

196
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:22,603
Think about it some more and then decide.

197
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:26,248
I really want to see you...

198
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:31,537
grow and develop into a great vocalist.

199
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:37,768
Your neck must be cold.

200
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:44,307
You can't catch a cold before the exam.

201
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:48,919
Take it.

202
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,318
Let's go. The food will get cold.

203
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:15,838
(Establish Law and Order)

204
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:46,608
(Caution -Slippery)

205
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:06,908
Joo Dan Tae. You don't deserve to live.

206
00:13:06,974 --> 00:13:10,111
I'll slit your throat
with my own two hands.

207
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:20,188
It isn't common to get moved
to another room midway like this.

208
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:21,853
You're a lucky man.

209
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,626
It isn't luck. It's all about money.

210
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,463
Right.

211
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:30,708
Hey! Look over here! Over here!

212
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,568
(As long as there is hope,
you can start again.)

213
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,602
Hey you! Guards!

214
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:41,919
Seriously! I know you hear me!

215
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:44,955
I wish you luck, Joo Dan Tae.

216
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,311
What is this?

217
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,444
Why are you here?

218
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,883
Hey, Lifer Joo.

219
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,497
What?

220
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:17,953
Who did that?

221
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,667
You should introduce yourself
when you move into a new room.

222
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:22,081
To our boss.

223
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:24,098
Hi, newbie.

224
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:27,753
Newbie? Have you lost your...

225
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,345
This is my room.

226
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,363
Do you know how much money I spent
to get in here?

227
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:36,930
Quiet.

228
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:41,831
I say everything with this one finger.

229
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:44,730
And I decide the rules of this room.

230
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:45,999
What...

231
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:49,878
I will assign everyone's spot for today.

232
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:09,635
Give me a break.

233
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:12,617
Why am I next to the bathroom?
It stinks there!

234
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,976
Why are you banning me
from seeing my lawyer?

235
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,061
It's a right granted by law...

236
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,333
Do you know what garbage
we're going through because of you?

237
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,087
People are complaining that
you are being treated like royalty.

238
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,606
There are thousands
of nasty online comments.

239
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:42,730
You can only have regular visits
for the time being.

240
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:46,090
It is the warden's orders,
so just accept it.

241
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:47,675
You can't do that.

242
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:50,157
My appeal is just around the corner.
You can't keep me from my lawyer.

243
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:52,379
Are you telling me
to rot in here for seven years?

244
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:53,921
We have rights in this country.

245
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,406
I'm going to file a complaint.
Do you think I'll just take this?

246
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:57,504
Hey!

247
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,081
Why you...

248
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:02,355
Hey! Bring me my lawyer! Bring him!

249
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,881
You can't do this! Why you...

250
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,747
Who would visit her?

251
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:11,630
Her ex-husband, current husband,
everyone's in prison.

252
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,011
And her daughter's in juvie.

253
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:17,539
What? Ma Ri. Are you done?

254
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,348
Since when did you talk down to me?

255
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:26,458
What? Can't I talk down to you?

256
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,998
Glare at me all you want.

257
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:31,968
Look down, Ms. Cheon!

258
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:33,328
Forget it.

259
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,298
It's nice out, but I feel down.

260
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:40,468
You. 3388. Sing me a song.

261
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,338
I hear you sang before you came in.

262
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:46,712
Why should I care if you feel down or up?

263
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:48,912
Sing to make you feel better?

264
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:51,052
I'd rather have you pull out my tongue.

265
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:54,292
I'm Cheon Seo Jin,
the best soprano in Korea.

266
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:56,292
I don't sing just anywhere.

267
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:57,828
Oh, my goodness.

268
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:01,500
Why are you acting out?
Do you have a death wish?

269
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,436
Just sing for her, Ms. Cheon!

270
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:05,610
What if she gets angry?

271
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,235
I won't. I refuse.

272
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,539
How could someone like her know...

273
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,565
what an aria is or "Deutschlandlied"?

274
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,214
What? You're the cell boss?

275
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,486
How dare someone
with nine priors insult my singing?

276
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:18,812
Hey, you.

277
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,248
3388.

278
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,034
I may look like this,

279
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,866
but I studied vocal arts
at Ewha Womans University.

280
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:36,617
Okay. 3952 and 5450.

281
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:38,655
Every time you hear "Ah" from my lips,

282
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:41,535
you may hit 3388 as hard as you want.

283
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:42,655
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

284

It must've been hard
getting over the jet lag.

293
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:01,462
I still don't know what's going on.

294
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:03,870
Or why you had me brought here.

295
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,506
It took me quite a while to find you.

296
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:08,951
I never imagined you'd be living...

297

as Baek Jun Ki.

298

I didn't do it.

299
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,456
Someone trapped me with that dirty name.

300
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:18,798
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

301
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,655
The man with the dirty name.

302
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:23,660
Is it him?

303
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,208
(Chairman Joo Dan Tae)

304
00:19:36,678 --> 00:19:37,672
Mr. Baek.

305
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,486
That's right. Mr. Baek.

306
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,729
What on earth did he do to you?

307
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:47,294
He is a murderer.

308
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:50,139
He killed both my parents...

309
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,715
and ran off with my family's assets.

310
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:58,124
Mr. Baek is alive and in Korea.

311
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,586
Joo Dan Tae.

312
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:03,283
He took your name.

313
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:06,713
Why take my name?

314
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,988
That evil jerk...

315
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:17,355
No way...

316
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,397
No way!

317
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:02,899
Joo Dan Tae.
Why did you hurt Ro Na, you jerk?

318
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:13,810
Chief, chief. Gosh, boss.

319
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:16,161
-What's going on?
-You scumbag.

320
00:21:20,706 --> 00:21:22,729
Guard! Guard!

321
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:26,022
There's a fight! Guard!

322
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:29,423
On your knees! On your knees!

323
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,921
Get off each other. Leave it!

324
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:35,651
What are you doing?

325
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:38,375
He tried to kill me.

326
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:40,659
He tried to stab me
with a sharpened toothbrush!

327
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:42,711
Is that true?

328
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:44,978
Sir.

329
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:48,824
That cannot be.

330
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,627
There's no way
we have a sharpened toothbrush.

331
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:54,175
Actually, this man...

332
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:56,970
attacked that man while he was asleep.

333
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,673
What are you talking about?

334
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:00,701
That's true. We saw it too.

335
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,087
He's the worst!

336
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:03,971
It's a lie. They're lying.

337
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:06,685
He tried to stab me with a toothbrush!

338
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,830
I apologize for the ruckus late at night.

339
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,747
Sir. This has never happened before.

340
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:13,242
Let them off this once.

341
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,088
I will teach him a lesson.

342
00:22:17,154 --> 00:22:19,383
Take extra care to keep him in line.

343
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:22,647
He was transferred here
for being a troublemaker.

344
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,568
Darn you.

345
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:29,248
You punk. How can you do this
after taking my money?

346
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,396
I'm warning you.

347
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:38,332
One more incident from you
and things will get really boring.

348
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:42,067
Your sentence could be finalized
without a chance of an appeal.

349
00:22:42,469 --> 00:22:43,712
Is that what you want?

350
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,357
We're done here.

351
00:22:58,939 --> 00:22:59,983
Boys.

352
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:08,267
Die.

353
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,090
Die. Die.

354
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:20,074
Only fools get blood on their own hands.

355
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:22,300
You cannot leave a mark.

356
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:26,293
It's not the right time to kill him.
Back down and wait.

357
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:39,006
Yes.

358
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:43,414
I understand. Well done.

359
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:46,974
Don't slack off for a moment
and keep a close eye on him.

360
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,485
No one knows what he will do.

361
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:54,108
Yes, of course, sir.

362
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:55,875
You have my loyalty.

363
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:58,274
Yes, sir. I'm at your service.

364
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:03,048
Oh, that's under control. Yes, sure.

365
00:24:04,948 --> 00:24:07,505
Come and wash my back for me.

366
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,537
-This is really nice.
-This is lovely.

367
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:18,528
-You need to get prettier.
-Come on.

368
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:20,388
Rub harder.

369
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:22,212
Oh, this feels good.

370
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:23,758
I feel refreshed.

371
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:32,379
What's he doing?

372
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:34,375
Boss, what are you doing?

373
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:37,410
Do something. He might die.

374
00:24:44,321 --> 00:24:47,005
Is he trying to kill him?

375
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,418
What if he actually dies?

376
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:56,739
-Go and help him.
-No way.

377
00:24:57,068 --> 00:24:58,593
He looks dead.

378
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:00,823
-Will you stop it now?
-Stop it.

379
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:03,541
-What's happening?
-Is he dead?

380
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:05,335
-No, he passed out.
-Did he?

381
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:07,858
-He fainted.
-He looks dead.

382
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,102
What happened?

383
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:24,240
Did you get into another fight?

384
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:26,531
No. He collapsed on his own.

385
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:29,981
He's sick now, is he?

386
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:33,670
Why is he on the floor,
ruining everyone's shower time?

387
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:35,745
Wake him up.

388
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:37,222
I'll do it, sir.

389
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:44,890
He wasn't dead.

390
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:47,562
-He's alive.
-I was scared for a second.

391
00:25:48,053 --> 00:25:51,790
Chairman Joo. Get up!

392
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:55,358
Oh, dear. Chairman Joo.

393
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:57,957
Can you get him some help?

394
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,873
He's suffering.

395
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:20,952
Sir. Why do you look so dreadful?

396
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,784
You don't look well at all.

397
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,765
Cut out the nonsense and brief me.

398
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:26,799
Who is that old fool?

399
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:28,227
His name is Bang Chi Soon.

400
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:31,916
He ends up here so often,
he's friendly with all the guards,

401
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:33,883
and he'll do anything for money.

402
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:38,955
What's odd is,
this time he came here voluntarily.

403
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,644
He wasn't charged with anything,
and no trial date is set.

404
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,104
I think he's targeting you.

405
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:51,120
He's targeting me?

406
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:54,552
It's also strange
how all your lawyers are resigning.

407
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:01,434
It's his handiwork.

408
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:03,922
Logan Lee, that scumbag.

409
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,676
Get to my slush fund...

410
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:08,824
and bribe the most capable guard.

411
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,630
I don't care how much it costs.

412
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,272
Get me out of that cell.

413
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:14,971
If you don't, I might die.

414
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:22,825
The jerk.

415
00:27:32,428 --> 00:27:35,328
(Nothing is too hard)

416
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:42,015
Mr. Chairman. Take it easy.

417
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:46,740
Here, have this.

418
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:53,485
There's a fun article in the paper.

419
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:13,762
(Logan Lee)

420
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:15,172
(Out!)

421
00:28:15,238 --> 00:28:17,072
(D-day)

422
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:19,168
(9)

423
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:32,209
Let's go.

424
00:28:33,688 --> 00:28:36,418
(9 days later)

425
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:40,787
-What a nice day.
-The weather's great.

426
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,063
-Gosh, this is nice.
-Yes, it is.

427
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:47,753
It's nice to be outside.

428
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:49,273
This is great.

429
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:51,673
-Nice.
-My gosh.

430
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:55,313
(Establish Law and Order)

431
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:57,372
Your wife cheated on you
with an upstairs neighbour,

432
00:28:57,438 --> 00:29:00,643
and you cheated on her
with your first love?

433
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:03,014
Two-way adultery
could complicate things a little.

434
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,778
-But you should file a suit first.
-File a suit?

435
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:08,303
Don't worry about it.

436
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:12,471
I used to be the best divorce lawyer
before I came in here.

437
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:16,431
Then can I get a consultation from you?

438
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:18,737
-Me too.
-No, wait.

439
00:29:18,803 --> 00:29:21,457
My wife cheated on me!

440
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:23,445
You guys, that's it for today.

441
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,355
-My gosh, come on.
-Spare me some time!

442
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:28,791
(Establish Law and Order)

443
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:35,105
Traitor Ha, I'm so scared.

444
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:37,112
I never even went to the army,

445
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:40,504
but I'm slowly getting used
to this group life.

446
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,009
It's giving me the creeps.

447
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:46,055
By the way, don't you miss Eun Byeol?

448
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:49,620
Isn't your darn daughter...

449
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:52,274
still locked up in juvie?

450
00:29:53,737 --> 00:29:55,868
I heard she never came to visit.

451
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:58,137
Get lost, you darn scumbag.

452
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:02,367
Listen, you punk.

453
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,629
You're in no position
to be talking to us right now.

454
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:07,436
Now get lost. Darn it.

455
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:10,395
Do you enjoy being
the big guy's little dog?

456
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:12,349
You acted as if you were a righteous man.

457
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:14,316
But you're nothing but his minion.

458
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:17,824
By the way, I heard John BIO...

459
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,582
belongs to Logan Lee.

460
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:23,892
You're completely broke, aren't you?

461
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,546
Do you have a death wish?

462
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:30,707
Once I get out of here,

463
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:34,262
the first thing I'll do is
kill Oh Yoon Hee and her daughter.

464
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:37,273
I'll destroy everything
that's precious to you.

465
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:39,111
You crazy jerk!

466
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:42,581
Hey, Lifer!

467
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,197
Do you think it's okay to be violent...

468
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:46,342
because you've already received
a life sentence?

469
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,454
You darn punk!

470
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:04,845
You scum. Come here.

471
00:31:08,754 --> 00:31:10,500
Get over here. Come here.

472
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:17,409
Get him!

473
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,917
Come here.

474
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:33,075
Get him!

475
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:35,695
Get off!

476
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:40,268
Come here!

477
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:45,294
You punk! Get off! Let go!

478
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,596
Let go already!

479
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:48,740
Oh, my gosh!

480
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:02,074
You darn scum!

481
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,706
-No, don't! It's dangerous!
-Get off me.

482
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:06,013
-Get off me! Come here!
-No, stop it!

483
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:08,140
-Come here! Get off!
-No!

484
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:09,606
My gosh!

485
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:20,801
He's bleeding.

486
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,446
-He's bleeding!
-What just happened?

487
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:42,513
What... What in the world... Who did this?

488
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:45,384
Inmate 2528! Inmate 2528! Wake up!

489
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:48,968
My gosh, what happened?
Who did this to him?

490
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,750
Hurry up and call an ambulance!

491
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,506
My gosh. Darn it.

-Here.
-Oh, gosh.

495
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:06,018
Put pressure on the wound.

496
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,406
His vitals are dropping quickly.

497
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:11,396
Hey, wake up.

498
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:14,988
Give him some painkillers, at least.

499

My princess, how have you been?

506
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:08,889
I'm back in Korea.

507
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:10,839
Are you really back in Korea?

508
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:12,657
Come home quickly!

509
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:16,364

-That punk?
-You don't know who I mean?

515
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:37,757
I wouldn't feel better
even if I chewed his bones to mash.

516
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:44,159
It's been a while, by the way.

517
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:45,917
You look well.

518
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:49,316
Where's the car?

519
00:34:52,526 --> 00:34:55,472
-What about a gift for my princess?
-It's in the back.

520
00:34:57,257 --> 00:35:00,376
It's so bulky.
Did you buy the whole store?

521
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:03,601
Mr. Yoo! It's not that one.

522
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,956
It's the bag next to it. The blue one.

523
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,166
Why are you so shocked?

524
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:09,131
Are you hiding a pile of gold bars
in there?

525
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,187
You got all the most popular things
from Dubai, right?

526
00:35:12,297 --> 00:35:15,104
Of course.
I brought new clothes for you too.

the day I get out of jail?

I'm sorry. I'm just a bit busy today.

Gosh.

533
00:35:39,415 --> 00:35:42,233
I nearly died
before I got to see my daughter.

534
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:52,170
I guess Korea has changed a lot.

535
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,319
It sure has.

536
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,953
We will soon be arriving
at Incheon International Airport.

537

I'm glad I lived...

542
00:36:09,398 --> 00:36:11,017
to meet him again.

543
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:14,595
Mr. Baek.

544
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:18,140
It isn't Mr. Baek anymore.
It's Joo Dan Tae.

545
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:20,899
I've scheduled a visit with him
in the afternoon.

546
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:23,240
We can go to the prison together...

547
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,497
after I see Su Ryeon.

548
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:27,910
Use this when you're in Seoul.

549
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:31,899
That punk won't...

550
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:35,582
remember what I look like, will he?

551
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:37,823
Probably not.

552
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:41,571
I'll get it all back.

553
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,408
Everything he took from me.

554
00:36:56,338 --> 00:36:59,040
Did everything go well in the US?

555
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:00,846
You seem at peace.

556
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:03,453
Yes. Now that everything's back to normal.

557
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,975
Anything new here?

558
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:06,892
I want to introduce you.

559
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,238
You guys are going to be seeing a lot
of each other.

560
00:37:09,304 --> 00:37:11,616
He has a lot of information on Mr. Baek.

561
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:13,152
It's nice to meet you.

562
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:15,736
Give me the car keys. I'll drive myself.

563
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:16,796
Here you go.

564
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,624
All right. I'll see you back at the hotel.

565
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,018
I'll be running late.

568

Already?

569
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:43,499
I was getting impatient,
so I couldn't wait any longer.

570
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,650
I'm back in the penthouse too.

Well... I'd love to see you.

574
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:56,503
Can we meet soon?

575
00:37:56,997 --> 00:37:59,297
I have something to tell you too.

576
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:04,105
I'm going to my store soon.
Should we meet there?

577
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:05,647
Sure, let's do that.

578

after he's been examined.

Call the prison
and get approval for surgery.

Hello. We're at the hospital now.

591

They say it's really bad
and he needs emergency surgery.

00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,944
However much you hate the guy,

659
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:09,450
how could you do that to him
when you're here to turn a new leaf?

660
00:47:09,516 --> 00:47:12,742
You scumbag.
You're in it with Joo Dan Tae, aren't you?

661
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:17,455
Must you do this
when Chairman Joo's at death's door?

662
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:21,591
You piece of trash.

663
00:47:21,657 --> 00:47:23,723
You son of a witch!

664
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:25,873
I will kill you, okay?

665
00:47:25,939 --> 00:47:27,953
I'll kill you, Lee Kyu Jin!

666
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:29,560
You punk!

667
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:32,205
-I'll get you one day!
-I'm sorry, Dr. Ha.

668
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:36,294
Kyu Jin learned a little too much
about life in here.

669
00:47:45,578 --> 00:47:47,342
(Respect one another)

670
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:48,408
My gosh.

671
00:47:49,348 --> 00:47:51,108
You'll get me out of here?

672
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:54,793
You seem to be gravely mistaken.

673
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,392
Hey. You got a life sentence.

674
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,729
And I'll be released on bail soon.

675
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:05,790
How, when everyone knows
your parents cut you off?

676
00:48:05,856 --> 00:48:07,836
Your mom blocked your number.

677
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:12,006
You scumbag.

678
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:14,515
Your bail.

679
00:48:16,506 --> 00:48:17,656
I'll pay for you.

680
00:48:17,722 --> 00:48:21,834
You idiot. Do you still want to show off?

681
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,162
Stop trying to be cunning.

682
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:28,901
I'll get out of here soon.

683
00:48:30,148 --> 00:48:33,858
If you don't believe me,
see what happens tomorrow.

684
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:38,174
I'm giving you a chance to side with me.

685
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,541
Especially just you.

686
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:43,854
In return,
get me Ha Yoon Chul's toothbrush.

687
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:03,829
Joo Dan Tae, you lunatic.

688
00:49:03,895 --> 00:49:06,086
He's a total crazy fool.

689
00:49:45,228 --> 00:49:46,564
Who are you people?

690
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:49,492
You're having fun, Mr. Chief Justice.

691
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:53,378
When did your wife get so young?

692
00:49:57,138 --> 00:49:58,308
Joo Dan Tae?

693
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:04,042
You took so much money from me,

694
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:07,333
so why are you refusing my calls?

695
00:50:07,399 --> 00:50:09,401
Why do you think I came here...

696
00:50:09,812 --> 00:50:11,561
in my current condition?

697
00:50:12,154 --> 00:50:15,278
I feel so wronged, I could die right now.

698
00:50:16,087 --> 00:50:18,225
What are you doing?

699
00:50:19,794 --> 00:50:21,365
I need you to get me out.

700
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,008
With the information I gave you,

701
00:50:24,074 --> 00:50:26,729
you bought land in Yongsan
slated to be redeveloped,

702
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:28,451
and news
of Paju's high-speed railway plan...

703
00:50:28,517 --> 00:50:30,160
made your alpine real estate priceless.

704
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:31,844
That got you a 400-square meter
Gangnam apartment...

705
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,192
and a luxurious holiday home like this.

706
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:37,010
You should make yourself
equally worthwhile.

707
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,412
Isn't that a fair rule?

708
00:50:39,715 --> 00:50:42,315
What you demand will cripple legal order.

709
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:44,602
Murderers aren't allowed
reduced sentences.

710
00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:47,423
I will call the police immediately.

711
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:49,327
That fugitive Joo Dan Tae is here.

712
00:50:50,878 --> 00:50:52,634
Do whatever you want.

713
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,339
I'm a lifer,
so all I have to do is return to prison.

714
00:50:56,405 --> 00:50:59,863
But it won't be that simple for you,
Mr. Chief Justice.

715
00:51:01,336 --> 00:51:03,685
There's talk you'll be made
Head of the Supreme Court,

716
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:06,509
and your daughter's getting married
next week.

717
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:10,778
What do you say?
Should I show up at the wedding...

718
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:13,548
and cause a scene?

719
00:51:14,078 --> 00:51:15,215
Yes?

720
00:51:32,206 --> 00:51:33,556
Turn on the news.

721
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:34,871
Yes, sir.

722
00:51:35,256 --> 00:51:36,632
This is just in.

723
00:51:36,698 --> 00:51:39,239
A car just exploded...

724
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,411
in the parking lot
of Cheonsoo District 27.

725
00:51:41,477 --> 00:51:43,011
According to police, the victim is...

726
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:45,743
a Korean-American businessman
and CEO of Logan Lee Corporation.

727
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:48,633
He is thought to have died on site.

728
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:51,152
Police sent the car
to the National Forensic Service...

729
00:51:51,218 --> 00:51:53,420
to investigate the cause of the explosion.

730
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,900
They're also questioning witnesses
and getting surveillance footage...

731
00:51:55,966 --> 00:51:58,487
to find out what happened.

732
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:03,328
-He's gone.
-Go that way. You, that way.

733
00:52:04,398 --> 00:52:05,870
Darn it.

734
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:07,780
What happened?

735
00:52:07,846 --> 00:52:10,179
I don't know. He was here a while ago.

736
00:52:10,245 --> 00:52:13,356
This punk escaped.

737
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:14,972
Block all the exits...

738
00:52:15,038 --> 00:52:17,353
and contact the stations
and have them set up roadblocks.

739
00:52:17,419 --> 00:52:18,685
Get to it.

740
00:52:19,506 --> 00:52:21,012
Darn you, fool.

741
00:52:21,078 --> 00:52:23,151
Sir! Come and see this.

742
00:52:23,217 --> 00:52:25,068
Why? What is it?

743
00:52:25,764 --> 00:52:27,184
-Let's go.
-This way.

744
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:34,534
This fool...

745
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:36,672
How long was he here for?

746
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:38,826
I think he walked off in a delirium.

747
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:40,621
I'm glad we found him.

748
00:52:41,111 --> 00:52:42,735
Get him out of here.

749
00:52:50,648 --> 00:52:52,585
He's not breathing.

750
00:52:52,651 --> 00:52:54,102
He had a heart attack.

751
00:52:54,813 --> 00:52:56,734
No. Save him!

752
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,737
Take him to an OR now!

753
00:52:58,803 --> 00:53:01,146
Carry him on your back.

754
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:02,588
It's this way.

755
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:07,128
(Surgery in progress)

756
00:53:12,068 --> 00:53:13,622
Charge to 120 joules.

757
00:53:13,688 --> 00:53:15,629
-120 joules.
-Clear.

758
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,939
-Charge to 150 joules.
-150 joules.

759
00:53:20,005 --> 00:53:21,410
Clear!

760
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,056
-Charge to 200 joules.
-200 joules.

761
00:53:25,122 --> 00:53:26,398
Clear!

762
00:53:31,388 --> 00:53:32,688
(Police Line Do Not Cross)

763
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:36,128
(Rest in peace in a better place.)

764
00:53:44,698 --> 00:53:47,538
(Rest in peace, Logan.)

765
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:55,342
(My condolences. Rest in peace.)

766
00:53:55,408 --> 00:53:57,348
(We hope you rest in peace.)

767
00:53:59,118 --> 00:54:00,732
It was you, Joo Dan Tae.

768
00:54:02,018 --> 00:54:03,427
You did it, didn't you?

769
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:06,671
You're the only one who'd do this.

770
00:54:07,503 --> 00:54:08,958
Only you.

771
00:54:21,288 --> 00:54:25,458
People only come to their senses
after a beating.

772
00:54:25,918 --> 00:54:27,886
If you just keep to the hierarchies,

773
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:30,990
there's no place
more humane than this one.

774
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:36,612
Here, have some.

775
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:42,671
Thank you. I love soy sauce braised beef.

776
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:47,734
What was that just now?

777
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,513
I have to eat to live.

778
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:51,220
If I die, no one will know.

779
00:54:52,892 --> 00:54:55,049
What are you looking at?
What do you want me to do?

780
00:54:55,115 --> 00:54:56,542
You're not eating?

781
00:54:56,608 --> 00:54:59,064
Then give me all your food.
I'm starving anyway.

782
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:01,476
Hey.

783
00:55:01,542 --> 00:55:02,833
Gosh.

784
00:55:03,188 --> 00:55:06,190
I was saving that.

785
00:55:06,256 --> 00:55:09,818
How dare you steal that from me?

786
00:55:12,933 --> 00:55:15,267
How dare you throw my food on the floor?

787
00:55:15,587 --> 00:55:18,512
-Ko Sang A.
-You started it.

788
00:55:18,578 --> 00:55:21,482
-You did it first.
-How dare you touch my food.

789
00:55:21,548 --> 00:55:23,518
Who do you think you are?

790
00:55:25,518 --> 00:55:27,852
How dare you do that to me?

791
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:31,418
I'll kill you.

792
00:55:31,484 --> 00:55:33,103
Why, you...

793
00:55:33,169 --> 00:55:35,835
Who needs more side dishes?

794
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:41,732
-Me!
-Me!

795
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:43,472
-Here!
-Me!

796
00:55:43,538 --> 00:55:45,572
-Please!
-Me! Cheon Seo Jin!

797
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:47,899
What are you waiting for?

798
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:49,463
What is this?

799
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:51,344
What? Oh Yoon Hee?

800
00:55:52,678 --> 00:55:55,857
How come you are the meal distributor?

801
00:55:55,923 --> 00:55:59,314
Why? Is that a good position?

802
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,203
They're highly esteemed positions
in prison.

803
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:05,900
You have to get on her good side
if you want an extra egg.

804
00:56:05,966 --> 00:56:09,489
But how did she manage
to get that job so easily?

805
00:56:09,555 --> 00:56:11,091
Who's supporting her?

806
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,219
What skills did you use?

807
00:56:15,368 --> 00:56:18,813
So does that mean that
Yoon Hee has more power...

808
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:20,567
than Jenny's mom?

809
00:56:22,823 --> 00:56:25,940
Yoon Hee, you know a bond
of hatred is still a bond, right?

810
00:56:26,006 --> 00:56:28,478
I'm okay with everything,

811
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:31,464
but if I don't have any meat,
I can't even stand up for a second.

812
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,721
Me too.

813
00:56:36,586 --> 00:56:37,828
Here.

814
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,156
Awesome.

815
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:45,748
If you have something to request, say it.

816
00:56:45,814 --> 00:56:47,380
Do you need anything?

817
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,852
My gosh.

818
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:50,832
Laver.

819
00:56:51,586 --> 00:56:52,675
What?

820
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:57,084
Did you not hear me?
I want a lot of laver.

821
00:56:58,098 --> 00:57:01,311
Don't you have a lot of money?
Buy it yourself.

822
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:03,289
Why did you even ask me
if you weren't going to give me any?

823
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:05,279
Who do you think put me here,
and made me this way?

824
00:57:05,345 --> 00:57:07,912
Are you saying
I'm the one who did this to you?

825
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:11,322
You still haven't come to your senses,
have you?

826
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:14,794
You got seven years, and I got three.

827
00:57:15,315 --> 00:57:17,342
I'll get out of here before you.

828
00:57:17,408 --> 00:57:19,763
Sure, congratulations.

829
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:22,349
How dare a murderer talk back to me?

830
00:57:24,868 --> 00:57:26,167
Logan is dead.

831
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,213
Logan died? When?

832
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:31,809
Did you kill him?

833
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,364
What are you talking about?
I have nothing to do with it!

834
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,644
Know that I'm watching you.

835
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:40,766
If you try anything, I'll kill you myself.

836
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:48,088
(Seoul Detention Center)

837
00:57:54,868 --> 00:57:56,241
What did you just say?

838
00:57:56,588 --> 00:57:59,397
There's a witness who says
the person who killed Na Ae Gyo...

839
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:01,964
wasn't Joo Dan Tae, but Logan.

840
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,175
A witness?

841
00:58:04,308 --> 00:58:08,041
We discovered that Logan
bribed a crematorium owner.

842
00:58:09,243 --> 00:58:13,254
The murderer's height, silhouette,
and stride captured by CCTV...

843
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,844
were also found to match...

844
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,383
those of Logan.

845
00:58:17,449 --> 00:58:19,494
But Logan is the one who died.

846
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,472
Someone murdered him.

847
00:58:21,538 --> 00:58:24,109
Don't you think you should change
the aim of your investigation?

848
00:58:24,525 --> 00:58:27,206
You need to find the person
who was travelling with Logan first.

849
00:58:27,272 --> 00:58:28,768
Right before the explosion,

850
00:58:28,834 --> 00:58:31,672
he got out of the car
and his whereabouts are unknown.

851
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:33,577
He has no relatives in Korea,

852
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,534
and we have no record of him
using his credit card.

853
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,675
Joo Dan Tae.

854
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:39,876
Did you check on him?

855
00:58:40,547 --> 00:58:42,357
I heard he was hurt
and being taken to the hospital.

856
00:58:42,423 --> 00:58:44,663
At the time of the explosion,
Joo Dan Tae had been stabbed...

857
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,160
by a sharpened toothbrush,
which put his life in danger.

858
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:48,646
He might've been acting
to create an alibi.

859
00:58:48,712 --> 00:58:50,845
He even suffered cardiac arrest.

860
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:53,584
It makes no sense to suspect him of this.

861
00:58:53,936 --> 00:58:56,336
I'm sure he ordered someone
to carry this out.

862
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:57,839
It's definitely him.

863
00:58:57,905 --> 00:59:01,396
-No one else could do...
-How much do you know about Logan?

864
00:59:01,462 --> 00:59:03,874
You know that
after getting her bone marrow,

865
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,561
he dissolved his adoption of Min Seol A.

866
00:59:05,954 --> 00:59:07,062
Are you aware of this?

867
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:10,516
-But that's...
-According to others,

868
00:59:10,582 --> 00:59:14,215
Logan has been stalking you
for a very long time.

869
00:59:14,281 --> 00:59:15,467
Is that true?

870
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,760
What are you talking about?

871
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:19,152
Stalking?

872
00:59:19,218 --> 00:59:20,770
Then were you lovers?

873
00:59:22,735 --> 00:59:26,644
With a man who transplanted
your dead daughter's marrow illegally?

874
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,887
To hold a special affection
for someone like that...

875
00:59:28,953 --> 00:59:32,610
It can't be true, can it?
He is the stepbrother of your...

876
00:59:33,264 --> 00:59:36,194
I won't sit here listening to you
badmouth him any longer.

877
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,562
The one thing that's clear...

878
00:59:37,628 --> 00:59:40,986
is that Logan would never hurt anyone.

879
00:59:41,885 --> 00:59:43,649
I guarantee it.

880
00:59:45,213 --> 00:59:48,082
The victim of the car explosion
occurring in the heart of Seoul...

881
00:59:48,148 --> 00:59:50,876
was a Korean-American businessman,
Logan Lee.

882
00:59:50,942 --> 00:59:54,516
We were shocked to learn that
he is the suspect in Na Ae Gyo's murder.

883
00:59:54,582 --> 00:59:57,226
As a result, the CEO of J King Holdings,

884
00:59:57,292 --> 01:00:01,249
Mr. Joo, who was arrested
for murdering his former wife...

885
01:00:01,315 --> 01:00:03,861
was revealed to have been framed
and a reinvestigation has opened.

886
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:05,865
The person to take charge
of the new case...

887
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:09,355
will work towards a just future
while investigating this case.

888
01:00:09,421 --> 01:00:12,699
During the investigation
of Na Ae Gyo's murder, Mr. Joo...

889
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:14,853
Hello.

890
01:00:15,548 --> 01:00:18,805
This is a junior colleague
of Chief Justice Jung.

891
01:00:18,871 --> 01:00:22,035
The second trial
has been taken on by our law firm.

892
01:00:22,573 --> 01:00:24,044
I'm in your hands.

893
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,421
When can I get out of here?

894
01:00:26,487 --> 01:00:28,811
To hold someone who's innocent,

895
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:30,706
what a state this country is in.

896
01:00:30,772 --> 01:00:34,210
The Supreme Court justice
is paying much attention to this.

897
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:36,375
How much attention?

898
01:00:36,441 --> 01:00:37,998
Could I get a briefing?

899
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:42,578
The imprisonment of Shim Su Ryeon...

900
01:00:42,644 --> 01:00:45,996
will be framed
as the sole act of Cheon Seo Jin.

901
01:00:46,062 --> 01:00:48,813
In the Ro Na incident,
we'll say the victim hurt her head,

902
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:52,288
and her testimony is inconsistent
and therefore problematic.

903
01:00:52,354 --> 01:00:54,150
And one more thing.

904
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:58,296
Let's say Ha Yoon Chul was the one
masterminding Seol A's desecration.

905
01:00:58,362 --> 01:01:00,132
I tried to reveal the truth...

906
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,922
and ended up suffering this mishap.

907
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:12,855
Bandages for the patient.

908
01:01:44,198 --> 01:01:45,453
Oh, no.

909
01:01:46,868 --> 01:01:48,289
The IV isn't in my arm.

910
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:53,003
Trash like you shouldn't be allowed
back in the world a second time.

911
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:54,779
Die, Joo Dan Tae.

912
01:01:59,067 --> 01:02:01,772
What an honour for you
to come visit me personally.

913
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:03,847
I missed you, Shim Su Ryeon.

914
01:02:03,913 --> 01:02:06,304
It makes me sad
to see you've become more beautiful.

915
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:07,834
You're crazy.

916
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,122
It's you, isn't it?
The one who killed Logan?

917
01:02:10,188 --> 01:02:12,445
What are you talking about?

918
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,951
Don't you see this?

919
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:19,139
Aren't you being too harsh
to a former husband who nearly died?

920
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:21,732
I'll kill you, Joo Dan Tae.

921
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,805
Were you in love with that punk, for real?

922
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:30,843
This is tearing my heart apart.

923
01:02:35,347 --> 01:02:37,543
If you can kill me, try.

924
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:41,589
Until you do, those around you
will die off, one by one.

925
01:02:41,655 --> 01:02:44,092
Just like Min Seol A and Logan.

926
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:46,741
Oh, and there was Min Seol A's father too.

927
01:02:46,807 --> 01:02:49,913
Everyone you love will all die.

928
01:02:49,979 --> 01:02:53,538
So please, don't do anything,
Shim Su Ryeon.

929
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,867
Shut it.

930
01:02:56,446 --> 01:02:59,747
Save your rage
if you want to face me again.

931
01:03:08,294 --> 01:03:10,993
I'll face you as much as you want.

932
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:13,841
I don't rely
on the judgement of the law anymore.

933
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:18,764
I'll use your own methods,
your inhumane methods,

934
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:21,538
to end your life.

935
01:03:23,058 --> 01:03:24,531
What are you doing?

936
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:27,213
I'm going to kill that man.

937
01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:29,125
That psychopath.

938
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:31,773
Just let me kill him.

939
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:34,465
Let me kill him with my own hands.

940
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:36,688
Hey.

941
01:03:36,754 --> 01:03:39,037
-Stop it.
-I need to kill that scumbag.

942
01:03:39,103 --> 01:03:41,943
Let me go.

943
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:45,275
Let me go. Let go!

944
01:05:08,668 --> 01:05:11,398
(Safety first)

945
01:05:28,618 --> 01:05:30,683
Will you please let us sleep?

946
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:32,113
-Let me sleep!
-Shut it!

947
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:34,553
-My gosh.
-She's so annoying.

948
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:36,688
Has she lost it?

949
01:05:36,754 --> 01:05:38,510
She's unbelievable.

950
01:05:38,577 --> 01:05:41,896
-Let us sleep already!
-I want to kill that witch.

951
01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:44,966
My gosh, I can't stand this.

952
01:05:45,032 --> 01:05:47,271
-My gosh.
-My goodness.

953
01:05:47,337 --> 01:05:49,233
Let me sleep already.

954
01:05:50,596 --> 01:05:53,203
-Can we please sleep?
-This is driving me crazy.

955
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:55,813
-What's wrong with her?
-My gosh.

956
01:05:55,879 --> 01:05:58,207
What's wrong with her?
I'm sick of listening to you.

957
01:05:58,273 --> 01:06:00,274
She must've lost it.

958
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:04,932
You're so darn loud. I can't sleep.

959
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:06,570
It's been days already.

960
01:06:06,636 --> 01:06:11,884
Thank you for inviting me
to perform in New York, everyone.

961
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:13,948
The next song is...

962
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:18,782
-Shut your mouth, you lunatic.
-I'm so honoured.

963
01:06:18,848 --> 01:06:19,921
Eun Byeol!

964
01:06:19,987 --> 01:06:22,109
I told you to focus on the diaphragm
and project your voice forward.

965
01:06:22,175 --> 01:06:23,185
Practice makes perfect.

966
01:06:23,251 --> 01:06:25,961
I want you to sing until you sleep
and then sing again in your dreams.

967
01:06:26,027 --> 01:06:30,061
Let me sleep so I can dream.

968
01:06:30,127 --> 01:06:34,410
What's the matter with you?
What made you go so crazy?

969
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:39,846
Why did you have to mess
with this lunatic, Cheon Seo Jin?

970
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,189
That's not good enough
to make you the best!

971
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:45,110
Try it again. I said, try it again!

972
01:06:45,176 --> 01:06:47,273
Stand up straight!

973
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:50,198
Hey! I'm not your darn daughter!

974
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:54,768
Yoon Hee, you're still so vulgar.

975
01:06:54,834 --> 01:06:57,693
Cheong A Foundation belongs to Seo Young.
It belongs to Seo Young.

976
01:06:57,759 --> 01:06:59,422
No! No, it can't be...

977
01:06:59,488 --> 01:07:02,484
No! It belongs to Seo Young?

978
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:04,463
No!

Eun Byeol! Your mom is right here!

982

Eun Byeol, focus on the diaphragm
and project your voice forward.

983
01:07:25,887 --> 01:07:27,278
What's wrong with her?

984
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:30,387
-My gosh.
-Is she choking?

985
01:07:30,453 --> 01:07:32,157
-What's going on?
-What's with her?

986
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,350
-I think she's having a seizure.
-My gosh.

-Hey.
-Shouldn't we do something?

-Seo Jin!
-Hey, 3388.

990
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:43,554

-My gosh.
-What's wrong with her?

994
01:07:51,158 --> 01:07:52,798
-Hurry.
-Please take a look.

998
01:08:06,185 --> 01:08:07,455

Seok Kyung, you must feel reassured...

1003
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,451
since you got
a principal's recommendation letter.

1004
01:08:36,517 --> 01:08:38,071
Are you only going to apply for SNU?

1005
01:08:38,137 --> 01:08:40,202
What about other schools?
Didn't you even apply?

1006
01:08:40,268 --> 01:08:41,875
I won't be going
to any of the other schools anyway.

If I get accepted everywhere,
it'll only be bad for you guys.

1008
01:08:44,363 --> 01:08:45,570
I just need to get into SNU.

1009
01:08:45,636 --> 01:08:47,878
I can't believe you're going to SNU
with such a low GPA score.

1010
01:08:47,944 --> 01:08:49,063
You're so lucky.

The grand prize winner is back now,

1013
01:08:54,073 --> 01:08:56,906
so shouldn't you give her
the free pass to SNU back?

1014
01:08:56,972 --> 01:08:59,906
She's right. Ro Na
was supposed to get the recommendation.

1015
01:09:00,994 --> 01:09:02,686
That's not for me to decide.

1016

I only followed the school rules.

1017
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:08,942
Ro Na turned down
the recommendation letter.

1018

What's the use anyway?
She's not even going to university.

1019
01:09:11,445 --> 01:09:12,655
She's right.

1020
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:15,183

in the entire world.

1047

She came to visit me today...

1049

and told me everything
that happened at school.

1050

I'd love to introduce her to you.

1052

She keeps hurting herself even more.

1053

to commit suicide.

1054

1060

1061
01:12:15,912 --> 01:12:18,086

Ms. Shim, it's time for you to wake up.

1063

One, two, three.

1064
01:12:53,965 --> 01:12:55,867
I stopped there again.

1065
01:12:57,225 --> 01:12:59,158
I heard a strange metallic sound.

1066
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:01,898
Can you describe
what kind of sound it was?

1067
01:13:01,964 --> 01:13:03,036
I don't know.

1068
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:06,316
Gosh, I really can't remember.

1069
01:13:09,982 --> 01:13:13,058
It was a creepy sound
that I really didn't like.

1070
01:13:13,124 --> 01:13:14,649
It was a very shocking accident,

1071
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:17,641
so it'll be difficult for you
to remember everything at once.

1072
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:19,709
I'm sure...

1073
01:13:20,933 --> 01:13:23,066
someone was there.

1074
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:27,284
The answer lies in that sound.

1075
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:33,106
Mr. Hong, who was the guy
that came in with Logan?

1076
01:13:33,172 --> 01:13:35,478
Why did Logan want me to meet him?

1077
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:38,543
Is he seeing someone dangerous
who hasn't shown up yet?

1078
01:13:39,904 --> 01:13:43,177
What if he did something to Logan?

1079
01:13:43,784 --> 01:13:46,208
He's someone who knows Mr. Baek very well.

1080
01:13:46,963 --> 01:13:48,241
"Mr. Baek?"

1081
01:13:48,307 --> 01:13:51,766
He will tell you everything
about Joo Dan Tae's past.

1082
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:53,612
I need to find him.

1083
01:13:53,678 --> 01:13:56,043
I'm sure he knows something
about Logan's death.

1084
01:13:56,701 --> 01:13:57,855
He might have...

1085
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:01,384
seen Joo Dan Tae that day at the scene.

1086
01:14:45,545 --> 01:14:46,851
Logan?

1087
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:02,215
Logan...

1088
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:12,410
I'm back, Su Ryeon.

1089
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:15,383
It's really nice to see you here again.

1090
01:15:17,745 --> 01:15:19,757
You crazy jerk.

1091
01:15:19,823 --> 01:15:22,729
Get out of here right now.
How dare you come in here!

1092
01:15:24,282 --> 01:15:26,952
What's going on? How is he here?

1093
01:15:28,188 --> 01:15:29,493
How did he get out?

1094
01:15:29,559 --> 01:15:32,017
I missed you guys so much,

1095
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:34,379
so I pulled some strings.

1096
01:15:34,445 --> 01:15:37,486
Gosh, Ro Na. I love your hair.

1097
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,285
I told you to get out.

1098
01:15:40,351 --> 01:15:43,749
You lost your custody of the kids
and received a restraining order.

1099
01:15:43,815 --> 01:15:45,594
Do you want the cops to drag you out?

1100
01:15:46,235 --> 01:15:47,842
There's no need to cause a fuss.

1101
01:15:47,908 --> 01:15:50,613
I only dropped by to say hello
to the kids.

1102
01:15:51,189 --> 01:15:54,669
It's nice to see the family
all together again.

1103
01:15:54,735 --> 01:15:57,421
Don't you guys miss having me around
at home?

1104
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,175
Stay away from the kids.

1105
01:16:01,726 --> 01:16:04,515
You're the one who needs to leave.

1106
01:16:05,035 --> 01:16:07,369
This penthouse was mine to begin with.

1107
01:16:08,372 --> 01:16:09,969
I'm going to take it all back.

1108
01:16:10,035 --> 01:16:12,369
The penthouse and my kids.

1109
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:14,752
Get lost right now.

1110
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:20,592
Sure.

1111
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,006
I'll make sure he never shows up again.
I'm sorry.

1112
01:16:54,538 --> 01:16:56,660
Did you not know he was out?

1113
01:16:56,726 --> 01:16:59,345
I talked to him over the phone once.
He called me so many times.

1114
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:01,943
Why did you even pick up?

1115
01:17:02,362 --> 01:17:04,162
We don't have a dad anymore.

1116
01:17:04,228 --> 01:17:07,132
You can't just make him disappear
by thinking he doesn't exist.

1117
01:17:08,748 --> 01:17:10,493
Dad got acquitted.

1118
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:12,944
He didn't kill our biological mother.

1119
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,601
Even the cops said it was Logan.

1120
01:17:14,667 --> 01:17:16,692
Are you really that dumb enough
to believe that?

1121
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,688
I should go.

1122
01:17:25,984 --> 01:17:28,080
Ro Na, wait for me.

1123
01:17:29,668 --> 01:17:32,837
Why is he acting like an idiot for Ro Na?

1124
01:17:35,755 --> 01:17:37,419
He's so annoying.

1125

1127
01:17:56,898 --> 01:17:58,868

to go to the States together?

1128
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:02,269
Is that what they've been planning?

1129
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:22,959

1130
01:18:26,628 --> 01:18:27,883
Joo Dan Tae.

1131
01:18:29,683 --> 01:18:31,100
Mr. Baek?

1132
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:38,673
Here's my verdict.

1133
01:18:38,739 --> 01:18:39,813
(One month later)

1134
01:18:39,879 --> 01:18:42,034
The defendant, Cheon Seo Jin,
has consistently claimed...

1135
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,762
that she had nothing to do
with Na Ae Gyo's murder.

1136
01:18:44,828 --> 01:18:47,166
Now that the real culprit
has been discovered,

1137
01:18:47,232 --> 01:18:49,666
I overrule the original sentence
and find her innocent.

1138
01:18:49,732 --> 01:18:52,747
Also, the confinement of Shim Su Ryeon
and the murder of Min Seol A...

1139
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:54,304
were both very severe crimes...

1140
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:56,512
and unacceptable as someone
working in the educational industry.

1141
01:18:56,578 --> 01:18:58,436
However, considering the fact
that she compensated the victims...

1142
01:18:58,502 --> 01:19:00,838
and is in urgent need
of psychological treatment,

1143
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:04,029
I sentence her to two years in prison
followed by four years of probation.

1144
01:19:14,548 --> 01:19:17,378
(Seoul High Court)

1145
01:19:44,015 --> 01:19:45,533
Who are you? What are you doing?

1146
01:19:45,599 --> 01:19:47,670
Who are you? Let go of me. Who is this?

1147
01:19:48,341 --> 01:19:49,514
Who are you?

1148
01:19:50,614 --> 01:19:51,633
Get off.

1149
01:19:52,324 --> 01:19:54,305
Who are you? Oh Yoon Hee?

1150
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:27,549
Let me go! Where am I?

1151
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:30,832
Let go of me! Oh Yoon Hee? Shim Su Ryeon?

1152
01:20:30,898 --> 01:20:32,067
Get off me!

1153
01:20:32,424 --> 01:20:34,787
Where am I? What's going on?

1154
01:20:34,853 --> 01:20:36,833
Get off me! Let me go!

1155
01:20:51,561 --> 01:20:54,508
Shim Su Ryeon. Oh Yoon Hee.

1156
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,066
What's going on? What are you doing here?

1157
01:20:58,862 --> 01:21:01,062
How did you manage to get out?

1158
01:21:02,047 --> 01:21:04,718
I guess you did a pretty good job
of acting like a psycho.

1159
01:21:04,784 --> 01:21:07,456
Or did Joo Dan Tae help you?

1160
01:21:08,344 --> 01:21:10,689
Did you help him kill Logan?

1161
01:21:17,576 --> 01:21:20,487
You killed Logan, didn't you?

1162
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:23,312
What are you talking about? It wasn't me!

1163
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:26,410
You killed him.
Do you think I don't know that?

1164
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:34,794
Why are you doing this?

1165
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:39,104
Why are you doing this to me?

1166
01:22:28,768 --> 01:22:31,478
=The Penthouse 3=

1167
01:22:31,778 --> 01:22:34,281
Did you kill my birth mother?
Because of Mom?

1168
01:22:34,347 --> 01:22:35,519
That's enough, Joo Seok Kyung!

1169
01:22:35,585 --> 01:22:37,069
Now tell me why you're here.

1170
01:22:37,135 --> 01:22:38,837
I really want to get
into Seoul National University.

1171
01:22:38,903 --> 01:22:40,632
Take care of that little rat for me.

1172
01:22:40,698 --> 01:22:42,541
Do you have a death wish?
You should now when to stop.

1173
01:22:42,607 --> 01:22:43,947
It's simple. We'll use each other.

1174
01:22:44,013 --> 01:22:45,764
Until we have money in our hands.

1175
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,472
I'm determined to kneel before you
from now on.

1176
01:22:48,538 --> 01:22:50,561
Who's the guy who came in with Logan?

1177
01:22:50,627 --> 01:22:52,066
He was with someone?

1178
01:22:52,132 --> 01:22:53,509
We must find him first.

1179
01:22:53,575 --> 01:22:55,802
Oh Yoon Hee killed Logan?

1180
01:22:55,868 --> 01:22:58,346
It's only hard the first time around.

1181
01:22:58,412 --> 01:23:00,597
-Su Ryeon Shim.
-Who are you?
