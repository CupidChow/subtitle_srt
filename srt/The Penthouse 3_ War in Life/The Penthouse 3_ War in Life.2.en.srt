1
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,750
(The characters, locations, incidents, organizations,)

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,150
(and background of this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,860
Let me go! Where am I? Let go of me!

4
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,310
Oh Yoon Hee? Shim Su Ryeon?

5
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,500
Get off me!

6
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,130
Where am I? What's going on?

7
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,810
Shim Su Ryeon. Oh Yoon Hee. What's going on?

8
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,590
What are you doing here?

9
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,690
How did you manage to get out?

10
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,490
I guess you did a pretty good job of acting like a psycho.

11
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,300
Or did Joo Dan Tae help you?

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,200
Did you help him kill Logan?

13
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,070
You killed Logan, didn't you?

14
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,480
What are you talking about? It wasn't me!

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,120
You killed him.

16
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,740
Do you think I don't know that?

17
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,850
Why are you doing this?

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,320
Why are you doing this to me?

19
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,620
Thank you.

20
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,710
Wake up. I know you're not dead.

21
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,150
What's going on?

22
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,920
Why are you doing this to me?

23
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,750
Finally, here we all are.

24
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,510
Good job, everyone.

25
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,630
Shall we start cornering the rat then?

26
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,030
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,730
Our beginnings may have been different,

28
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,000
but we all want the same ending.

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,820
We want Joo Dan Tae gone.

30
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,200
There's nothing I wouldn't do for that happy ending.

31
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,940
I'm ready to join hands with anyone.

32
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,280
So? Are you telling me to cooperate with you?

33
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,820
Joo Dan Tae is in action.

34
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,920
He is now the owner of the 85th floor of Hera Palace.

35
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,420
At today's Cheong A Group shareholders' meeting,

36
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,110
he'll be appointed the only president.

37
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,660
Is it okay if you lose the entire Cheong A Group to him?

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,530
Bring evidence that he killed Logan.

39
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,860
Whatever it takes,

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,410
I need you to approach him and find some evidence.

41
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,670
What should I do that?

42
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,800
That's the only reason we saved you.

43
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,220
Do you want to help us or...

44
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,140
die here?

45
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,290
What?

46
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,920
The choice is yours.

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,720
I'm ready to get rid of you anytime.

48
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,730
Just like you tried to kill me two years ago.

49
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,530
Do you think I'm still the weak Shim Su Ryeon you used to know?

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,670
Can you do it or not?

51
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,670
Betray us, and I'll kill you with my hands.

52
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,730
Shut it.

53
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,170
Do you know what got me through in that cold prison cell?

54
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,010
Gnashing my teeth every day,

55
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,880
dreaming of paying Joo Dan Tae back.

56
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,320
Joo Dan Tae.

57
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,030
I'll never let you two kill him.

58
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Ms. Cheon!

59
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,940
I'll be the one killing him first.

60
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,410
Ms. Cheon!

61
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,440
Is it really okay to let her go like this?

62
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,790
What if she was involved in Logan's death?

63
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,250
How can you trust her?

64
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,330
I don't.

65
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,290
We'll see if we watch what she does from now.

66
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,840
Anyway, why did you get me out?

67
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,140
You even changed your witness statement.

68
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,140
The moment Joo Dan Tae was released,

69
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,910
the entire legal system collapsed.

70
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,740
Ro Na may be in danger again.

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,940
You need to be there to protect her.

72
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,040
Never trust the law again.

73
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,120
- I'll take you to the hospital. - There's no need.

74
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,030
What time is the shareholders' meeting today?

75
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,770
It starts at 2pm.

76
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,190
It seems like Mr. Joo is planning to dismiss...

77
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,970
every executive on your side.

78
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,140
Now that I'm out of prison, he can't have his way.

79
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,140
How much money do I have left?

80
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,780
Your buildings in Gangnam have been sold,

81
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,850
but after paying Ms. Shim 50 million dollars in compensation...

82
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,480
and paying a forfeit,

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,870
there's not much left.

84
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,020
That's impossible.

85
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,370
Do you know how many buildings I own in Myeongdong?

86
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,790
They should be worth at least hundreds of million dollars.

87
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,920
All your real estate has been transferred...

88
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,050
to the lady in Seongbuk-dong and Mr. Joo.

89
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,830
Do you mean they took everything away from me?

90
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,100
Was there anything strange on the day Logan died?

91
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,900
I told you to put a tail on Logan.

92
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,060
Here are the photos from where the explosion happened.

93
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,000
The old man right next to the car,

94
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,870
who sells popcorn, seems fishy.

95
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,610
An old man?

96
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
What about Eun Byeol?

97
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,350
Where's she now?

98
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,680
Here.

99
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,470
It's tasty.

100
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,790
"TOEFL Preparation Institute"?

101
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,270
You should take the TOEFL test once you enter university,

102
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,480
so I went to ask some questions,

103
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,040
and they keep calling me.

104
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,740
Eat up.

105
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,850
I love the shave ice here too.

106
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,190
This is the first time we've been here together, right?

107
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,490
When you eat this,

108
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,600
you're supposed to pour this over it.

109
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,810
It's so good.

110
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,850
When did you get released?

111
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,220
Are you released for good?

112
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,920
You look a mess.

113
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,250
I have nothing to say to you.

114
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,230
Eun Byeol, how have you been?

115
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,490
Are you well?

116
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,900
How did you get released?

117
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,290
I thought you got a seven-year sentence.

118
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,840
It's for you.

119
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,540
I was worried about you and missed you so much.

120
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,930
Look at me.

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,780
Eun Byeol.

122
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,220
Why did you show up in front of me?

123
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,720
I'd forgotten all about you and I'm doing well.

124
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,310
What are you talking about? I'm here to pick you up.

125
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,030
Who says I'm going back to you?

126
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,750
I'm living happily with Ms. Jin.

127
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,400
I get to eat and do whatever I want.

128
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Your mom is here. Why would you live with her?

129
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,060
Do you want her to ruin your life?

130
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,860
You're the one who ruined my life.

131
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,300
- My criminal parents did. - What?

132
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
What can you possibly do for me?

133
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,780
Do you have any money?

134
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,000
Do you have the power to get me into Seoul National University?

135
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,580
You even lost our place at Hera Palace to Seok Kyung's dad.

136
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,040
You've been kicked out of...

137
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,940
both the classical singing world and your company.

138
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,590
And you even went to prison.

139
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,330
You're nothing but humiliation and an obstacle in my life.

140
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,420
You have nothing left. Where can you take me?

141
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,350
I'll get everything back!

142
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,770
I've never been poor in my life.

143
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,300
Money? I can always make more.

144
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,330
I can do anything for you.

145
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,200
No. Don't do anything.

146
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,170
Without Ms. Jin,

147
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,540
I'd be in juvie now.

148
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,570
With even Grandma refusing to be my guardian,

149
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,180
who else could I rely on?

150
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,120
What did this woman do to you?

151
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,680
Let go of her!

152
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,290
Lay a finger on her,

153
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,030
and I'll kill myself.

154
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,870
Eun Byeol.

155
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,880
I've never been this happy.

156
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,310
Please don't take Ms. Jin away from me.

157
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,990
It's my last request.

158
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,680
Ms. Jin, let's move to another table.

159
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,200
Eun Byeol wants me to be her guardian.

160
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,910
She's the one who asked me to help her escape from Hera Palace.

161
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,040
That's not true. My daughter wouldn't do that.

162
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,780
She has her performance test for Seoul University next week.

163
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,340
She's sensitive right now, so don't try to see her again.

164
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,710
What's your relationship with Yoon Hee?

165
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,950
Was she the one who sent you to us?

166
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,530
Did she hire you to ruin Eun Byeol's life?

167
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,790
What if she were? Will you take revenge on her?

168
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,900
Were you really communicating with Yoon Hee?

169
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,460
Logan introduced us.

170
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,790
He's the one who brought me from the US.

171
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,140
Logan?

172
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,970
Then...

173
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,800
Does that mean Su Ryeon was in on it too?

174
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,920
I felt bad for never visiting you in prison.

175
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,880
Would you like a shaved ice?

176
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,920
Fine. You should leave me.

177
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,400
If I have you,

178
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,720
I'll have to let Dan Tae attack me again.

179
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,140
The more I have to protect, the more vulnerable I am.

180
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,270
I won't come to you...

181
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,510
until I put everything back to the way it was.

182
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,340
Open up!

183
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,650
Open up, Dan Tae!

184
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,120
Dan Tae! Open up!

185
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,680
This is my home. Dan Tae!

186
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,790
You changed the code?

187
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,960
You changed the code? You changed the code?

188
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,170
How could you break someone else's door down?

189
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,670
Get out of here!

190
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,740
We're in trouble if Chairman Joo comes.

191
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,540
I'll get fired!

192
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,340
Darn it. Get over here.

193
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,010
Don't you dare touch me!

194
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,020
This is my home.

195
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,540
I'll show you whom you'll bow to. Just wait and see.

196
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,860
(Cheong A Group)

197
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,670
We will begin the Cheong A Group shareholders' meeting.

198
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,800
What kind of risk management...

199
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,800
have you been doing?

200
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,150
There are no bank investments...

201
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,940
and our stock prices have tanked.

202
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,420
Cheong A is about to go bust.

203
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,650
Did you decide to give up and watch it sink?

204
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,260
I mean... The owner was linked to a murder.

205
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,260
How could the company survive?

206
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,920
You're paid a high salary...

207
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,500
to take care of things like that.

208
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,090
That's why you're sitting there, Director Cho.

209
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,240
Companies have a system.

210
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,870
If Director Cheon Seo Jin were here,

211
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,140
it wouldn't have gotten this bad.

212
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,930
I won't tolerate your abuse of power any longer.

213
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,970
Listen to that wild hog talk.

214
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,970
If you miss Seo Jin so much,

215
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,380
go visit her in prison.

216
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,380
You're fired.

217
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,890
Chairman Joo!

218
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,160
Even the chairman can't abuse executives like this.

219
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,550
You're fired too.

220
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,130
Anyone who's unhappy with me, submit your resignation.

221
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,560
I won't stop you, and there's no way I'll listen to your criticism.

222
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Cheong A will be run as Joo Dan Tae dictates.

223
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,540
If you want to end up on the street, keep yapping away!

224
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,580
We must work together...

225
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,860
to save the company.

226
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,220
Let's hear your ideas...

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,950
for how to save Cheong A.

228
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,280
Seo Jin?

229
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,900
Honey. I've missed you so much.

230
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,420
What are you doing?

231
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,060
Thank you...

232
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,790
for doing everything you could to get me out of prison.

233
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,510
It's all thanks to you.

234
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,610
What are you babbling about?

235
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,670
Chairman Joo.

236
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,540
Thank you for agreeing to give us the first interview.

237
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,670
Me?

238
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,540
You returned quickly amidst much criticism.

239
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,940
Stock prices have been hitting all-time lows.

240
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,520
Don't you think your return was a bit rash?

241
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,420
You're the one who's rash.

242
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,760
How long has it been since he made his return?

243
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,270
However, Cheong A Group will change very soon.

244
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,500
Upon opening Cheong A Art Center,

245
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,740
we will make a great leap forward.

246
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,240
Ms. Cheon. Is it true that you gave Shim Su Ryeon...

247
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,640
50 million dollars in compensation?

248
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,510
Whereas I was wronged in many ways,

249
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,610
I've cleared up my misunderstandings with her.

250
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,470
Please explain the rumours of your problems with Chairman Joo.

251
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,390
My husband and I do not have any problems.

252
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Those rumours are all lies.

253
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,220
My husband and I will make it up to the people.

254
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,740
We will cherish family...

255
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,560
and give our all in saving Cheong A Group.

256
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,880
We'll make more and use the money for good.

257
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,620
Please trust us...

258
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,990
and watch how we do.

259
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,400
Smile a little.

260
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,560
Like you're in total bliss.

261
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,640
Thank you.

262
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,840
Thank you.

263
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,040
("Joo Dan Tae Reunited with Cheon Seo Jin, Stock Prices Soar.")

264
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,260
('Cheon promised that she will make it up to the people...")

265
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,920
("Joo Dan Tae Reunited with Cheon Seo Jin, Stock Prices Soar.")

266
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,130
See?

267
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,900
Seo Jin hasn't changed at all.

268
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,950
No, she became more evil.

269
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,130
She went back to Dan Tae.

270
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,270
She had no choice but to join forces with him...

271
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,240
in order to increase the value of Cheong A stock.

272
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,410
This is what I was after.

273
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,140
You were after this?

274
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,880
I cut off all of her sources of funds.

275
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,120
That way, she'd run to Dan Tae.

276
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,180
I plan...

277
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,120
to fight fire with fire.

278
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,560
Since it's true that he messed with her profits.

279
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,060
Do you think she'll help you though?

280
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,920
Would she bring you evidence that he killed Logan?

281
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,460
Why are you pretending to be strong?

282
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,190
You're not fine at all.

283
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,340
You're dying inside because of Logan.

284
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,070
You watched...

285
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,140
the man you love die.

286
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,410
You can be honest when you're with me.

287
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,510
I'm more worried because you're acting so tough.

288
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,920
I don't have the luxury of crying.

289
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,390
I have to prove Dan Tae killed him. That's priority.

290
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,090
You planned this little charade as soon as you got out.

291
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,330
Let's remain married until Cheong A is stabilized.

292
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,960
Consider it a contract marriage.

293
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,730
Says who?

294
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,530
I can de-list this company...

295
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,000
or build it up.

296
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,880
In other words, if I can't have it, I can kill it.

297
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,650
You can't return to Cheong A Group.

298
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,380
Your followers have been fired already.

299
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,480
I know you're here...

300
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,780
to stab me in the back.

301
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,420
I can't trust you either.

302
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,980
It's simple. We'll use each other.

303
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,160
Until we have money in our hands.

304
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,570
If stock prices shoot up every time we smile at each other,

305
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,800
what's so hard about it?

306
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,670
Weren't you planning...

307
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,730
to build up the company and sell it anyway?

308
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,170
But sorry.

309
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,850
I...

310
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,940
don't want to team up with you...

311
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,240
in the slightest.

312
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,180
You'll regret it.

313
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,230
What is this?

314
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,910
Your disguise was incredible.

315
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,150
It's so you.

316
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,050
Who is this old man?

317
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,010
You know exactly who it is.

318
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,860
Did you forget?

319
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,920
Secretary Do is great at his job.

320
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
But then,

321
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,130
he learned from the great Joo Dan Tae.

322
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,730
I was actually quite surprised.

323
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,140
That you'd kill Logan to get a not-guilty sentence?

324
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,880
I never even imagined that.

325
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,580
Turn my Hera Palace to what it was.

326
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,280
And make me a joint partner of Cheong A Group.

327
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,710
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

328
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,710
You don't want to?

329
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,750
Would you not mind if I send those photos to Shim Su Ryeon now?

330
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,280
Actually, no.

331
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,330
Wouldn't it be best if I send them to Logan Lee's...

332
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,130
grieving family in the US?

333
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,990
I heard they're frantically trying to find their son's killer.

334
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,170
What shall I do?

335
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,310
I quite like the new interior and furniture.

336
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,770
Good job.

337
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
Oh, right.

338
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,980
Who's the guy who came in with Logan?

339
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,590
Did you kill him too?

340
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,130
He was with someone?

341
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,460
My goodness. You didn't know that either?

342
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,570
It's not fun if there are too many witnesses.

343
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,810
Darn it!

344
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,950
What is it, Su Ryeon?

345
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,720
It's nothing.

346
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
Mom.

347
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,440
Who are you people?

348
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,510
How did you get in here?

349
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,300
Oh. So you're the infamous Su Ryeon Shim, huh?

350
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,420
Who are you?

351
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,140
I want you to answer my god damn question first.

352
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,410
What did you do to my brother Logan?

353
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,140
He is Logan's older brother.

354
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,120
Do you actually think I killed Logan?

355
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,320
Yeah. Because all the motivations are there.

356
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,420
You see, you must have a grudge against my family...

357
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,390
for what my parents did to your daughter.

358
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,660
But shoot. Did you really have to go that far?

359
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,520
Yo, my parents, they're already on trial.

360
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,630
My parents, they're already paying for their mistakes.

361
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,690
So why the...

362
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,030
Logan has to go and die like that?

363
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,030
You call this revenge?

364
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,810
I wish I were the one who had killed him.

365
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,810
What was that?

366
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,850
If I hated him,

367
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,470
and I killed him because I couldn't forgive him,

368
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,170
then at least I'd feel better.

369
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,750
He called me every day and showed his concern for me,

370
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,450
and suddenly he's gone from my side.

371
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,190
Do you know how dreadful that feeling is?

372
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,260
So many times a day I think I should've stopped him from coming.

373
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,840
Was there something I could've done for him?

374
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,870
The regret and anger are driving me crazy.

375
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,610
If only I could turn back time,

376
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,010
I'd be okay with not seeing him ever again.

377
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,420
I would do anything if only I could bring him back.

378
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,330
Then you should've never called him back in the first place!

379
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,090
You should've just let him go!

380
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,860
Don't you know him better than that?

381
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,130
He wanted to be responsible for what his parents did.

382
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,260
I trusted his sincerity.

383
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,190
We...

384
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,760
Jesus.

385
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,970
Shoot.

386
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,240
Now, on the day of Logan's death,

387
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,980
there was 10 billion dollars...

388
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,240
withdrawn from his personal bank account.

389
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,680
You know where this money is, right?

390
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,780
I don't know about that.

391
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,890
Liar!

392
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,600
If you don't know where this money is, then who does?

393
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,420
He told me that money was for Seol A.

394
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,990
Move.

395
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,960
Move.

396
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,810
No, sir.

397
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,880
You cannot leave the house. Direct orders from the master.

398
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,050
I have to go.

399
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,170
Can't you tell I'm with a company?

400
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,120
- Get out of the way. - Hey!

401
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,890
Just where the heck do you think you're going?

402
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,890
- You are going nowhere. - Alex.

403
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,780
Why are you stopping me too?

404
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,520
Joo Dan Tae's a very dangerous person.

405
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,130
If I don't go back and prove him guilty...

406
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,020
for all his wrongdoings in the past,

407
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,420
and have him rot in jail,

408
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,340
Su Ryeon can end up in danger again.

409
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,700
Well, that's exactly why I'm telling you...

410
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,110
you are going nowhere.

411
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,110
Do you not know what you mean to this family?

412
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,910
Do you not know what our parents did...

413
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,470
to save your darn life?

414
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,780
You.

415
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,890
You're the one who's supposed to take over Pop's business.

416
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,010
I have to go and protect her, no matter what.

417
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,390
I promised her that I'd make her happy.

418
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,860
Do you really think...

419
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,460
this woman, she's going to forgive our family?

420
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,420
That's more the reason why I'm sorry.

421
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,260
Instead of hating me like she's supposed to,

422
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,260
she chooses to care for me.

423
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,610
Alex. I need her by my side to be happy. So please.

424
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,710
Let me go.

425
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,580
Jesus Christ.

426
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,660
What about the 10 billion dollars you cashed out from real estate?

427
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,390
Is all that money for her too?

428
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,330
That money was for Seol A anyway.

429
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,220
I never thought it was mine.

430
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,190
For goodness sake, Logan.

431
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,900
Who, I mean... What is this woman to you?

432
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,910
I like her. I like Su Ryeon.

433
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,140
What did you say?

434
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,470
I like her.

435
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Very much.

436
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,850
Listen, Alex. I only got a second chance at life...

437
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,970
because of Seol A.

438
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,180
The new life she gave me, I want to spend for Su Ryeon.

439
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,820
My heart...

440
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,680
and all my belongings.

441
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,220
Now, whoever was after Logan for that 10 billion dollars,

442
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,800
I swear to almighty, I'll find him...

443
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,600
and I'll kill him.

444
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,500
Even if that means you, lady.

445
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,000
So you best be prepared.

446
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,780
Hey, yo! Let's go.

447
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,650
Was there really something between Mom and Logan?

448
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,650
No, right?

449
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,440
The weird rumour isn't true, is it?

450
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,590
I told you to trust Mom.

451
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,120
Once we believe, we trust forever.

452
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,910
Mom.

453
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,670
My little girl.

454
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,920
Have you been strong?

455
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,210
You're not sick, are you?

456
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,480
You look like you lost weight.

457
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,010
I went on a diet.

458
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,570
I missed you, Ro Na. I missed you so much.

459
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,740
You stupid jerk!

460
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,620
You had no idea Secretary Do was following you?

461
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,350
Why didn't you tell me he had company?

462
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,940
What if he saw something?

463
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,660
You haven't found him yet, have you?

464
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,220
I'm checking all the CCTVs...

465
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,690
and dashboard cameras from nearby...

466
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,020
and he didn't show up.

467
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,420
What do you know so far?

468
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,760
Nothing other than that he flew in with Logan.

469
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,700
His name is Baek Jun Ki.

470
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,970
Baek Jun Ki?

471
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,850
Have the police not yet called about Baek Jun Ki?

472
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,320
I don't think they found him yet.

473
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,680
Where is he hiding?

474
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,250
Any departure records?

475
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,830
None.

476
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,630
I downloaded a tracking app on the phone...

477
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,520
Logan gave him to use in Korea,

478
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
and he hasn't turned on his phone yet.

479
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,930
That means he's still in Korea.

480
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,230
We must find him first.

481
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,270
Before Joo Dan Tae does something.

482
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,510
Bang.

483
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,660
Bang.

484
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,760
Yes, honey. Did you get there okay?

485
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,810
What's the weather like in New York?

486
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,610
The jet lag must be killing you.

487
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,730
Okay.

488
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,500
What? Of course, I'm home.

489
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,670
I just lay down to go to bed.

490
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,050
Got it. I love you.

491
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,750
No!

492
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,600
Get out. Get out.

493
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,460
Get out.

494
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,340
What are you doing here?

495
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,310
Shouldn't you lead with "long time no see?"

496
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,210
Is this why you never visited?

497
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,940
I'm disappointed.

498
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,630
There she is. Your mom.

499
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,330
What happened?

500
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,920
Seo Young, what is all this?

501
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,630
There you are.

502
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,430
You said my adultery...

503
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,760
brought shame to the family.

504
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,230
But I don't think your daughter leads a much better life.

505
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,410
What? "Your daughter?"

506
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,620
I believe Seo Young's in-laws are very sensitive about these issues.

507
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,710
Is it okay if...

508
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,710
I tell them?

509
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,450
Their classy, quiet daughter-in-law...

510
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,920
cheated on her husband with their driver.

511
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,490
- What are you doing? How crude... - Crude?

512
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,170
How classy did you think I was going to be after serving time?

513
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,840
Is that why you never visited...

514
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,270
when your "classy" daughter went to jail...

515
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,080
and even pushed Eun Byeol away?

516
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,920
How dare you call yourself family?

517
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,350
What is it...

518
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,980
that you want?

519
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,680
Return everything you stole from me.

520
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,190

521
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,720

525
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,550
the life of your precious daughter.

526
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,440
Mom. Tell her we'll give anything.

527
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,240
You want to see me get divorced?

(Building transfer agreement, Share transfer agreement)

529
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,690
I'll give you back the Myeongdong building.

530
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,530
But not Cheong A Foundation.

531
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,430
I sold it to Shim Su Ryeon.

532
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,340
How can you sell that?

533
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,850
Bring it back!

534
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,240
Even if it means a high penalty!

535
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,970
It's already done.

536
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,780
Please, Seo Jin. Let's just end it here.

537
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,950
I beg of you.

538
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,090
Please. I'm sorry.

539
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,420
- Seo Jin... - She's your sister, after all.

540
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,130
- Seo Jin, please... - Seo Jin, we're family.

541
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,300
Shim Su Ryeon. Of all people, why?

542
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,760
You really want to be my nemesis?

543
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,490
What's this?

544
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,420
What? Do you think it's poisoned?

545
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,730
If we're going to pretend to be a happy couple,

546
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,130
you should get used to this much.

547
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,910
Don't do anything unless I ask you to.

548
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,480
Do you think I wanted to do this?

549
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,540
Since we made a deal,

550
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,410
I think we should sign a contract.

551
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,050
I find it offensive when you invade my personal space.

552
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,220
Gladly.

553
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,550
This time, I get to decide.

554
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,460
Strictly abide by the rules written here.

555
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,560
Every time you break a rule, you lose one percent of your stock.

556
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Sign it.

567

568
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,900
until Cheon A Group's stock price doubles.

569
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,270
Once my goal is achieved, we'll get divorced...

570

and part ways. Keep your promise.

You should do the same. I'm not some thug.

572

You're not a thug. You're a scumbag.

Did you know Dad moved back to Hera Palace?

585
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,320
Seok Hoon, I can explain.

586
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,320
I'm the one who asked the restraining order to be lifted.

587
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,460
What?

588
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,530
Why? Can't I do that?

589
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,830
He's been cleared of murder charges.

590
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,470
Why can't he live here?

591
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,870
Why should we object to the court's decision?

592
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,970
I thought we were finally out of Dad's grip. Why in the world...

593
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,610
are you doing this?

594
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,750
Seok Kyung, if you want, I'm not going to stop you...

595
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,020
from seeing your dad.

596
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,850
But think about Ro Na.

597
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,550
If your dad lives at Hera Palace...

598
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,660
Why should I think about Ro Na?

599
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,490
She's a victim.

600
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,230
She can't live in the same building as the perpetrator.

601
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,000
You still see Ro Na's mom.

602
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,130
You keep the woman who killed your daughter with you.

603
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,400
Why not Dad?

604
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,700
- Seok Kyung! - Don't yell at me!

605
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,870
I know you're going to the US with Ro Na.

606
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,310
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

607
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,850
You only care and think about Ro Na.

608
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,310
You don't care at all about me,

609
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:12,180
so why are you stopping me from being close to Dad?

610
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,290
Did you forget what he did to us?

611
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,520
He even tried to kill our mom.

612
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,720
How are you still like this after all that he did to us?

613
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,530

00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,100
I don't want you to go there? You're mistaken.

What did he mean to you?

620
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,910
Did you like the jerk who harassed us or something?

621
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,210
Was he the one who tried to send Seok Hoon to the US?

622
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,780
To claim the penthouse by yourself as Dad said?

623
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,250
That's enough, Joo Seok Kyung!

00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,760
You have no right to hit me!

627
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,000
Are you happy now?

628
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,170
You turned us against each other. Does that make you happy?

629
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,810
I will never leave the penthouse...

630
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,810

You're the one who should leave, not me.

636
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,710
You are just as shameless as your mom.

637
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,380
I live here too. On the 85th floor.

638
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,990
We'll run into each other morning and night.

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,590
What does my daughter want?

664
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,060
Caviar? Lobster?

665
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,430
- All of it. - Okay. Give me a minute.

666
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,530
The pizza's good.

667
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:19,040
Seok Hoon. I'm going to apply to Seoul University.

668
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,570
You are? You'll really take the test?

669
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,510
I have no reason to run away.

670
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,280
I'll prepare hard.

671
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,110
Good. I'll help you.

672
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,810
Thanks.

673
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,020
Ma Doo Ki speaking.

674
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,020
Why are you telling me that now?

675
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,100
Come on. Drink faster.

676
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,100
Hey. Drink like Jenny.

677
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,540
Okay. That's it.

678
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,010
Want to die?

679
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
Sorry?

680
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,380
How much are you going to eat?

681
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,560
Here, my princess. Eat more.

682
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,030
You need to eat well and be strong to perform well.

683
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,760
I don't want to eat anymore. I'll gain weight.

684
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,660
I have to watch my weight now.

685
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,200
I want to do everything for you that I couldn't while I was away.

686
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,900
Why are you refusing?

687
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,870
You're just excited that Mom's coming out, aren't you?

688
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,140
Gosh. That too.

689
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,040
Now that our family's reunited, we are invincible.

690
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,250
Stand tall. Stand proud.

691
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,880
Don't be discouraged, okay?

692
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,100
I must be studying too hard. I'm hallucinating.

693
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,510
What's your problem?

694
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,680
What do you want?

695
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,080
You haven't changed.

696
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,990
You're a spoiled brat and a rude punk.

697
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,320
Are you done?

698
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,190
It's a compliment.

699
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,660
No matter what happens,

700
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,430
you're strong and confident. That's your strength.

701
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,270
I really want you to get along...

702
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,870
with my daughter Jenny.

703
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,670
You're friends.

704
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,810
(Joo Seok Kyung)

705
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,910
Otherwise, that would be a really big problem.

706
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,920
Is the boys' room this way?

707
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,790
See you later.

708
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,730
Mr. Yoo. You've messed with the wrong girl.

709
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
I'll make you regret that.

710
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,240
(Director Cheon Seo Jin)

711
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,190
(Director Cheon Seo Jin)

712
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,330
Seok Hoon's mother... I mean, Director Shim.

713
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,160
I just heard the news.

714
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,460
That you'll be our interim director.

715
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,970
I got the call too late.

716
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,230
I didn't get to clean up. I'm sorry.

717
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,370
- Mr. Ma Doo Ki? - Yes?

718
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,470
As the interim director,

719
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,340
I'd like to see all the student records.

720
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,540
Will you get them for me right now?

721
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,650
Why do you want to see...

722
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,550
I see. You must be worried about Seok Hoon's...

723
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,420
and Seok Kyung's college applications.

724
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,720
You don't have to worry about a thing.

725
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,920
You know me.

726
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,020
I've made sure they're perfect as per Chairman Joo's orders.

727
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,390
I made sure they won every award that was given out...

728
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,330
within the school.

729
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,470
They received 50 awards.

730
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,570
I heard you've even lost your house in a speculative investment.

731
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,440
I guess you still haven't learned your lesson.

732
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,780
- Pardon? - From this day forth,

733
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,340
you've been removed from all of your duties.

734
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,880
The grounds will be what you just admitted.

735
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,980
Manipulating student records.

736
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,190
But I did that for your babies...

737
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,690
I mean, your children.

738
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,960
I devoted myself to them.

739
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,490
It is my rule...

740
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,060
that no one gets special treatment. Not even my own children.

741
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Given the disgraceful incident...

742
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,230
during the festival this year,

743
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,900
the principal will no longer give recommendations.

744
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,410
That is all. You may leave.

745
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,750
This is unfair.

746
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,910
All I did was devote myself...

747
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,880
to the school and the parents.

748
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,250
And I've played a big part...

749
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,050
in sending so many students to the top colleges.

750
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:11,930
You can't do this to me.

751
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,800
I'll submit a complaint to the Ministry of Education.

752
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,670
I won't go down alone.

753
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:24,940
So please, give me one more chance.

754
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,110
As an educator,

755
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,350
you should not have submitted to the parents.

756
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,950
I'm done listening to you.

757
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,190
Ma'am. Director Shim. Director Shim!

758
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,590
He must be waiting.

759
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,890
Mother, do you really plan not to go?

760
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,200
Why should I go there?

761
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,930
Did Kyu Jin save the country or something?

762
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,000
When I think about my money that he blew,

763
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,200
I stay up at night crying.

764
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,840
I'm only stopping by because of my grandson.

765
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,810
Well, now that you're out, I don't need to come anymore.

766
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:05,080
Mother. He'll be very hurt.

767
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,450
Father...

768
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,520
cut all ties with us as soon as he went to jail.

769
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,790
He's just waiting...

770
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,630
for us to post his bail.

771
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,300
Give me a break.

772
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,330
My son is in prison.

773
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,400
My daughter-in-law is out on probation.

774
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,070
My grandson is a school bully.

775
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,140
What idiocy is this...

776
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,100
in a family of lawyers?

777
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,910
Don't come over for the time being.

778
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,580
Stay quiet until you hear from me.

779
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,550
Mother. Mother.

780
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,050
You can't just leave, Mother.

781
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,920
Mother!

782
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,200
I am free of my in-laws.

783
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,540
I am free of my husband!

784
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,910
It's been so long since I was free.

785
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,980
Kyu Jin, I'm sorry.

786
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,780
You never served in the army,

787
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,480
so you've never lived with a group before.

788
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,880
Since you're in there,

789
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:13,620
I hope you come back out as a decent human being.

790
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,590
Good luck.

791
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,360
I wish you the best.

792
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,560
Sang A!

793
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,600
Why am I hearing things?

794
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,740
Come back home

795
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,510
Kyu Jin got out on bail.

796
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,990
Sang A!

797
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,920
(Seoul Bank)

798
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,240
Hey! Mr. Yoo.

799
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,280
Attorney Lee, you got out.

800
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,350
I should've visited you sooner.

801
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,220
Your wife got out too, right?

802
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
You bet. I did my time,

803
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,960
and then Kyu Jin got out to see you.

804
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,900
Why is there black stuff on the surface? That's a bad omen.

805
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,830
I think there's an issue with the plumbing.

806
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,230
It smells bad, doesn't it?

807
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,530
I'll call Maintenance...

808
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,400
and fix it up perfectly myself.

809
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,800
I'm sure they'll manage.

810
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,110
Let's get going. Chairman Joo wants us there by 9pm.

811
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,340
But darn it, this rotten smell is really bad.

812
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,750
Do you think it's a dead body?

813
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,520
Let's go.

814
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,850
Oh, my.

815
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,660
Cheers.

816
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:39,960
Are you sure Cheong A Group can make a comeback?

817
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,530
Your shares reached a new low. It's killing me.

818
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:46,700
I trusted my stupid aide and bought at the last minute...

819
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,070
and now I'm totally ruined.

820
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,940
But then, both husband and wife ended up in handcuffs.

821
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,010
Who would invest?

822
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,310
Have you forgotten already who got you out on bail?

823
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,650
Do you know how much I spent to get your wife out too?

824
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,390
Try not to get too upset.

825
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,320
I said that out of pure concern.

826
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:09,290
Stock prices will rise again with one good piece of news.

827
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,560
What good news? A friend?

828
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,830
Do you have a friend called Good News?

829
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,300
Good news isn't a person's name here.

830
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,270
Dong Pil is way older than me,

831
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,440
but you're an idiot.

832
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,410
What gives you the guts to keep sidling up to me?

833
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,450
If there's no good news, make some.

834
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,910
Right, Chairman?

835
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,550
Don't you have a plan?

836
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,650
- Cheonsoo District. - Cheon... Cheon...

837
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:41,060
Not again. Not that darn Cheonsoo District again!

838
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:43,590
I sunk millions of dollars into that...

839
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,160
and my mom disowned me and I had to quit politics.

840
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,400
My whole life was ruined!

841
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,900
Get back up after you fall. Isn't that how life is?

842
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:53,970
Do you have what I asked for?

843
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,840
Here's the report on Opyeong District.

844
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,440
After the redevelopment was announced,

845
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,210
everything's been going well without a hitch.

846
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,250
Opyeong District's redevelopment. We have to flip it.

847
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,390
Does that make sense? The land there...

848
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,890
was flattened out...

849
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:12,260
and they started work already.

850
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,660
Isn't that why we gathered to put our heads together?

851
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:18,960
How did you pass the bar with a brain like that?

852
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,270
The planner of our group...

853
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,800
was always Dr. Ha.

854
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,040
Yes.

855
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,540
He was a hypocrite, but he was a smart one.

856
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,940
I lost my appetite for alcohol!

857
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,280
Why must you mention a fool...

858
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,950
who needs to rot in jail for much longer?

859
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,280
So I invited another person...

860
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,590
with the smart brain that you want.

861
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,820
Come in!

862
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,500
How've you been?

863
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,110
Stay seated.

864
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,810
You don't have to stand to welcome me.

865
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,080
It's too much of an honour.

866
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,480
Ha Yoon Chul, how come you're here?

867
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,150
When did you get out?

868
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,450
Just today.

869
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,650
I had the shortest sentence of us all.

870
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,250
Wasn't my release a long time coming?

871
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,200
This is fantastic.

872
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,830
Let's talk about work first.

873
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,670
Mr. Yoo briefed me on why you're meeting today.

874
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,240
I'm here because I'd like to join this project.

875
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,910
Why did you invite him without my permission?

876
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,740
How much did you tell him?

877
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,140
Two years ago, near Opyeong District,

878
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,280
a Joseon kiln site was found.

879
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,480
You know that, right?

880
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:52,260
The trick to put a stop to the Opyeong District development.

881
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,690
I have one.

882
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,570
I did some thinking when I was left alone in jail.

883
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:05,240
What do I get from pretending to be...

884
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,040
just and straight?

885
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,980
I won't do that anymore, and now I know my place.

886
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:16,880
I decided to be the worst of the worst trash.

887
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,880
Wrong.

888
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,950
I disapprove.

889
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,720
He's an expert at stabbing people in the back.

890
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,120
Don't you remember how he betrayed us in court?

891
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,960
Chairman Joo, you won't trust Traitor Ha, will you?

892
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:35,330
Right now, right here, no one's as desperate as I am.

893
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,370
I lost everything.

894
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:40,570
My wife, kid, home, money, honour, everything!

895
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,370
Even my doctor's license was suspended.

896
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,940
I can't even practice now.

897
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,380
Isn't that why...

898
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:57,320
you're back here, to get revenge on us?

899
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:02,890
Hey. Do you think we are stupid and...

900
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,270
Revenge is only possible when you have money and power.

901
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,070
I need to survive.

902
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,480
What must I do to make you believe me?

903
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,560
He's insane.

904
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,430
Shall I dig out my heart too?

905
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,940
Do it.

906
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:49,910
Stop.

907
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,130
You won't regret this.

908
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:20,200
I'm even prepared to lick the soles of your feet.

909
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,540
(Opyeong District Redevelopment Plan)

910
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,110
(Wiretapped)

911
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,780
You idiot. How many times must I tell you?

912
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,950
Look. If an artifact is unearthed in Opyeong District...

913
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,460
Construction will be stopped...

914
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,390
and an investigation will begin.

915
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,460
Then Cheonsoo District that was going to be redeveloped...

916
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,830
but then not will resurface as the next place to redevelop.

917
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:50,800
It's next to a kiln site,

918
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,570
so the artifact should be pottery.

919
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,600
I will look into that.

920
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,640
We'll get something if we ask a fencer.

921
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,970
We'll need an excavator.

922
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,610
I will drive it myself.

923
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:01,750
I can invite reporters and civic groups...

924
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,410
to make a huge fuss.

925
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,390
Hey, Ha Yoon Chul.

926
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,790
I can no longer stand watching you be so haughty.

927
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,090
Tonight, let's get things straight.

928
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,430
We need to sort out our rank.

929
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,730
I was born in October of 1978.

930
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,070
I was born in early 1978.

931
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,770
But you can be my senior.

932
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,040
I am your minion!

933
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,050
It has been a while since the four of us got together.

934
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:38,550
We must make it big.

935
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,190
Let's score so that we stink of money.

936
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,820
You're way too eager.

937
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,560
The group feels perfect now that Dr. Ha is back.

938
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,060
Let's make a toast.

939
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,500
Here's to the grand return of Hera Club in its entirety.

940
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,200
- Cheers! - Cheers!

941
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,570
- Hey. Yoon Chul. - Yes?

942
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,640
Why don't you sing for us?

943
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,050
Freeze.

944
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,950
Do you know what time it is?

945
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,750
Your wife was released from prison today.

946
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,490
How could you come home at this hour reeking of alcohol?

947
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,860
Honey.

948
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,260
Sweetheart.

949
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,770
My lady, tonight is going to be an unforgettable night.

950
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:38,540
- Dad! - Jenny.

951
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:42,180
Jenny, were you still up?

952
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,280
Of course, I waited up.

953
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,750
Our family is finally reunited. How about some chicken and soda?

954
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,380
Dad, I found an amazing chicken place.

955
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,450
You did? Then shall we?

956
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:55,120
This is not okay. I had a plan, Jenny.

957
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,060
- Go in. - Okay.

958
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:58,660
Come on.

959
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,860
Let me just change first.

960
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,970
Order everything you want.

961
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:08,770
Anyway, why did you come home so late?

962
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:10,240
Did you already start working?

963
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,540
I should get moving soon.

964
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,980
I had a business meeting.

965
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:17,250
The fountain on the first floor seems to be out of order.

966
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,710
Has it ever happened before?

967
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,450
The fountain is out of order?

968
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,150
It was built with the best materials from Europe.

969
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,150
That's strange.

970
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:27,720
As the person who built it, I feel bad.

971
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,790
I should probably take it apart myself.

972
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,700
You're going to quit this, right?

973
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:41,640
Quit right now.

974
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,170
I'll make sure we move to the top floor of Hera Palace.

975
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:46,910
Well...

976
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,610
I'm still too young to retire.

977
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:54,720
As long as there are ladies who insist on receiving my service,

978
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,480
how can I quit?

979
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,790
Here. Cheers.

980
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,560
I hope you're not getting involved with Joo Dan Tae.

981
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,900
I'm not. That's absurd.

982
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,800
You'd better not.

983
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,240
I won't sit back if you get involved with that jerk in any way.

984
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:20,210
He deserves to be torn to pieces. That piece of trash.

985
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,880
You're on probation now.

986
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,950
You shouldn't tear a person to pieces.

987
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:27,050
So? Are you going to continue to hang out with him?

988
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,020
You were in prison for six years because of that jerk.

989
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,220
- It makes my blood boil. - Is someone talking about me?

990
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,960
Are you listening to me or not?

991
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,430
Jenny, has the food arrived yet?

992
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,430
Wait.

993
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:43,770
He's not only good-looking but also so kind-hearted.

994
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,900
I can never relax.

995
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,220
I'm so worried.

996
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,990
SNU's performance test is right around the corner.

997
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,790
I wonder if I can lose weight until then.

998
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:12,060
It's your kid taking the test.

999
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,730
Why should you lose weight?

1000
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,300
As her mom, I should do something.

1001
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,170
It's the least I can do to get her into SNU.

1002
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,210
At our age, we don't have the energy to work out.

1003
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:27,110
And it's not easy to lose weight simply by fasting.

1004
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,110
You're right.

1005
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,650
- Excuse me. What's taking so long? - Gosh.

1006
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,390
Hello.

1007
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:40,090
Oh, my.

1008
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:41,590
How have you been?

1009
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:45,030
Yoon Hee, what are you doing here?

1010
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,330
Don't tell me you work here.

1011
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,460
I did hear that you got released,

1012
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,500
but I didn't expect you to find a job so soon.

1013
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,340
Anyway, how did you get released so early?

1014
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:59,770
We really need stricter laws in this country.

1015
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,110
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin walked free...

1016
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:05,410
after committing crimes too.

1017
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,220
Are you okay with that?

1018
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,620
I got released legally.

1019
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,660
Stop being nosy.

1020
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,220
How dare you speak to me like that?

1021
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,060
You're a murderer!

1022
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,840
My gosh.

1023
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,080
You scared me.

1024
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:40,220
From now on, please be more careful.

1025
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,250
The first time is always the hardest.

1026
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,900
Let me know if you need any help.

1027
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,370
Gosh.

1028
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:02,140
Did she just threaten to kill us?

1029
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,070
Unit 4502 belongs to JohnBIO,

1030
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,510
so I thought she'd move out immediately.

1031
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:08,610
But apparently, I was wrong.

1032
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:11,910
Hera Palace is no rehab center for criminals.

1033
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:13,480
To rent a shop this size in Hera Palace,

1034
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,250
she must've paid a huge deposit.

1035
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,790
I wonder where Ms. Oh got that much money.

1036
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:21,020
I know. Maybe Su Ryeon lent her some money.

1037
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,290
No way.

1038
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,960
Why would she lend money to a woman who killed her daughter?

1039
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,800
Did she hit the jackpot or something?

1040
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,630
Did she make money in prison?

1041
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,440
She sure has a way with money.

1042
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,900
That's not it. Be quiet for a moment.

1043
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,940
There must be something huge behind her.

1044
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,320
Su Ryeon, it's been a while.

1045
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,990
Thanks to you, I experienced so many things...

1046
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,290
that I never imagined I would.

1047
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:55,790
I see.

1048
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,330
You know,

1049
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:01,460
if we're going to keep seeing each other as neighbors,

1050
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:05,170
I think we should let bygones be bygones.

1051
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,400
We went through so much in there.

1052
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,570
You have no idea.

1053
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,980
It must've been so hard.

1054
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,480
Is that what you want to hear?

1055
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:23,490
Let's face it, you're not entirely innocent either.

1056
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,750
Oh Yoon Hee is already out of prison...

1057
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:29,220
and has even opened her own shop.

1058
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:32,030
It isn't exactly a pretty sight, I must say.

1059
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,390
She opened her own shop?

1060
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:35,300
You didn't know that?

1061
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,000
We thought you financed it.

1062
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:40,970
Then who financed it?

1063
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,870
Did Logan leave some money to her...

1064
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,210
when he died?

1065
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,470
Why would he?

1066
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,010
What's their relationship?

1067
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,250
Could it be that Oh Yoon Hee...

1068
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,620
Killed him?

1069
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,020
You people haven't changed a bit, have you?

1070
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,350
Do you still fear nothing in the world?

1071
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:00,560
Watch your mouth.

1072
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,500
Is she going to report us or something?

1073
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,470
What's the big deal about Logan?

1074
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,500
Is he someone sacred we can't even talk about?

1075
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,940
- I know. - Fine, go ahead and report us!

1076
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:21,110
Using accurate data,

1077
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:25,710
we first find out why you gained weight to begin with.

1078
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,480
We provide customized solutions.

1079
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,320
I hope you can trust us and give it a try.

1080
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,720
What do you think?

1081
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,830
I heard you called, sir.

1082
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:49,070
Come sit down.

1083
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,710
(Cheong A Group)

1084
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:56,580
I was too harsh on you yesterday.

1085
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,250
I thought about it,

1086
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,680
and I think it was a great move...

1087
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,950
to invite Yoon Chul to join the Cheonsoo District project.

1088
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,550
Thank you for thinking of it that way.

1089
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:07,690
Is Jenny doing okay with getting ready for college?

1090
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,160
Do you need anything?

1091
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:10,860
No, it's okay.

1092
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,990
You've already given us a great house,

1093
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:15,030
and you helped my wife with her work.

1094
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:17,900
I have no idea how I'm going to pay you back.

1095
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,470
These days, I spend most of my time doing things for Jenny...

1096
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,900
to make up for the time while I was gone.

1097
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,340
Jenny doesn't know...

1098
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,580
that you went to jail...

1099
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,250
for murder, right?

1100
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:36,880
Of course not. I'll keep my lips sealed forever.

1101
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:40,390
Good. I'll do the same.

1102
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:42,660
You and I go way back.

1103
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,390
Our kids will all get accepted to Seoul University of Music.

1104
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,430
So let's throw a big party once they finish their exams.

1105
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:48,930
I'd be honored.

1106
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,800
You really are a generous man.

1107
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,740
I admire you, sir.

1108
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,700
Okay, you may go now.

1109
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,580
I'm impressed.

1110
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,350
How was that?

1111
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:14,620
Do you believe me now?

1112
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,720
I have Jenny's father...

1113
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:19,530
in the palm of my hand.

1114
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,900
You're right.

1115
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,330
I hated how he kept going around acting like a big shot.

1116
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,300
Now tell me why you're here.

1117
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:28,540
What is it that you want?

1118
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,810
Mom doesn't want me to go to SNU.

1119
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,810
As soon as she became the director of Cheong A Foundation,

1120
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:34,480
she forbade the principal from recommending anyone.

1121
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,610
Well, obviously.

1122
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,350
You and that woman...

1123
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:43,220
aren't related at all. She's pretty much a stranger.

1124
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,390
Why would she want you to go to SNU...

1125
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:48,020
when you were one of the kids who bullied her daughter?

1126
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,960
You're my daughter,

1127
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,290
so she'll never let you become happy.

1128
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,660
What would you do if you were in her shoes?

1129
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,170
Wouldn't you want to destroy whomever hurt your daughter?

1130
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:59,470
Don't speak ill of her.

1131
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,970
Just get rid of a disgusting loach for me.

1132
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:09,080
A loach? Whom?

1133
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,350
- Bae Ro Na. - "Ro Na"?

1134
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,520
But she's not even going to take the CSATs.

1135
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,120
She changed her mind.

1136
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,120
I bet Mom convinced her.

1137
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,430
Do everything you can to make her fail the test.

1138
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:25,830
You'll do that for me, right?

1139
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:32,400
When have I ever let you down?

1140
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,870
Don't worry. I'll deal with it for you.

1141
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,880
I really want to go to SNU.

1142
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,140
With Seok Hoon.

1143
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:47,010
Yes, of course. It's only right that you go there.

1144

(Seoul University of Music, Day of the Exam)

1145
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:00,120
(Examination Hall College of Music, Seoul University)

1146
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:12,050
Your dad is the best.

1147
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:13,750
Let's go.

1148
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,950
Who brings their dad to the performance test?

1149
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,760
Kids who are bound to fail always make a big deal of things.

1150
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,800
As soon as I retired,

1151
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,930
it felt as if my life had come to an end.

1152
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:34,540
But my husband continued...

1153
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,910
to stay by my side.

1154
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,430

I'm actually taking care of Eun Byeol at the moment.

She has no parents.

1197

What do you mean? They both got released.

1198
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:03,850
Why are you still taking care of her?

1199

I don't see why I need to explain my private life to you.

1200
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,500
We should stay away from each other. I'm sure it's uneasy for both of us.

Probably the day you turned yourself in.

1205
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:32,850
I never got to see him again after that.

It's almost time, right?

1207

I became disqualified for the test because of your daughter.

1315
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,220
I don't care what anyone thinks now.

1316
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,350
I can't believe this is how you chose to take revenge.

1317
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,060
Fine. I'll do the exact same thing to you.

1318
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,730
I'm not going to be the only one who fails to get in.

1319
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,820
I'm going to raise an issue with this.

1320
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:01,230
You're the one who cheated,

1321
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:02,930
so you deserve to get disqualified too!

1322
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,560
Stop taking it out on her...

1323
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:06,040
just because you failed your test.

1324
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,610
Stop crying and tell me what really happened.

1325
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,240
While I was taking my test,

1326
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:15,850
your cell phone suddenly rang inside my pocket.

1327
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,520
You put it in there on purpose, didn't you?

1328
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:20,750
You witch.

1329
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,020
You darn witch!

1330
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,220
That's enough, Eun Byeol.

1331
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:35,500
Don't get nervous. You can do this.

1332
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,070
You even took your medicine.

Ha Eun Byeol, disqualified!

1337
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,370
Where did Seok Hoon go?

1338
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,600
Did he even take the test?

1339
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:19,870
- The receiver cannot be reached. - I don't know.

1340
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,100
- You will be directed to voicemail. - Why won't he answer his phone?

1341
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,210
Please leave a message after...

1342
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,320
What are you doing here?

1343
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,410
My precious kids took an important test today.

1344
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,920
So it's only natural that I'm here.

1345
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,460
Seok Kyung, did you make any mistakes?

1346
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:35,930
I think I did a pretty good job.

1347
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,700
I'll be spending time with Dad.

1348
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,100
He promised to buy me something to eat after the test.

1349
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,390
I'm sorry you have to leave alone.

1350
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,770
Your mom's down to earth, so I bet she won't care.

1351
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,110
Let's go.

1352
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:51,740
Seok Kyung.

1353
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,520
Seok Kyung will be home late.

1354
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,220
She might not even go home tonight.

1355
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,300
Hey, Mr. Hong. What's up?

1356
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,160
Baek Jun Ki just turned on his cell phone.

1357
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,730
We got his location from the application.

1358
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:18,900
Where is he?

1359
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,710
Ro Na will get disqualified...

1360
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,870
along with Eun Byeol.

1361
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,640
I knew it was you.

1362
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,750
Eun Byeol is so dumb. She's nothing without her mom.

1363
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:32,150
By the way, whom did you ask to do this for you?

1364
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,120
That's a secret.

1365
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,250
Jenny seems to have failed the test too.

1366
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,590
That means I might be the only one who gets in.

1367
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,230
Not everyone gets into SNU.

1368
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,030
But you'll get accepted because you're my daughter.

1369
01:22:56,310 --> 01:23:00,340
Do you know why your mother's so nice to you guys?

1370
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,880
Why?

1371
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:06,480
She wants to become your sole guardian...

1372
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,750
so she can take the inheritance of your biological mother.

1373
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,920
She's not that kind of person.

1374
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:18,160
I'm sorry.

1375
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,200
But it's true.

1376
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,800
She's related to...

1377
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:24,940
the death of your biological mother.

1378
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,700
Really?

1379
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,370
Did Logan really kill our biological mom?

1380
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,540
Because of Mom?

1381
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:50,820
- Excuse the mess, everyone. - Sorry for the mess.

1382
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,160
We're sorry.

1383
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,600
You're Baek Jun Ki, aren't you?

1384
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:03,770
Let me go. I'm going to kill him.

1385
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:06,640
Baek Jun Ki, who are you really?

1386
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:08,450
My daughter's there.

1387
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,750
I can't let her watch her own father die right before her eyes.

- There you are. - You said you'll kill Joo Dan Tae.

1390
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,930
My heart still beats like crazy every time I see you.

1391
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:04,470
Did you really kill someone?

1392
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:07,500
A million times more! I'm a father.

1393
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,130
Joo Dan Tae's dog. It really suits you.

1394
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,010
You don't need to worry about my family or house.

1395
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:13,980
A billion dollars?

1396
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,710
Logan's money suddenly disappeared.

1397
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,140
How would I know about that money?

1398
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:18,870
Oh Yoon Hee took a billion dollars?

1399
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,640
- Mr. Baek. - Logan?

1400
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,810
It seemed like he cared for you a lot.

1401
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:23,890
Do you like it?
