1
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,340
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,576
I'm so moved!

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,540
Education will be used in their ploy
to make money on real estate.

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,020
Dohae Construction
won the Cheonsoo contract.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,448
Arrange a meeting with Dohae's CEO.

6
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:27,103
Give me the construction rights.

7
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:28,092
I won't.

8
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:31,523
I swear I will step on Ha Eun Byeol
and become the best.

9
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:34,509
I'll be a prima Donna
for Clark's performance?

10
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,057
If you trust my ears,

11
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,938
please give her one more chance.

12
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:40,129
Who are you?

13
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:42,090
What's your relationship with Logan?

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,020
Just keep him alive.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,123
Logan's body's value
changes drastically...

16
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:47,529
based on whether or not he's alive.

17
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:50,701
You are the only person
our family can trust.

18
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,601
This belongs to Ms. Oh Yoon Hee, right?

19
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,029
The watch was able to record sounds.

20
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:55,828
Seok Kyung is your biological daughter.

21
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:59,150
Seok Kyung is Seol A's twin sister.

22
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,859
Seok Kyung is my daughter?

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,947
=Episode 8=

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,919
Seok Hoon!

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,629
When did you last hear from Seok Kyung?

26
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:23,451
She said
she arrived safely yesterday. Why?

27
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,666
Do you know the name of the school
in Italy? Where is it?

28
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,314
Did she say anything else to you?

29
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:30,368
Can you reach any of her friends?
She tells you everything.

30
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:32,564
Calm down and tell me what's going on.

31
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:34,706
Did something happen to Seok Kyung?

32
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:39,761
I had twins in the US.

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,241
I gave birth prematurely from shock,

34
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:45,272
and I was told one twin died
right after birth. But apparently,

35
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,618
she is alive.

36
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:52,811
What do you mean?

37
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:54,641
Seol A's twin sister is...

38
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:58,240
Seok Kyung.

39
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:00,178
What?

40
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:06,521
Seok Kyung and Seol A are twins?

41
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:10,470
Do you mean Seok Kyung and I
are not biological siblings?

42
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:14,199
He switched Seol A with Hye In
right after birth,

43
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,439
so I couldn't meet her all my life.

44
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,629
And he lied to me that
Seok Kyung was stillborn...

45
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,377
and raised her himself.

46
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:24,442
It's your father's doing.
He's behind all this.

47
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:26,996
Why would he do that? For what?

48
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:30,634
He must have wanted to torment me.

49
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:34,846
He told Seok Kyung that
I wasn't her biological mother...

50
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:37,663
to turn her against me.

51
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:40,277
Now, he'll use the fact that
she's my daughter...

52
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:41,768
to blackmail me.

53
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,221
Then why did he send Seok Kyung abroad
to study?

54
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:48,883
I don't know.

55
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:51,550
I'm afraid that's not what happened.

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,108
I have a bad feeling.

57
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:55,325
That can't be right.

58
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:57,737
She even sent me some pictures yesterday.

59
00:02:57,817 --> 00:03:01,093
Pictures of her at the airport
and on campus.

60
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:08,537
This is fake. It's been manipulated.
Look here.

61
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:10,147
You don't see her shadow.

62
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:18,051
Then...

63
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,195
what do you think happened to Seok Kyung?

64
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,261
Who are you guys?

65
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:36,126
Am I in Italy?

66
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:38,219
What is this girl saying? Italy?

67
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,569
-Italy?
-What?

68
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,421
What are you guys doing?

69
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,984
Bring the person in charge.

70
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,712
What a bunch of lowlifes.

71
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,649
Did you guys kidnap me or something?

72
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,513
Do you know who my dad is?

73
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,838
Is something wrong with your tongue?

74
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:53,061
What's with the way you talk?

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,042
(A clean body, a pure soul)

76
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:06,963
Don't come any closer.

77
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:13,129
Lay a finger on me,
and I'll kill you all.

78
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:15,624
Don't come any closer.

79
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:17,897
Stay away from me!

80
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,884
Stay away!

81
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,766
(Motto: Kindness, truth,
action, and patience)

82
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:37,784
Logan, can you hear me?

83
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,543
Move your fingers if you can hear me.

84
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:43,258
I'm Ha Yoon Chul. You can trust me.

85
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:58,663
Can you bring Su Ryeon to me?

86
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:05,064
Logan, are you okay? Can you hear me?

87
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,497
Yes.

88
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:13,988
Su Ryeon...

89
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,440
How is she?

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,550
Don't worry. She's safe.

91
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,019
How long...

92
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,987
has it been?

93
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,732
It's been seven months since the accident.

94
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:32,805
Do you know who did this to you?

95
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:34,930
Joo Dan Tae.

96
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,737
It's his doing.

97
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,866
I saw him clearly at the scene.

98
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,681
I knew it was his doing.

99
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:54,061
Please get me out of here right now.

100
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:57,542
Su Ryeon may be in danger.

101
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,385
I need to call my brother, Alex.

102
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:03,535
I need to call him...

103
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:07,039
and let him know I'm alive.

104
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,109
What happened? Did he wake up?

105
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,071
I think I just saw him move.

106
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,218
Don't tell me he's conscious.

107
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:31,645
He must be experiencing delirium.

108
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,453
He's talking nonsense,
and his condition is bad.

109
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,414
He might not get through the night.

110
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:37,808
Are you saying he might die?

111
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:45,019
You're dead if you're lying.

112
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:49,189
I don't care about him enough
to give up my life for him!

113
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:50,751
We don't have much time.

114
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:53,806
I don't think
he'll make it through the night.

115
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:02,516
Then we can't wait any longer.

116
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:05,773
It's time to make my move.

117
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,650
Mom.

118
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,845
How is it there?

119
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:28,047
There's no one harassing you...

120
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:30,582
and hating on you, right?

121
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,586
You're at peace, right?

122
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:39,215
I'm happy if you're happy.

123
00:07:58,112 --> 00:07:59,653
I miss you...

124
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:01,894
so very much.

125
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:19,691
The one pulling the strings
behind Dohae Construction...

126
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,274
was Su Ryeon.

127
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:25,476
Su Ryeon was the lobbyist?

128
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:26,734
How is that possible?

129
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:29,433
They called her "Madam Na,"
so I thought she was a bar madam.

130
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:32,460
Who could've imagined
Su Ryeon would do that?

131
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:35,844
She has done much worse.

132
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:37,722
Why couldn't you imagine it?

133
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:40,170
Who else would mess with us like that?

134
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,877
What's the point
in arguing about that now?

135
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:46,292
We need to get the development rights
to Cheonsoo District.

136
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:48,279
Cheong A Constructions
is about to go bankrupt otherwise.

137
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:50,589
You moron. Why did you do something
to make it go bankrupt?

138
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,933
Why is it always my fault
if things go wrong?

139
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,862
You have no right to get angry.

140
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,352
Darn it.

141
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:00,444
Hold on.

142
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,301
Madam Na?

143
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,919
Do you know the bar...

144
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:09,958
where Su Ryeon used to work?

145
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:13,111
There's no record of her
leaving the country?

146
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,169
Are you sure?

147
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:19,950
Okay. I'll be in touch.

148
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,507
There's no record of her leaving?

149
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,816
Then where is she?

150
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:27,991
I think he took her somewhere else.

151
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:31,095
Somewhere where he can control her.

152
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:34,040
Forget this. I need to go and ask.

153
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,110
No.

154
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,157
You'll put her in danger
if you say something.

155
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:40,493
If Seok Kyung really is my daughter,

156
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,452
there's nothing Dan Tae won't do.

157
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,354
He will not go easy on her.

158
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,371
What if... Like Seol A...

159
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,928
I promise I'll find her.

160
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,576
I'll do whatever it takes.

161
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:55,498
Father trusts me right now.

162
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:58,734
I'll go to work tomorrow
and locate Seok Kyung.

163
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:00,626
I'm sure I'll find a lead
if I tail Secretary Cho.

164
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:03,312
Seok Hoon. I'm scared.

165
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:07,640
Seok Kyung is my sister.

166
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,274
I will protect my sister.

167
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:43,117
Give it up.

168
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:45,126
They have to open it from the outside.

169
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:47,740
What?

170
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,423
There were too many girls like you
who tried to run away.

171
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:53,535
I have to get out of here. And I will.

172
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,755
My mom will find me soon.

173
00:10:56,835 --> 00:10:58,898
My big brother will make you all pay.

174
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:00,413
You're all dead.

175
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,920
What garbage.

176
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,540
This place is for orphans.

177
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,080
Orphans who were dumped by our parents.

178
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:08,915
Just like you.

179
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:11,900
An orphan? Why am I an orphan?

180
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,343
No one looks for us, and even if they do,
they can't find us.

181
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,401
This place isn't on any map.

182
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:19,862
-Quiet.
-Seriously.

183
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:22,581
-Pipe down.
-Enough already.

184
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,361
-Let's get some sleep.
-What's her problem?

185
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:29,229
Let me out.

186
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,124
Let me out!

187
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,811
Let me out, you jerks!

188
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:37,113
-What's wrong with you?
-Stop it.

189
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:38,463
Quiet.

190
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:43,115
-Stop it.
-Quiet.

191
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:44,696
Let's get some sleep.

192
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:46,840
Stop it!

193
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,396
-What's wrong with you?
-Darn it.

194
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,731
Cut it out.

195
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,054
You're not the only one here.

196
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:55,234
Think about other people.

197
00:11:57,715 --> 00:11:59,709
Keep it down.

198
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,149
Hello.

199
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:19,492
Why are you here so late?
Pick up the pace.

200
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,555
It's only 6:00 AM, okay?

201
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,523
I didn't get up this early
even when I was a high school senior.

202
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:26,208
Keep talking back to me,
and I'll break your teeth.

203
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:28,736
Report.

204
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,103
Yoo Jenny's recent activities.

205
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,722
She's studying hard.
She has tteokbokki and chicken once a day.

206
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:34,148
She studies at night
in the community room.

207
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,261
She's mad busy preparing
for the Cheong A Arts Center audition.

208
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:39,510
Also, I took this picture.

209
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,665
My gosh. My daughter.

210
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:45,416
She got prettier.

211
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:48,996
Is she still getting along with Ro Na?

212
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:50,112
Don't they ever fight?

213
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:52,368
They're besties. They even live together.

214
00:12:58,252 --> 00:12:59,940
Give this to her.

215
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,703
Tell her you got them for her
to wear to her audition.

216
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,661
Tell her I got them for her again?

217
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,459
She won't accept them then.

218
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,069
She doesn't like me.

219
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:10,388
You know what I did to her.

220
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:13,081
You should give them to her.

221
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:15,064
I don't know what you did wrong,

222
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:16,589
but I'm sure
it's not as bad as what I did.

223
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:17,789
Pick them up now.

224
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:23,763
If Jenny isn't wearing these
at her audition, you're dead.

225
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:24,892
Yes, sir.

226
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,537
Take a picture of her wearing them
and show it to me.

227
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,719
Keep your mouth shut. Got that?

228
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:33,308
You may go.

229
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:37,224
Why did you make me come here
so early in the morning?

230
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:38,480
What is it this time?

231
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:41,392
I have a gift.

232
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:45,165
I got them for you
to wear to your audition.

233
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:46,435
Whatever.

234
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,947
These are the newest design
from my favourite brand.

235
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:53,560
They're so pretty.

236
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,066
Is that what you expected?

237
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:00,402
I don't want them. Return them.

238
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:03,226
Wait. No. You have to wear them.

239
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,551
I may die if you don't.

240
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:07,540
What do you mean?

241
00:14:08,492 --> 00:14:10,163
Well, so...

242
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,773
I may die of a broken heart.

243
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,527
Did you decide to become my stalker?

244
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,680
Why are you following me around
and being weird?

245
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,533
Who cares if I'm being weird?

246
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:24,194
Just be cool about it and take them.
Please.

247
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:28,356
-I'll just try them on.
-Okay.

248
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,157
Hey.

249
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:39,473
They're prettier than I expected.

250
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,584
Mission complete.

251
00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:51,135
Who are you sending that to?

252
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:53,528
No. Wait!

253
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,971
-Hand it over.
-No.

254
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:58,491
Well...

255
00:14:58,571 --> 00:14:59,545
So...

256
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,231
So that's what it was.

257
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:05,914
My dad made you do it.

258
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:11,893
Mr. Chairman.

259
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:13,426
There's a problem
among the subcontractors...

260
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:16,024
regarding the contractor selection matter.

261
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:17,954
You should meet with them...

262
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,066
Must I worry about things like that too?

263
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:23,821
I made you
the CEO of Cheong A Construction!

264
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:26,632
You should take care of it
so these things don't happen!

265
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:27,943
I'm sorry, sir.

266
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:33,161
Have a nice day.

267
00:15:43,037 --> 00:15:44,163
Jenny.

268
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,587
Were you buying me this garbage...

269
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,268
with money you made from bowing to
and getting kicked by that rat?

270
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,733
I don't need this garbage.

271
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,629
And I don't need you.

272
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:58,810
Don't make Min Hyuk do that anymore.

273
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:02,326
Jenny. That's not it. Jenny.

274
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,170
Jenny!

275
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:05,741
Jenny...

276
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,834
I'm doing this for you.

277
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,665
Can you come to the airport?

278
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:23,486
I haven't seen you in so long.

279
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:25,669
And I won't be seeing you for a while.

280
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,805
Why do you need me
when you'll do whatever you want?

281
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,594
Don't call me whether you live or die.

282
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:31,851
I can pretend I don't have a sister.

283
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,042
Bye.

284
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,615
Why didn't I notice? I'm such an idiot.

285
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:43,163
Hang in there for a while.

286
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:45,342
I will find you.

287
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,474
I came to keep my promise.

288
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:57,125
I'll do as you said and learn the ropes.

289
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:05,071
I wonder why my son suddenly decided
to be obedient.

290
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:09,183
Because I'm sick of being good.

291
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,546
Now I want to be Joo Dan Tae's son.

292
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,146
If I inherited the devil's blood,
I must act as such.

You said they're both mine.

00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:23,805
I want to learn how to do business,

296
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,179
Dad.

297
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,076
I must protect what is mine.

298
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,902
You truly are my son.

299
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,858
Now, all I have is yours.

300
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:02,261
Because you are my son I'm proud of.

301
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:04,301
Don't get any silly ideas...

302
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,374
and focus only on climbing higher.

303
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:07,667
I should.

304
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,659
Why did you suddenly
send Seok Kyung abroad?

305
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,601
That's because it's what she wanted.

306
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:19,098
You know I do anything she wishes.

307

Can I give you a hug?
It's been a long time.

00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:46,452
Seok Kyung, is something wrong?

310
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:48,442
I can't reach you.

311
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:49,939
Call me when you can.

312
00:18:57,865 --> 00:19:00,561
I have too many lectures.
I'll call another time.

to visit the subsidiaries' CEOs.

00:19:34,324 --> 00:19:36,308
Okay. We'll leave right now.

316

Wait.

317
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:44,088
I think I left my phone upstairs.

318
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:46,190
Get it from my dad's office.

319
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,911
I'll have his secretary bring it.

320
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,104
Get it yourself.

321
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,395
I gave you the order.

Are you displeased that
I'm giving you orders?

323

Not at all. I'll be right back.

00:31:50,853 --> 00:31:53,272
What shortcuts are you referring to?

495
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:58,965
("Libiamo ne' lieti calici")

496
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:04,645
("Libiamo ne' lieti calici")

497
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:07,365
Even before the audition started,

498
00:32:07,445 --> 00:32:10,185
you were warming up
to "Libiamo ne' lieti calici."

499
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:12,555
If this isn't a shortcut, what is?

500
00:32:12,635 --> 00:32:15,115
Your mom told you beforehand!

501
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,936
You're the one who should be disqualified,
not us.

502
00:32:19,016 --> 00:32:20,403
Every person here...

503
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:24,005
has lost the chance to win because of you.

504
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:28,595
Is there any reason for us
to audition fair and square?

505
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,216
What do you think, Ha Eun Byeol?

506
00:32:33,945 --> 00:32:35,632
Don't feel too sorry for yourself.

507
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:39,224
It's something you've always done.

508
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:47,495
(First prize)

509
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:53,160
(Cheong A Arts Center Artist
in Residence Audition)

510
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:14,330
Smile, ma'am.

511
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:17,944
They can clearly see that
you don't want to give this to me.

512
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,565
Look here!

513
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,579
Congratulations, Ro Na!

514
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,432
Over here!

515
00:33:55,394 --> 00:33:58,559
Bae Ro Na, how dare you mock me?

516
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,866
Thank you for being a judge today.

517
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:03,121
No worries at all. It's been fun.

518
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:05,938
These kids were so good...

519
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:10,031
that I am now considering retiring.

520
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,176
Thank you.

521
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:16,791
The audition went smoothly thanks to you.

522
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:18,913
I didn't need to do much...

523
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:20,781
because she was exceptional.

524
00:34:21,403 --> 00:34:24,628
The most important thing
is to set fair standards.

525
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:29,133
I have no doubt Bae Ro Na
will be a world-class prima Donna.

526
00:34:29,655 --> 00:34:32,064
She totally changed the audition's vibe.

527
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:36,228
I had a great time thanks to you.

528
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:38,933
I hope to see you again next time
under even better circumstances.

529
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,628
You have to accept my invitation
next time as well, promise?

530
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,128
Of course. It's you.

531
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:50,879
I see. Call me as soon as you locate him.

532
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,195
I'll be waiting.

533
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,863
I see you're almost considering
adopting Ro Na.

534
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:56,279
Instead of Min Seol A.

535
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:01,378
You were the one who invited Clark,
Shim Su Ryeon?

536
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:04,024
Did you also sign Ro Na
up for this audition?

537
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:06,167
That's quite low...

538
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,083
for Shim Su Ryeon.

539
00:35:10,055 --> 00:35:11,812
What are you accusing me of?

540
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:13,562
It was the kids' self-defence...

541
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:15,777
to protect the very basic idea
of fairness.

542
00:35:15,857 --> 00:35:17,010
Lies.

543
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,238
You think I don't know
you were behind all this?

544
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:21,690
How much longer do you think
this will last?

545
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:23,968
Right back at you.

546
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,566
You're really going crazy trying
to regain the Cheong A Foundation.

547
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:31,578
You were the one
who shook the board, weren't you?

548
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:34,101
It's true that you worked as a madam
at a bar.

549
00:35:34,181 --> 00:35:35,947
I only revealed the truth.

550
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:39,959
Truth.

551
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,687
You love that, don't you?

552
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:44,478
Madam Na, right?

553
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,158
You even deleted all the CCTV footage.

554
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:49,431
That's very meticulous.

555
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:52,046
I learned it from you.

556
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:53,436
Destruction of evidence.

557
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:58,798
You must want Cheong A Foundation back,
but it's not going to be easy.

558
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:03,002
I'm not planning on giving it back to you.

559
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:07,359
If only you had left the foundation alone,

560
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:10,090
we wouldn't have ended up here.

561
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:13,164
You don't have the right.

562
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:15,933
You're still cooking up secret plans.

563
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:17,791
You shouldn't get involved in education.

564
00:36:19,184 --> 00:36:22,174
You don't even own any shares.
Who are you to say that?

565
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:25,842
Are you counting on your dead ex's shares?

566
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,187
This doesn't concern your kids.
Stay out of it.

567
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:32,866
I'll make sure...

568
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,447
you regret what happened today,
Shim Su Ryeon.

569
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:49,072
Let's toast.

570
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:51,498
To Ro Na.

571
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:52,568
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

572
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:53,703
Thank you.

573
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,270
Look how shiny the trophy is.

574
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:02,021
Are you expecting a call?
You've been staring at your phone.

575
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,137
It's nothing.

576
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:06,556
You should've seen
Ms. Cheon's face earlier.

577
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:08,435
So what if she disagrees?

578
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:10,694
Ro Na was by far the best.

579
00:37:10,774 --> 00:37:13,963
The reporters
were all over her afterwards.

580
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,255
Great job, Ro Na.
Your mom must be so proud.

581
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,761
This is just the beginning.

582
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,980
I'll make sure my skills are recognized.

583
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,759
You're one ambitious girl.

584
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:25,266
Your high notes in the finale
gave me goosebumps.

585
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:27,311
You were just as good.

586
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:28,451
Are you sure?

587
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,496
Are more people coming?

588
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,133
Should we try this?

589
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:39,572
-Surprise!
-Here comes excellent champagne.

590
00:37:39,652 --> 00:37:41,990
What brings you here? You're not invited.

591
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,611
We all worked hard.

592
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:46,335
How could you leave us out? I'm hurt.

593
00:37:46,415 --> 00:37:47,335
Welcome.

594
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:50,049
Jenny, I was holding my breath earlier.

595
00:37:50,129 --> 00:37:51,980
You were just as good as Eun Byeol.

596
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,386
It really was the best part
of the audition.

597
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,277
-I was always that good.
-I know that.

598
00:37:57,357 --> 00:37:59,383
Why did you bring flowers?
It's old-fashioned.

599
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:04,555
Su Ryeon, these skincare products
are amazing.

600
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:08,192
I thought they'd be perfect for you,
so I brought them for you.

601
00:38:08,272 --> 00:38:09,977
-Thank you.
-Oh, my.

602
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:13,236
It has red ginseng in it? What about me?

603
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:15,594
There's some for you too, of course.

604
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:18,256
-Where?
-At my place.

605
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:20,573
Forget it. Get out of here.

606
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:24,217
I prepared a gift for you too, I promise.

607
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:26,425
Please let me stay.

608
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,164
-I'll go get it later.
-It smells so nice.

609
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:30,432
-Please let me stay.
-Hold on.

610
00:38:30,512 --> 00:38:32,685
-Let's see here.
-Come on.

611
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:35,903
It feels so nice.

612
00:38:37,027 --> 00:38:39,222
Su Ryeon, thank you for this.

613
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:41,311
Please let me stay.

614
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:42,925
I want to celebrate with you.

615
00:38:43,828 --> 00:38:45,528
This erases memories?

616
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:50,104
Eun Byeol must know something
about my mom's accident.

617
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:52,911
That's why she's taking this.

618
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:54,280
I think so too.

619
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:57,814
But I heard the side effects of that drug
were so severe...

620
00:38:57,894 --> 00:38:59,739
that the clinical trials were put on hold.

621
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:02,001
It can cause early onset dementia.

622
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:05,716
Ms. Jin seemed
to really care about Eun Byeol.

623
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:09,668
How could she give a drug like this
to Eun Byeol?

624
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,682
She tried to kidnap Eun Byeol.

625
00:39:11,762 --> 00:39:13,185
She's obsessive.

626
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,994
You shouldn't trust her.

627
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:26,272
Hi, Seok Hoon.

628
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:34,068
Bae Ro Na. Did you really have to do that?

629
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:38,718
You mean witch!

630
00:39:45,231 --> 00:39:46,588
(From Bae Ro Na)

631
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:47,823
Meet me in the community room.

632
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:50,093
(From Bae Ro Na:
Meet me in the community room.)

633
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:59,586
You want to show off some more?
Is that why you called me here?

634
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:08,236
Does your mom know
that you're taking this drug?

635
00:40:13,313 --> 00:40:14,932
Why do you have that?

636
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:19,117
It's just a tranquillizer
I've been taking for a long time.

637
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:21,143
I only take it when I'm extremely nervous.

638
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,860
Is that what Ms. Jin told you?

639
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:26,158
Did you believe her, you fool?

640
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,639
When you said you didn't remember anything
about my mom's death,

641
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,347
I thought you were lying.

642
00:40:33,084 --> 00:40:36,983
But now I know that
you really had no memory of it.

643
00:40:38,844 --> 00:40:41,938
This drug erases your memories.

644
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:45,377
Taken long-term,
it can cause early onset dementia.

645
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:47,395
That's ridiculous.

646
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,073
Why would Ms. Jin
give me such an awful drug?

647
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,755
Are you losing your mind
after your mom's death?

648
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:02,310
Don't bother me like this again.

649
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,518
Wake up, Eun Byeol.

650
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,700
You shouldn't take this drug.

651
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,953
Eun Byeol!

652
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:23,215
Mr. Ha, it's me, Ro Na.

653
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:28,033
I have something to tell you.
Do you have a minute?

654
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:32,949
Oh, no. It's getting late.

655
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:35,368
I should go and cook for Kyu Jin.

656
00:41:35,697 --> 00:41:39,354
He's been insisting
that we have grilled eel today.

657
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:40,474
See you.

658
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,257
Why would you...

659
00:41:42,742 --> 00:41:45,183
cook for that jerk day in day out?

660
00:41:45,263 --> 00:41:48,190
He can prepare a meal himself.

661
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:51,521
My cutie can't do that.

662
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:54,621
He can't even pour a glass of water
for himself.

663
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:56,393
Don't get shocked.

664
00:41:56,878 --> 00:42:00,423
You said your cutie can't even pour
a glass of water for himself.

665
00:42:00,503 --> 00:42:04,077
Here's what he does when he goes out.

666
00:42:05,097 --> 00:42:06,130
Watch this.

667
00:42:10,894 --> 00:42:13,287
This is what the Hera Club guys do
when they go out.

668
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:16,002
This is who Lee Kyu Jin really is.

669
00:42:16,082 --> 00:42:19,459
Do you really want
to be at his beck and call...

670
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:22,363
for the rest of your life?

671
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:24,500
When he does this behind your back?

672
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:30,168
What happened to my dear Kyu Jin?

673
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:33,435
(Sisters Retreat Center)

674
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:38,145
(Sisters Retreat Center)

675
00:42:38,226 --> 00:42:41,670
Do they expect me to eat this?

676
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:44,641
How can I possibly eat this?

677
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,149
I'm not some pig.

678
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:48,792
Do you need more beatings?

679
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:52,191
Cut it out and eat what you're given.

680
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:57,202
You can stuff your face all you want.

681
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,325
Have you lost your mind?

682
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:12,556
-Are you crazy?
-Let go!

683
00:43:22,658 --> 00:43:24,034
She's a total psycho.

684
00:43:24,114 --> 00:43:25,565
It hurts!

685
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,355
What are you doing?

686
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:31,738
Take her away.

687
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,341
Stand up. Come.

688
00:43:36,377 --> 00:43:38,258
Who started it?

689
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:39,450
Answer!

690
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:43,530
Come here.

691
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:45,667
Come on.

692
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:50,489
Hey, what are you doing?

693
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:53,167
Hey!

694
00:43:53,247 --> 00:43:54,360
Get her!

695
00:43:58,083 --> 00:43:59,478
Stop there!

696
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,232
Stop! Come here!

697
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:07,826
Darn it.

698
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,642
Stop there!

699
00:44:35,095 --> 00:44:37,240
Where did she go? Find her!

700
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:39,852
You morons. What are you waiting for?

701
00:45:05,234 --> 00:45:06,280
Seok Kyung.

702
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,488
Dad.

703
00:45:14,395 --> 00:45:16,345
(No GPS signal)

704
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,475
Seok Hoon. Which way is it?

705
00:45:28,555 --> 00:45:30,415
This road leads to a retreat center.

706
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,941
It's a dead end. So she must be there.

707
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,034
Let's go, Mom.

708
00:45:34,387 --> 00:45:36,183
You stay here. I'll go check.

709
00:45:36,263 --> 00:45:37,714
It's dangerous if you go alone.

710
00:45:37,794 --> 00:45:39,171
I'm not alone.

711
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:42,784
It'll be dangerous for you
if Dan Tae sees you now.

712
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:45,018
He'll even question
why you're at the company.

713
00:45:45,098 --> 00:45:46,503
Wait here.

714
00:46:29,975 --> 00:46:32,019
Why are you doing this to me?

715
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,861
I betrayed Mom and left home to help you.

716
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:37,202
So why did you lock me up here?

717
00:46:37,282 --> 00:46:38,706
Let me out right now.

718
00:46:39,322 --> 00:46:41,720
I did everything you asked, so why?

719
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,728
You're so loud. Shut your mouth already.

720
00:46:44,808 --> 00:46:46,360
Tell me.

721
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:49,205
Why am I here instead of in Italy?

722
00:46:49,285 --> 00:46:51,865
Do you want to know why you're here?

723
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,556
Seok Kyung.

724
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:55,526
You're a fake.

725
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:59,196
You have that rat's dirty blood
flowing in your veins.

726
00:46:59,276 --> 00:47:02,701
You should've realized
when I gave the penthouse...

727
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:05,717
and Cheonsoo District only to Seok Hoon.

728
00:47:06,136 --> 00:47:08,670
It meant you were not my daughter.

729
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:10,530
Are you that stupid?

730
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:14,554
What... What are you talking about?

731
00:47:15,038 --> 00:47:16,533
You're making no sense.

732
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:19,998
Bring Seok Hoon here.

733
00:47:20,078 --> 00:47:22,009
He won't let you get away with this.

734
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,664
Don't say my son's name
with that lunatic mouth.

735
00:47:25,744 --> 00:47:27,516
You and Seok Hoon have different roots.

736
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:31,524
You have the same dirty,
lowly blood as Seol A.

737
00:47:32,129 --> 00:47:33,637
You're Seol A's twin sister.

738
00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:36,404
Seol A's...

739
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,224
twin?

740
00:47:38,742 --> 00:47:39,818
Me?

741
00:47:40,412 --> 00:47:43,339
I took you in and fed you,
clothed you, and let you enjoy...

742
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:45,167
the best life living in the penthouse.

743
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:46,782
You have nothing to complain about.

744
00:47:46,862 --> 00:47:48,420
Stop lying to me!

745
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:50,182
No.

746
00:47:50,646 --> 00:47:53,296
Why are you doing this to me, Dad?

747
00:47:53,376 --> 00:47:55,374
You have nowhere to go anymore.

748
00:47:55,454 --> 00:47:58,383
You're the one who took my hand
and stabbed Su Ryeon in the back.

749
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,758
You didn't even realize she was your mom.

750
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:04,825
You wouldn't have raised me
if I were someone else's child.

751
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:07,280
Why would you raise Seol A's sister?

752
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,586
Thanks to you,
your mom suffered immense pain.

753
00:48:12,128 --> 00:48:14,861
You've served your purpose.

754
00:48:15,276 --> 00:48:18,312
Seriously.
Had I known you were this big an idiot,

755
00:48:18,392 --> 00:48:20,116
I would've brought Seol A.

756
00:48:21,146 --> 00:48:23,656
Okay, then. Earn your keep...

757
00:48:24,172 --> 00:48:26,622
one last time before you die.

758
00:48:27,352 --> 00:48:29,961
Tearfully beg your mom to save you.

759
00:48:30,448 --> 00:48:32,364
To do everything you ask.

760
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:33,974
You can do that much, right?

761
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:37,435
(Shim Su Ryeon)

762
00:48:41,157 --> 00:48:42,443
Hello?

763
00:48:42,523 --> 00:48:45,312
Make Dohae Construction
forfeit the development rights.

764
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:47,038
Then everything will be beautiful.

765
00:48:47,463 --> 00:48:48,884
Why should I do that?

766
00:48:48,964 --> 00:48:51,471
That's the only way
your daughter will live.

767
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:54,076
Seok Kyung didn't go to Italy.

768
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:56,003
I hid her somewhere.

769
00:48:56,753 --> 00:48:59,199
Do you not care if you never see
your biological child ever again?

770
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:00,463
Where's Seok Kyung?

771
00:49:00,543 --> 00:49:03,023
If you hurt her in any way, I'll kill you.

772
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:05,629
Don't get so worked up.

773
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:07,999
Talk to your daughter.

774
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:10,735
I think your daughter
has something to say.

775
00:49:15,728 --> 00:49:16,947
Mom.

776
00:49:17,027 --> 00:49:19,696
Seok Kyung. Is that you?

777
00:49:19,776 --> 00:49:21,020
Where are you?

778
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:23,234
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

779
00:49:27,685 --> 00:49:28,864
Tell her.

780
00:49:29,464 --> 00:49:31,619
You wanted to talk to your mom.

781
00:49:33,878 --> 00:49:37,254
Tell her
to hand over the development rights.

782
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:40,327
Tell her
it's her daughter's desperate plea.

783
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:43,808
Seok Kyung. I'm coming.
I'll be right there.

784
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:45,530
Hang in there, okay?

785
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:50,114
You heard what Dad wants.

786
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:55,463
Don't do any of it.

787
00:49:55,543 --> 00:49:57,690
Don't do it because of me!

788
00:50:01,547 --> 00:50:02,568
You crazy little...

789
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:05,427
Seok Kyung.

790
00:50:07,419 --> 00:50:09,746
You little freak.

791
00:50:12,571 --> 00:50:13,921
Open the door first!

792
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:15,521
Hello?

793
00:50:15,997 --> 00:50:17,186
Hello?

794
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:23,874
Stop.

795
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:26,745
(Sisters Retreat Center)

796
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,983
Send Seok Kyung somewhere else tomorrow.

797
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,706
Get rid of her.

798
00:50:34,218 --> 00:50:35,580
Yes, sir.

799
00:50:36,395 --> 00:50:40,395
(Help)

800
00:50:43,195 --> 00:50:44,247
I'm...

801
00:50:46,065 --> 00:50:47,888
Mom's real daughter?

802
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:51,587
Seol A was my sister?

803
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,895
That's absurd.

804
00:50:57,285 --> 00:50:59,901
No. That can't be.

805
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:04,395
Why don't you try to be honest for once?

806
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:06,119
Ro Na's mom is dead.

807
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,464
Aren't you secretly pleased about it?

808
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:13,341
That woman was punished
for killing your daughter.

809
00:51:14,258 --> 00:51:18,549
Please stop pretending to be good
and show how you really feel.

810
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:21,797
I won't care anymore...

811
00:51:21,877 --> 00:51:24,931
how you live your life
or what you do with your dad.

812
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:27,478
You're no longer my daughter.

813
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:29,776
Now you're showing your true colours.

814
00:51:29,856 --> 00:51:33,466
It's not like
you treated me like a daughter!

815
00:51:35,661 --> 00:51:37,819
I taught them as much as you paid me,

816
00:51:37,899 --> 00:51:39,754
Seok Kyung was the one who was deceitful.

817
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:42,150
She even humiliated me
and claimed I was a thief.

818
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,932
-Shut your mouth.
-Seok Kyung.

819
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:47,679
How did you come in first place
in the test then?

820
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:50,175
I passed fair and square with my talent.

821
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:51,932
Is that wrong?

822
00:51:52,347 --> 00:51:55,466
Maybe you approached us on purpose
to steal information.

823
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:59,030
There's no information
I can take from you anyway.

824
00:52:00,313 --> 00:52:02,292
-Seok Kyung.
-That was...

825
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,503
What are you doing?

826
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:07,152
That's my warning
telling you to know your place.

827
00:52:07,232 --> 00:52:08,908
Why? Are you angry?

828
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,258
You idiot. I think the car is on fire.

829
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,905
Let's get out of here.
What if the car explodes?

830
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:18,229
Don't go!

831
00:52:18,707 --> 00:52:20,159
Let me out!

832
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:30,163
No. No.

833
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:32,387
It can't be.

834
00:52:32,979 --> 00:52:34,790
No. No.

835
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:37,585
No!

836
00:52:38,278 --> 00:52:40,247
Liar!

837
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:15,638
(Sisters of Korea)

838
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:44,718
Stop them.

839
00:53:54,282 --> 00:53:55,682
Where's Seok Kyung?

840
00:53:56,824 --> 00:53:58,464
How did you find this place?

841
00:53:59,044 --> 00:54:00,192
Did that witch tell you?

842
00:54:00,272 --> 00:54:01,741
What did you do with her?

843
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,018
What did you do to my daughter?

844
00:54:04,098 --> 00:54:05,372
Your daughter?

845
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,632
You knew she was your real daughter?

846
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:11,183
Whether or not she was my blood,
Seok Kyung was always my child.

847
00:54:11,263 --> 00:54:15,037
Right. Since I raised your daughter
all this time,

848
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:18,142
give me the development rights
as a thank you.

849
00:54:19,271 --> 00:54:22,236
Did you raise her to do this garbage?

850
00:54:23,255 --> 00:54:26,315
I'll make sure you never touch her
with those dirty hands again.

851
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:43,026
Seok Kyung.

852
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,510
Seok Kyung.

853
00:54:59,285 --> 00:55:00,795
(Sisters of Korea)

854
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:08,225
(Mom, don't look for me anymore.
I won't let Dad catch me.)

855
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,328
Mom, don't look for me anymore.

856
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,790
I won't let Dad catch me.

857
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,190
(Mom, don't look for me anymore.
I won't let Dad catch me.)

858
00:55:18,895 --> 00:55:20,205
Seok Kyung.

859
00:55:24,675 --> 00:55:26,045
(Sisters of Korea)

860
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:41,288
Seok Hoon, we're in trouble.

861
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,941
Seok Kyung's gone.

862
00:55:43,537 --> 00:55:46,168
What do you mean? No one passed by me.

863
00:55:46,694 --> 00:55:48,012
I'll come over.

864
00:56:30,475 --> 00:56:31,794
I can't go back like this.

865
00:56:31,874 --> 00:56:33,865
I will correct everything myself.

866
00:56:41,258 --> 00:56:42,338
Find her!

867
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:46,895
Joo Seok Kyung.

868
00:56:48,586 --> 00:56:50,655
You're dead once I catch you.

869
00:56:52,473 --> 00:56:55,270
-Place your bets.
-Wow!

870
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:01,559
Ace, all in.

871
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:02,751
All in.

872
00:57:09,144 --> 00:57:10,897
Ace, king, house.

873
00:57:10,977 --> 00:57:12,249
Show your cards.

874
00:57:13,979 --> 00:57:15,743
Kings, you win.

875
00:57:16,926 --> 00:57:18,010
Darn it.

876
00:57:18,764 --> 00:57:19,948
Mister.

877
00:57:22,729 --> 00:57:24,742
Who's next?

878
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,307
Hey, what's going on, man?

879
00:57:31,094 --> 00:57:32,410
What are you doing here?

880
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,934
You remember me, right?

881
00:57:36,696 --> 00:57:38,659
Logan's brother Alex.

882
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,958
You can't come here at this hour.

883
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,975
Logan's brother visited me
at the gambling den.

884
00:57:54,008 --> 00:57:56,069
He knows I'm a gambler.

885
00:57:56,657 --> 00:57:57,746
What?

886
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,612
I told you to be careful for a while.

887
00:57:59,692 --> 00:58:01,711
You can't let him find out
something that's important right now.

888
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:04,710
Why are you so slow to sort things out?

889
00:58:05,992 --> 00:58:07,351
Where is Logan right now?

890
00:58:08,494 --> 00:58:10,252
Hand him over to James,

891
00:58:10,332 --> 00:58:13,707
get me the money I'm owed so I can leave.

892
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:16,241
No.

893
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,194
I'll deal directly with James.

894
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:23,755
Once they suspect us, it's all over.

895
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:25,290
What excuse did you give?

896
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:27,490
That I dropped by for fun
because I felt suffocated.

897
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:31,055
He didn't seem to believe me.

898
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:35,021
Call James.

899
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:36,583
He can have him tomorrow.

900
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:38,448
Tomorrow?

901
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,753
Give this to James. Say you found Logan.

902
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:49,791
Tell him that
Joo Dan Tae had kept Logan hidden away.

903
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:52,844
Will this be the end of Joo Dan Tae, then?

904
00:58:55,163 --> 00:58:57,244
Are you going to bury this doctor too?

905
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:00,281
He works for Dan Tae,

906
00:59:00,361 --> 00:59:02,367
so James will be convinced
Dan Tae's behind it.

907
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:07,787
Very soon, you'll become incredibly rich.

908
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,136
Because I will give you half the reward.

909
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:14,838
Yes, this is it!

910
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,235
It's time
for everything to go back to its place.

911
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:40,999
You did well so far, Logan.

912
00:59:42,267 --> 00:59:43,949
In just 24 hours,

913
00:59:44,978 --> 00:59:46,736
you will feel very comfortable.

914
00:59:51,464 --> 00:59:53,085
(Cheong A Group)

915
01:00:04,906 --> 01:00:06,773
You look like a right mess.

916
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,582
Did it not go too well
with Dohae Construction's lobbyist?

917
01:00:09,662 --> 01:00:10,944
Do not agitate me.

918
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,603
You should've killed Su Ryeon
when you had the chance.

919
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:18,031
Then we wouldn't have gone to prison
or fail at everything we attempted.

920
01:00:19,096 --> 01:00:20,268
It's all your fault.

921
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:22,035
It's my fault again?

922
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,234
Can you stop blaming others?

923
01:00:25,569 --> 01:00:27,037
I'm not here to fight.

924
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,001
Shim Su Ryeon.

925
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:32,212
Why not leave her to me this time?

926
01:00:33,607 --> 01:00:36,636
-What?
-I'll get rid of her.

927
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,352
But I need your help in return.

928
01:00:39,996 --> 01:00:41,522
If you cooperate with me,

929
01:00:41,602 --> 01:00:44,054
proof that you killed Logan...

930
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,259
will disappear forever.

931
01:00:47,178 --> 01:00:48,262
How's that?

932
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:55,368
What must I cooperate with?

933
01:00:56,742 --> 01:00:59,452
It's not a bad deal for you at all.

934
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:00,968
If you're lucky,

935
01:01:03,488 --> 01:01:07,159
you can also get rid
of that pain Baek Jun Ki.

936
01:01:18,157 --> 01:01:20,535
Kyu Jin's hungry.

937
01:01:23,283 --> 01:01:25,291
Where's your husband's breakfast?

938
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:30,328
Why are you drinking soju in the morning?

939
01:01:32,209 --> 01:01:33,324
There's no food?

940
01:01:38,217 --> 01:01:40,322
Food.

941
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:51,391
What's this?

942
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:52,786
Where's Kyu Jin's?

943
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,233
There's really nothing?

944
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:59,122
From now on,
whatever you put in your mouth,

945
01:01:59,202 --> 01:02:02,061
you can prepare yourself.

946
01:02:02,141 --> 01:02:03,768
How dare you?

947
01:02:04,944 --> 01:02:08,331
Your husband works all day
until his knees are worn,

948
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:11,065
his body is crushed,
and his back is humped,

949
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:14,086
and you won't cook for him?
After all he does?

950
01:02:47,758 --> 01:02:48,714
Dad.

951
01:02:52,766 --> 01:02:53,783
Eun Byeol.

952
01:02:55,509 --> 01:02:56,757
It's been a long time.

953
01:02:57,269 --> 01:02:58,916
Are you okay?

954
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,077
Are you doing well at university?

955
01:03:01,922 --> 01:03:05,248
You have that many questions
and never visited?

956
01:03:05,893 --> 01:03:07,414
Didn't you miss me?

957
01:03:07,494 --> 01:03:08,772
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

958
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:11,801
There was something I had to do.

959
01:03:11,881 --> 01:03:12,807
What was that?

960
01:03:12,887 --> 01:03:15,739
Did it have something to do with Ro Na?

961
01:03:15,819 --> 01:03:17,703
Are you looking into her mom's death?

962
01:03:18,276 --> 01:03:20,118
Why should you?

963
01:03:20,198 --> 01:03:22,185
Because you married her?

964
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:25,070
Does Ro Na's mom mean more to you
than your own daughter?

965
01:03:28,002 --> 01:03:29,512
She's important to me.

966
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:32,800
And you're no longer a child.

967
01:03:33,368 --> 01:03:35,681
I won't put up with your tantrums anymore.

968
01:03:37,182 --> 01:03:39,230
Tell me why you came to see me.

969
01:03:42,545 --> 01:03:45,513
This medication. Why do you have it?

970
01:03:45,593 --> 01:03:47,712
Did you take it?

971
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:49,087
What's going on?

972
01:03:49,477 --> 01:03:51,018
Did Ro Na call you?

973
01:03:51,632 --> 01:03:53,093
Is that why you're here?

974
01:03:53,173 --> 01:03:55,137
This pill erases memories.

975
01:03:55,218 --> 01:03:57,414
It's what you took after Ro Na's accident.

976
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:58,951
Who gave it to you?

977
01:03:59,031 --> 01:04:00,970
Was it Jin Bun Hong? Or your mom?

978
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,697
It's just for my headaches! Don't mind it!

979
01:04:05,871 --> 01:04:08,854
Eun Byeol. When Ro Na's mom died...

980
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:10,999
What did you see?

981
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:12,341
You know something, don't you?

982
01:04:12,421 --> 01:04:15,120
You're taking the pills to hide the truth.

983
01:04:17,172 --> 01:04:18,921
Did Ro Na ask you to find out?

984
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:22,396
I don't know. I don't remember anything!

985
01:04:22,476 --> 01:04:24,160
You must remember!

986
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,152
You can't ignore anything anymore.

987
01:04:27,232 --> 01:04:28,408
You and I both...

988
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,613
shouldn't do that to Ro Na anymore.

989
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:33,892
How much more damage do you want to do?

990
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:37,268
What if something...

991
01:04:38,426 --> 01:04:40,222
really did happen that day?

992
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,024
What if what I remember...

993
01:04:43,482 --> 01:04:45,918
has something to do with Mom?

994
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:47,886
Then what?

995
01:04:48,454 --> 01:04:49,948
You still need to remember.

996
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:51,878
Whatever the truth is.

997
01:04:53,351 --> 01:04:56,664
I'll never abandon you.

998
01:04:56,744 --> 01:04:58,284
So trust me.

999
01:04:58,716 --> 01:05:01,744
And tell me everything
that happened that day. Okay?

1000
01:05:02,257 --> 01:05:03,923
You're a good girl.

1001
01:05:07,669 --> 01:05:11,268
I see you want to crack my head open
for Bae Ro Na.

1002
01:05:11,348 --> 01:05:12,851
Forget it.

1003
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:17,284
I don't know anything.

1004
01:05:20,258 --> 01:05:22,206
Eun Byeol.

1005
01:05:28,056 --> 01:05:29,190
Cheon Seo Jin.

1006
01:05:29,584 --> 01:05:33,005
I'll take off that mask
you're wearing with my own hands.

1007
01:05:36,525 --> 01:05:37,968
I finally found him.

1008
01:05:38,048 --> 01:05:39,527
Logan is alive.

1009
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,999
Was Joo Dan Tae behind it?

1010
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:46,807
And the guy beside him?

1011
01:05:46,887 --> 01:05:48,765
Joo Dan Tae's doctor friend.

1012
01:05:49,471 --> 01:05:52,604
It seems he was used
to prolonging Logan's life.

1013
01:05:54,623 --> 01:05:57,711
I told you. Joo Dan Tae is evil.

1014
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:02,247
He set up the bomb himself
and has been torturing Logan...

1015
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:03,974
without actually killing him.

1016
01:06:04,054 --> 01:06:06,362
That crazy psychopath!

1017
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:07,677
Please kill Joo Dan Tae...

1018
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:09,549
with your own hands.

1019
01:06:18,502 --> 01:06:20,048
Where's Logan?

1020
01:06:20,623 --> 01:06:23,620
I really don't know!

1021
01:06:25,863 --> 01:06:29,137
Baek Jun Ki already told us.

1022
01:06:29,525 --> 01:06:31,425
About your psycho deeds.

1023
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:33,866
Where's Logan?

1024
01:06:34,822 --> 01:06:36,860
Get a grip.

1025
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:40,530
Baek Jun Ki is playing all of you.

1026
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,913
Don't even try.

1027
01:06:42,993 --> 01:06:46,850
Tell us where Logan is
before we blow your head off.

1028
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,975
Kill me if you want.

1029
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:50,367
But...

1030
01:06:50,447 --> 01:06:53,528
Someone else was behind all this.

1031
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:57,552
If you really want to save Logan,
you have to listen to me.

1032
01:06:57,632 --> 01:07:00,559
What a silly tongue.

1033
01:07:02,716 --> 01:07:03,970
Let me look at the picture.

1034
01:07:05,373 --> 01:07:08,978
What does it say
on that trash can next to Logan?

1035
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:16,211
Penthouse?

1036
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:17,876
Penthouse?

1037
01:07:18,944 --> 01:07:21,412
I knew it was familiar.

1038
01:07:22,158 --> 01:07:25,146
Logan's at the penthouse.

1039
01:07:25,226 --> 01:07:27,085
The one taking care of Logan right now...

1040
01:07:27,433 --> 01:07:29,149
is Shim Su Ryeon.

1041
01:07:30,031 --> 01:07:32,172
Shim Su Ryeon?

1042
01:07:33,129 --> 01:07:34,782
Shim Su Ryeon is the one who...

1043
01:07:34,862 --> 01:07:38,143
She tried to blame it all on me.

1044
01:07:39,165 --> 01:07:40,935
The person who brought in Baek Jun Ki,

1045
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:44,548
and the person who told him
to set up the bomb...

1046
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:46,684
was Shim Su Ryeon!

1047
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:57,235
(Shim Su Ryeon, The eighth director)

1048
01:08:18,525 --> 01:08:22,122
This is your fault
for wanting something you shouldn't have.

1049
01:08:23,489 --> 01:08:25,891
This position means nothing to you.

1050
01:08:27,453 --> 01:08:28,517
But for me,

1051
01:08:29,623 --> 01:08:30,786
it's my life.

1052
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,706
(Cheong A Foundation Director
Shim Su Ryeon)

1053
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:08,958
Ma'am, you need to come over.

1054
01:09:09,038 --> 01:09:11,974
There's a weird smell
coming from behind the hall.

1055
01:09:12,586 --> 01:09:13,732
There is?

1056
01:09:29,602 --> 01:09:31,438
What kind of space is this?

1057
01:09:31,518 --> 01:09:33,141
I've never seen it before.

1058
01:09:33,221 --> 01:09:34,959
We use it as storage.

1059
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,156
-Who are you?
-Shim Su Ryeon.

1060
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:06,335
You revenge your daughter's death
by doing this to our Logan?

1061
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:08,427
Logan?

1062
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:11,897
Logan? What are you talking about?

1063
01:10:14,433 --> 01:10:16,979
I didn't know you were such a scary woman.

1064
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:19,481
Ordering Baek Jun Ki
to blow up Logan's car...

1065
01:10:19,561 --> 01:10:21,226
and keeping him locked up like this.

1066
01:10:21,306 --> 01:10:23,193
That's quite vicious.

1067
01:10:23,273 --> 01:10:26,150
This is your revenge for Min Seol A?

1068
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,914
You did this, didn't you?

1069
01:10:27,994 --> 01:10:29,498
What did you do to Logan?

1070
01:10:29,578 --> 01:10:32,029
This tactic won't work anymore.

1071
01:10:32,109 --> 01:10:34,403
We all know the truth now.

1072
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,647
Poor Logan.

1073
01:10:36,985 --> 01:10:39,573
Tricked by the woman he loves.

1074
01:10:42,946 --> 01:10:44,733
Logan!

1075
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:47,164
His heart stopped.

1076
01:10:48,365 --> 01:10:51,248
Take him to the hospital!

1077
01:10:51,328 --> 01:10:53,717
And bring her too!

1078
01:10:53,797 --> 01:10:55,346
Come on in!

1079
01:10:56,801 --> 01:10:58,415
Let me see Logan.

1080
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:01,722
Please let me see Logan!

1081
01:11:01,802 --> 01:11:03,931
Logan! Let me see him!

1082
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:07,732
Please!

1083
01:11:07,812 --> 01:11:09,100
Logan.

1084
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:11,547
Kill everyone...

1085
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:14,176
who put Logan in this situation!

1086
01:11:27,398 --> 01:11:30,262
Let me go! You can't do this!

1087
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:31,842
(Studio apartment)

1088
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,578
Why are you doing this?

1089
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:47,057
You're really something, Cheon Seo Jin.

1090
01:11:47,519 --> 01:11:49,391
You really tricked James.

1091
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,580
Is it now time to celebrate?

1092
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:55,167
No wonder...

1093
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,297
we make such great partners.

1094
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:06,131
There's one thing I want to know.

1095
01:12:06,815 --> 01:12:09,248
Why do you want
to get at Shim Su Ryeon so badly?

1096
01:12:09,854 --> 01:12:11,331
The almighty Cheon Seo Jin.

1097
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:15,203
She was the one woman
who really made me care.

1098
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,591
Shim Su Ryeon.

1099
01:12:18,549 --> 01:12:20,148
-Su Ryeon!
-Oh, my!

1100
01:12:20,228 --> 01:12:22,907
-It's been a while.
-It has been.

1101
01:12:22,987 --> 01:12:25,750
We started without you.
I hope that's okay.

1102
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:27,397
How's everyone been?

1103
01:12:28,212 --> 01:12:29,772
Right, I got this.

1104
01:12:30,448 --> 01:12:33,275
I didn't want to come empty-handed.
It's a pecan pie.

1105
01:12:33,355 --> 01:12:35,034
Let's all share it later.

1106
01:12:35,461 --> 01:12:37,452
Look at Ms. Cheon.

1107
01:12:37,532 --> 01:12:40,225
She also prepared a pecan pie.

1108
01:12:40,966 --> 01:12:43,883
That's amazing. Can I try it now?

1109
01:12:44,253 --> 01:12:45,308
Well...

1110
01:12:46,022 --> 01:12:47,666
Me too. I want a slice too.

1111
01:12:48,162 --> 01:12:49,432
This looks great.

1112
01:12:50,487 --> 01:12:52,649
You're so talented.

1113
01:12:52,729 --> 01:12:55,816
The taste is incomparable
to store-bought ones.

1114
01:12:55,896 --> 01:12:57,153
This is great.

1115
01:12:57,233 --> 01:12:59,245
What goes well with dessert?

1116
01:13:00,024 --> 01:13:01,084
Honey.

1117
01:13:02,892 --> 01:13:04,887
Go bring a Bordeaux wine.

1118
01:13:04,967 --> 01:13:06,619
It's always nice to share a good wine.

1119
01:13:08,577 --> 01:13:09,719
Quickly.

1120
01:13:14,255 --> 01:13:17,106
Is it fun mocking your wife
in front of everyone else?

1121
01:13:17,186 --> 01:13:18,302
You like that?

1122
01:13:18,382 --> 01:13:20,089
I told you to stop trying so hard.

1123
01:13:20,169 --> 01:13:22,177
Pretending to have everything
and know everything.

1124
01:13:22,257 --> 01:13:23,212
Aren't you sick of it?

1125
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:26,049
Do you want your wife to be low-class?

1126
01:13:26,548 --> 01:13:29,409
I'm doing it to save your face.

1127
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:30,990
Be more honest.

1128
01:13:31,103 --> 01:13:34,125
Shim Su Ryeon is the real deal
when it comes to being a wife.

1129
01:13:34,216 --> 01:13:36,256
Look at how Chairman Joo's business
is booming.

1130
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:42,966
What are you doing?

1131
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:45,794
You think you can just compliment
someone else's wife like that?

1132
01:13:45,874 --> 01:13:47,017
You...

1133
01:13:49,535 --> 01:13:51,178
I was looking for the bathroom.

1134
01:13:57,729 --> 01:14:01,484
Right then,
I wanted to steal everything you had.

1135
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:04,418
The penthouse. Your husband.

1136
01:14:04,498 --> 01:14:07,340
The relaxed elegance. All of it.

1137
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,025
All men are like that.

1138
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,062
She annoyed me like crazy.

1139
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:16,055
The woman I had never beaten in my life.

1140
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:17,253
Shim Su Ryeon.

1141
01:14:17,888 --> 01:14:19,846
Oh Yoon Hee and Logan...

1142
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:21,670
died because of you.

1143
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:26,796
I had to eliminate those around you
to beat you.

1144
01:14:28,257 --> 01:14:32,238
Will there ever be a day better than this?

1145
01:14:32,318 --> 01:14:35,679
I got rid of everyone
who has been bothering me.

1146
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,260
I shall drink until I get wasted.

1147
01:14:57,321 --> 01:14:58,194
Let go.

1148
01:14:58,897 --> 01:15:00,526
You're being fooled.

01:15:00,606 --> 01:15:02,667
Please take me to Logan.

1150
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:04,179
I need to see...

1151
01:15:04,259 --> 01:15:06,747
how he's doing with my own eyes.
I beg you.

1152
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:12,278
I didn't kill Logan.

1153
01:15:12,358 --> 01:15:13,875
I didn't do it.

1154
01:15:28,681 --> 01:15:30,047
I was in love...

1155
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:34,404
with Logan.

1156
01:15:56,775 --> 01:15:57,870
Logan.

1157
01:15:59,492 --> 01:16:00,568
Su Ryeon.

1158
01:16:38,576 --> 01:16:39,950
I missed you.

1161
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:33,106
Are you really Logan?

1162
01:17:33,186 --> 01:17:34,472
I'm sorry it took me so long.

1163
01:17:34,552 --> 01:17:36,158
I want Yoon Hee's revenge too.

1164
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:37,817
Did Ro Na's mom die because of me?

1165
01:17:37,897 --> 01:17:39,228
Ma Ri, what do you want me to do first?

1166
01:17:39,308 --> 01:17:40,354
I'll do as you say.

1167
01:17:40,434 --> 01:17:42,347
If something happens to me,
please look after Ro Na.

The tallest building in the world.
Imagine that.

1169
01:17:44,979 --> 01:17:46,623
It's your turn now, Joo Dan Tae.

1170
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:48,981
I'm giving you one last chance.

1171
01:17:49,061 --> 01:17:51,549
What happened that day? Tell me!
