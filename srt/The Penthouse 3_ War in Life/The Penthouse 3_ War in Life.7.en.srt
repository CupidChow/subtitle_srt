(All characters, organizations,

3
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:14,236
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

4
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:15,890
Get Logan's body no matter what.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,730
He needs to be kept alive.

6
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:20,520
I'll tell Su Ryeon everything.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,895
That you knew
Logan was going to die that day.

8
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:24,255
Logan is dead.

9
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:28,929
I won't see her again. I won't!

10
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:31,214
You killed her.
You pushed her off the cliff.

11
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:33,609
It's better to forget bad memories.

12
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:34,808
Cheonsoo District.

13
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:37,004
If Cheonsoo District is reselected,

14
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:39,206
Cheong A Constructions
will be the constructor.

15
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,187
That's him. It's Joo Dan Tae, right?

16
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:43,347
Only a demon can handle a demon.

17
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:44,545
It's Dohae again?

18
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,437
I heard they have a lobbyist
working for them.

19
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:47,976
I just can't figure out who it is.

20
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:49,150
Hello.

21
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:51,476
I'm honoured to meet you like this.

22
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:53,626
=Episode 7=

23
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:58,717
You're Vice Minister Yoon Kyung Eun
from the Ministry of Education, yes?

24
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,647
Thank you for taking the time
to meet me, ma'am.

25
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:04,412
Why did you ask to see me?

26
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:09,062
You're highly reputed
to be an educator with good character,

27
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:10,937
so I wanted to meet you.

28
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,051
I would like to become a light
for your future.

29
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:18,294
A light?

30
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,156
Who on earth are you?

31
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:26,510
Hello, Vice Minister Yoon.

32
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,693
I'm Jessica, the baby madam.

33
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:34,494
Baby madam?

34
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:37,617
Don't stare at me like that.
You're embarrassing me.

35
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:44,015
I may not look it,
but I am very interested in education.

36
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,019
I'm your fan.

37
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:51,001
It feels kind of cold. How about we drink?

38
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:53,867
Here. Drink with us. Bottoms up.

39
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,264
I don't drink with people I do not know.

40
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:59,690
Then... Have some fruit. Here you go.

41
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,998
I can get it myself.

42
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:03,320
Why are you so on guard?

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,669
Please make yourself comfortable.
Be comfortable.

44
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:08,458
I am very comfortable right now.

45
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,984
I would not have come
had I known this was why you invited me.

46
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,043
I'm leaving.

47
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:14,344
Goodness. Wait.

48
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:16,177
-What was that?
-What are you doing?

49
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:18,847
What did you say? What?

50
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:21,764
I didn't invite you here
to waste your time.

51
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:26,030
There's something you need to see.

52
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:31,296
Here. Ma'am.

53
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,364
This is nice.

54
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:39,802
They're VIP customers
in the next room over.

55
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:44,217
-Gosh.
-Minister Kang?

56
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,701
Gosh. Goodness.

57
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:54,217
What great weather.

58
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,713
Are you telling me...

59
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:01,289
to take this bribe from you?

60
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:02,573
Minister.

61
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:06,323
What do you mean?
There's no bribe in this room.

62
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:09,644
We can't see or hear anything.

63
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:18,374
How did you read my mind so well?

64
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,736
I'm so moved!

65
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:29,386
You're so cool.

66
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:32,209
Please do what you can...

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,434
to get Gangnam's prestigious schools
to move to Cheonsoo District.

68
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:37,336
Prestigious high schools
are absolutely necessary...

69
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,591
in the model submitted
by Cheong A Constructions.

70
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,297
Please make your decision.

71
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:43,696
You won't be a minister forever.

72
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:47,401
You have honour already.
It's time to become rich now.

73
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:49,693
-Yes!
-Me too.

74
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:52,458
Friends.

75
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,057
I don't know if this is right.

76
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:03,295
They're so beautiful.

77
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,236
Second lady. Come here.

78
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:07,071
Whatever!

79
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,264
Kindness shall never be forgotten!

80
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,225
-Kindness shall never be forgotten!
-Kindness shall never be forgotten!

81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,789
Why don't you sing something, sir?

82
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:16,915
Are you ready to party?

83
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,763
Party with me all night long.

84
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:25,324
Shout it out loud.

85
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:34,812
Cheong A Constructions
is lobbying Minister Kang...

86
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:37,082
to move the prestigious schools...

87
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:39,707
from Gangnam's School District Eight
to Cheonsoo District.

88
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:42,204
I knew he'd get in trouble
one of these days.

89
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:44,238
He was always obsessed with money.

90
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:48,610
If the top high schools in our nation
are moved to Cheonsoo District,

91
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,414
young parents will storm
to buy houses there.

92
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:54,641
And the house prices
will shoot through the roof.

93
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:56,167
Because an education complex...

94
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:58,520
bigger than the one
in Daechi-dong will be created.

95
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:00,782
Education...

96
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,922
will be used in their ploy
to make money on real estate.

97
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:08,060
Why are you showing this to me?

98
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,532
We know
you don't get along with Minister Kang.

99
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,419
Everyone knows you're enemies.

100
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:17,094
We want the same thing.

101
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:19,662
Their demise.

102
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,166
It'll be enough
to get rid of Minister Kang.

103
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,657
I don't know what you're up to,

104
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,553
but making a deal with me like this
is also lobbying.

105
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:32,926
I am aware of that.

106
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:36,549
You don't have to get your hands dirty.

107
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,222
I'll do everything myself.

108
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,393
All you have to do is clean it up.

109
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:45,521
Clean it up?

110
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:46,979
Make sure...

111
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:50,540
the schools in School District Eight
can't be moved to Cheonsoo District.

112
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,171
Our children's education...

113
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:55,519
should not be used
for the sake of property value.

114
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,824
You've lived as an educator
your whole life.

115
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,894
Isn't your pride at stake?

116
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:08,821
Who are you?

117
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:10,586
Who?

118
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,680
Do whatever it takes to save Logan.

119
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,647
He doesn't need to function
as a human being.

120
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,022
Just keep him breathing. That's why...

121
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:25,664
I got you out of prison.

122
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:28,594
I'm not a burn specialist. He's hopeless!

123
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:31,258
I don't know when he'll die.

124
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:32,499
He needs more drugs.

125
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,340
He must be moved
to a large hospital quickly.

126
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:36,180
Let's talk in person.

127
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,172
Talk to the nurse.

128
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,870
What is that?

129
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,265
I said no outside drugs.

130
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:49,159
You said to save him at all costs.

131
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:54,261
I'm just doing my best as a doctor
to treat my patient, that is all.

132
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:57,474
Do you think you're a reputable doctor?

133
00:06:57,554 --> 00:06:59,929
Don't try to play doctor.

134
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,348
Just keep him alive.

135
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,997
Even a doctor who lost his license
can do that much, right?

136
00:07:07,797 --> 00:07:10,439
How much do you know about me?

137
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,631
You're watching from there, aren't you?

138
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:13,918
Who are you?

139
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,871
What's your relationship with Logan?

140
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:18,994
None of your business.
Shut it and do as I say.

141
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,488
If you're really worried about him,
use the drugs that are there.

142
00:07:22,947 --> 00:07:24,679
It'll relieve the excruciating pain.

143
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,698
Why are you trying to save him?

144
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,216
I said it's none of your business.

145
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:31,871
No one else can find out
that Logan is alive.

146
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,195
If it gets out...

147
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,281
your daughter's life will be in danger.

148
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:40,366
What?

149
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:42,793
Remember this.

150
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:45,778
No matter what you do,
you're in the palm of my hand.

151
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:49,070
So don't try to do anything stupid.

152
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,673
I got you out of prison,

153
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:53,174
so you should lick the soles of my feet.

154
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:54,756
Am I wrong?

155
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:56,753
Are you...

156
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,315
Are you Dan Tae?

157
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,310
Finish treating him.

158
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,720
You can go once the nurse relieves you.

159
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:10,818
Who are you? Show your face, you low life!

160
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:14,014
Are you Dan Tae? Show your face!

161
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,381
Hey, you!

162
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:29,399
I said to think about your daughter.

163
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,782
I'm even prepared...

164
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:10,673
to lick the soles of your feet.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,933
Yes. Think that it's Dan Tae.

166
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:17,039
That's what I want.

167
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:25,504
-That was great.
-I know.

168
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:29,952
Losers come in all shapes and sizes.

169
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:33,935
He's busy making offerings
to the people in power.

170
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:36,349
And he's busy extorting subcontractors.

171
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:39,217
It's because scum like that
are in power...

172
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:41,571
that people like Yoon Hee
died wrongful deaths.

173
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:44,622
I'll gouge out everything that is rotten.

174
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,692
Every single one.

175
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,122
Thank you.
It's an honour to work with you.

176
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:57,399
Thank you.

177
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,953
How about a picture
to commemorate the occasion?

178
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:00,960
Sounds good.

179
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,157
Okay. Get in.

180
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:07,147
-That came out nice.
-It did.

181
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:08,825
-I'll let you talk.
-Sure.

182
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:11,035
So, what are your plans...

183
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:14,157
(Korean Gaudi, Architect Bae Chae Shik)

184
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:16,977
(Cheonsoo District,
Cheong A Constructions)

185
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:20,307
(Cheong A Group)

186
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:38,938
I know nothing about it.

187
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:40,930
How dare you create fake photos of me?

188
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,991
Fake? Did you just say they're fake?

189
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:48,408
Fake?

190
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:51,626
Sign this.

191
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:54,779
It's an oath that you'll never work
with Cheong A Constructions.

192
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:56,203
But...

193
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,395
No? You won't sign it?

194
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,321
I will. I'll sign it.

195
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:07,524
Just keep the gold bars.

196
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,840
We won't tell Cheong A Constructions
for the time being.

197
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:15,355
-Sign it.
-Yes, ma'am.

198
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:16,744
(Oath Refusing
to Work with Cheonsoo District)

199
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:19,424
(Bae Chae Shik)

200
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,453
My liver is dying
from drinking every single night...

201
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:30,029
to wine and dine all those people.

202
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:31,773
It's almost over.

203
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:32,865
With the best schools,

204
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:35,834
the best architecture and landscaping,
it's game over.

205
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:38,314
Did you manage
to get Dohae Construction's business plan?

206
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:41,346
Their main pledge
is about creating an eco-friendly city.

207
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:43,302
Education versus the environment.

208
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:45,175
It'll be a tough fight.

209
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:47,450
It's not fun if our opponent is too easy.

210
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,679
But a new construction company
managed to jump into...

211
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,825
this huge business without any capital.

212
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:54,382
It's too weird.

213
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:56,839
Do you know who Dohae's lobbyist is?

214
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,972
Nothing much is known about her.

215
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:00,991
She's incredibly pretty.

216
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:04,732
And there's this woman
who follows her like a bodyguard...

217
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:07,552
and her name is... Yes, Jessica.

218
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,660
She's in her 30s, I think.

219
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,259
She mixes drinks fantastically well...

220
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:15,498
and can make flowers
and cranes out of fruit.

221
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:18,395
She's so charismatic
that most men cower around her.

222
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:19,464
"Jessica"?

223
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:20,794
(Bathhouse)

224
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,629
What are you doing? Let go.

225
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,300
Let go!

226
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,640
What's your deal with Dohae Construction?

227
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:28,341
Jessica.

228
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,513
When we first met,
you lied and said that was your name.

229
00:12:32,256 --> 00:12:33,891
What are you up to?

230
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,425
Don't you mind what I do.

231
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,258
We're one sign away from being divorced.

232
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:41,041
Chairman Joo won't touch us
as long as we don't betray him.

233
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:42,566
Why are you acting out?

234
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,420
-Think of Jenny.
-You moron.

235
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,103
Are you living as Dan Tae's dog
for Jenny's sake?

236
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,610
I'm not a moron like you,

237
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:52,197
so I'm not scared of Dan Tae at all.

238
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,627
Do you want Jenny to be their pet dog too?

239
00:12:56,834 --> 00:13:00,029
How did the fiery fist of Jincheon
end up like this?

240
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:02,410
Ma Ri. You're Jenny's mom. Please.

241
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,623
Whenever I think of how you threw
poor Yoon Hee in the lake,

242
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:08,829
I feel chilled to the bone.

243
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:12,235
If you're going to defend Dan Tae,
don't show your face again.

244
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:13,701
And don't show up near Jenny.

245
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:15,327
She and I are in agreement on this.

246
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:17,540
-No, honey.
-Let go of me!

247
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:20,671
Kang Ma Ri. Ms. Jincheon!

248
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:28,097
(Bathhouse)

249
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:33,637
(My sister)

250
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,200
It's me.

251
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,883
Why? What's up?

252
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,681
Are you busy?

253
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,379
Just tell me why you called.

254
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,557
I'm leaving today
to study abroad. In Italy.

255
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:57,699
You're going abroad?

256
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:00,376
You're telling me now?

257
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,629
Did you get Mom's permission?

258
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:05,335
No. You tell her for me.

259
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,247
What is wrong with you?

260
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,496
You decided something
that important without talking to Mom?

261
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,529
You should've at least talked to me first.

262
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:17,168
Are we even family?

263
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:19,088
Can you do this to Mom?

264
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:20,675
Why are you so angry?

265
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:22,404
I'm telling you now.

266
00:14:24,456 --> 00:14:26,643
Mom said
she doesn't consider me her child.

267
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:27,862
Do you believe that?

268
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:31,102
You're stupid.
Mom's always waiting for your call.

269
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:32,718
Can you come...

270
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:36,815
to the airport?

271
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:39,011
I haven't seen you in so long.

272
00:14:39,907 --> 00:14:41,857
And I won't be seeing you for a while.

273
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:45,553
Forget it.

274
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,201
Why do you need me
when you'll do whatever you want?

275
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,090
Don't call me whether you live or die.

276
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,435
I can pretend I don't have a sister.

277
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,407
Bye.

278
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,885
Seok Hoon.

279
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,508
What?

280
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:07,231
Today?

281
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,974
She never mentioned that.

282
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,263
What time is her flight?

283
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,918
I didn't ask.
She'll call when she arrives.

284
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,157
Don't worry.

285
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:17,639
Which school in Italy is it?

286
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,523
Did your dad send her?

287
00:15:26,147 --> 00:15:28,190
She wanted to study abroad.

288
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,746
She'll settle in just fine.

289
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:33,399
It's best for her to be apart from Dad.

290
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:36,795
I didn't think she'd leave so abruptly.

291
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:41,526
Has something been bothering you?

292
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:43,699
I've been busy with work.

293
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:48,022
It's about Ro Na's mom, isn't it?

294
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:52,341
If you're looking into her death,
I'll help.

295
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:55,193
It's fine. I can manage.

296
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:57,465
I'm in university now. I'm not a child.

297
00:15:57,545 --> 00:16:00,150
Ro Na is struggling,
and I want to help her.

298
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:02,619
Seok Hoon.

299
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:06,605
I know you think dearly of Ro Na,

300
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:11,443
but I think it's best you end it now.

301
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:17,480
What do you mean by that?

302
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,650
Ro Na's mom's death...

303
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,978
has something to do with your dad.

304
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:27,361
What?

305
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,142
Is that true?

306
00:16:32,485 --> 00:16:34,485
It's not, right? Is it?

307
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,163
Ro Na will find out one day,

308
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,941
and it'll hurt both you and her a lot.

309
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:45,652
The man who tried to hurt her
drove her mom to her death.

310
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,705
How could she forgive that?

311
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:54,268
-It's not your fault, but...
-Stop.

312
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:58,727
Stop it.

313
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:01,694
I get it, so stop it.

314
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,164
It is my fault.

315
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:10,477
Like Dad said, if he's a demon,
I'm the demon's son.

316
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,150
If he's a snake, I'm a snake's son.

317
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,154
A demon and snake's son,
that's what I am...

318
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,455
and I fell for Ro Na.

319
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,296
I don't even deserve to.

320
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:30,730
I'm the son of a scumbag.

321
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,397
Where are you going, Seok Hoon?

322
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,517
(Dr. Ha Yoon Chul)

323
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:40,779
It's Ha Yoon Chul.

324
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,169
I have something urgent to say.

325
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:44,734
Can we meet?

326
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:52,672
I'm really sorry.

327
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:55,149
The traffic is terrible
and I'll be ten minutes late.

328
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:59,088
Sure, that's fine. I just arrived anyway.

329
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:00,365
Take your time.

330
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:12,317
(Number Withheld)

331
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,857
(Number Withheld)

332
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:19,836
What are you doing?

333
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,883
Why do you have Eun Byeol's photo?

334
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:24,860
I thought what your weakness would be.

335
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,693
Nothing beats a child.

336
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:28,531
What darn nonsense...

337
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:33,498
If you touch a single hair
on Eun Byeol's head,

338
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:35,269
I will kill you.

339
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,842
I swear I will kill you. Do you get that?

340
00:18:38,922 --> 00:18:40,710
That's all up to you.

341
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:43,677
If you tell Shim Su Ryeon anything...

342
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:44,804
Mom!

343
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:47,122
that will be the last time
you see your daughter.

344
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:50,644
Unless you want a tragic ending,
leave right now.

345
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:52,275
You scumbag.

346
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:55,057
I don't give a second warning.
Think carefully.

347
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:22,327
The phone is turned off. Please leave...

348
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:31,728
What are you doing here?

349
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,078
Why? Am I somewhere I can't be?

350
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,326
I need you to empty the building.

351
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,858
I'm going to flatten everything.

352
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:42,907
Says who?

353
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:48,000
The penthouse
and Cheonsoo District lot 27.

354
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:50,151
Did you forget they're in my name?

355
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:52,784
I was too lenient, wasn't I?

356
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,528
I can't delay any longer.

357
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,329
It's your final notice.

358
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:02,089
Of all the plots of land,
why are you so fixated on this one?

359
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,055
I wonder.

360
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:09,149
Why don't you ask your dead father?

361
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,199
What happened to Seok Kyung?

362
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,778
Why suddenly send her abroad?

363
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:16,470
She wanted to go.

364
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:20,145
She wanted to run away
to a place her mom could never find her.

365
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,927
So I made her wish come true...

366
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,438
since I'm a sweet dad.

367
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:29,977
I'm busy and have to dash. Bye.

368
00:20:46,117 --> 00:20:49,787
(The Barber of Seville)

369
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:54,927
(The Barber of Seville)

370
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,006
(The Barber of Seville)

371
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,114
What are you doing?

372
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:08,096
I heard you failed the Cheong A audition.

373
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:09,426
Every application
you submit gets rejected...

374
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:11,030
and yet you still want to go on?

375
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:13,259
Just go abroad, like my mother said.

376
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,277
Seok Kyung also went off to Italy,
didn't she?

377
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,760
I don't want to run away.

378
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:19,199
People already say
I'm the talentless daughter...

379
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,441
of a serial killer.

380
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:21,747
Where would I even run to?

381
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:24,876
Why would you read those comments?
They'll only make you angry.

382
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:27,297
Make those people who attack you
without knowing the full context...

383
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:29,885
reveal their identities
before coming at you.

384
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:33,028
I'm reading them on purpose,
so that I don't forget.

385
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:36,306
It's so that I remember...

386
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:38,574
what happened to my mom.

387
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:43,055
I can't watch this.
Leave this and come with me.

388
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,668
Where are we going?

389
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:49,246
Drink and forget about it.

390
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:51,368
Tteokbokki and fried chicken
are your favourite foods.

391
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:53,520
-Enjoy.
-It looks delicious.

392
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,465
Honestly, isn't the whole Cheong A
resident musician thing fake?

393
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,575
It's a show to support Eun Byeol.

394
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:00,438
I heard the Vienna Philharmonic concert
in Korea...

395
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:02,284
is also taking place
at Cheong A Arts Center.

396
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,890
Ms. Cheon...

397
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,592
is absolutely set
on supporting Eun Byeol all the way.

398
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:08,263
That makes me so mad.

399
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:12,146
Min Hyuk. Are you going to live
as Ha Eun Byeol's servant?

400
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:13,468
Don't you have any pride?

401
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:16,912
Everyone at your school
should boycott the audition.

402
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:18,823
Make everything go to waste.

403
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:23,465
What are you doing at school?

404
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:24,970
I have good news.

405
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:28,369
You know the Vienna Philharmonic concert
is next week, right?

406
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:30,202
The conductor, Clark Lee,

407
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,546
is doing a press conference
at Cheong A Arts Center.

408
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,906
I'll do whatever it takes
to arrange a meeting.

409
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,838
You just prepare to audition for Clark.

410
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:39,228
Audition? Me?

411
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:40,685
How?

412
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:42,991
He knows me
from when I was studying abroad.

413
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,091
If you're acknowledged by Clark,

414
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:47,244
you'll get called
by world-renowned conductors.

415
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,713
Then you can perform on international
stages with the Vienna Philharmonic.

416
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:54,604
You can become a prima Donna at famous
opera houses in Italy and Austria.

417
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:57,881
I'll be a prima Donna
for Clark's performance?

418
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:01,302
No matter what anyone says,
your skills are top-notch.

419
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:03,659
You won all music competitions in Korea.

420
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,429
Korea is too small a stage for you.

421
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:09,869
Although I stayed in this country,

422
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,311
I will support you endlessly...

423
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,654
so that you can perform
on the international stage.

424
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,242
Do you think I can do it?

425
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,052
No one but you can do it.

426
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:22,309
Mom, can you hear my heart beat?

427
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:25,170
What should I sing for the audition?

428
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,025
You'll teach me, right?

429
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,535
Of course.

430
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,730
We need to bring our your best
by next week, whatever it takes.

431
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,531
It's going to be different
from any other audition you've done.

432
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:37,506
To conquer the world stage,
just singing well isn't enough.

433
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,719
You have to act with perfect emotions,

434
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,994
using your hands, feet, face,
and your entire body.

435
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:46,603
You understand me, don't you?

436
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:51,582
You have to be better than me.
That's the only way...

437
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:55,851
I can get compensated
for the life I've lived.

438
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,763
I'll never let go of this opportunity
you've given me.

439
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:04,789
I love you, mom.

440
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:08,531
No wonder you're my daughter.

441
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:11,414
I knew you would be able
to get out of this fiery pit on your own.

442
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,303
I'm so glad I trusted you.

443
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:21,330
Goodness. Is this for Eun Byeol?

444
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:24,960
It seems like your relationship
with your daughter is going well,

445
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,464
seeing how
you're taking such good care of her.

446
00:24:27,544 --> 00:24:30,188
You're not trying to eat
with Eun Byeol, are you?

447
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,410
No way.

448
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,431
I have a weaker stomach than you think.

449
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:35,130
I think Cheong A Constructions...

450
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,458
will soon win the rights
for Cheonsoo District.

451
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:41,141
So I think I might need...

452
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:43,405
some more money
from the Cheong A Group fund.

453
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,019
Again?

454
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:48,841
I heard Dohae Construction
is not an easy rival.

455
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,754
That tiny company can't compete
with Cheong A Constructions.

456
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,398
Still, no more.

457
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:57,117
I only trust the money I have,
not what has already left my hands.

458
00:24:57,587 --> 00:24:59,514
You, even less so.

459
00:25:00,174 --> 00:25:02,393
Eun Byeol. Come have breakfast.

460
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:04,811
Expanding the company...

461
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:09,398
It's your wish
to expand the company and split with me...

462
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:11,103
as soon as possible.

463
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:12,465
If we make a successful bid,

464
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,871
it'll be easy to raise stock prices
by double or triple.

465
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:16,893
I bet my life on Cheonsoo District.

466
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,864
It's a great chance
to sell the company at the highest price.

467
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:21,118
And what if it fails?

468
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:23,770
That's never going to happen.

469
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,873
I need about 50 million dollars
to start bribing...

470
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:28,508
the Cheonsoo District
association's officers today.

471
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:32,073
They are the ones
who will fight for us on the front line.

472
00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:34,631
Trust me. This is the last time.

473
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:39,895
Fine.

474
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:41,795
But under one condition.

475
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:44,906
Give me ten percent
of Cheong A Group's stocks.

476
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:46,220
Then I'll consider it.

477
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:48,885
Ten percent?

478
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,469
Are you a thief?
Do you think that makes any sense?

479
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:55,310
You don't have to do it.
I don't want it either.

480
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,468
No other condition will work.
Come back when you change your mind.

481
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:01,617
Eun Byeol, come have breakfast.

482
00:26:01,697 --> 00:26:02,882
That crazy...

483
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:07,202
Fine. Ten percent.

484
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,204
Here at Cheong A Constructions,

485
00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:14,230
we are planning on procuring a
billion dollars to use for promotion fees.

486
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:16,554
Not only will we move
the prestigious schools...

in Gangnam's School District Eight
to Cheonsoo District,

488
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:22,156
we are also planning
to build Cheonsoo Express,

489
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:25,862
making the trip from Jongno to Cheonsoo
a mere 20 minutes,

490
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:28,481
and from Apgujeong to Cheonsoo
no more than ten.

491
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:30,455
-How amazing.
-Good idea.

492
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,874
The rate would be 100,000 dollars
per 3.3 square metres.

493
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:35,237
But for the members of our association,

494
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:37,417
it will be 50,000 dollars
per 3.3 square metres.

495
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:42,623
Don't worry about the taxes.

496
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:45,421
I, former assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin,

497
00:26:45,763 --> 00:26:48,488
will help you minimize your taxes.

498
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,118
But...

499
00:26:53,531 --> 00:26:58,182
is it true that you will guarantee
200 percent in compensation...

500
00:26:58,262 --> 00:26:59,558
if you fail to meet any of your promises?

501
00:26:59,638 --> 00:27:02,756
You don't even trust your husband, do you?

502
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:08,204
We'll create a nice document
and even get it notarized.

503
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:11,533
You can sue us
if we don't carry out our promises.

504
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:15,820
That shows just how confident
we are in all of our promises.

505

of our business plan.

507
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:29,437
We trust you to convince the members well.

508
00:27:30,825 --> 00:27:34,411
A new city that combines
the best of Apgujeong and Daechi-dong...

509
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:36,580
will soon be yours.

510
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:39,179
-Thank you.
-Welcome, Clark.

511
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,868
How long has it been?

512
00:28:42,622 --> 00:28:44,899
I'm so excited to see you again.

513
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:46,181
So am I.

514
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:49,025
You've become even more beautiful.

515
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,480
Congratulations on becoming the director.

516
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,178
Thank you for choosing our art hall
as your press conference location.

517
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,697
The reporters are waiting. Shall we?

518
00:28:58,777 --> 00:28:59,752
Certainly.

519
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:01,581
Take good care of him.

520
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:08,087
-Where's Eun Byeol?
-Rehearsing in the waiting room.

521
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:11,410
Bring her backstage
as soon as the press conference ends.

522
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,830
And make sure the reporters don't notice.

(Press Conference for Vienna
Philharmonic's Concert in Korea)

524
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:41,481
The biggest gift for me...

525
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:44,011
is the news that Ms. Cheon,
Director of the Arts Center,

526
00:29:44,091 --> 00:29:46,229
will be returning to the stage.

527
00:29:48,657 --> 00:29:50,143
My heart flutters...

528
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:53,882
at the excitement
of meeting talented new vocalists...

529
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:56,643
right on this stage.

530
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:01,128
It is a great honour...

531
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:04,994
that the Vienna Philharmonic concert
led by Conductor Clark Lee...

532
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:07,413
is the first performance
we'll host at Cheong A Arts Center.

533
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:11,040
Please help us spread the word
so that the concert is a success.

534
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:21,997
I believe we can wrap up the interview
about now.

provided for you...

537
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:27,947
Thank you.

538
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:30,734
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

539
00:30:30,814 --> 00:30:32,980
Shall we go some place else
and have some tea?

540
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,110
Okay.

Who is that?
Who's singing without permission?

543
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:18,000
Excuse me, Clark?

544
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,088
Bae Ro Na.

545
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:39,859
I didn't realize there were people here.

546
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:42,596
I'm sorry.

547
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,273
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:50,390
Someone who's as talented as you
shouldn't be here preparing food.

549
00:31:51,218 --> 00:31:54,067
I feel like I've just discovered
an amazing gem.

550
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,909
Is she a resident musician here?

551
00:31:56,989 --> 00:31:58,069
No.

552
00:31:59,296 --> 00:32:01,909
I didn't even have a chance to audition.

553
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,905
My application was rejected.

554
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:10,266
Someone who can sing a high F perfectly
didn't even get a chance to audition?

555
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,797
No way. There must be something wrong.

556
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,802
You mustn't miss out on a gem like this.

557
00:32:17,882 --> 00:32:19,209
If you trust my ears,

558
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:21,567
please give her one more chance.

559
00:32:21,938 --> 00:32:23,433
You will do so, won't you?

560
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:28,413
What is your name?

561
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:30,835
My name is Bae Ro Na.

562
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,984
She's the daughter
of the Admissions Murderer!

563
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:34,998
-I need to get an interview.
-That's her, right?

564
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,679
Ms. Bae, may I get an interview with you?

565
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,271
You have been acknowledged
by the world-renowned Clark Lee.

566
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:39,550
How do you feel?

567
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:42,980
Are you giving me a chance to audition,

568
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,542
Director Cheon?

569
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,203
I would like a clear answer.

570
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:54,480
Since it's Clark's request,

571
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,020
I guess I have no choice.

572
00:32:59,817 --> 00:33:02,521
I'm truly grateful
to Director Cheon for giving me...

573
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:06,060
a fair chance
without having any prejudice against me.

574
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,883
I will prepare well
to ensure that I repay your kindness.

575
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:12,879
How will you prepare for the audition?

576
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:15,514
-What are your plans?
-Could you tell us?

577
00:34:02,147 --> 00:34:03,282
Bae Ro Na.

578
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,231
You!

579
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:06,820
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

580
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,253
You waited behind the stage on purpose.

581
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,226
You did it
to steal Eun Byeol's opportunity.

582
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:12,636
How did you know?

583
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:17,215
Is that what your dead mother taught you?

584
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:19,565
How could you act
exactly like your mother?

585
00:34:19,645 --> 00:34:21,981
You don't have any right
to say that to me.

586
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,237
Thanks to my mother
acting as your shadow singer,

587
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:26,669
you were able to finish
your 20th anniversary concert well.

588
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:30,024
The song my mom sang that day
was also "Una Voce Poco Fa".

589
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:31,140
Do you remember?

590
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,299
Perfect pitch and high F.

591
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:36,315
You received high praise
saying it exceeded your talents...

592
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:38,199
at the peak of your career.

593
00:34:40,317 --> 00:34:41,457
Are you crazy?

594
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:44,541
How could you be so brazen and say that?

595
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:47,606
There's no way to beat you
unless I am brazen.

596
00:34:48,344 --> 00:34:50,823
But I guess the skies are on my side.

597
00:34:51,229 --> 00:34:54,270
I even got a chance to be praised
by a world-renowned conductor.

598
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,201
This is all thanks to you.

599
00:34:58,503 --> 00:34:59,653
Shut your mouth.

600
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:05,089
I'm not a kid anymore.

601
00:35:05,694 --> 00:35:09,032
So don't be so confident anymore.

602
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:13,603
The truth will eventually reveal itself.

603
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:17,999
Bae Ro Na...

604
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,310
Bae Ro Na!

605
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:22,112
What an audacious child.

606
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:25,264
I won't let this go.

607
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:32,721
Eun Byeol.

608
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:38,172
You don't need to be disappointed.

609
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:40,670
I'll set up another meeting with Clark.

610
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,234
Why would I be disappointed?

611
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:44,076
Ro Na can't beat me anyway.

612
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:47,039
How can a high school graduate
beat a Seoul University of Music student?

613
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,546
I'm going to go at my own pace.

614
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:53,448
I'll show them
how good I am during the auditions.

615
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:56,410
You're truly incredible, Eun Byeol.

616
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,846
I was worried that you'd be disappointed.

617
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:00,956
I'm going to see Clark off.

618
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:02,398
Don't worry about me.

619
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:18,175
Ms. Jin. It's me. Can we meet tonight?

620
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:31,886
Thank you for inviting me to Korea.

621
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:33,591
It's my honour.

622
00:36:34,346 --> 00:36:35,875
Do you like your hotel?

623
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:37,026
Yes.

624
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:39,679
If anything is uncomfortable,
or if you need anything,

625
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:41,198
feel free to tell me any time.

626
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:42,198
Okay.

627
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:51,370
Oh, right.
Did you visit Cheong A Arts Center?

628
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,630
The size and facilities were amazing.

629
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,205
I'm excited to perform there.

630
00:36:56,735 --> 00:37:00,287
Oh, and I met a talented vocalist there.

631
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:02,633
Her voice was beautiful,

632
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:05,587
and she had
an incredibly wide vocal range.

633
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:09,870
I think I know who she is.

634
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,474
Is that so?

635
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:13,939
She was so impressive...

636
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:16,648
that I recommended her
for the Cheong A auditions.

637
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:21,549
To be honest,
I have a favour to ask on her behalf.

638
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,892
That is why I asked to meet you today.

639
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,961
Yes, I'm on my way up.

640
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:32,356
Okay. I'll see you at the community.

641
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,160
I guess you're here to meet Eun Byeol.

642
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:39,760
You avoided me
despite all my attempts to call you,

643
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:41,305
and yet I meet you here.

644
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:44,031
I have nothing to say to a kid like you.

645
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,345
You know why my mom died, don't you?

646
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,852
Are you hiding it for Eun Byeol's sake?

647
00:37:51,932 --> 00:37:54,256
Or are you trying
to cover up your own crimes?

648
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:57,274
Can you move?
As you can see, I'm very busy.

649
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,920
Don't run away like a coward and tell me!

650
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,467
What on earth happened that night?

651
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:03,040
What are you doing?
Do you know how priceless this is?

652
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,228
My gosh!

653
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:14,917
Hey. I'm warning you.

654
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:17,166
Don't try to get in the way of Eun Byeol.

655
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:19,454
Eun Byeol is as pure as snow.

656
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,817
The likes of you
can't dare to step on or dirty her.

657
00:38:21,897 --> 00:38:24,951
I'm going to put my life on the line
to protect her. Got it?

658
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:41,897
Why did you get me so little?

659
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:45,023
Well...
It's hard to get this medicine these days.

660
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:48,765
I can't make it to the auditions
with this much.

661
00:38:49,921 --> 00:38:52,673
If I don't take my medicine,
I get severe headaches,

662
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:56,340
feel nauseated, and feel like
the ground is sinking beneath me.

663
00:38:57,659 --> 00:38:59,067
Get me more.

664
00:38:59,148 --> 00:39:01,042
This is a prescribed drug,
so I can't get...

665
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:03,684
So are you saying
you can't get me anymore?

666
00:39:04,102 --> 00:39:06,007
Are you saying
you're going to abandon me, too?

667
00:39:06,087 --> 00:39:09,404
You're the only one I can ask about this.

668
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:12,637
Okay. I understand.
I'll try my best to get some more.

669
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,901
Don't worry about anything else
and focus on your audition.

670
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,505
Bae Ro Na is auditioning too.

671
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:23,417
Are you worried about her?

672
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:25,039
How should I help you?

673
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,585
You don't need to help.

674
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,220
I'm going to beat her anyway.

675
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:32,092
I came out during my lesson.

676
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:34,235
I need to go back,
or my mom will get suspicious.

677
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:35,586
Wait, Eun Byeol.

678
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,915
I want to live with you again.

679
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:42,770
Without you, I can't sleep,

680
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,534
I can't eat,
and life just isn't fun anymore.

681
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:48,400
You can't live with that woman, Ms. Cheon.

682
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,237
That woman doesn't love you.

683
00:39:50,317 --> 00:39:53,259
She will continue to harass you
and make your life miserable.

684
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,962
The only person in this world
who loves you unconditionally is me.

685
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,419
You know that.

686
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:12,130
Eun Byeol! What's wrong, Eun Byeol?

687
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,206
Are you okay? Eun Byeol!

688
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,551
Eun Byeol. Do you think you can walk?

689
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,711
Did you overwork yourself
preparing for the audition?

690
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:23,301
Ms. Jin. When did you get here?

691
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:26,314
Do you know how long I waited for you?

692
00:40:26,394 --> 00:40:28,492
What took you so long?

693
00:40:29,348 --> 00:40:31,130
Did you bring the drug?

694
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,318
I just gave it to you. There.

695
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:41,315
When did I get it?

696
00:40:41,395 --> 00:40:44,313
Please be on time, will you?

697
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:47,040
I couldn't study at all today
because of you.

698
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,921
What will you do
if I can't get into college?

699
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,529
You're so annoying.

700
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:54,669
Eun Byeol!

701
00:40:55,096 --> 00:40:57,366
Eun Byeol, talk to me.

702
00:40:57,446 --> 00:40:59,831
What's wrong with you? Eun Byeol!

703
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:07,175
She's a total mess.
Why hasn't Dan Tae called?

704
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:15,207
(Jin Bun Hong)

705
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:16,980
What's her problem?

706
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:19,004
The person you have reached...

707
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:21,156
You're screening my calls, is that it?

708
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:26,484
You shouldn't do this to me.

709
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:29,352
You want to get rid of me already?

710
00:41:34,106 --> 00:41:35,290
I'm sorry, sir.

711
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:54,806
What do you think you're doing?

712
00:41:54,886 --> 00:41:57,125
Why are you back here? I said to stay low.

713
00:41:57,686 --> 00:41:59,323
So why did you screen my call?

714
00:41:59,403 --> 00:42:02,428
Would you pick up if you were me?
You act like a total psycho.

715
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:05,941
Whatever. I need money.

716
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:09,618
I gave you money not long ago.
Did you spend it all already?

717
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,907
Like you gave me so much.

718
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:17,359
Should I tell Su Ryeon
that you killed Yoon Hee?

719
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:20,129
Or should I go
and tell the cops everything?

720
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:22,267
How many times must I tell you?
I didn't kill her.

721
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:24,049
Should I make sure
you can't even eat with that mouth?

722
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:26,139
Who cares whether or not you killed her?

723
00:42:26,237 --> 00:42:28,784
I just have to make Su Ryeon believe
you did.

724
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,283
I'll send the money with Mr. Cho.

725
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:35,484
Don't do anything rash. Stay low.

726
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:37,381
Do as I say. Please.

727
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:39,023
Don't touch me.

728
00:42:39,103 --> 00:42:41,703
Jerks like you make me sick.

729
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:44,527
I'll never see you as a man
even if it kills me,

730
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:48,235
so if you're interested in me,
wake up and smell the coffee.

731
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:12,110
It was you...

732
00:43:13,742 --> 00:43:15,007
after all.

733
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:34,696
Why did you do it?

734
00:43:35,544 --> 00:43:37,476
Why did you do it? Why?

735
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,000
How can I ever face Ro Na again?

736
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:46,561
I need to die, don't I?

737
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:52,565
Must I remove all of my cursed blood...

738
00:43:53,288 --> 00:43:56,170
to atone for my sins
for being born your son?

739
00:44:55,097 --> 00:44:56,164
Put that down...

740
00:44:57,018 --> 00:44:59,202
before I break your arm.

741
00:45:06,195 --> 00:45:07,433
Who are you?

742
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:14,356
James.

743
00:45:16,453 --> 00:45:18,698
She's Logan's grandmother.

744
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:22,530
It's nice to meet you.

745
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,732
I apologize for my rudeness.
I didn't know you were coming.

746
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:28,317
What happened?

747
00:45:29,517 --> 00:45:31,774
Have you still not found Logan?

748
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,997
It has been over six months already.

749
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:37,839
Have you been deceiving us?

750
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,087
The police said...

751
00:45:40,794 --> 00:45:44,278
the bones they found in the car
were from an animal, not a person.

752
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:45,499
Logan is alive.

753
00:45:46,806 --> 00:45:50,201
You know better than I do
that he wouldn't die that easily.

754
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,276
Then why can't you find him?

755
00:45:57,957 --> 00:45:59,472
Have you grown weary already?

756
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:03,809
I even risked my life...

757
00:46:04,357 --> 00:46:07,613
and moved into Joo Dan Tae's home
to keep my promise to Logan.

758
00:46:08,258 --> 00:46:10,218
I'm fine stopping here.

759
00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:12,508
I can just kill Dan Tae...

760
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:14,664
and leave, that's all.

761
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:17,731
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

762
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,021
I understand.

763
00:46:21,464 --> 00:46:23,892
I'm having Joo Dan Tae's people
followed closely,

764
00:46:23,972 --> 00:46:25,605
so we'll find something soon.

765
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:27,031
Please be patient.

766
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,112
We can't do anything rash.
He may retaliate.

767
00:46:31,192 --> 00:46:34,999
You are the only person...

768
00:46:35,481 --> 00:46:37,146
our family can trust.

769
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,305
Mr. Hong. Bring it.

770
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:42,487
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

771
00:46:44,811 --> 00:46:46,595
Use it to pay for everything.

772
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:51,971
If we can find Logan,
we don't mind spending our entire fortune.

773
00:46:58,707 --> 00:47:02,823
Logan must be alive.

774
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:04,868
Yes, ma'am.

775
00:47:07,427 --> 00:47:08,601
Let's go.

776
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:40,067
That's enough.

777
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:42,447
Thank you.

778
00:47:46,257 --> 00:47:47,516
Oh, my gosh.

779
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:51,688
What are you doing?
What if someone sees you?

780
00:47:52,198 --> 00:47:53,275
Who cares?

781
00:47:53,726 --> 00:47:56,682
People will only find out
that we have a secret relationship.

782
00:47:56,762 --> 00:47:58,277
That's not so bad.

783
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,023
Behave. Do you want to die?

784
00:48:02,732 --> 00:48:04,293
Hello.

785
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:19,095
Stop being stupid.
Tell me why you're here.

786
00:48:19,175 --> 00:48:20,953
Logan's family came to see me.

787
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:22,746
What did they say?

788
00:48:23,382 --> 00:48:24,805
They said if I find Logan,

789
00:48:25,117 --> 00:48:27,627
they're willing to give me
their entire fortune.

790
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:29,261
I thought about it,

791
00:48:31,037 --> 00:48:33,165
and I got the short end of the deal.

792
00:48:33,553 --> 00:48:36,225
You hide behind me and don't do anything.

793
00:48:36,305 --> 00:48:39,535
You want to just sit there
and take tens of billions of dollars?

794
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:44,493
I'm the one doing everything I can
to save Logan.

795
00:48:44,573 --> 00:48:46,886
Logan's body's value
changes drastically...

796
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,407
based on whether or not he's alive.

797
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:52,629
I know you want me
to take the bullets for you.

798
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:54,199
If things go south,

799
00:48:54,904 --> 00:48:56,371
I'll be the only one being punished.

800
00:48:56,451 --> 00:48:59,202
So pray hard that Logan survives.

801
00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:01,561
Once I get the money from James,

802
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:03,926
I'll give you exactly half.

803
00:49:04,284 --> 00:49:06,811
If it's 10 billion, you get five.
If it's 20 billion, you get 10.

804
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:08,030
Okay?

805
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:09,728
Get lost.

806
00:49:15,215 --> 00:49:17,340
How dare you threaten me?

807
00:49:27,057 --> 00:49:29,787
You're an amusing woman, Seo Jin.

808
00:49:42,977 --> 00:49:45,699
Why are you working so hard to look good?

809
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:48,055
You're blindingly beautiful already.

810
00:49:48,135 --> 00:49:49,294
Gosh.

811
00:49:49,888 --> 00:49:52,794
I'm going golfing
with Minister Kang's wife.

812
00:49:52,874 --> 00:49:56,137
Do you know how busy I've been,
being a supportive wife?

813
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:58,799
What is this though?

814
00:49:59,342 --> 00:50:01,350
A gift for the wives.

815
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:04,709
It's made from red ginseng,
which is good for the skin.

816
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:07,886
Don't you think it's perfect
for those fancy wives?

817
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,770
That's good. Perfect.

818
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,095
They're deciding
on the construction today.

819
00:50:13,395 --> 00:50:14,975
We need to try hard.

820
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:16,990
Our son got into Seoul University.

821
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,968
Our business is doing well.

822
00:50:19,048 --> 00:50:20,980
And you're so pretty.

823
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:24,242
How could everything go so well this year?

824
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:27,446
I'm getting nervous
because we're so lucky.

825
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:29,372
Don't be nervous.

826
00:50:29,452 --> 00:50:31,255
Just enjoy yourself.

827
00:50:31,335 --> 00:50:33,896
Our family's motto
is "alternate joy and grief".

828
00:50:34,377 --> 00:50:37,096
How do I look? Does my face shine?

829
00:50:37,176 --> 00:50:41,540
Just so I can be your ideal wife,
I bought new clothes, new handbags,

830
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,260
and even a new car!

831
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,517
Well done. You did so well.

832
00:50:46,597 --> 00:50:49,596
You are so magnanimous.

833
00:50:49,676 --> 00:50:52,333
But you can't swap out your husband, okay?

834
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:54,755
I'm not like Ms. Cheon.

835
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:06,677
What brings you here?

836
00:51:06,757 --> 00:51:08,970
In the VIP room of my establishment,

837
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:12,388
someone set up some hidden cameras.

838
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:15,530
I don't want to be involved
in such matters,

839
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,080
so I came right over.

840
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:25,068
It was inside a decoration,
and I didn't notice it.

841
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,305
Please take a look.

842
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:33,666
Come on! Dance!

843
00:51:33,746 --> 00:51:36,658
This is Kang Sin Mo,
the Minister of Education.

844
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,346
Come on!

845
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:42,021
This just came in.

846
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:45,560
Minister of Education Kang Sin Mo
is suspected of accepting a large bribe...

847
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,169
in return for promising
to move prestigious schools...

848
00:51:48,249 --> 00:51:50,732
from Gangnam's School District Eight
to Cheonsoo District,

849
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,783
and prosecutors are looking into it.

850
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:54,469
The Ministries of Land and Education...

851
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:57,216
will launch a joint inspection
on the overheating...

852
00:51:57,296 --> 00:51:59,443
of investments in Cheonsoo District
caused by...

853
00:51:59,523 --> 00:52:01,340
-the rumoured school moves.
-Kyu Jin is here.

854
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,269
Cheonsoo District's redevelopment plan...

855
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:04,724
-What's wrong?
-will be re-evaluated.

856
00:52:04,804 --> 00:52:06,562
Is it a celebrity scandal?

857
00:52:06,642 --> 00:52:10,535
Minister Kang's recent incident
gathered the public's interest,

858
00:52:10,615 --> 00:52:13,136
and the redevelopment project
is also a big event,

859
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:16,069
-Minister Kang.
-so to ensure it goes smoothly.

860
00:52:16,149 --> 00:52:18,044
-What's going on?
-They will investigate thoroughly.

861
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:19,387
Who was it?

862
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:20,743
Who tattled?

863
00:52:20,823 --> 00:52:22,788
I'll kill any traitor!

864
00:52:22,868 --> 00:52:24,146
It wasn't me.

865
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:26,458
It obviously wasn't me.

866
00:52:26,538 --> 00:52:29,126
Chairman Joo. What's going on?

867
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:32,588
Can we not host
any of the prestigious schools?

868
00:52:33,396 --> 00:52:35,597
(Education Organizations
Demand Minister Kang's Apology)

869
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:38,599
The construction company
was just announced.

870
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:39,961
Who got the deal?

871
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,410
It's obviously Cheong A, right?

872
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,583
The thing is...

873
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:43,892
Dohae Construction got it.

874
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,974
What's this?

875
00:52:56,054 --> 00:52:57,979
Did the subcontractors hear already?

876
00:52:58,059 --> 00:52:59,974
They'll want us to cough up
what they gave us!

877
00:53:00,054 --> 00:53:01,611
What should I do?

878
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:02,873
It's the bank manager.

879
00:53:02,953 --> 00:53:04,683
We have to pay back the first chunk
of the loan today.

880
00:53:04,763 --> 00:53:07,093
The loan sharks
seem to have found out too.

881
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,811
What happened? What's going on?

882
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:14,294
How did this happen?

883
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:16,135
Why won't you answer your phones?

884
00:53:16,215 --> 00:53:17,453
What happened?

885
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:20,532
We trusted you
and gave you illegal loans!

886
00:53:20,612 --> 00:53:21,994
I'm about to lose my job now!

887
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,304
Forget everything else.

888
00:53:23,384 --> 00:53:26,912
Pay me back first,
before I level this building!

889
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:28,460
Before they go bankrupt,

890
00:53:28,848 --> 00:53:30,953
take anything with any value at all!

891
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:33,297
What can we take? The cups.

892
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,752
-Let go.
-This is mine.

893
00:53:34,832 --> 00:53:36,427
Let's take that.

894
00:53:38,355 --> 00:53:40,186
Take what you can!

895
00:53:42,168 --> 00:53:43,440
What's that?

896
00:53:44,274 --> 00:53:45,951
Let go of me!

897
00:53:46,462 --> 00:53:48,270
Let go!

898
00:53:49,366 --> 00:53:52,704
I'm taking what I owe!

899
00:53:58,815 --> 00:54:01,825
Didn't you say
you were sure you'd get the deal?

900
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,453
You took a fortune from Cheong A Group.

901
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,537
No harm came to you.

902
00:54:06,783 --> 00:54:09,021
I gave you my shares. Isn't that enough?

903
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:11,644
What about our plummeting stock prices?

904
00:54:11,724 --> 00:54:13,427
We lost 500 million dollars today.

905
00:54:13,507 --> 00:54:15,043
What will you do about that?

906
00:54:15,814 --> 00:54:20,240
Did the great Cheong A Construction
lose out to Dohae Construction?

907
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,658
They were a small company
unable to take a project this big.

908
00:54:25,196 --> 00:54:27,922
So what if they are? They got the deal.

909
00:54:30,043 --> 00:54:31,426
I can clean this up.

910
00:54:32,076 --> 00:54:34,044
I'll meet with their representative.

911
00:54:34,124 --> 00:54:36,366
I'll do whatever it takes
to take the deal back.

912
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:37,908
If I can't do that,

913
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:40,597
I'll buy Dohae Construction.

914
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:43,053
With what money?

915
00:54:43,969 --> 00:54:47,010
You can't touch a single cent!

916
00:54:47,408 --> 00:54:50,387
Why don't you just hand over
all your shares and get lost?

917
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:53,259
Then I might help you somehow.

(Cheong A Group)

919
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:19,970
Chairman Joo.

920
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:23,794
Didn't we really just lose everything?

921
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:27,865
I put so much into this project!

922
00:55:27,945 --> 00:55:30,028
Didn't you take more than you put in?

923
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:33,526
Are you insane?
You're the spy, aren't you?

924
00:55:33,858 --> 00:55:35,560
Come over here.

925
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,934
It's not the time for that!

926
00:55:39,347 --> 00:55:40,996
It's not over yet.

927
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:43,733
Dohae Construction
must pay 100 million dollars...

928
00:55:43,813 --> 00:55:46,007
within the week to secure the contract.

929
00:55:46,557 --> 00:55:48,138
We just have to make them give up.

930
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:49,952
If we can't,

931
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:52,652
our money is gone forever.

932
00:55:52,995 --> 00:55:54,208
That can never happen.

933
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:56,181
Not after all I did to get here.

934
00:55:56,923 --> 00:55:58,869
Arrange a meeting with Dohae's CEO.

935
00:55:58,949 --> 00:56:00,643
Drag him by the collar if you must.

936
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:03,579
I'll get the money together.

937
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:06,262
Where will you go to do that?

938
00:56:06,342 --> 00:56:08,414
Even the loan sharks won't talk to you.

939
00:56:09,921 --> 00:56:10,952
There's someone.

940
00:56:12,374 --> 00:56:13,621
Just one person.

(Haeyeon Group)

942
00:56:20,058 --> 00:56:23,321
I didn't think you'd ask to see me first.

943
00:56:24,439 --> 00:56:26,516
I came to ask for some cash.

944
00:56:26,596 --> 00:56:27,935
I'm in...

00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:32,376
-a tight spot.
-I heard about that.

Dohae Construction

You got beat by a tiny company.

948

With your help, I can get back up.

949

951
00:56:57,587 --> 00:56:58,631

I don't need any interest.

This is the problem with listed companies.

I'll take your penthouse, then.

It's just a formality, so don't worry.

No, it's fine.

970
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:12,214
I should get going too.

971
00:58:13,162 --> 00:58:14,367
Thanks for your help.

972
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,935
He must be in a bind...

973
00:58:37,245 --> 00:58:38,962
if he thought of taking my money.

974
00:58:39,723 --> 00:58:42,311
Oh, right. Is it not my money?

975
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:46,095
I'll send you what he asked for.

976
00:58:46,175 --> 00:58:47,564
Thank you, Chairman Song.

977
00:58:47,644 --> 00:58:49,831
Come to me whenever you need something.

978
00:58:49,911 --> 00:58:52,017
You could do with a lot of help.

979
00:58:52,097 --> 00:58:54,744
I will do anything for Ms. Jincheon.

980
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,714
Sir, your guest is here.

981
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:04,903
Let her in.

982
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,223
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cheong A's Chairman Joo Dan Tae.

983
00:59:22,081 --> 00:59:24,200
Why are you here?

984
00:59:27,046 --> 00:59:28,239
It can't be.

985
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:29,420
That's right.

986
00:59:30,558 --> 00:59:33,649
The lobbyist of Dohae Constructio
you've been desperate to find.

987
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,421
-That's me.
-What?

988
00:59:40,501 --> 00:59:42,433
Let me hear what you have to say.

989
00:59:42,513 --> 00:59:43,954
What are you doing?

990
00:59:44,262 --> 00:59:47,080
What have you been doing behind my back?

991
00:59:48,102 --> 00:59:49,943
Are you the one
who did that to Minister Kang?

992
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:53,141
You... What is your relation
with Dohae Construction?

993
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:58,104
Wasn't Dohae's construction rights
what you wanted?

994
00:59:58,184 --> 01:00:00,936
It'd barely be enough
if you went on your knees and begged.

995
01:00:01,677 --> 01:00:03,308
Let alone your current attitude.

996
01:00:03,388 --> 01:00:05,870
I know you've poured
in an astronomical amount of money...

997
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,197
to Cheonsoo District.

998
01:00:09,547 --> 01:00:11,047
You're okay with blowing that up?

999
01:00:13,574 --> 01:00:14,808
Do you want to die?

1000
01:00:14,888 --> 01:00:17,121
Are you begging me to kill you or what?

1001
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:18,752
Give me the construction rights.

1002
01:00:18,832 --> 01:00:21,005
I won't. Why would I?

1003
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,383
I will watch you fail.

1004
01:00:24,463 --> 01:00:27,373
Give up. You don't even have Logan.

1005
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:29,721
Do you think you can beat me?

1006
01:00:29,801 --> 01:00:30,978
Shut up!

1007
01:00:34,121 --> 01:00:36,278
How dare you say his name?

1008
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:38,074
Why are you so sensitive?

1009
01:00:38,154 --> 01:00:40,104
He died because he had to.

1010
01:00:40,184 --> 01:00:42,118
I still remember it as clear as day.

1011
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:44,715
The creepy metal sound.

1012
01:00:45,238 --> 01:00:47,368
The sound of your handcuffs.

1013
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:53,528
You really want to die, don't you?

1014

1018
01:02:02,072 --> 01:02:04,906
Who are you, mister? What are you doing?

1019
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:10,011
No! My mom and sister are sleeping!

1020
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:24,872
I warned you I'd bulldoze it today.

1021
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:29,742
These homeless beggars.

1022
01:02:30,686 --> 01:02:32,094
Bulldoze it.

Hey!

01:02:37,557 --> 01:02:40,822
No! My mom and sister are still in there!

1026
01:02:40,902 --> 01:02:42,876
Let go of me!

1027
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:48,079
Mom! Jun Hee! Come out!

1028
01:02:48,768 --> 01:02:51,065
Don't tear down my house!

1029
01:02:51,145 --> 01:02:54,549
Who are you to destroy my house?

1030
01:02:54,629 --> 01:02:56,940
This little beggar.

1031
01:03:00,172 --> 01:03:02,496
Mom! Jun Hee!

1032
01:03:04,897 --> 01:03:08,850
Hey. Don't report this
to the chairman of Simoon Construction.

1033
01:03:09,722 --> 01:03:11,017
Keep it a secret.

1034
01:03:14,103 --> 01:03:15,679
Mom! Jun Hee!

1035
01:03:25,007 --> 01:03:27,012
Mom!

1036
01:03:27,623 --> 01:03:28,715
Jun Ki.

1037
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:31,453
Jun Ki!

1038
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:34,465
You must live.

1039
01:03:35,205 --> 01:03:38,372
Make lots of money, be successful,

1040
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:43,041

1041
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:47,221
You must live...

1042
01:03:48,717 --> 01:03:50,397
as a rich man.

1043
01:03:50,477 --> 01:03:53,009
No. No, mom.

1044
01:03:53,089 --> 01:03:54,628
Don't die.

1045
01:03:55,921 --> 01:03:58,613
You can't die and leave me all alone.

1046

Jun Hee, wake up.

1047
01:04:06,545 --> 01:04:08,410
Please breathe.

1050
01:04:29,255 --> 01:04:30,348
Mom.

1051
01:04:33,479 --> 01:04:34,607
Mom!

1052
01:04:37,028 --> 01:04:38,163
No!

1053
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:48,821
What is it?

1054
01:04:50,935 --> 01:04:52,558
What is it?

1055
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:00,645
Who are you?

1056

Who are you?

1057
01:05:14,233 --> 01:05:15,510
Show yourself!

1058
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:35,232
Are you trying to kill me?

1059
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:38,224
Why? Are you scared?

1060
01:05:38,304 --> 01:05:41,350
I'll give you one last chance
to repent before you go to the fiery pit.

1061
01:05:42,584 --> 01:05:43,788
Stop it!

1062
01:05:45,037 --> 01:05:47,104
Confess that you killed Yoon Hee.

1063
01:05:47,607 --> 01:05:49,587
Admit you killed Logan!

1064
01:05:52,497 --> 01:05:54,588
You crazy witch!

1065
01:06:03,235 --> 01:06:04,809
My goodness...

1066
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:22,049
Even until the very end,
you have no conscience.

1067
01:06:23,582 --> 01:06:25,242
You are not worth living.

1068
01:06:26,314 --> 01:06:28,810
I'll stop you from doing anything more
from now on.

1069
01:06:29,469 --> 01:06:31,530
Shim Su Ryeon. You crazy...

1070
01:06:33,873 --> 01:06:35,112
Stop it!

1071
01:06:41,371 --> 01:06:42,881
-Hurry up!
-Seok Hoon!

1072
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:07,849
What have you been doing...

1073
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:09,670
that made mom act like that?

1074
01:07:10,802 --> 01:07:12,928
I didn't do anything.

1075
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:17,251
Your mom is just blaming me
because Oh Yoon Hee and Logan died.

1076
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:18,973
I did nothing wrong.

1077
01:07:23,307 --> 01:07:24,505
Anyway,

1078
01:07:25,348 --> 01:07:27,432
I thought you just hated me.

1079
01:07:27,748 --> 01:07:30,482
But you can't deny your own blood,
can you?

1080
01:07:30,896 --> 01:07:33,538
That's why you came to save me, right?

1081
01:07:33,618 --> 01:07:35,871
I didn't save you because I like you.

1082
01:07:36,405 --> 01:07:38,889
I just couldn't let mom kill you.

1083
01:07:41,028 --> 01:07:43,124
You can be more honest.

1084
01:07:43,204 --> 01:07:46,515
By nature, you and your mother
don't suit one another,

1085
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:47,960
because you're my son.

1086
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,632
How could you possibly get along
with Shim Su Ryeon?

1087
01:07:50,712 --> 01:07:53,298
That woman hates you
just as much as she hates me.

1088
01:07:53,378 --> 01:07:55,739
Every time she sees you,
she'll be reminded of me.

1089
01:07:55,819 --> 01:07:57,918
Do you think she could love you as a son?

1090
01:08:03,031 --> 01:08:04,107
Look.

1091
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:08,085
Stop deceiving yourself.

1092
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,070
Admit that I'm your father.

1093
01:08:10,415 --> 01:08:14,156
Then I can give you anything.

1094
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:19,862
Promise me one thing.

1095
01:08:19,942 --> 01:08:22,787
Promise you will never hurt mom.

1096
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:23,960
Then...

1097
01:08:24,478 --> 01:08:26,885
I won't push you any longer.

1098
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:29,147
I'll live the life...

1099
01:08:31,477 --> 01:08:32,634
you want me to.

1100
01:08:34,171 --> 01:08:35,285
Fine.

1101
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:37,912
I promise you.

1102
01:08:38,562 --> 01:08:40,191
Come work for me.

1103
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:42,785
Take time off that measly school of yours.

1104
01:09:06,177 --> 01:09:08,238
These are drugs that Ms. Kim had.

1105
01:09:08,886 --> 01:09:11,079
It seemed like
she was going to give them to Eun Byeol.

1106
01:09:12,038 --> 01:09:14,858
Can you help me find out
what drugs are they?

1107
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:17,079
I will.

1108
01:09:19,193 --> 01:09:21,551
I'll be auditioning for Cheong A.

1109
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:24,738
Really? Congratulations.

1110
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:28,000
You can endure it, right?

1111
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:31,715
I want to be acknowledged for my talents
no matter what.

1112
01:09:32,236 --> 01:09:36,101
If I want to restore my mom's honour,
that's the only thing I can do.

1113
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,193
Seok Hoon.

1114
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:44,662
Haven't you gone to school yet?

1115
01:09:50,087 --> 01:09:51,697
I'm taking time off from school.

1116
01:09:51,777 --> 01:09:53,743
I thought I'd get busy
once I started working.

1117
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,883
You're taking time off? Why?

1118
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:57,670
Seok Hoon.

1119
01:09:59,727 --> 01:10:01,332
Did something happen to Seok Hoon?

1120
01:10:01,845 --> 01:10:03,786
What kind of job is he starting?

1121
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,791
He wants to work for his dad's company.

1122
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:07,215
He wants to learn the business.

1123
01:10:07,295 --> 01:10:09,642
What? Seok Hoon said that?

1124
01:10:12,368 --> 01:10:13,620
Seok Hoon.

1125
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:14,921
Stop right there.

1126
01:10:15,642 --> 01:10:16,715
Don't come near me.

1127
01:10:17,617 --> 01:10:19,052
Come to your senses.

1128
01:10:19,464 --> 01:10:20,886
Why are you doing this too?

1129
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:23,912
You should stay by your mom's side.

1130
01:10:26,813 --> 01:10:28,903
I've finally come to my senses.

1131
01:10:29,374 --> 01:10:30,998
I was being childish all this time.

1132
01:10:31,585 --> 01:10:35,570
I was mistaken into thinking
I could do something for you and my mom.

1133
01:10:38,759 --> 01:10:41,505
But it turns out
I'm not all that different from my dad.

1134
01:10:42,227 --> 01:10:44,903
My life is more important to me
than anyone else's.

1135
01:10:46,064 --> 01:10:48,017
Why are you acting like this
all of a sudden?

1136
01:10:49,347 --> 01:10:51,330
We would never work anyway.

1137
01:10:51,924 --> 01:10:55,117
My dad tried to kill you,
so what could we do?

1138
01:10:58,297 --> 01:10:59,496
Let's break up.

1139
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:02,893
I can't do this anymore.

1140
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:07,283
Are you being serious?

1141
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:12,388
Yes, I'm being serious.

1142
01:11:13,382 --> 01:11:15,155
I'm not going to acknowledge you
from now on,

1143
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:17,009
and I'm not going to help you
if something happens.

1144
01:11:17,089 --> 01:11:19,182
Let's go back
to when we didn't know each other.

1145
01:11:19,262 --> 01:11:22,579
I don't care if you resent me or hate me.

1146
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:25,726
I think that would be best for both of us.

1147
01:11:29,723 --> 01:11:30,883
Okay.

1148
01:11:32,438 --> 01:11:33,647
Let's do that...

1149
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,728
if that's what you want.

1150
01:11:38,364 --> 01:11:39,516
But Seok Hoon.

1151
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:43,013
It's not your fault.

1152
01:11:44,237 --> 01:11:47,540
We couldn't choose who our parents are.

1153
01:11:49,687 --> 01:11:50,776
So...

1154
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:54,491
you can put down any burdens you have.

1155
01:11:59,197 --> 01:12:00,509
I'm sorry.

1156
01:12:01,973 --> 01:12:03,165
Ro Na.

1157
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:06,140
I'm really sorry.

1158
01:12:46,075 --> 01:12:47,147
Hello?

1159
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:51,986
Yes. I'm her daughter.

1160
01:12:57,543 --> 01:12:59,123
We're Oh Yoon Hee's family.

1161
01:12:59,203 --> 01:13:00,412
We received a call and came.

1162
01:13:00,492 --> 01:13:02,462
You can speak with that detective
over there.

1163
01:13:02,542 --> 01:13:03,742
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1164
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,240
This belongs to Ms. Oh Yoon Hee, right?

1165
01:13:09,549 --> 01:13:11,322
Yes. That's my mom's watch.

1166
01:13:11,402 --> 01:13:12,696
Where did you find it?

1167
01:13:12,776 --> 01:13:16,280
This man found it while working
on the construction at the cliff.

1168
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,796
Thank you.

1169
01:13:21,161 --> 01:13:24,744
This is the watch that
my mom was wearing in her last moments,

1170
01:13:25,996 --> 01:13:27,463
but now it's broken.

1171
01:13:33,775 --> 01:13:34,959
Can you fix it?

1172
01:13:35,381 --> 01:13:37,154
It must be fixed.

1173
01:13:37,234 --> 01:13:40,090
The data might've been damaged
upon impact,

1174
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,570
but I'll try my best to restore it.

1175
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:52,189
The watch was able to record sounds.

1176
01:13:52,455 --> 01:13:53,957
It was restored well.

1177
01:13:58,445 --> 01:13:59,964
Somebody help me!

1178
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:07,133
Su Ryeon.

1179
01:14:07,974 --> 01:14:09,700
Su Ryeon, do you hear me?

1180
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,491
You must listen to this.

1181
01:14:13,652 --> 01:14:16,783
Su Ryeon, your daughter is alive.

1182
01:14:16,863 --> 01:14:18,880
Your biological daughter is alive.

1183
01:14:19,491 --> 01:14:21,558
Seok Kyung is your biological daughter.

1184
01:14:21,638 --> 01:14:25,156
Seok Kyung is Seol A's twin sister.

1185
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:28,906
I'm so sorry.

1186
01:14:29,754 --> 01:14:31,927
-Take care of my daughter...
-Seok Kyung...

1187
01:14:32,315 --> 01:14:34,473
-My dear Ro Na...
-Seok Kyung is my daughter?

1188
01:14:56,147 --> 01:14:58,175
Who are you?

1189
01:14:59,074 --> 01:15:00,679
Isn't this Italy?

1190
01:15:00,759 --> 01:15:03,126
What is she talking about? Italy?

1191
01:15:03,809 --> 01:15:06,520
-She said she's in Italy.
-What are you doing here?

1192
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:08,671
Who brought me here?

1193
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:10,111
Bring the person in charge.

1194
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,314
How dare you people...

1195
01:15:12,394 --> 01:15:14,168
Did you kidnap me or something?

1196
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:15,908
Do you know who my dad is?

1197
01:15:15,988 --> 01:15:18,435
Don't you know how to show respect?

1198
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:20,908
How dare you talk to me like that?

1199
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:24,617
(Clean body, Clean spirit)

1200
01:15:35,419 --> 01:15:36,780
Don't come near me.

1201
01:15:39,555 --> 01:15:42,804
If any of you lay a hand on me,
I'm going to kill all of you.

1202
01:15:44,178 --> 01:15:45,292
Don't come near me.

1203
01:15:45,996 --> 01:15:47,801
Don't come anywhere near me!

1204
01:15:48,622 --> 01:15:50,187
Don't come near me!

1205
01:16:28,659 --> 01:16:30,233
You have to wake up.

1206
01:16:30,911 --> 01:16:34,178
I'm going to save you no matter what.

1207
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:49,745
Logan. Do you hear me?

1208
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:52,604
If you can hear me, move your hand.

1209
01:16:52,684 --> 01:16:55,297
I'm Ha Yoon Chul. You can trust me.

1210
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:16,525
Su Ryeon...

1211
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:22,027
Can you bring Su Ryeon here?

1212
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:06,797
=The Penthouse 3=

1213
01:18:06,887 --> 01:18:10,016
We'll start the auditions for the resident
musicians for Cheong A Arts Center.

1214
01:18:10,096 --> 01:18:11,644
You want to reveal the truth
behind Ro Na's mom's death?

1215
01:18:11,724 --> 01:18:13,039
You have to remember it!

1216
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:15,295
If I have the blood of the demon,
I should become a demon too.

1217
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:17,124
Good job, Logan.

1218
01:18:17,204 --> 01:18:19,591
-You remember me, right?
-Is Joo Dan Tae done for now?

1219
01:18:19,671 --> 01:18:20,807
What did you do to Seok Kyung?

1220
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:22,571
Your biological daughter?
I'm going to kill her.

1221
01:18:22,651 --> 01:18:25,175
I'll make sure you won't lay a hand
on Seok Kyung ever again.

1222
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:27,520
I'm going to get rid
of Shim Su Ryeon forever.
