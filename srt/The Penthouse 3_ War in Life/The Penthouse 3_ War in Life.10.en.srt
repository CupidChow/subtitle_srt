00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:22,855
Your disguise was incredible.

3
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,535
It's simple. We'll use each other.

4
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,675
I'm the one doing everything I can
to save Logan.

5
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:27,933
He might not get through the night.

6
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:29,489
Then we can't wait any longer.

7
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:33,355
Proof that you killed Logan
will disappear forever.

8
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:35,334
We got rid of Su Ryeon, Logan Lee,

9
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:38,081
Jun Ki, and Yoon Chul
all in one fell swoop.

10
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,197
We make such great partners.

11
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:42,176
It's your turn now, Joo Dan Tae.

12
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:44,935
Turn the ambulance around.

13
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:47,658
How could you betray my trust like this?

14
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:49,954
Tell me
where that dashboard camera is now.

15
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,044
Yoon Hee!

16
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:55,509
So that Yoon Hee's death isn't in vain,
we must reveal the truth.

17
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,202
I will get revenge
that will devastate them.

Cheon Seo Jin!

21
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,740
How dare you mess with me?

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,468
Look who's talking.

23
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:20,774
Didn't we agree to bury that for good?

24
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:22,469
After asking me to get rid of Baek Jun Ki,

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,739
how could you stab me in the back
like this?

26
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:25,712
Ruining my ceremony...

27
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,607
would harm Cheong A Group too.
Don't you know that?

28
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,261
That's nonsense!

29
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,773
Why are you digging up the past then?

30
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:34,049
Do you have proof that I killed my father?

31
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,225
Get off me!

32
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:50,412
Did you kill your father
so you could become the director?

33
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:54,498
And then you cried so hard at his funeral?

34
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:57,513
-You give me the creeps.
-That's not true!

35
00:01:57,837 --> 00:01:59,525
I don't know what nonsense
Seok Kyung talked about,

36
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:01,600
but you can't accuse me without any proof.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,139
Seok Kyung? Is she aware of it too?

38
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,368
I know you heard it from her.

39
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:08,050
Stop putting on an act!

40
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,374
You're the one putting on an act.

41
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:12,335
Why did you send me
the footage of Logan's accident?

42
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,494
Are you really in the position to do that?

43
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:16,713
You hid him away
and kept him barely alive.

44
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:18,673
Do you want me
to tell his secretary everything?

45
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:21,441
Our cooperation is over.

46
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,786
Just hand over Cheong A Group
and get lost!

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,668
You're finally being honest.

48
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,069
I'll never give up on Cheong A Group.

49
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:31,578
I want a divorce.

50
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:33,334
Apply for a divorce right now!

51
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:36,336
As long as we sign
a confidentiality agreement, why not?

52
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,446
I'd love that, as long
as the stock prices aren't affected.

53
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:43,710
You're trash! I'll kill you!

54
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:54,990
A dogfight has begun,

55
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,413
just like you predicted.

56
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,820
Hey! Come here!

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,280
Don't be surprised.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,519
We're all here...

59
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:09,587
to punish Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

60
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,485
They blew up Logan's car,

61
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:14,515
locked him up, and assaulted him.

62
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:16,572
They also murdered Yoon Hee...

63
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,780
out of malice.

64
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:21,442
Ms. Oh died...

65
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,605
a horrible death.

66
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,042
The primary culprit was Joo Dan Tae.

67
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:33,754
The secondary culprit was Cheon Seo Jin.

68
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,046
In addition,

69
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:43,669
Joo Dan Tae inflicted further harm...

70
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:48,244
by damaging Ms. Oh's dead body
and mocking her death.

71
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,458
I disposed of Ms. Oh's body.

72
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,456
I'll do anything.
I'm even ready to go to prison.

73
00:04:02,513 --> 00:04:03,840
How could you do that?

74
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,257
Do you only care about your own family?

75
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:07,082
Don't you care whatever happens to Ro Na?

76
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,572
That's why he came here.

77
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:10,160
To right his wrong.

78
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:11,812
Stop!

79
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:15,517
There's no point in criticizing
and blaming each other.

80
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:17,533
We're all...

81
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,450
responsible for Ms. Oh's death.

82
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:23,073
Including myself.

83
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,629
If you really want to atone
for what you did to Yoon Hee,

84
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,572
please do as I say.

85
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:29,375
Let's just put them behind bars.

86
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:31,536
Let's send the dashboard cam footage
to the police.

87
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:34,890
I trust neither the police
nor the court anymore.

88
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,454
We must punish them ourselves.

89
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:43,645
First, we need to turn the two
against each other completely.

90
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,578

of the ground breaking ceremony...

Why did you let Joo Dan Tae
walk all over you...

97

98

It's finally beginning.

166
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:07,973
Let's move onto the next stage.

167
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,321
I've given the order.

168
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,268
Those two will be entertaining to watch.

169
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:14,603
Let go!

170
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:17,522
Let go!

171
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:19,584
Let go!

172
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:22,768
-Please stop, sir.
-Let go of me!

173
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:25,229
I'm going to kill that woman!

174
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:26,726
My sentiments exactly!

175
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:27,911
This is bad.

176
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:29,844
James just called.

177
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:32,525
Baek Jun Ki got away.

178
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,648
What?

179
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,089
He got away?

180
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:39,186
-What do you mean?
-Those losers.

181
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:41,836
They couldn't handle that little twerp
and lost him?

182
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,874
That's why their son died like that.

183
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,707
Send people out and find Jun Ki!

184
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:52,617
What?

185
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:09,557
What are you doing here?

186
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,201
I need to take you somewhere.

187
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:14,931
Do you have time?

188
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,287
Ms. Shim? What are you doing here?

189
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,300
I was worried
because I couldn't reach you.

190
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,925
I'm glad you're safe.

191
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:36,661
I have something to tell you.

192
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:39,604
It's very important.

193
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:43,543
Ro Na.

194
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:47,508
I think you should know the truth
behind your mom's death.

195
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:50,657
Wasn't it Mr. Joo Dan Tae?

196
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:52,232
It was.

197
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,002
But someone else killed her.

198
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:57,488
Who...

199
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:00,298
was it?

200
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:03,930
I'll punish everyone
who did that to your mom.

201
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,595
Everything has been prepared.

202
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:07,543
If you'll end up being hurt...

203
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:09,653
by it becoming public knowledge,

204
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:12,382
we can bury the truth.

205
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,047
No.

206
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:16,385
Tell everyone...

207
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:20,170
everything that happened to Mom.

208
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:23,975
The person
who pushed your mom off the cliff...

209
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:27,217
was Seo Jin.

210
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:36,733
Why? Why did Mom do that?

211
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:39,973
I don't understand.

212
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:44,399
You're saying Mom died
and left me behind just to save Eun Byeol.

213
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:47,221
I'm sure she didn't think she'd die.

214
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,333
She was wronged.

215
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,483
So why did she help a brat like her?

216
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:54,698
Who cares whether or not Eun Byeol dies?

217
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:56,085
Because she was a mom.

218
00:11:57,935 --> 00:12:01,231
Because she had experienced the pain
of losing her daughter.

219
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:06,355
She was Seo Jin's daughter,
whom she despised,

220
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,355
but I'm sure she had no choice
at that moment.

221
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:12,965
It was my fault.

222
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:17,434
I shouldn't have helped Eun Byeol
back then.

223
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:20,949
I should've ignored it.

224
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:25,962
If I hadn't hidden her in our home,
this never would've happened.

225
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:29,302
It was all my fault. It was me.

226
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:32,106
I'm so sorry.

227
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:39,549
Your mom died while trying to help me.

228
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,684
Mom.

229
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,618
Beef up security.

230
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:10,194
Jun Ki will come here first.

231
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:13,075
The boys are spread out
throughout Hera Palace.

232
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:17,466
Where's Eun Byeol?

233
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,741
She's in the studio.

234
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,524
Go get her right now.

235
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:23,912
If Jun Ki fled, it means he's after me.

236
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:26,416
Make sure Eun Byeol doesn't leave home
for a while.

237
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:27,459
Yes, ma'am.

238
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,903
Get the evidence you mentioned.

239
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:39,014
Evidence that Seo Jin had locked Logan up.

240
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:41,045
Are you sure it's in her home?

241
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,974
I told you that already.

242
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:44,375
If you're lying,

243
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:47,682
you'll rot in that mental hospital
in Japan until you die.

244
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:50,676
Someone who betrays a person once
is bound to do it again and again.

245
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:53,496
Are you talking about yourself?

246
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:56,121
I hear you're an expert
at stabbing people in the back.

247
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:05,292
What are you doing?

248
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:07,044
Wherever you may be, whatever you do,

249
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:09,430
your location will be transmitted to us.

250
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,201
So don't even think about running.

251
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:13,096
Must you go this far?

252
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:16,416
Why are you asking for my help
if you don't even trust me?

253
00:14:18,296 --> 00:14:19,590
Watch it.

254
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,180
If I catch you trying to pull something,
forget the mental hospital.

255
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,779
You'll end up six feet under.

256
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,568
We kept you alive for one reason.

257
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:31,617
Because you need a mad dog
to catch a mad dog.

258
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:33,286
I know that much.

259
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:37,773
That I need to work with you people
right now to stay alive.

260
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,719
Don't worry.

261
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,064
I'll do as you say.

262
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,421
What was that?

263
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:04,775
Hey.

264
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:06,428
Hey!

265
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,159
Hey!

266
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,518
What's going on? Hey!

267
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:15,871
Hey!

268
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:18,181
Where is everyone?

269
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:19,486
Hey!

270
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:27,908
Jun Ki.

271
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,043
How have you been, partner?

272
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:37,332
Did you forget your promise
to protect me no matter what?

273
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:41,856
Thanks to you,
even Logan's family knows who I am.

274
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,839
You're all I have left now.

275
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:52,174
Because I'm about to die right now.

276
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,538
Should I tell James everything?

277
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,292
That you made me do it?

278
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:05,273
What you did to Logan after abducting him,

279
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:06,786
the fact that you dumped it all
on Su Ryeon,

280
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,688
and that you got paid for it?

281
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,506
Should I tell him everything?

282
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:11,833
Go ahead.

283
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:14,105
Who would believe a mental patient
like you?

284
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:16,249
Didn't you run away
because no one believed you?

285
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,958
It stayed nicely hidden.

286
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:36,338
-What is that?
-What do you think?

287
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:40,225
It's evidence
that will prove my innocence.

288
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:43,143
I hid it in your living room...

289
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:45,925
because I felt like
it would be the safest here.

290
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:51,630
Why do you gamble if you're so bad at it?

291
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,840
What?

292
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,350
Do I look like someone
who runs errands like this?

293
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,286
What if someone sees me?

294
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,035
Didn't you know I was like this
when we joined forces?

295
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:07,161
You said you'd let me gamble
as much as I want for life.

296
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,354
I even fooled Logan and came to Korea.

297
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:11,682
You shouldn't make me worry about money.

298
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:15,342
Must I regret betraying the rich boy...

299
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,911
and teaming up with you already?

300
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:23,706
Why did you even record this?

301
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:25,436
I need a way out.

302
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:27,765
I can't trust a viper like you.

303
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:32,231
Since the day your secretary visited me
in the hotel in Japan,

304
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:36,064
every amicable conversation we had
in this house...

305
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:38,123
is right here.

306
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,574
Shouldn't this be enough to make...

307
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:44,192
Logan's family believe me?

308
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:46,637
No.

309
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:49,946
No, you can't. No, wait.

310
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,129
Wait.

311
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:53,792
I'm a fugitive because of you.

312
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:59,019
Do you have any idea
how tenacious James is?

313
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,857
Talk to me. I will compensate you.

314
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:04,691
I'll smuggle you to a place
Logan's family can never find you.

315
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:07,951
Those files. Give them to me.

316
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,310
Shall I fall for your tricks again?

317
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,302
Trust me.

318
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:15,986
I don't care for words.

319
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,010
Bring me 200 million dollars.

320
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,748
What?

321
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:22,201
For that much money,

322
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,736
I might think about it.

323
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:28,548
Won't I need that much to live
in hiding forever?

324
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,412
It's not a discussion.

325
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:32,364
Bring me the money in three days.

326
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:34,612
Miss the deadline...

327
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:39,099
and these recordings
will find their way to Logan's family.

328
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:40,678
Three days?

329
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:44,205
Do you think
200 million dollars is a joke?

330
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:48,494
You have just three days.

331
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:52,238
Do not talk back at me.

332
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:01,492
I should've killed him myself.

333
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,150
That little rat.

334
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:20,165
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

335
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:25,245
♪Wild rabbit, little wild rabbit♪

336
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:29,707
♪Where are you going to?♪

337
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:31,622
How did you get out?

338
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:37,425
♪Hop, hop, hopping on your way♪

339
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:41,105
I escaped, risking my life to do so.

340
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:44,563
I couldn't just die.
That would be too unfair.

341
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:47,566
I have a few cards of my own.

342
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:49,633
I didn't get to play them yet.

343
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,368
Joo Dan Tae disguised as an old man.

344
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:58,187
What was he doing in your secretary's car?

345
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:02,676
Isn't this concrete evidence
that you left a bomb in Logan's car?

346
00:20:03,654 --> 00:20:06,419
This photo would make James fly
right over...

347
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,275
from the US to get you.

348
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:13,571
He'd be furious that you lied to his face.

349
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,147
I doubt he'll let you live.

350
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:18,338
What is it you want?

351
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:22,067
What do you think it is?
Nothing's better than money.

352
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:24,119
Two hundred million dollars.

353
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:26,343
You only have three days.

354
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:28,618
If you're even a day late,

355
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:33,076
these photos will go straight to James.

356
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:35,936
I must give you 200 million dollars
to fund your gambling habit?

357
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:39,098
Cheon Seo Jin set it all up, not me.

358
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:40,749
I know that.

359
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:44,508
I just talked to her.

360
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:48,951
I showed her proof
that she had Logan locked up,

361
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,555
and she willingly offered
to buy my silence with 200 million.

362
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:58,042
She's so magnanimous.

363
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,458
Cheon Seo Jin said that?

364
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:03,616
So I'm weighing my options.

365
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:08,069
Should I send James the evidence...

366
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,460
or take the money
and disappear in silence?

367
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,953
What do you think I should do,

368
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:16,302
Jun Ki?

369
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:20,106
You'll blackmail us both
and get paid by both?

370
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:24,177
Don't you think 200 million dollars
is too little to compensate me...

371
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:25,884
for my life full of suffering?

372
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:31,859
Fine.

373
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:33,922
For 200 million dollars,

374
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:36,442
give me the original photos too.

375
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:38,211
One more thing.

376
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:41,694
Give me the evidence
that Seo Jin had Logan locked up.

377
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:43,832
I'll give you 300 million dollars.

378
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:50,483
Isn't it a sweet deal?

379
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:53,240
Logan's already dead.

380
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,925
Do you think that evidence...

381
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:57,053
will get James off your tail?

382
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,114
What do you say?

383
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:01,567
Why not do business with me?

384
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:09,404
I knew it.

385
00:22:34,582 --> 00:22:38,317
Two hundred million
from each person is 400 million.

386
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:41,771
On top of that,
an extra 300 million dollars?

387
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:44,688
That's a pretty good deal.

388
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:50,992
Wherever you may be, whatever you do,

389
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:53,292
your location will be transmitted to us.

390
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,032
So don't even think about running.

391
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
You got me wrong.

392
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:01,443
I'm not that easy to control.

393
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:27,856
I knew you'd try something like this.

394
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:30,564
You really aren't worth trusting.

395
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,180
Who are you?

396
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,254
Remember this.
Other than the chip in your arm,

397
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:38,135
there are eyes watching you everywhere.

398
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:56,098
What about Mr. Yoo?

399
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:57,638
What does he want to say?

400
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:01,371
What are you doing?

401
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:02,516
Ro Na.

402
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:05,157
I'm sorry.

403
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:10,557
I have wronged you terribly.

404
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:14,685
I took your mom...

405
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:18,715
Your mom...

406
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:23,955
Joo Dan Tae made my husband...

407
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:26,260
take your mom's body...

408
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:29,798
and dump it in a lake.

409
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:31,582
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

410
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,177
I deserve to die for it.

411
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,205
Does an apology...

412
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:46,205
make it go away?

413
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,122
You knew, didn't you, Ms. Kang?

414
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:53,515
Is that why you stayed with me
and looked after me?

415
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:56,928
Did you think you could make up
for what he did?

416
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:58,022
Did you?

417
00:24:58,102 --> 00:24:59,497
It wasn't because of that.

418
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:02,004
I can't forgive him
for what he did either.

419
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:03,735
But...

420
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:08,065
that was the only way to make up for it.

421
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:11,809
My wife didn't know anything.

422
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:14,442
She did nothing wrong. It was all me.

423
00:25:14,522 --> 00:25:15,874
I'll pay for what I did.

424
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:18,494
I'll reveal what Joo Dan Tae did,

425
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:22,223
and I'll turn myself in and pay the price.

426
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:27,025
Ro Na. I'm sorry.

427
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,663
How can you be so selfish?

428
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,846
How can you be so terrifying?

429
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:37,348
You give me the chills! You disgust me!

430
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:46,465
(Yoo Jenny)

431
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,195
The person you have reached...

432
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:56,179
What's going on? Why won't she pick up?

433
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,687
When did she go out?

434
00:26:02,506 --> 00:26:05,209
Mom, where did you go without me?

435
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,505
Did you see Ro Na?

436
00:26:06,585 --> 00:26:09,886
She left early to go to work.

437
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:11,789
At this hour?

438
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,535
Did she start another job
without telling me?

439
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:22,196
Pack up. It's time for us to go home.

440
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:24,458
Is Dad quitting Chairman Joo's company?

441
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:26,509
Yes. Soon.

442
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,604
So...

443
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:30,824
we can't live here anymore.

444
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:33,286
That doesn't mean we can't live together.

445
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:35,447
I enjoyed living with Ro Na.

446
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:38,141
Then who'll cook for Ro Na?

447
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:40,903
I will, of course.

448
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:44,301
Even if she says no, I will.

449
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:47,016
Even if she throws the plate
saying the food is bad.

450
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:49,170
Even if she flips the table
saying she doesn't want it.

451
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,289
I'll still act like a mom.

452
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:55,646
Mom.

453
00:26:58,015 --> 00:26:59,311
What's up with her?

454
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:08,377
Joo Seok Kyung.
It's your mom. Open the door.

455
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:09,680
Seok Kyung.

456
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:15,497
She was there just a moment ago.
Maybe she left for a second.

457
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,075
You're the one Seok Kyung wants to see
the most right now.

458
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,205
Just wait a little while,
and she'll reach out to you.

459
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:33,855
(I miss you, my beautiful daughter.)

460
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:45,215
(I miss you, my beautiful daughter.)

461
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:48,417
I miss you, my beautiful daughter.

462
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:49,920
Oh, please.

463
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:53,108
Please just leave me alone.

464
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:57,289
Don't come looking for me.

465
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:59,020
Don't text me.

466
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,263
Don't worry about me.

467
00:28:03,255 --> 00:28:07,427
You just want
to make me the worst daughter ever.

468
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:20,615
It will be difficult
to secure enough money...

469
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:22,837
to raise Cheong A's shares before
the shareholder meeting next week.

470
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,034
Three days.

471
00:28:24,114 --> 00:28:26,725
We need 200 million dollars
in three days, whatever it takes.

472
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,489
Sell every bond or real estate
that we can...

473
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:30,655
and get as much money as possible.

474
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:32,546
Things have already been bad
since Father's death.

475
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:35,691
It's over once the shareholders
learn about Baek Jun Ki.

476
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:37,471
Do you trust Baek Jun Ki?

477
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:41,038
Even if he gets the money,
he might send the evidence to James.

478
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:42,980
He's not that dumb.

479
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,846
How will he survive, even if he tries
to live off Logan's family?

480
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:48,258
You go deal with the Myeongdong building
like I told you to.

481
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:49,383
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,012
Mom.

483
00:28:58,692 --> 00:29:00,435
-Hi.
-You're still home?

484
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:03,053
You look really nervous.

485
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:05,917
I do? I'm not.

486
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,621
Is it because of what happened yesterday?

487
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:11,306
Joo Seok Kyung told her dad, didn't she?

488
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:12,637
About Grandpa?

489
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,755
I'll deal with it. Don't you worry.

490
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:20,035
It's because of me.

491
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:22,215
I shouldn't have filmed that.

492
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:24,635
There's no evidence.

493
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:26,398
No one will trust Seok Kyung.

494
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:27,893
Of course not.

495
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:32,011
As long as you're okay, I am too.

496
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:33,627
Don't worry. Just go to school.

497
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:35,421
Okay. Bye.

498
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:36,573
Bye.

499
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:52,352
Baek Jun Ki and Joo Dan Tae...

500
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:54,519
I need to get rid of them both.

501
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:56,881
If not, Cheong A Foundation...

502
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,326
and Eun Byeol will both be hurt.

503
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:05,478
Things will work out easily
if we use Cheon Seo Jin's weakness.

504
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:08,292
How much money do we have on hand
that we can use?

505
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:10,344
I can get 500 million dollars.

506
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:13,081
Then use the Cheonsoo District
as an excuse to get that money...

507
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:14,376
and send it to Baek Jun Ki.

508
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:15,885
It's too dangerous.

509
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:17,447
That's too big of an amount.

510
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:19,068
It doesn't matter.

511
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:21,201
We can send it under Cheon Seo Jin's name.

512
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:24,319
If the divorce ends quickly,
I won't be accountable.

513
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,650
If it works out, it's a chance...

514
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:30,695
to blow off Cheon Seo Jin
and get my hands on Cheong A Group.

515
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:34,423
You don't look like you agree.

516
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:36,803
It's a shareholders' meeting.
It's dangerous.

517
00:30:36,883 --> 00:30:38,954
If you want to be nominated
as Cheong A Group's chairman again,

518
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:40,557
you need to avoid anything suspicious.

519
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:47,743
Very well then.

520
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:50,966
First, put it in a borrowed account
under Lee Kyu Jin's name.

521
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,179
If we play it well,

522
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,664
I won't ever be put in danger.

523
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:57,592
Understood, Chairman.

524
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:04,098
Do you think Joo Dan Tae
and Cheon Seo Jin...

525
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,735
will really go with Baek Jun Ki's offer?

526
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:10,191
It's not a threat you can ignore.

527
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,957
No matter how much the cost is,
they need to hold on...

528
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,687
until the Cheonsoo District is sold.

529
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,428
We need to steal everything
they own before that happens.

530
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:22,137
Make them even more nervous...

531
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:24,385
by creating a situation in which
the two cannot trust each other.

532
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:29,320
I hope that Kang Ma Ri and Yoo Dong Pil
lead this whole thing well.

533
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:40,915
Please...

534
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:42,896
The person you have reached
is unavailable...

535
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:44,424
What should I do?

536
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:46,927
Sang A is ignoring me again.

537
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:49,886
Cheer up and eat.

538
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:53,283
Come on. You said you were a good cook.

539
00:31:53,363 --> 00:31:54,453
This is just ramyeon.

540
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,038
Just ramyeon?

541
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:57,800
Look at what's inside.

542
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,289
Plus, you know I cooked in the military.

543
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:01,367
Please.

544
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:04,722
I am the son of a culinary researcher.

545
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:07,013
My palate has high standards.

546
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:10,535
No matter how good the ramyeon is,
it's still just ramyeon.

547
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:20,102
This is incredible!

548
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:26,803
Since the ground breaking ceremony,

549
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,775
people have been saying
that Chairman Joo is a murderer.

550
00:32:29,855 --> 00:32:32,233
I don't know what impact
that's going to have in the future.

551
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:36,746
Chairman Joo, if you look at him,
has more enemies than you think.

552
00:32:37,195 --> 00:32:38,852
Did you take care of everything okay?

553
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:41,662
It's not that simple.

554
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:45,395
What, you think Chairman Joo
actually killed Logan?

555
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:48,669
There's evidence
that Joo Dan Tae is a murderer.

556
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:49,816
Evidence?

557
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:54,204
Why are you telling me
such an important thing over ramyeon?

558
00:32:54,284 --> 00:32:57,784
The Joo Dan Tae we know
is not the real Joo Dan Tae.

559
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:59,767
What do you mean
he's not the real Chairman Joo?

560
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,236
You mean he's a clone?

561
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:02,512
Nonsense.

562
00:33:02,592 --> 00:33:04,222
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

563
00:33:04,302 --> 00:33:05,660
He's wanted?

564
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,445
The Joo Dan Tae we know...

565
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:10,354
is someone who is wanted for killing
two people in Japan and fleeing.

566
00:33:10,434 --> 00:33:11,596
And his name is Baek Jun Ki.

567
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:12,868
And the real Joo Dan Tae...

568
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:15,580
is that guy he said he knew from Japan,
Baek Jun Ki.

569
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,839
So you mean...

570
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:21,588
Baek Jun Ki is the real Joo Dan Tae,
and Joo Dan Tae is Baek Jun Ki?

571
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,213
The police are already on it.

572
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,624
It's only a matter of time
before Chairman Joo gets caught.

573
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,692
Why do you think
Baek Jun Ki came back here?

574
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,204
He wanted to get his identity back.

575
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:32,549
What a dirtbag.

576
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:36,599
What kind of a freak
steals someone else's name?

577
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:41,519
You know, Dong Pil,

578
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,355
since when have you had access
to such good information?

579
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:47,072
Ten billion dollars?

580
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:50,677
So? Spill!

581
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:56,305
After Yoon Hee died,
the ten billion she had disappeared.

582
00:33:56,385 --> 00:34:00,800
Which means
her death wasn't just an accident.

583
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,318
-Of course not.
-Then what was it?

584
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:05,454
Did someone kill her?

585
00:34:06,835 --> 00:34:09,345
That day, somebody...

586
00:34:09,573 --> 00:34:11,776
pushed the car from behind.

587
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:13,948
To kill Yoon Hee.

588
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:15,599
-My goodness.
-No way.

589
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,973
Who does something so horrible?

590
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:19,747
I heard the dashboard camera was found,

591
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:22,392
and they're thinking about
reopening the case.

592
00:34:22,472 --> 00:34:23,436
Let's be real.

593
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:27,589
Who benefited the most
from Yoon Hee's death?

594
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:30,653
Isn't there one person you can think of?

595
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,909
Do you mean... Ms. Cheon?

596
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,124
-No way.
-Goodness.

597
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:36,413
That's far-fetched.

598
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:40,093
For Ms. Cheon,
it's as if her biggest enemy died.

599
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:42,302
Even Eun Byeol went to SNU.

600
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:45,632
Everyone in Hera Palace
has heard the rumour.

601
00:34:45,712 --> 00:34:48,636
That it was Ms. Cheon who killed Yoon Hee.

602
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,070
I even heard that the body...

603
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,333
is buried
under Hera Palace's water fountain.

604
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:54,506
Haven't you heard?

605
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,701
What gibberish is this!

606
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,463
At least her ears work well.

607
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:07,736
-Let's get up.
-Let's go.

608
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,275
Did you hear?

609
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:11,977
Don't you know it's a crime...

610
00:35:12,057 --> 00:35:13,920
to disseminate
obviously false information?

611
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,442
Why are you yelling?

612
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:18,035
You have something to hide?

613
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:22,287
People might think
you actually did kill Yoon Hee.

614
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:24,526
-Kang Ma Ri.
-Yes.

615
00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:27,773
Stop it, you two. Don't fight.

616
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:32,936
If you spread rumours like that
ever again,

617
00:35:33,016 --> 00:35:34,391
I won't just take it.

618
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:36,293
I'll sue you.

619
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:43,852
Sue me. I'm not scared.

620
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:46,278
It's a democratic country.

621
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:48,900
I can say whatever I want.

622
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,341
Why is he repeatedly calling?

623
00:35:53,605 --> 00:35:55,626
Who would spread a rumour like that?

624
00:35:55,706 --> 00:35:58,236
Could it be Jin Bun Hong?

625
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:05,744
Why are you calling?

626
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,208
How's the money coming along?

627
00:36:10,162 --> 00:36:13,055
A single check would be nice and neat.

628
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:14,260
Two hundred million dollars.

629
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,737
Let's meet tomorrow night.

630
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:18,358
I'll bring it to where you want.

631
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:39,789
I didn't know you were the punctual type.

632
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:41,021
Shut it.

633
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:46,370
Give me the recorder first.

634
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:55,569
I trust you didn't make any copies.

635
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:57,971
I don't have time for that.

636
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,686
I'll be busy
spending my 200 million dollars.

637
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,683
Didn't you have fun...

638
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:09,833
working with me?

639
00:37:09,913 --> 00:37:12,279
Never show up in front of me again.

640
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:14,496
The next time we meet,

641
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:16,552
we'll be in the fiery pit.

642
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:20,687
One more thing.

643
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,409
I prepared a goodbye gift for you.

644
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:28,475
You'll find something interesting
in the recorder.

645
00:37:29,535 --> 00:37:30,776
Enjoy.

646
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,043
One more thing.

647
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:46,137
Give me the evidence
that Seo Jin had Logan locked up.

648
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:48,064
I'll give you 300 million dollars.

649
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:50,369
Isn't it a sweet deal?

650
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:53,050
Logan's already dead.

651
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,552
Do you think that evidence...

652
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:56,686
will get James off your tail?

653
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,221
What do you say?

654
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:00,678
Why not do business with me?

655
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:01,990
Joo Dan Tae.

656
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:05,419
You're trying to stab me in the back?

657
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:23,798
Mr. Joo, there's a problem.

658
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:26,769
The funds in Mr. Lee's account are gone.

659
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:30,252
"Gone?" How is that possible?

660
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:31,478
Are you sure?

661
00:38:31,558 --> 00:38:32,917
Yes, I've confirmed it.

662
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:36,197
I was going to wire money to Baek Jun Ki,
but there was no money left.

663
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:40,414
The phone is turned off.

664
00:38:40,494 --> 00:38:41,983
Son of a...

665
00:38:58,322 --> 00:38:59,422
No way.

666
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,131
This can't be.

667
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:03,862
How did that jerk find out?

668
00:39:04,895 --> 00:39:06,580
I don't believe this.

669
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,380
What's wrong with Dad?

670
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,450
He planned a family trip to cheer me up.

671
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,568
Try to understand him.

672
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:28,369
This is embarrassing.

673
00:39:29,114 --> 00:39:30,257
I'll go get coffee.

674
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:35,046
Honey, you should cover your face too.

675
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:37,405
Why would you wear sunglasses at night?

676
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:39,587
We might not be able
to set foot in Korea again.

677
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,724
What do you mean?

678
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:42,692
I thought we were going on a trip.

679
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:50,036
"Bon-bi Holdings?" What company is that?

680
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,047
The CEO is Ko Sang A?

681
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,762
I...

682
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:57,728
stole Joo Dan Tae's money.

683
00:39:57,808 --> 00:39:59,844
-What?
-Five hundred million dollars...

684
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:01,654
at that.

685
00:40:02,323 --> 00:40:03,684
Did you say 500 million?

686
00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:06,777
I don't want to be his minion
for the rest of my life.

687
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:10,865
I want to live my life to the fullest.

688
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,654
How could you?

689
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:16,485
Hey, Lee Kyu Jin.

690
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:18,474
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

691
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:24,194
You should've
discussed this with me first.

692
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:27,795
Sang A.

693
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,079
You had me scared there.

694
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,552
Do you approve of what I did?

695
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,406
Yes, you're the best.

696
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:39,376
Sang A.

697
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,775
Goodness, you're clueless.

698
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:48,097
The rumour has spread everywhere.

699
00:40:48,177 --> 00:40:51,530
Cheong A Group will go bankrupt
as soon as Chairman Joo is arrested.

700
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,010
Then what's going to happen to us?

701
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:58,380
Joo Dan Tae is setting up slush funds
to save himself.

702
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,110
He's splitting
and laundering his company funds.

703
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,881
I heard some money
was transferred to your account.

704
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,957
I have slush funds in my account?

705
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,748
I don't know how much it is,
but you should look into it.

706
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:12,546
You might end up being accused
of embezzlement.

707
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:16,305
At this rate, Joo Dan Tae
will take everything away from us.

708
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:27,366
I didn't feel comfortable
having the money in my name,

709
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:30,581
so I set up a paper company in your name
and put it there.

710
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:33,197
Good job.
Now that we have 500 million dollars,

711
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:36,154
you don't have to work for Joo Dan Tae,
that jerk, anymore.

712
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:40,464
With this money, all six of us
can live like kings and queens.

713
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:44,370
All six of us? What do you mean?

714
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,477
Are there more people than us?

715
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:49,962
There they are.

716
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,361
Hey! Mom! Over here!

717
00:41:54,043 --> 00:41:57,699
Are they coming with us?

718
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:59,566
What else can we do?

719
00:41:59,646 --> 00:42:02,975
My dad divorced my mom because of me.

720
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:05,043
I should take responsibility.

721
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:09,108
Gosh. Just a second.

722
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:12,252
Kyu Jin! There you are.
I looked everywhere for you.

723
00:42:12,332 --> 00:42:13,881
Why are you dressed like this?

724
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,685
Son, are we moving abroad?

725
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:18,947
-Where are we going?
-Hawaii? Europe?

726
00:42:19,027 --> 00:42:20,204
Listen carefully.

727
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,317
We need to pull ourselves together.

728
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:25,541
First, we're going to Turkey via Japan.

729
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:27,020
Then to Romania.

730
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,005
After that,
we'll spend three years in Poland.

731
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:31,467
-With 500 million dollars...
-Ultimately, we're going to Russia.

732
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:33,323
Do you have gowns and stuff?

733
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:35,784
Why are you dressed like this?

734
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:40,011
You'll have to change
into different clothes.

735
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,541
We won't be able to communicate...

736
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:44,414
You still haven't found him?

737
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:47,206
What's taking so long?

738
00:42:47,537 --> 00:42:48,950
It doesn't seem like
he's left the country...

739
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:52,229
while Ko Sang A
and their son have left for Japan.

740
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:54,400
Japan?

741
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:56,712
Baek Jun Ki has been calling
and asking for money.

742
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:57,786
What should we do?

743
00:42:58,465 --> 00:43:00,153
Baek Jun Ki, that little...

744
00:43:03,452 --> 00:43:06,039
Withdraw my slush funds
from the Cayman Islands.

745
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,658
If I don't pay him,
he'll leak the pictures to the press.

746
00:43:09,738 --> 00:43:11,673
All 500 million dollars?

747
00:43:11,753 --> 00:43:14,961
I'll do anything to shut his mouth.
Don't you understand?

748
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:19,208
I can make up for the loss
once the stock prices go up.

749
00:43:19,288 --> 00:43:20,281
Get out.

750
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:28,510
Father, you have a guest.

751
00:43:30,127 --> 00:43:31,097
A guest?

752
00:43:34,587 --> 00:43:36,416
How have you been, Chairman Joo?

753
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:40,368
What brings you here?

754
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:43,316
Our conversation isn't over, I believe.

755
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:47,683
Ms. Jin just arrived.

756
00:43:48,149 --> 00:43:50,487
Okay. We don't know what she might do.

757
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:51,797
Keep a close eye.

758
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,609
Be careful.

759
00:43:56,064 --> 00:43:57,979
Is it Jin Bun Hong's turn now?

760
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:02,887
I trust she can make Joo Dan Tae
and Cheon Seo Jin...

761
00:44:03,503 --> 00:44:05,061
tear each other apart.

762
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:07,564
She's a total psycho.

763
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:11,035
I trusted you.

764
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:14,891
How could you fail to keep Cheon Seo Jin
under control and keep me waiting?

765
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:21,029
I'm not in the mood
for bickering with you.

766
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:24,478
-Get lost.
-Don't tell me what to do.

767
00:44:24,874 --> 00:44:26,888
I decide whether I stay or leave,
you jerk.

768
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:28,011
"Jerk?"

769
00:44:28,091 --> 00:44:30,049
Yes, you're a jerk.

770
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:33,754
I don't think it's a good idea
to be so cocky with me.

771
00:44:34,781 --> 00:44:38,193
My dashboard camera footage
of the day Oh Yoon Hee died...

772
00:44:38,273 --> 00:44:39,576
is right here.

773
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:44,406
You did a great job
pushing her to the edge of the cliff.

774
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:47,831
Your dashboard camera footage?

775
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:50,894
You're lying. No such thing was found.

776
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:54,319
Yes, you're right.

777
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,500
But I had someone find it for me.

778
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,782
You shouldn't have underestimated me.

779
00:45:04,216 --> 00:45:05,771
Stop, Joo Dan Tae!

780
00:45:05,861 --> 00:45:07,887
-Hold on.
-She's still in the car!

781
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,827
Wait for the highlights.

782
00:45:17,704 --> 00:45:18,878
What?

783
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:22,362
It was Cheon Seo Jin
who killed Oh Yoon Hee?

784
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:27,144
You're such a fool.
How could you not know that?

785
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:29,450
Can't you do anything right?

786
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:33,518
How much...

787
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:36,025
do you want for that footage?

788
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:38,907
-I want 500 million dollars.
-Five hundred million?

789
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,684
Are you kidding me?

790
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:43,846
If you're desperate,
you'll have to prepare it.

791
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:47,291
Otherwise, I'll bring it to the police.

792
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:50,553
You're responsible
for Oh Yoon Hee's death too.

793
00:45:52,698 --> 00:45:53,750
Wait a second.

794
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:57,350
It's too expensive. Give me a discount.

795
00:45:58,643 --> 00:46:00,483
What? This is embarrassing.

796
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,483
It's 500 million.

797
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:07,047
Prepare it within this week,
and this footage is yours.

798
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:09,761
The shareholders' meeting
is around the corner.

799
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:11,811
If you manage
to bring Cheon Seo Jin down using this,

800
00:46:11,891 --> 00:46:13,724
all of Cheong A Group will be yours.

801
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,395
Who cares about 500 million?

802
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:23,204
Darn it!

803
00:46:23,895 --> 00:46:26,143
If it weren't for that jerk Kyu Jin...

804
00:46:27,593 --> 00:46:29,139
I need to get that video.

805
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,434
If I have that video, Seo Jin is done for.

806
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:34,597
It's 500 million dollars.

807
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:37,849
Where will I get 500 million dollars?

808
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,804
Father is starting to lose it.

809
00:46:40,055 --> 00:46:42,734
Darn it. My 500 million dollars.

810
00:46:43,435 --> 00:46:45,718
It's 500 million dollars.

811
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:50,845
I plan to dry up
all of Joo Dan Tae's funds.

812
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:54,800
His properties, cash,
and the slush fund he has abroad.

813
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:57,707
It's starting to get there.

814
00:46:58,287 --> 00:47:00,184
It's time to go after Seo Jin.

815
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:05,568
When did you hear the rumour
about Oh Yoon Hee's murder?

816
00:47:05,648 --> 00:47:09,697
I heard it through the grapevine,
so I can't remember exactly when it was.

817
00:47:09,777 --> 00:47:14,366
Still, the rumour was so detailed.
That's why it seems credible.

818
00:47:14,446 --> 00:47:16,794
They say someone pushed from behind.

819
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:19,141
They wanted the ten billion dollars.

820
00:47:19,221 --> 00:47:22,129
Why are you investigating that now?

821
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:26,003
The police received a tip too,
that Oh Yoon Hee was murdered.

822
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:27,660
It was damaged,

823
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,643
but we found the dashboard camera
from the site.

824
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:31,779
-Dashboard camera?
-We're restoring it now.

825
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:32,831
No way.

826
00:47:32,911 --> 00:47:34,876
Please call us if you hear anything else.

827
00:47:34,956 --> 00:47:36,212
Of course.

828
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,481
Are you all right?

829
00:47:39,781 --> 00:47:41,869
Of course. Let's go to school.

830
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:52,902
Scared?

831
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:55,899
You should be, you evil witch.

832
00:48:07,744 --> 00:48:10,626
The police received a tip too,
that Oh Yoon Hee was murdered.

833
00:48:10,706 --> 00:48:12,171
They say someone pushed from behind.

834
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:13,551
We found the dashboard camera...

835
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:15,169
They wanted the ten billion dollars.

836
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:17,049
We're restoring it now.
The police received a tip too,

837
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:18,611
-that Oh Yoon Hee was murdered.

What's wrong, Mom?

00:48:42,514 --> 00:48:44,096
Eun Byeol.

843
00:48:47,232 --> 00:48:48,418
What's her problem?

844
00:48:54,154 --> 00:48:55,614
Are you okay?

845
00:48:56,555 --> 00:48:57,706
Yes.

846
00:48:58,256 --> 00:48:59,954
I was speeding in case you were late.

847
00:49:00,034 --> 00:49:01,350
Sorry. I'll slow down.

848
00:49:18,275 --> 00:49:19,725
Why are you back here?

849
00:49:20,147 --> 00:49:21,796
I came to uncover the truth...

850
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:25,150
about what happened
the night Yoon Hee died.

851
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:30,241
It's a picture of Dan Tae
following her car in his.

852
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:39,481
He was the one
who promised to get Eun Byeol for me.

853
00:49:39,993 --> 00:49:42,671
He was also the one
who made me lie to the press.

854
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,192
Will you let him get away with it?

855
00:49:46,272 --> 00:49:47,927
What are you getting at?

856
00:49:48,536 --> 00:49:51,221
I want to help you, that's why.

857
00:49:52,385 --> 00:49:54,257
The video of Dan Tae...

858
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:56,744
chasing Yoon Hee that day in Gimpo.

859
00:49:56,824 --> 00:49:58,950
My sworn statement that he paid me.

860
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,479
I'll give it all to you.

861
00:50:00,946 --> 00:50:02,057
Do you mean it?

862
00:50:02,803 --> 00:50:05,395
In exchange, I want 500 million dollars.

863
00:50:05,475 --> 00:50:06,506
What?

864
00:50:06,885 --> 00:50:09,265
You really are insane.

865
00:50:09,345 --> 00:50:11,115
You can have it
by the end of the week, right?

866
00:50:11,195 --> 00:50:13,028
If you consider it the price
for Eun Byeol's life,

867
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:15,214
you should be more than willing
to part with it.

868
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,757
Okay, then. I'll wait for your call.

869
00:50:18,245 --> 00:50:22,048
What... That... You crazy little...

Put the Cheongdam-dong building
up for sale.

-I need 500 million dollars more.
-Pardon?

874

Didn't you hear me? Go bring me money.

875

Do whatever it takes...

876

to get the money together.

877
00:50:50,608 --> 00:50:53,950
If I don't get rid of Dan Tae now,
I'll be the one going down.

878
00:50:54,705 --> 00:50:55,905

You haven't fully paid off
the previous loan yet.

That's why I put the prime location
in Cheonsoo District as collateral.

00:57:52,114 --> 00:57:56,332
It's not true that Oh Yoon Hee
is the Admissions Murderer.

981
00:57:57,105 --> 00:58:00,653
I did as Chairman Joo told me to,

982
00:58:00,733 --> 00:58:04,180
and took Eun Byeol from Hera Palace
and put her in my car.

983
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,229
I then took her to a Gimpo orchard
that Chairman Joo and I spoke of.

984
00:58:08,637 --> 00:58:10,777
The police are searching the penthouse.

985
00:58:11,997 --> 00:58:13,103
And Dan Tae?

986
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,789
He vanished.

987
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,382
Did he dig a cave to hide in?

988
00:58:19,976 --> 00:58:22,929
Still, he's just a cornered little mouse.

989
00:58:23,991 --> 00:58:27,008
Summon a Cheong A Group
emergency board meeting in one hour.

990
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:28,113
Yes, Ms. Cheon.

991
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:34,836
What should I wear?

992
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:41,478
Should I wear red or blue?

993
00:59:07,955 --> 00:59:10,515
(Same genders only)

994
00:59:11,759 --> 00:59:13,169
Let's stay here for now.

995
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:16,199
It can be traced,
so do not turn on your phone.

996
00:59:16,717 --> 00:59:19,509
I'll go and get some supplies.

997
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,248
Dong Pil, don't be long.

998
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:22,968
I'm scared on my own.

999
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:37,826
Police arrested Mr. Cho who worked closely
with Chairman Joo Dan Tae.

1000
00:59:37,906 --> 00:59:41,219
Mr. Cho is suspected
of assisting in Chairman Joo's escape,

1001
00:59:41,299 --> 00:59:45,008
and police are focusing efforts
on locating the fugitive.

1002
00:59:45,088 --> 00:59:48,379
Police consider this a grave crime
involving abduction,

1003
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,619
murder, and disposing of a corpse,
which was planned,

1004
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:53,535
-and the Gangnam Police Station...
-That darn Cheon Seo Jin...

1005
00:59:53,615 --> 00:59:57,252
She killed Oh Yoon Hee
and she's making me take the fall?

1006
00:59:57,332 --> 00:59:58,367
I won't go down like this.

1007
00:59:58,447 --> 00:59:59,983
-Hiding in a laundry hamper...
-I won't!

1008
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,733
-to escape.
-I'll kill you, Seo Jin.

1009
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:06,382
Other than Mr. Cho,
there was one more accomplice...

1010
01:00:06,462 --> 01:00:07,797
who fled with Mr. Joo...

1011
01:00:07,877 --> 01:00:10,825
It looks like Cheon Seo Jin
will swallow Cheong A Group.

1012
01:00:11,257 --> 01:00:12,316
But...

1013
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:15,070
that's what you want, isn't it?

1014
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,781
You'll take down Joo Dan Tae first,
and in the end,

1015
01:00:19,901 --> 01:00:21,382
it'll be Cheon Seo Jin.

1016
01:00:21,462 --> 01:00:23,265
At Cheong A Group's shareholders' meeting,

1017
01:00:23,738 --> 01:00:26,507
we will reveal all that she did.

1018
01:00:27,811 --> 01:00:30,041
I'll also tear down Cheonsoo District.

1019
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,732
I plan to leave Seo Jin alone until then.

1020
01:00:53,075 --> 01:00:54,706
Ro Na.

1021
01:00:57,055 --> 01:00:59,954
I wondered
who kept leaving stuff by the door.

1022
01:01:01,755 --> 01:01:02,860
It was you.

1023
01:01:05,465 --> 01:01:07,563
I think you got the wrong apartment.

1024
01:01:08,517 --> 01:01:10,569
Your daughter lives on the 85th floor.

1025
01:01:12,545 --> 01:01:15,565
So take all this with you.

1026
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,860
Also, I'd rather not see you.

1027
01:01:22,715 --> 01:01:24,369
I'd like you to be careful.

1028
01:01:41,425 --> 01:01:43,298
I don't need a dad like him.

1029
01:01:43,928 --> 01:01:45,786
I just need you, Mom.

1030
01:01:46,905 --> 01:01:48,578
I just want you.

1031
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:01,392
I...

1032
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:03,787
knew all along.

1033
01:02:05,865 --> 01:02:09,115
That Mr. Ha was my real dad.

1034
01:02:10,735 --> 01:02:12,389
When he lived with us,

1035
01:02:13,325 --> 01:02:15,514
you looked so happy.

1036
01:02:16,123 --> 01:02:17,706
I'd never seen you like that.

1037
01:02:18,995 --> 01:02:19,992
That's why...

1038
01:02:21,057 --> 01:02:23,941
you couldn't ignore Eun Byeol, right?

1039
01:02:25,485 --> 01:02:26,994
Because she's Dad's daughter too.

1040
01:02:27,904 --> 01:02:29,427
You're so stupid.

1041
01:02:31,485 --> 01:02:35,570
Mom. Why did you leave me?

1042
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:39,461
Why are you not with me?

1043
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:40,754
Why?

1044
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:44,255
Mom.

1045
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:47,358
Mom...

1046
01:03:04,091 --> 01:03:05,223
Come outside.

1047
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:15,003
It's not good at all.

1048
01:03:15,955 --> 01:03:17,085
I'm wanted too.

1049
01:03:17,701 --> 01:03:18,713
I think...

1050
01:03:19,389 --> 01:03:20,972
I must confess to the police.

1051
01:03:21,052 --> 01:03:22,088
What are you...

1052
01:03:23,479 --> 01:03:25,055
You'll turn yourself in?

1053
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,599
You promised to keep the secret forever.

1054
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:28,908
I can't do that anymore.

1055
01:03:29,584 --> 01:03:32,504
I don't want to lie to my wife
or daughter.

1056
01:03:33,585 --> 01:03:36,513
You should give up now.
The police got Mr. Cho too.

1057
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:40,660
Dan Tae. This is the last chance
to turn things right.

1058
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:42,837
Killing Kim Mi Sook...

1059
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:45,372
Killing Oh Yoon Hee
and stuffing her in the fountain...

1060
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:47,922
I'm an accomplice to all that,
so let's both turn ourselves in.

1061
01:03:48,002 --> 01:03:50,439
You can't do this to me, Dong Pil.

1062
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:54,267
When you were a thug in Jincheon,
the one who got you out of the gang.

1063
01:03:54,653 --> 01:03:55,833
It was me.

1064
01:03:55,913 --> 01:03:58,423
When your gang members
almost beat you to death,

1065
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:02,098
I'm the one who saved your life!

1066
01:04:02,178 --> 01:04:05,178
So I took the fall for murder
and did time.

1067
01:04:05,645 --> 01:04:07,314
I broke my daughter's heart.

1068
01:04:11,095 --> 01:04:13,481
Dan Tae. Let's pay the price...

1069
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,977
and live in peace.

1070
01:04:17,108 --> 01:04:18,397
It's different this time.

1071
01:04:18,782 --> 01:04:21,166
No, it's not.

1072
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,444
It's not different.

1073
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,997
Dong Pil. Help me out one more time.

1074
01:04:28,224 --> 01:04:29,288
Let's say...

1075
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:31,615
you killed Oh Yoon Hee.

1076
01:04:32,457 --> 01:04:34,170
If you do time for me,

1077
01:04:34,856 --> 01:04:36,620
I'll give you everything I own.

1078
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,606
I have a fund stashed overseas.
I'll put it all in your name.

1079
01:04:39,686 --> 01:04:42,109
You trust me, don't you? Don't you?

1080
01:04:42,857 --> 01:04:43,969
Just this once.

1081
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:48,079
Please, help me out one more time.

1082
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:50,056
Just one more time.

1083
01:04:52,569 --> 01:04:53,635
Okay.

1084
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:57,513
I got it. I'll think about it.

1085
01:04:59,712 --> 01:05:00,983
This is a burner phone.

1086
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:03,116
Keep this and hide somewhere.

1087
01:05:03,196 --> 01:05:04,960
I'll call if something happens.

1088

1089
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:10,682

1091

you quit Seok Kyung's dad's company.

01:09:58,765 --> 01:10:01,061
We're leaving soon, so stay in here.

1142
01:10:01,141 --> 01:10:02,509
In here?

1143
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:04,941
Yes.

1144
01:10:05,283 --> 01:10:06,542
Darn it.

1145
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:40,101
Man, it's hot.

1146
01:10:42,362 --> 01:10:43,649
This place...

1147
01:10:44,497 --> 01:10:45,526
Darn it.

1148
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:51,355
What?

1149
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:55,434
What is this?

1150
01:11:23,385 --> 01:11:24,357
Mom.

1151
01:11:24,783 --> 01:11:25,684
Hey.

1152
01:11:26,591 --> 01:11:28,280
You seem to be in a good mood today.

1153
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,014
Yes, I am.

1154
01:11:30,456 --> 01:11:34,512
I think I'll be chosen Chairwoman
at this shareholders' meeting.

1155
01:11:35,107 --> 01:11:36,552
-Really?
-Yes.

1156
01:11:36,632 --> 01:11:38,827
Let's go shopping before the inauguration.

1157
01:11:38,907 --> 01:11:40,120
Get new clothes fitted...

1158
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,466
and take some new photos
for the first time in a while.

1159
01:11:42,546 --> 01:11:44,124
Is there anything you want?

1160
01:11:44,204 --> 01:11:45,273
No.

1161
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:49,162
I'm just happy you're happy.

1162
01:11:51,186 --> 01:11:52,209
Thank you.

1163
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,174
-Shall we have breakfast?
-Certainly.

1164
01:11:57,254 --> 01:11:59,516
I made an apple salad.
Doesn't that sound good?

1165
01:11:59,596 --> 01:12:01,406
Wow, you made it?

1166
01:12:01,486 --> 01:12:03,318
Of course. Try it.

1167
01:12:03,398 --> 01:12:06,106
I'm going to try this first.

1168
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:09,423
Is it good?

1169
01:12:10,298 --> 01:12:11,470
It's so good.

1170
01:12:14,155 --> 01:12:15,988
Slow down.

1171
01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:18,092
I can't help it. It's too good.

1172
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,601
This one. And this.

1173
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:29,777
-I think green will suit you well.
-I don't own any green.

1174
01:12:30,362 --> 01:12:32,285
-Try this.
-Me?

1175
01:12:34,025 --> 01:12:35,765
We're shooting.

1176
01:12:35,845 --> 01:12:37,243
One, two...

1177
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:40,078
Closer.

1178
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:42,558
One, two, three.

1179
01:13:00,805 --> 01:13:03,044
Hey. Hey.

1180
01:13:05,107 --> 01:13:06,170
Where am I?

1181
01:13:09,555 --> 01:13:12,161
What is this place?

1182
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:13,516
Answer me.

1183
01:13:15,555 --> 01:13:17,953
Are you awake?

1184
01:13:18,214 --> 01:13:19,370
Mr. Baek Jun Ki.

1185
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,692
Baek...

1186
01:13:21,113 --> 01:13:22,610
Baek Jun Ki?

1187
01:13:24,705 --> 01:13:25,789
What...

1188
01:13:29,632 --> 01:13:30,974
Baek Jun Ki...

1189
01:13:34,484 --> 01:13:35,556
What is this place?

1190
01:13:36,102 --> 01:13:37,186
Where am I?

1191
01:13:37,266 --> 01:13:38,510
Why am I here?

1192
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,728
Open this. Right now! I'll break it.

1193
01:13:43,077 --> 01:13:44,303
Open it.

1194
01:13:55,426 --> 01:13:56,627
Joo Seok Kyung?

1195
01:13:58,065 --> 01:13:59,243
You did this?

1196
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:05,585
I love the outfits you got me.

1197
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,963
Eun Byeol, should we have a glass of wine?

1198
01:14:09,043 --> 01:14:10,163
That sounds good.

1199
01:14:10,243 --> 01:14:12,100
Let's party after changing.

1200
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,895
I'll set things up. You go shower.

1201
01:14:14,975 --> 01:14:16,715
-Go on.
-Look at you.

1202
01:14:16,796 --> 01:14:19,427
You must be tired too.
We can make the housekeeper do it.

1203
01:14:19,507 --> 01:14:21,095
Be pretty!

1204
01:14:51,465 --> 01:14:52,640
It's perfect.

1205
01:14:53,412 --> 01:14:56,860
Shim Su Ryeon, Joo Dan Tae, Oh Yoon Hee...

1206
01:14:57,885 --> 01:14:59,485
They're all gone.

1207
01:15:06,245 --> 01:15:08,001
The final winner...

1208
01:15:09,245 --> 01:15:10,565
is you, Cheon Seo Jin.

1209
01:15:27,525 --> 01:15:28,499
Mom.

1210
01:15:29,795 --> 01:15:32,507
I'll erase all your bad memories...

1211
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:36,300
so you can always be happy.

1212
01:15:41,002 --> 01:15:42,552
I've been saving all my pills...

1213
01:15:43,268 --> 01:15:45,209
just for you.

1214
01:16:31,915 --> 01:16:33,566
My goodness.

1215
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,030
Did you prepare all this yourself?

1216
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:39,304
You did a beautiful job.

1217
01:16:39,384 --> 01:16:40,371
Do you like it?

1218
01:16:40,827 --> 01:16:42,868
Of course, I love it.

1219
01:16:43,446 --> 01:16:44,740
I can't believe this.

1220
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:47,654
Mom, shall we drink?

1221
01:16:48,091 --> 01:16:49,257
Sounds good.

1222
01:17:02,123 --> 01:17:04,060
You made a good choice.

1223
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,418
It's so sweet.

1224
01:17:09,495 --> 01:17:11,165
This is...

1225
01:17:12,435 --> 01:17:14,141
the happiest day of my life.

1226
01:18:09,062 --> 01:18:11,781
=The Penthouse 3=

1227
01:18:11,861 --> 01:18:13,246
I just need to get through the day.

1228
01:18:13,326 --> 01:18:15,165
I'm going to reveal my mom's last moment.

1229
01:18:15,245 --> 01:18:17,295
You killed Yoon Hee, didn't you?

1230
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,371
I'll kill you. Is it painful?

1231
01:18:19,451 --> 01:18:21,317
-Baek... Baek Jun Ki?
-How do you feel?

1232
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:22,980
Do you have to destroy yourself
even further?

1233
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,186
Don't come to see me again.

1234
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:25,732
After how much I struggled to escape...

1235
01:18:25,812 --> 01:18:26,952
I must get out of here.

1236
01:18:27,032 --> 01:18:29,049
Something doesn't feel right.

1237
01:18:29,129 --> 01:18:30,514
Are you not feeling well?

1238
01:18:30,594 --> 01:18:32,860
See how it feels to live in misery.
