(The characters, locations,
incidents, organizations,)

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,560
(and background
of this drama are fictional.)

=Episode 4=

4
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,780
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

5
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,540
Joo Dan Tae?

6
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,550
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

7
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,090
-"Baek Jun..."
-Seo Jin.

8
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,979
This is cheating.

9
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:18,252
Joo Dan Tae is wanted?

10
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:21,538
What happened? What is this about?

11
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:23,513
This man is...

12
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,976
Joo Dan Tae, right?

13
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,901
What are you talking about?

14
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:31,712
Why would Dan Tae be wanted?

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,734
It's obviously someone else.

16
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:38,793
It is Joo Dan Tae, isn't it?

17
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:43,016
But why is his name Baek Jun Ki?
Baek Jun Ki is...

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,050
your name.

19
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,915
You're keeping something from me,
aren't you?

20
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:55,664
What's your secret plan
behind moving into my house?

21
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:57,985
You're mistaken.

22
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:01,979
I'm tired. Can you leave?

23
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:05,167
Also, please
don't go through my room again.

24
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:10,748
Just ask me directly...

25
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:12,802
if you want to know something.

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,455
Instead of peeping in like a rat,

27
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:32,335
why didn't you just come in
if you were curious?

28
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:37,105
I'm sure I saw this face
on that wanted poster.

29
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:38,919
His name is Baek Jun Ki,

30
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,486
but he looks exactly like Joo Dan Tae.

31
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,947
What's going on?
Shouldn't you explain it yourself?

32
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:46,776
Cut out the nonsense.

33
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,769
That guy is a crook.

34
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,098
I'm kicking him out soon,
and I need you to cooperate.

35
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:00,442
I knew it. The person
who can bring Joo Dan Tae down is...

36
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,599
Joo Dan Tae himself.

37
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:08,313
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

38
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:21,363
(Logan Lee)

39
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:27,963
(7 months ago, Japan)

40
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,833
It's time for your medicine, Baek Jun Ki.

41
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:39,598
If you want to get out of here,

42
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:42,809
do as I say, Joo Dan Tae.

43
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:48,983
Who are you?

44
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,042
At 2:00 AM tomorrow,

45
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,996
when the shift changes,
the power will go out for one minute.

46
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:55,870
I'll leave the door unlocked.

47
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,233
Take the emergency stairs
to the parking lot.

48
00:03:58,313 --> 00:04:01,630
There will be a car
waiting with the emergency lights on.

49
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,738
Get in the car.

50
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:05,400
What are you talking about?
Tell me who you are first.

51
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,422
This is your only chance.

52
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:09,541
Do you want to rot in a loony bin
for the rest of your life...

53
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,968
or come out into the world?
It's up to you.

54
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,250
Until we meet again,

55
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,399
lie low and pay your expenses with this.

56
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:18,705
(Logan Lee)

57
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:20,721
Wait.

58
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:22,874
Stop there.

59
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:24,937
Wait.

60
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:26,665
Don't go.

61
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:30,533
(Logan Lee)

62
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:37,873
Logan.

63
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:52,053
(Shim Su Ryeon)

64
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:00,034
I hoped I was wrong.

65
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:05,583
Are you the one who took my seal?

66
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:07,871
Did Dad make you do it?

67
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,174
How far are you planning to go?

68
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,652
Shouldn't you know better?
How could you steal?

69
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:15,213
It's because you try
to take things away from me.

70
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,598
Why would I do that?

71
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:22,976
I know you have your eyes
on this penthouse.

72
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:24,818
Do you believe your dad?

73
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,616
He's trying to come between you and me...

74
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:30,627
And you're trying
to come between me and Dad.

75
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,375
At least Dad tried to help me.

76
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:37,954
By stealing exam papers for you?

77
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:39,641
Is that what you mean?

78
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:43,753
At least he didn't kick me out of school
like you did.

79
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,655
You ruined my life, Mom.

80
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:48,221
You don't deserve to be my mom.

81
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:50,378
Stop blaming other people.
You're not a kid anymore.

82
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:53,899
What ruined your life
is the choice you made.

83
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:57,540
I'm tired of feeling disappointed in you.

84
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:01,767
How much longer
do you think I'll tolerate you?

85
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,528
What you did is a crime
and should be reported to the police.

86
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:06,856
Go ahead and report it.

87
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:09,667
Put me behind bars like Dad.

88
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:10,855
That would settle this.

89
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,041
You're not even my real mom, so why not?

90
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:20,645
You disgust me.

91
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,215
Seok Kyung!

92
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,762
Seok Kyung!

93
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:34,016
Stay strong.

94
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:40,331
Stay strong.

95
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,823
(Incident Log, Affidavit)

96
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:48,996
Yoo Dong Pil.

97
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:52,172
Yoo Dong Pil killed Kim Mi Sook?

98
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:56,039
Why? There must be a reason.

99
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,708
They met for the first time that day,

100
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:00,771
so he didn't have a grudge.

101
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:03,974
They got into a fight. Supposedly,
he lost control and killed her.

102
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:07,453
That's ridiculous.

103
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,738
Why would he kill Hye In's birth mom?

104
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:11,142
This is a coincidence?

105
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,809
But there is something
that's kind of suspicious.

106
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,710
What do you mean?

107
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,885
Before Yoo Dong Pil turned himself in,

108
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:22,414
the police had suspected someone else
of the murder.

109
00:07:24,882 --> 00:07:27,997
He sent the victim a large sum of money.

110
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:29,249
And...

111
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:33,237
he spoke with her often
until just before she died.

112
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:34,987
(Call history)

113
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:37,941
The number's listed there.

114
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:39,991
Whose number is this?

115
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:41,521
The number...

116
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:45,488
is registered
to the company J King Holdings.

117
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,214
Joo Dan Tae.

118
00:07:58,248 --> 00:08:00,140
I made this all night long.

119
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,316
Have some, son.

120
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:04,521
I don't eat veggies!

121
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,302
I saw the news about Cheonsoo District.

122
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:13,829
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

123
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:15,299
My gosh.

124
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,395
I looked down on it for being a landfill.

125
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,463
But it'll be a new town again.

126
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:24,081
How many units did you buy there?

127
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:26,715
You took all of mine,
so it's more than 10, right?

128
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:28,562
Give them back to me.

129
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,508
I'll pay a premium for them.

130
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:31,967
Seriously.

131
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:36,416
Let's set the record straight.

132
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,049
When the land was worth nothing,

133
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:41,389
you made your son pay you back
for every last cent.

134
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,595
But now, you want to buy it back?

135
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:47,436
I'm not interested. Get out.

136
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,013
What did you just say?

137
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:53,561
Did you just tell your mom to get out?

138
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,655
Kyu Jin decided
to cut off even his parents.

139
00:08:58,735 --> 00:09:03,312
Thanks to Cheonsoo District,
we can make a comeback easily on our own.

140
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:06,014
Money isn't enough.
A person needs prestige.

141
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,219
You lost your post as an assemblyman
and lost your law license.

142
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,974
How will you make a comeback?

143
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:15,430
There's something called trends,
Madam Wang.

144
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,392
Cultural businesses are all the rage now.

145
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:19,535
We're running...

146
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:23,007
to become the director
of Cheong A Art Center.

147
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:24,847
Director of Cheong A Art Center?

148
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,090
That belongs to Cheong A Group.

149
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,153
How... How will you become the director?

150
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,666
Do you think...

151
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:34,183
they'll jump at the opportunity
and hire you?

152
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:37,327
Just wait and see!

153
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,815
If Min Hyuk gets into Seoul University,

154
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:43,215
I'll let him have solo recitals every day
at Cheong A Art Center!

155
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:46,079
I, Kyu Jin, promise to run for director!

156
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,978
I'll do anything
and everything for Min Hyuk.

157
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:53,305
Unlike someone
who never visited her son once in prison!

158
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,190
I won't be like you! Got that?

159
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:03,103
You'll be at the completion ceremony
for Cheong A Art Center, right?

160
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:05,374
Of course. It's mine.

161
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,397
What do you mean?
We haven't picked a director yet.

162
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:12,505
We're accepting applicants
as a formality for publicity.

163
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,976
It has been decided internally
that I'll be the director.

164
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:18,813
Publicize it well
so that our stock price will go up.

165
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:22,284
We'll have a music competition
when we have our grand opening.

166
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,379
If we make the prize 300,000 dollars...

167
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:27,302
and give them a chance to be hired
as a musician at Cheong A Art Hall,

168
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:29,301
the top musicians will line up.

169
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:32,852
Shouldn't the winner
get an exemption from military service?

170
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,701
Why is that? For Seok Hoon?

171
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:44,354
The competition can't be a front
for making Eun Byeol shine.

172
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,001
We want it to look fair.

173
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,940
It would look shady
if the director's daughter wins.

174
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:52,163
It's discrimination if she can't win...

175
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:54,126
just because
she's the director's daughter.

176
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:57,877
Her skills aren't enough
to say it's discrimination.

177
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,352
You know that.

178
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:01,977
That's funny
coming from Seok Kyung's father.

179
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,972
Your daughter was expelled...

180
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:05,959
-and didn't even graduate.
-What?

181
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,354
I have to get ready for work.
Please leave.

182
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,274
You didn't forget our manual, did you?

183
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,580
We must remain a distance even at home.

184
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,642
Get lost.

185
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:23,173
Good morning.

186
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:30,737
How long will you cling on like a leech?

187
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:33,598
I'll get you a hotel room,
so get out of my home!

188
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,894
Why? Are you uncomfortable?

189
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:40,834
I like living with you again.

190
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:43,397
It brings back memories.

191
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:48,910
How many years did you freeload off of us?

192
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,281
Should I remind you,

193
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,018
Baek Jun Ki?

194
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:56,319
I dropped that name years ago.

195
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:58,833
Dropping it doesn't make it go away.

196
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,741
If you don't want to see me anymore,

197
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:05,739
bring me 50 percent
of the shares of Cheong A Group.

198
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,514
I won't accept a single percent less.

199
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,427
What right do you have to covet my money?

200
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,655
You built the company
using my parents' money.

201
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,470
I think I have the right.

202
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,487
That's right.

203
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,368
Su Ryeon is as beautiful as ever.

204
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:25,429
She looks the same as when she was young.

205
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,928
You met Su Ryeon? When?

206
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:30,367
It's sad she doesn't remember me.

207
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:32,732
But we were just so young.

208
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:36,380
She was my first love.

209
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:38,960
My father always said...

210
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,724
I should marry someone like her.

211
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,670
Was that why you wanted her so badly?

212
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:49,739
Enough to steal my name, Joo Dan Tae?

213
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:50,965
Shut it.

214
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:55,888
I thought the decor looked familiar.

215
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:59,524
It looks a lot like our old home.

216
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:03,803
I hear your daughter
is studying classical singing.

217
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:07,631
You must've been jealous
that my mom was a classical singer.

218
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,454
You only listen to classical music,
enjoy wine,

219
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,525
and have severe OCD.

220
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:16,672
You're just like my father.

221
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:21,348
It must've been your dream
to live like my father.

222
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:22,866
I said to shut it.

223
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:26,412
Oh, my gosh!

224
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:29,213
What are you doing to a guest?

225
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:32,599
Are you okay, Jun Ki? Oh, my gosh.

226
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:34,837
I'm okay.

227
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,851
I teased him a little.

228
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,905
I said something that he hates...

229
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:40,932
and he got angry.

230
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,800
You know how proud he is.

231
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:47,087
That's probably
how he made a success of himself.

232
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,769
What do you mean?

233
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,105
Dan Tae...

234
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,309
is the son
of a successful Korean-Japanese man.

235
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:56,260
I heard everyone in Osaka
knows his father.

236
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,552
Is that what he said?

237
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:02,658
If that's what he said, it must be true.

Gosh. Mr. Chairman. Hello, sir.

00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,662
It's still under construction?

243
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:27,835
How long do you plan to drag it out?

244
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:30,695
The sewer is badly clogged.

245
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,070
We have to remove...

246
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,284
the pipes in the walls
to identify the cause.

247
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:35,492
Hurry it up.

248
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:37,281
This is ugly.

249

250
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,613
I'm sorry, sir.
We'll have it fixed in a few days.

251
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:42,900

257
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:02,593
No, I don't.

258
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:05,824
Then did you kill someone...

259
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:07,957
you didn't even know?

260
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:13,181
I have no idea what you're saying,
Unit 4502.

261
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,228
I'm busy, so...

262
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:18,112
Tell me why you killed her.

263
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:20,901
The woman you killed six years ago...

264
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,465
was Su Ryeon's daughter's birth mom.

265
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:25,568
You knew that, didn't you?

266
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:31,153
I understand that everyone knows
about my time in prison,

267
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,539
but this is out of line.

268
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:37,489
I don't know her and I paid my dues.

269
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,246
So stop with your nonsense.

270
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:42,806
Don't try to play dumb.

271
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:45,362
The body was never found.

272
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:47,409
You weren't even a suspect.

273
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,978
So why did you turn yourself in?

274
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:51,224
Get out of my way!

275
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:54,589
You killed a complete stranger
whom you had nothing against.

276
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:56,037
How are you so brazen?

277
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:58,504
Should I say what really happened?

278
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,575
You were wronged too,

279
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:03,342
if you were in prison for six years
because of Dan Tae.

280
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,019
Dan Tae was involved, wasn't he?

281
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,786
Did he tell you
to kill Hye In's birth mom?

282
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:17,454
Yoon Hee. You should shut your mouth.

283
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,203
Otherwise, you'll end up dead too.

284
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:23,732
You didn't really kill her, did you?

285
00:16:24,873 --> 00:16:26,796
If you took the fall for Dan Tae...

286
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:28,126
Shut it!

287
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:32,351

How can a criminal be so shameless?

At SNU's performance exam,
before you went in to sing,

did you meet Seok Kyung?

No. I was with Ms. Jin all along.

00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,341
We're leaving.

330
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:24,393
Help me.

331
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:31,815
Seok Hoon.

332
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,001
I need to ask for a favour.

333
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:52,253
(Director Inauguration Performance)

334
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:14,928
Father, look.

335
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,462
Eventually,

336
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,936
I completed your dream,
Cheong A Art Center.

337
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:38,655
Gosh, Seo Jin, the stage suits you.

338
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:42,267
Congratulations
on completing Cheong A Art Center.

339
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:46,005
It would've opened long ago
had you not been imprisoned.

340
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:48,426
It's as big as an opera house.

341
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:50,958
It's so grand, Ms. Cheon.

342
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,527
I guarantee
it will become the greatest culture spot.

343
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:58,630
From the design to all the finishings,
every single detail went through me.

344
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,094
As soon as the news went out...

345
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,217
of the opening,
Cheong A's shares skyrocketed.

346
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:05,072
How did you know...

347
00:21:05,152 --> 00:21:07,481
to build something like this
in Cheonsoo District?

348
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:11,245
I can't wait to find out
who'll be the center director.

349
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:15,619
Kyu Jin applied for the job too.

350
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:20,540
I practiced for this day
since you were an assemblyman.

351
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,799
Trust me. I'll do anything it takes
to get you elected.

352
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:28,970
Honey, darling, you are the best
and most supportive wife ever.

353
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,653
I applied too.

354
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:35,065
You too, Ms. Kang?

355
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:38,066
If Cheong A Arts High School
is child's play,

356
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:41,834
Cheong A Art Center is a global game.

357
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:45,011
If you get everything you want,
would that be life?

358
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:47,913
You should weigh your background first.

359
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:49,440
To be eligible for the position,

360
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,259
you must own over five percent of shares
in the center.

361
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:54,057
I heard Cheonsoo District's value went up.

362
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,018
Are you all suddenly loaded?

363
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:58,473
The last thing we rich people
can invest in...

364
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:00,601
is art, isn't it?

365
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,981
Right.

366
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:19,636
Wait.

367
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:21,980
Yoon Hee,
you were invited to the ceremony too?

368
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,417
It's nice to see you all.

369
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:26,258
I'm here to apply to be the director.

370
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:29,145
You, the center director?

371
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:31,789
You're involved in everything.

372
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:33,817
Don't do this. You'll just look bad.

373
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:37,354
A murderer
wants to get into the art business?

374
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:40,709
Do you know the conditions to apply?

375
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,115
Of course, I do.

376
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:45,284
Don't you know
I own 20 percent of this place?

377
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,190
-Twenty percent?
-What?

378
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,405
Twenty percent?

379
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:55,823
I guess none of you knew.

380
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:58,586
But then, maybe you didn't know
because my company bought it.

381
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,065
Seo Jin,
I believe you own about 15 percent.

382
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:05,918
If we count just the shares,

383
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:09,161
I could become director over you.

384
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:12,901
That's just nonsense.
How can you own 20 percent?

385
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:14,954
I love the feel of the stage.

386
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:16,252
It's fantastic.

387
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:22,136
It's time for the ceremony.
Shouldn't we head over?

388
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:25,724
I'll go and take my seat first.

389
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:34,967
What on earth are you up to, Oh Yoon Hee?

390
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:44,833
(Cheong A Art Center
Grand Opening Ceremony)

391
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:48,923
(Cheong A Art Center
Grand Opening Ceremony)

392
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:52,662
Thank you.

393
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:01,460
That's crazy.

394
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,166
Oh Yoon Hee took Logan's money?

395
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:06,730
Ten billion dollars of it?

396
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,836
How did his money end up with her
and not Shim Su Ryeon?

397
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:15,018
While Su Ryeon was missing,
Yoon Hee befriended Logan in the US.

398
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:17,326
She got close to him on purpose.

399
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:19,876
That's how she got JohnBIO's investment.

400
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:23,453
You're right. Logan owns JohnBIO.

401
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:28,987
That means that woman
stole the key to Logan's safe.

402
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,867
-What?
-How else could she...

403
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:35,002
have taken 10 billion dollars?
That much money...

404
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,963
Can you even imagine the amount?

405
00:24:38,197 --> 00:24:42,464
Do you think
Oh Yoon Hee actually killed Logan?

406
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:44,173
Why don't I?

407
00:24:44,253 --> 00:24:47,581
She's the only one
who benefited from his death.

408
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,784
How else could she ever buy...

409
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,943
as much as 20 percent of this art center?

410
00:24:54,023 --> 00:24:56,398
That makes no sense whatsoever.

411
00:24:56,478 --> 00:25:00,246
Chairman Joo,
you need to tread really carefully.

412
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,261
Logan's dead anyway.

413
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,573
The rightful owner's gone.

414
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:08,797
Let's take the 10 billion from Yoon Hee.

415
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:12,808
How can we do that
when we don't even know where it is?

416
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,602
We have bullets.

417
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,863
Bullet number one, Yoo Dong Pil.

418
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:19,865
He already has a record.

419
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:22,465
The first murder charge is hard to take.

420
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:23,825
It gets easier from there.

421
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:26,227
Bullet number two, Ha Yoon Chul.

422
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:28,891
Bang. What do you think?

423
00:25:40,692 --> 00:25:41,922
What happened?

424
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:44,992
Did you know Yoon Hee
bought Cheong A Art Center's shares?

425
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:46,631
What do you mean?

426
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,391
Did you two gang up against me?

427
00:25:49,471 --> 00:25:50,806
To mess with me?

428
00:25:51,378 --> 00:25:54,755
Tell the truth now
or I will break our pact.

429
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:56,075
I'd never heard of it.

430
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,838
I didn't know she owned any shares.

431
00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:01,344
You acted like you were blood sisters.

432
00:26:01,705 --> 00:26:03,933
What do you know about that woman?

433
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:06,619
A rumour's spreading in Hera Palace...

434
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,095
that Yoon Hee
took 10 billion of Logan's money.

435
00:26:09,175 --> 00:26:10,357
That's nonsense.

436
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:14,704
Don't fall for groundless rumours
and keep a close eye on Dan Tae.

437
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:18,946
Other than killing Joo Dan Tae,
I care of nothing else.

438
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,625
You always get stabbed in the back
because you're so stupid.

439
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:25,864
The money Yoon Hee's spending is Logan's,
I'm sure of it.

440
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,821
You lost all that and you don't care?

441
00:26:29,362 --> 00:26:30,636
What an idiot.

442
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:37,683
(Bank of Seoul)

443
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:40,860
Turn everything here into one check.

444
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:43,641
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:50,263
(Bank of Seoul)

446
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:58,061
There she is.

447
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:24,661
Welcome. I've been waiting for you.

448
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:31,791
How's the store?

449
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:33,949
Where have you been?

450
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:37,219
The completion ceremony
for the Cheong A Art Center.

451
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:39,682
I'm running for the center director.

452
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,139
Ever since Cheonsoo District
got reselected as the new town,

453
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:46,088
everyone has been eyeing
the center director position.

454
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:47,166
But...

455
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:50,500
how did you afford to buy the share?

456
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,137
Got investment from someone I know.

457
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:54,863
Investment?

458
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:57,790
I thought the value would rise a bit
once Cheong A Art Hall opens.

459
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:03,792
What was it you wanted to discuss?

460
00:28:03,872 --> 00:28:05,884
Did Seok Kyung do something again?

461
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,010
Joo Dan Tae...

462
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:12,206
asked Seok Kyung to steal my seal.

463
00:28:12,546 --> 00:28:13,687
What?

464
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:17,508
Now he's making his daughter steal?

465
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:19,751
He is insane!

466
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:22,990
So, what did he do with the seal?

467
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:26,775
The owner of lot 27
and the penthouse has changed.

468
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,601
They're now jointly owned
by Joo Dan Tae and Seok Hoon.

469
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:31,675
Joint name with Seok Hoon?

470
00:28:31,937 --> 00:28:34,678
Why would it be under Seok Hoon
when Seok Kyung stole the seal?

471
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:37,443
And Seok Hoon hates his father.

472
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:39,044
I don't know why.

473
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,883
Whether it's to make Seok Hoon
and Seok Kyung turn against each other.

474
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,696
I don't understand how someone...

475
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:52,060
can use their children to this extent.

476
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,814
Joo Dan Tae is just human garbage.

477
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,287
How can a father...

478
00:29:03,063 --> 00:29:06,034
No way. It can't be.

479
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:08,301
What?

480
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:12,584
Su Ryeon,
the hospital where you had your baby...

481
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:15,089
Didn't you say it closed?

482
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:19,690
Yes, I heard it closed
because the director passed away.

483
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,043
So there's no way to check the files now.

484
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:24,298
What about them?

485
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:32,132
Su Ryeon, there's something...

486
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,383
I haven't been able to tell you.

487
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:40,630
Ma'am, you have a visitor.

488
00:29:42,643 --> 00:29:45,153
I didn't know someone was here.
I can come back...

489
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:47,579
No, no. I was leaving.

490
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:48,981
Come in.

491
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:51,994
I'll talk to you soon, Su Ryeon.

492
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,192
What happened?

493
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:07,496
What if people see you?

494
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:10,297
I'm sorry. There's something urgent
I needed to discuss.

495
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:14,525
I think Cheon Seo Jin realized
who Joo Dan Tae is.

496
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:17,832
She saw the wanted poster I had.

497
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:19,812
We can't hide it forever.

498
00:30:21,043 --> 00:30:22,332
Don't worry.

499
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,889
She won't be able to talk to Dan Tae
that easily.

500
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:33,609
You wore the ring.

501
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:40,394
How is the investigation
for Logan's case going?

502
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:43,768
The dash-cams and CCTVs
have all been burned,

503
00:30:43,848 --> 00:30:45,721
so there's not much left.

504
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:50,295
It's not easy to prove
it was Dan Tae wearing an old man costume.

505
00:30:53,181 --> 00:30:54,498
It must be hard.

506
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:59,136
You can cry if you want.

507
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:01,488
I know how it feels.

508
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,453
When you lose someone you love
right in front of your eyes...

509
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,881
I've been there.

510
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:14,820
You might not remember,

511
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,289
but I've seen you when I was young.

512
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:18,904
At the Simoon Construction picnic.

513
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:20,587
You did?

514
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:23,160
I don't remember at all.

515
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:27,455
Your father really trusted
and liked my father.

516
00:31:27,743 --> 00:31:30,530
That's why he allowed for the marriage,
I assume.

517
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:34,504
He was very upset...

518
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:36,758
when he heard
he unfairly passed away in Japan.

519
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:42,590
You were just as beautiful then.

520
00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:49,503
I hope you can smile a lot as well,
just like you used to.

521
00:31:50,263 --> 00:31:52,338
Let me take care of Joo Dan Tae.

522
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:05,530
Can we talk for a second?

523
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:09,641
Sorry, but I have plans.

524
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:15,358
I happened to see you this morning,
talking to Mr. Yoo...

525
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:17,559
about things
you shouldn't be talking about.

526
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:20,755
Watch what you say.

527
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:24,939
I hate it
when other people mention my name.

528
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:28,379
You must be really paranoid
about something...

529
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:31,408
to decide to come see me at work
and tell me to shut my mouth.

530
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:36,727
Mr. Yoo feels that
he was treated unfairly in many areas.

531
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:38,415
Watch yourself.

532
00:32:39,017 --> 00:32:42,274
If you're living an undeserved life
with someone else's money,

533
00:32:42,354 --> 00:32:45,376
just take care of your daughter
and stay quiet and out of the way.

534
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,376
You're wondering about...

535
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:53,598
the 10 billion Logan left behind?

536
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,487
You're still you.

537
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:02,385
Didn't change at all.

538
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:05,415
Straightforward.
Making people feel uncomfortable.

539
00:33:05,495 --> 00:33:09,262
Joo Dan Tae.
You haven't changed at all, either.

540
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,171
Smells some money and jumps at it
as if it's all yours.

541
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:16,441
It's you spending the money
as if it's yours.

542
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:21,872
Did you kill Logan
to get his 10 billion dollars?

543
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:26,065
Do you want to know where the money is?

544
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:30,654
If you answer my question correctly,

545
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:33,137
I'll let you know where it went.

546
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:35,875
One of the twins...

547
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,682
that Su Ryeon had in America.

548
00:33:41,243 --> 00:33:42,438
What did you do with her?

549
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,744
What are you talking about?

550
00:33:49,214 --> 00:33:51,630
Not Seol A,
whom you exchanged with Hye In.

551
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,761
There was one more.

552
00:33:54,253 --> 00:33:57,244
Su Ryeon thinks that the child died
while giving birth,

553
00:33:57,324 --> 00:33:59,514
but she was born perfectly healthy.

554
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:02,244
You did something at that hospital
in America, didn't you?

555
00:34:02,324 --> 00:34:04,585
What did you do? Did you kill her?

556
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:06,793
Did you kill her like you killed Seol A?

557
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:08,594
Don't talk gibberish.

558
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:11,530
You told Yoo Dong Pil
to kill Hye In's birth mother, didn't you?

559
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,494
Or, did you kill her yourself?

560
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,385
What kind of threats were you under,

561
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:19,698
to send her that much money
and then kill her later?

562
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:22,436
What was the reason
you had to kill Kim Mi Sook?

563
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:23,806
You little...

564
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:27,988
Always so annoying.

565
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,070
Just stay in your place.

566
00:34:31,122 --> 00:34:32,434
I swear...

567
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:35,097
Su Ryeon will end up dead because of you.

568
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:36,394
Watch it happen.

569
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,223
You scumbag...

570
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:40,766
You scumbag!

571
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,661
Yes, let's see what happens!
Let's see who ends up dying!

572
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:53,020
Su Ryeon had twins.

573
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:55,046
Did you know that?

574
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,400
Twins?

575
00:34:57,768 --> 00:34:59,068
No, I had no idea.

576
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:03,866
After her ex-husband was murdered
in America,

577
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:11,260
she had twins in a coma.

578
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,570
She said she had a miscarriage with one,

579
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:16,219
and miraculously gave birth to the other.

580
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:19,679
But I've secretly been looking
into this at that hospital in the US.

581
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:23,248
They said one kid was born 2.5 kilograms,
a relatively healthy weight,

582
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,800
and was released early
in a self-breathing state.

583
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:29,288
And the kid who was born 1.4 kilograms...

584
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:32,272
and was then transferred to Korea...

585
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:35,409
was Seol A.

586
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,943
So then...

587
00:35:37,993 --> 00:35:40,568
Seol A's twin is alive?

588
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,833
Where is she?

589
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,149
Are you sure she's alive?

590
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,925
We must tell Su Ryeon immediately.

591
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:51,001
She would be so happy...

592
00:35:51,346 --> 00:35:54,321
if she found out that a child
she'd known to be dead is actually alive.

593
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:55,982
But I have a feeling...

594
00:35:57,448 --> 00:36:00,313
that child may already be dead.

595
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:03,865
If Joo Dan Tae had already worked on it
back then.

596
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,809
I don't want Su Ryeon to get hurt again.

597
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:11,631
We can look into it first,
and then tell her later.

598
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:15,366
Can you help me...

599
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:18,107
look for that child?

600
00:36:19,797 --> 00:36:21,127
Please.

601
00:36:21,207 --> 00:36:24,090
I don't care if you use all the money
to look for that child.

602
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,235
I promise to find that child
and bring her back to Su Ryeon.

603
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:31,090
I swear.

604
00:36:36,483 --> 00:36:37,939
Darn it.

605
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:40,341
How much does she really know?

606
00:36:41,214 --> 00:36:42,587
She couldn't possibly know...

607
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:46,205
that child happens to be alive?

608
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:52,173
Ha Eun Byeol!

609
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:53,860
Can we talk?

610
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,769
Eun Byeol is busy.
And she has nothing to say to you.

611
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:58,561
When are you going to apologize?

612
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:00,546
You tried to kill me with that trophy.

613
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,874
Even if you pretend nothing happened,
the truth doesn't change.

614
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,373
This is unfair.

615
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:07,539
You ruined my performance test.
Aren't we even now?

616
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:10,224
Don't even react to her. Let's go.

617
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,666
Where do you think you're going?

618
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,174
-Is she serious?
-Withdraw your appeal.

619
00:37:17,254 --> 00:37:19,352
I was unfairly disqualified
because of you.

620
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:21,799
You did that on purpose, didn't you?
You knew you weren't good enough,

621
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:24,129
so you played a trick
to have me disqualified, didn't you?

622
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,598
-Hey! Let go!
-What's going on?

623
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,846
-Calm down.
-Eun Byeol!

624
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:30,988
-Eun Byeol!
-Let go!

625
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:34,035
-Hey, Bae Ro Na! Stop right now!
-My gosh.

626
00:37:34,115 --> 00:37:35,349
Hey, move!

627
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:40,457
-Eun Byeol!
-Oh, my.

628
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:44,290
Eun Byeol!

629
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,489
Hey, get out of my way!

630
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:50,715
Let go! Move!

631
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:52,223
Her head is bleeding.

632
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,183
What? Bleeding?

633
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:56,529
Hey! Move!

634
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:59,139
Eun Byeol.

635
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:02,868
Hey! What did you do?

636
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,936
What did you do to my daughter?

637
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,203
Are you going to hit her?

638
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:09,124
-Let go!
-Take her to the infirmary.

639
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,494
Let go!

640
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:12,577
Eun Byeol, are you okay?

641
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,577
Jenny!

642
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,095
Did you just push her?

643
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,176
-Eun Byeol!
-Hold her.

644
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:24,590
-Hold her.
-Eun Byeol!

645
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,663
This counts as assault.

646
00:38:26,743 --> 00:38:29,146
-Eun Byeol, your mom is here!
-Why are you just standing?

647
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:30,760
-Hold her tight.
-Eun Byeol!

648
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,526
(Infirmary)

649
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:36,346
Eun Byeol, are you okay? Eun Byeol!

650
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:38,840
Eun Byeol...

651
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,397
Where did she go?

652
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:53,454
Wait at my place. Here.

653
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,958
We'll keep her distracted. Stay put.

654
00:38:57,727 --> 00:38:58,930
Do you understand?

655
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,200
If I get caught, she'll kill me.

656
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,938
That's not going to happen.
Don't open the door to anyone.

657
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:07,811
She might track you down.
Keep your phone turned off.

658
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:09,975
Eun Byeol!

659
00:39:10,357 --> 00:39:11,832
Sir, please leave.

660
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:17,178
Hey, it's your doing, isn't it?
Where's Eun Byeol?

661
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:18,678
What are you doing?

662
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:20,968
-What happened?
-I know you hid her away.

663
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:23,254
Where's Eun Byeol? Tell me!

664
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:25,944
What are you talking about?

665
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:27,644
I just took her to the infirmary.

666
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:30,644
Stop lying. Do you think I'm stupid?

667
00:39:30,724 --> 00:39:35,074
Eun Byeol must have run away
so she wouldn't have to apologize.

668
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:36,747
Tell her this when you find her.

669
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:38,778
If she doesn't kneel
and apologize immediately,

670
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:41,072
I'll let the entire country
know what she's done.

671
00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:44,493
Let's go.

672
00:39:44,922 --> 00:39:46,613
Hey, where do you think you're going?

673
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:48,676
Tell me where Eun Byeol is!

674
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:52,809
Eun Byeol. I need to find her.

675
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:55,158
Where could she be? Eun Byeol...

676
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:05,084
-How do I look?
-You look so pretty.

677
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,129
Let's try these on.

678
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:10,623
Okay.

679
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,977
She's still following us.

680
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:23,006
Pretend you don't notice her.

681
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:25,237
She won't give up
unless we completely ignore her.

682
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:34,115
Have you been following
what Mr. Yoo is up to?

683
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:37,000
-There's nothing suspicious.
-"Nothing suspicious?"

684
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,106
After having dinner with Jenny,
he's relaxing at home now.

685
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:42,338
I understand.

686
00:40:47,853 --> 00:40:51,557
You know how much I care about you, right?

687
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,182
Of course, Mr. Joo.

688
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:57,193
Go ahead.

689
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:05,979
Here's what Yoo Dong Pil's been up to
for the past week.

690
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:11,160
On Monday at 3:00 AM, using a crowbar,
he damaged the fountain drain on purpose.

691
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,775
It was also him...

692
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:15,204
who put a fish head in the fountain
on Tuesday and created an odour.

693
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:17,922
Since Wednesday,
he's been repairing the fountain,

694
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:19,334
and here are some pictures.

695
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,543
Just what is hidden in that fountain?

696
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:29,549
Why does Mr. Yoo have to go this far?

697
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:31,376
And you.

698
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:35,286
I wonder why...

699
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:39,959
you lied to me.

700
00:41:44,256 --> 00:41:47,866
He's been stuck in that fountain all day,

701
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,014
and you're telling me
he had dinner with Jenny at home?

702
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:53,263
During the five years
Yoo Dong Pil was away,

703
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:55,487
I thought you became my guy.

704
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:57,737
But you're apparently still his guy.

705
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:01,651
You left
all the important information out.

706
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,751
Did that thug tell you to do that?

707
00:42:06,573 --> 00:42:09,186
I... I'm sorry, Mr. Joo.

708
00:42:15,444 --> 00:42:17,607
Don't you want to see them again?

709
00:42:18,256 --> 00:42:20,593
I mean your parents in your hometown.

710
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:23,621
Please forgive me. I beg you.

711
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:26,495
Please forgive me, Mr. Joo.

712
00:42:26,575 --> 00:42:30,118
I'll never lie to you again.

713
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:33,705
I'm way too soft-hearted.

714
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,195
I already feel...

715
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:40,203
What should I do with this guy?

716
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:46,941
Find out
what Mr. Yoo hid in that fountain.

717
00:42:47,021 --> 00:42:50,561
Also,
find out what Oh Yoon Hee's plan is.

718
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:56,217
This is your last chance
to save your family.

719
00:42:57,464 --> 00:42:58,600
Understood?

720
00:42:59,855 --> 00:43:00,875
Take him away.

721
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:17,007
Come to think of it,
that woman's body was never found...

722
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:19,821
when we scoured
the entire Cheongpyeong Dam.

723
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:21,810
Why?

724
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:24,795
The fountain?

725
00:43:25,388 --> 00:43:29,076
The very fountain
where the woman died stopped working?

726
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:33,818
Yoo Dong Pil.

727
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:47,832
The owner of lot 27
and the penthouse has changed.

728
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:50,982
They're now jointly owned
by Joo Dan Tae and Seok Hoon.

729
00:43:51,968 --> 00:43:55,291
Whether it's to make Seok Hoon
and Seok Kyung turn against each other.

730
00:43:55,743 --> 00:43:58,615
I don't understand how someone...

731
00:43:59,229 --> 00:44:01,325
can use their children to this extent.

732
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:05,815
No way. What am I thinking?

733
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:13,761
Hold on. A psycho like Joo Dan Tae...

734
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,564
might want to keep his enemy close
and torture them.

735
00:44:16,932 --> 00:44:18,571
I need to find out.

736
00:44:20,846 --> 00:44:21,974
Ro Na.

737
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,074
Why are you eating so much at night?

738
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,942
Now that my performance test is over,
I feel so relieved.

739
00:44:29,022 --> 00:44:30,469
I keep feeling hungry.

740
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:33,632
All right. Don't stay up too late.

741
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,808
Okay.

742
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:48,783
Eat.

743
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:55,470
Don't worry. I got rid of Ms. Jin.

744
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:58,842
She won't come here for a while.

745
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:01,498
But...

746
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:03,900
Why is she like that toward you?

747
00:45:04,443 --> 00:45:05,800
I don't know.

748
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,095
She loses it and gets angry
if I even mention my mom.

749
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:10,283
She's becoming more and more obsessive.

750
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,909
She can't handle it
if she can't see me for a minute.

751
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:14,797
She calls 100 times a day.

752
00:45:17,112 --> 00:45:20,301
I think she was the one
who put my cell phone...

753
00:45:20,798 --> 00:45:22,290
in your pocket in the waiting room.

754
00:45:22,778 --> 00:45:24,978
What? Why would she do that?

755
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:26,447
I don't know.

756
00:45:26,813 --> 00:45:28,549
I can't read her.

757
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:34,389
Did you call your mom?

758
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:39,333
Eat and then call her.

759
00:45:39,983 --> 00:45:41,387
I'm sure she's waiting for you.

760
00:45:51,693 --> 00:45:52,978
That psycho...

761
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,665
Who is it at this hour?

762
00:45:58,273 --> 00:46:00,672
What? The security office.

763
00:46:01,573 --> 00:46:03,186
They said to pick up a package.

764
00:46:06,073 --> 00:46:07,175
Who is this?

765
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:08,849
Mom.

766
00:46:09,386 --> 00:46:10,508
Eun Byeol?

767
00:46:11,883 --> 00:46:14,371
Is something wrong? Are you sick?

768
00:46:15,198 --> 00:46:16,392
Well...

769
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:22,103
Why are you calling so late?

770
00:46:22,843 --> 00:46:23,950
Can you...

771
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,599
come get me now?

772
00:46:27,807 --> 00:46:29,671
I thought you were doing well
living with Ms. Jin.

773
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:31,583
You're the one who yelled at me
not to come.

774
00:46:31,975 --> 00:46:34,005
I'm busy with work too.

775
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:36,685
We have a guest staying with us,
so stay there for the time being.

776
00:46:37,048 --> 00:46:38,810
The CSAT is coming up too.

777
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,381
It's bad to change your environment.

778
00:46:45,424 --> 00:46:47,971
What's wrong?
Is your mom coming right now?

779
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,483
Mom...

780
00:46:54,393 --> 00:46:56,401
Hey. What's wrong?

781
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:08,307
Why did Eun Byeol call?
Does she want to come home?

782
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:10,752
She can't come here!

783
00:47:11,514 --> 00:47:13,202
No. Don't worry about it.

784
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:20,431
I'll go pick up my package.

785
00:47:22,895 --> 00:47:24,140
That psycho.

786
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:42,014
Have you lost your mind?
How dare you come here?

787
00:47:42,094 --> 00:47:44,488
Is... Is my Eun Byeol there?

788
00:47:44,568 --> 00:47:45,907
What are you talking about?

789
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:48,588
Eun Byeol... Eun Byeol is missing.

790
00:47:49,177 --> 00:47:52,117
I think Seok Hoon and Ro Na took her away,

791
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:53,743
but I can't find her anywhere.

792
00:47:53,823 --> 00:47:56,360
She isn't here.
Seo Jin doesn't seem to know either.

793
00:47:56,905 --> 00:47:59,557
Where did my daughter go?

794
00:47:59,637 --> 00:48:01,093
Make sure to find her.

795
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:04,111
I said to keep an eye on her.
She's Seo Jin's only weakness.

796
00:48:04,191 --> 00:48:06,496
If you don't find her, our deal is over.

797
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:08,257
Deal?

798
00:48:08,337 --> 00:48:11,604
I don't need any of that.
As long as I have my Eun Byeol.

799
00:48:11,684 --> 00:48:14,589
I only helped you because
you said we could leave the country.

800
00:48:14,669 --> 00:48:16,805
Do you think I care at all about you?

801
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:19,101
I never once saw you as a man.

802
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,547
Once I find my Eun Byeol,
we'll hide where no one can find us.

803
00:48:24,546 --> 00:48:26,201
Eun Byeol. My Eun Byeol.

804
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,080
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol.

805
00:48:31,053 --> 00:48:33,100
She won't be useful for very long either.

806
00:48:33,584 --> 00:48:35,663
Why are there so many psycho wenches
in my life?

807
00:48:41,163 --> 00:48:43,176
Did you not sleep well?

808
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,415
You don't look well.

809
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:47,983
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

810
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,853
I'll be fine soon.

811
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:57,165
I got this for you.

812
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:58,941
Read it when you can't fall asleep.

("Paradise Lost")

814
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:08,636
Thanks. I can't wait to read it.

815
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:11,711
Want to stay for breakfast?

816
00:49:12,642 --> 00:49:13,717
Should I?

817
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:15,933
I'll go wash my hands.

818
00:50:14,783 --> 00:50:16,131
Ms. Oh is at my place.

819
00:50:16,211 --> 00:50:17,665
She is? That's a relief.

820
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,370
Eun Byeol, you can come out.

821
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,989
My mom isn't home.

822
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:27,432
It's not much, but dig in.

823
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:31,099
Why are you being so nice to me?

824
00:50:32,277 --> 00:50:35,005
Bae Ro Na, why do you always
have to be the good one?

825
00:50:35,085 --> 00:50:37,265
You always make me look bad.

826
00:50:37,748 --> 00:50:39,147
And I hate you for that.

827
00:50:39,227 --> 00:50:42,305
Criticize me and hate me.
That would make me feel better.

828
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:45,480
What am I supposed to do?

829
00:50:53,213 --> 00:50:55,250
I still hate you.

830
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:58,246
And you still owe me a proper apology.

831
00:50:58,897 --> 00:51:01,599
But for now, I just want to help you.

832
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:03,063
That's how I feel.

833
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,252
I don't care
if I'm being nosy or a pushover.

834
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:07,787
What I know is
that you're not happy right now.

835
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:10,396
So stop crying and eat.
I'm tired of your whining.

836
00:51:14,227 --> 00:51:17,536
Please. Get it together, okay?

837
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:22,489
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

840
00:52:07,963 --> 00:52:10,361
Oh Yoon Hee
just arrived at a DNA test lab.

841
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:12,156
She came from the penthouse.

842
00:52:12,236 --> 00:52:13,820
I think she's doing a test on the kids.

843
00:52:14,612 --> 00:52:16,083
Stop the test by all means.

844
00:52:16,163 --> 00:52:17,816
No one can find out the truth.

845
00:52:17,896 --> 00:52:20,176
Tamper with the test or something.
Oh Yoon Hee can't know!

846
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:28,913
(Diagnostic Test Lab)

847
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:56,146
She knows everything.

848
00:52:57,668 --> 00:52:59,151
That pain Oh Yoon Hee.

849
00:53:01,243 --> 00:53:03,812
Life can be so tenacious.

(Kim Mi Sook's baby)

852
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:15,577
Well done. You did the right thing.

853
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:20,078
Again?

854
00:53:20,526 --> 00:53:22,695
You're out of money already?

855
00:53:22,775 --> 00:53:25,160
How much to make you shut your mouth?

856
00:53:25,784 --> 00:53:27,916
Today, I'm not here to talk about Hye In.

857
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:31,283
I found out something more shocking
and interesting.

858
00:53:33,273 --> 00:53:34,875
The twins' birth mom's name is...

859
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:37,405
Na Ae Gyo.

860
00:53:38,513 --> 00:53:39,592
What?

861
00:53:39,672 --> 00:53:42,176
She looks just like Shim Su Ryeon.

862
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,469
I happened to hear about Na Ae Gyo.

863
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:49,722
That you two were friends since childhood.

864
00:53:50,406 --> 00:53:51,479
But...

865
00:53:51,925 --> 00:53:54,910
Na Ae Gyo never gave birth to twins.

866
00:53:55,963 --> 00:53:59,917
Her birth was a hard one,
so all the OB-GYN nurses remember her.

867
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,173
Just to be sure,

868
00:54:02,692 --> 00:54:05,794
I compared your DNA to the twins'.

869
00:54:07,216 --> 00:54:08,492
One of them...

870
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,535
isn't yours.

871
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:14,659
The result is...

872
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:16,996
right here.

873
00:54:22,163 --> 00:54:23,865
You put in a lot of work.

874
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,728
But you did something pointless
just to take more money from me.

875
00:54:27,808 --> 00:54:28,934
So...

876
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,778
your point is,
pay you more this time, right?

877
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:33,904
I'm glad we're on the same page.

878
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:37,750
I really hope your beautiful wife
Shim Su Ryeon...

879
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,454
never has to suffer a dreadful shock.

880
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,395
One of the twins she gave birth to...

881
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:46,150
was swapped out with another baby
and abandoned,

882
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:49,279
while the other thinks
their real mom is their step-mom.

883
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:55,302
Doesn't this make you a monster,
not a husband?

884
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:04,732
Not to mention
you have an ex who looks just like her...

(Adhere to safety protocol)

If you know too much,

887
00:55:11,466 --> 00:55:14,004
this is what happens, Kim Mi Sook.

888
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:18,176
You sucked me dry for 10 years.
It's time you got sick of it.

889
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:22,319
But your head exploded
before your stomach did.

892
00:55:40,689 --> 00:55:41,830
What happened?

893
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,437
Don't let anyone come inside.

894
00:55:43,922 --> 00:55:46,198
The workers are returning
from their break.

895
00:55:46,278 --> 00:55:47,802
Just stop them!

896
00:55:50,813 --> 00:55:51,989
Did you kill her?

897
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,650
Mr. Yoo, I need your help.

898
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,899
Deal with her body for me.

899
00:56:05,979 --> 00:56:07,874
I'll make it up to you
for the rest of your life.

900
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:10,105
We've been colleagues for years.

901
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:11,510
No.

902
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:14,648
Dong Pil, my friend.
You'll help me, won't you?

903
00:56:15,194 --> 00:56:17,174
You are all I have.

904
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:20,259
You promised
you wouldn't let me get blood on my hands.

905
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:23,128
Please, Dong Pil. Bro!

906
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,310
Get out of here.
I'll deal with everything.

907
00:56:29,775 --> 00:56:31,662
You have to make sure nothing goes wrong.

908
00:56:31,742 --> 00:56:34,993
Take her far away,
where no one can find her.

909
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:36,913
So that no one
finds any prints or anything.

910
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,255
Get out!

911
00:56:38,712 --> 00:56:39,791
Okay.

Oh Yoon Hee.

914
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:04,071
If you keep poking around,

915
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:07,466
blood will flow in Hera Palace.

916
00:57:08,464 --> 00:57:10,935
Please, don't do anything.

917
00:57:11,573 --> 00:57:13,132
If not,

918
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,594
you will die.

919
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:31,455
I'll get a few things Eun Byeol needs.

920
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:34,472
You stay at home.
She'll be scared on her own.

921
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:36,371
She's inside. It's fine.

922
00:57:39,153 --> 00:57:41,158
I don't like sending you out alone.

923
00:57:44,063 --> 00:57:45,194
Shall we go together?

924
00:57:53,773 --> 00:57:57,418
I wondered where he was all day,
and he was with Ro Na?

925
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:01,537
Why is Eun Byeol here anyway?

-Are you hungry?
-No.

927

Shall we buy something?

928
00:58:07,769 --> 00:58:09,895
How about that tteokbokki?

Let go of me. I'm busy.

932
00:58:21,426 --> 00:58:24,157
Ha Eun Byeol. Are you looking for her?

933
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:28,093
Do you know where my Eun Byeol is?

934
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,146
I think I can help you.

935
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:47,886
Did Oh Yoon Hee say when she'd be back?

936
00:58:47,966 --> 00:58:50,733
No. She asked me
to get the results as soon as possible,

937
00:58:50,813 --> 00:58:52,167
but she hasn't been by yet.

938
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:55,457
When she comes,
give her the result I gave you.

She'd have come for it already

She caught on.

945

It's very important.

Call her and tell her to come home now.

okay?

01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:21,916
Tell me the truth.

975
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:25,774
How do you expect to work together
when you have so many secrets?

976
01:01:25,854 --> 01:01:28,120
If this is how you do things,
I quit working with you.

977
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:31,369
You and Yoon Hee both,
I just cannot trust.

978
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:35,630
You're right.

979
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,120
Baek Jun Ki.

980
01:01:38,873 --> 01:01:40,428
Logan brought him here.

981
01:01:41,324 --> 01:01:42,404
Logan?

982
01:01:43,263 --> 01:01:45,457
He holds Joo Dan Tae's weakness,

983
01:01:45,844 --> 01:01:48,404
and he's capable
of truly bringing him down.

984
01:01:49,403 --> 01:01:51,395
I know you searched his room.

985
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:54,049
Whatever you saw, whatever you know,

986
01:01:54,129 --> 01:01:56,657
keep your mouth shut
and don't tell Dan Tae.

987
01:01:56,957 --> 01:01:58,396
Things could go wrong.

988
01:02:00,493 --> 01:02:03,390
I'll explain everything
when Yoon Hee's here.

989
01:02:06,092 --> 01:02:08,518
The fried chicken and tteokbokki
set to go, please.

990
01:02:08,598 --> 01:02:09,974
A set to go.

991
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:13,247
Here you are, Seok Hoon.

992
01:02:15,303 --> 01:02:16,861
Are you here to get tteokbokki?

993
01:02:17,394 --> 01:02:18,772
Seok Kyung.

994
01:02:18,852 --> 01:02:20,112
Let's eat here together.

995
01:02:20,785 --> 01:02:22,564
We ordered it to go.

996
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:26,419
I see. Can I follow you to your place?

997
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:29,559
Let's just eat here.

998
01:02:39,773 --> 01:02:42,130
Fried chicken and tteokbokki
go surprisingly well together.

999
01:02:53,073 --> 01:02:55,243
(Mom)

1000
01:03:05,313 --> 01:03:06,833
I'm stalling them.

1001
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:08,583
(Seok Kyung)

1002
01:03:11,253 --> 01:03:14,574
-Eun Byeol, are you there?
-Mom?

1003
01:03:14,654 --> 01:03:17,181
Eun Byeol, it's your mom.

1004
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:20,708
I should've come sooner.

1005
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:21,954
I'm sorry.

1006
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:24,611
Come with me.

1007
01:03:26,248 --> 01:03:27,647
Mom!

1008
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,584
Mom!

1009
01:03:29,664 --> 01:03:30,663
Mom?

1010
01:03:31,164 --> 01:03:34,361
Eun Byeol, how have you been?
Are you well?

1011
01:03:34,868 --> 01:03:36,679
It's been so long.

1012
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:39,417
There you are, my girl.

1013
01:04:11,533 --> 01:04:12,753
Ms. Jin?

1014
01:04:13,509 --> 01:04:15,318
What are you doing?

1015
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:24,004
Eun Byeol! What's going on?

1016
01:04:24,084 --> 01:04:25,973
Eun Byeol!

1017
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:48,650
Why is she following me?

1018
01:04:50,183 --> 01:04:52,723
(TOEFL Preparation Institute)

1019
01:04:53,353 --> 01:04:54,917
I found Eun Byeol.

1020
01:04:54,997 --> 01:04:56,441
I'm being followed by Oh Yoon Hee.

1021
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:57,919
I'm trying to shake her off.

1022
01:04:57,999 --> 01:04:59,216
Help me.

1023
01:04:59,675 --> 01:05:00,938
Oh Yoon Hee?

1024
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:04,103
Oh Yoon Hee is there?

1025
01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:08,279
Then I should, of course, help you.

1026
01:05:08,359 --> 01:05:11,389
I'll send you an address. Lure her there.

1027
01:05:11,469 --> 01:05:12,688
I can take care of the rest.

1028
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,990
Get the car ready, punk!

1029
01:05:18,451 --> 01:05:19,537
Yes, sir.

1030
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,208
Hold on.

1031
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:25,051
Are you keeping an eye on Mr. Yoo?

1032
01:05:25,576 --> 01:05:26,705
Yes, sir.

1033
01:05:26,785 --> 01:05:28,201
Then call Seok Kyung...

1034
01:05:28,534 --> 01:05:30,548
and tell her to meet me
at the cottage in Gimpo.

1035
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:36,373
To get rid of Oh Yoon Hee,
I need people to help me.

1036
01:05:36,453 --> 01:05:39,815
Yoo Dong Pil, Jin Bun Hong,
and Joo Seok Kyung.

1037
01:05:42,324 --> 01:05:45,181
What's taking so long?
She said she only needed 30 minutes.

1038
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,532
Something must have happened.

1039
01:05:49,788 --> 01:05:51,858
Mom, there's a problem.

1040
01:05:51,938 --> 01:05:54,344
-What's wrong?
-Eun Byeol is missing.

1041
01:05:54,424 --> 01:05:56,089
She was at Ro Na's place
until a while ago.

1042
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:57,621
But she disappeared
while we stepped out for a moment.

1043
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:00,108
The door was left open,
and her phone was left behind.

1044
01:06:00,188 --> 01:06:01,478
What are you talking about?

1045
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:03,261
Why was Eun Byeol at Ro Na's place?

1046
01:06:03,341 --> 01:06:05,718
It seemed like Ms. Jin
was abusing Eun Byeol,

1047
01:06:05,798 --> 01:06:07,508
so I hid her at my place.

1048
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,181
Why are you telling me this now?

1049
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:10,503
Where's Eun Byeol now?

1050
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:12,420
You should've told me sooner!

1051
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,110
Didn't Eun Byeol call you
and ask you to come?

1052
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,873
Oh Yoon Hee, why aren't you here yet?

1053
01:06:25,436 --> 01:06:27,481
Eun Byeol has been kidnapped by Ms. Jin.

1054
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,238
Kidnapped?

1055
01:06:34,275 --> 01:06:35,809
Where is she?

1056
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:37,462
I think they're heading for Gimpo.

1057
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:39,253
I'll tell you more when I arrive.

1058
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:41,503
Report to the police right now.

1059
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:43,276
Eun Byeol is in danger!

1060
01:06:43,356 --> 01:06:46,034
Stop her. You must stop her.

1061
01:06:46,114 --> 01:06:48,779
Stop her by all means. Eun Byeol...

1062
01:06:48,859 --> 01:06:51,803
Oh Yoon Hee, you can't lose Eun Byeol.

1063
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:55,632
Please save Eun Byeol.
I beg you, Oh Yoon Hee.

1064
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:57,350
Hang up. I can't talk right now.

1065
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,845
Wait...

1066
01:07:31,287 --> 01:07:32,657
Pick up, Jin Bun Hong!

1067
01:07:32,737 --> 01:07:35,153
Why aren't you picking up? Jin Bun Hong!

1068
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:37,146
We should report to the police.

1069
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,693
Hello?

1070
01:07:41,179 --> 01:07:42,564
A person has been kidnapped.

1071
01:07:42,644 --> 01:07:44,062
Her name is Ha Eun Byeol.

1072
01:07:44,142 --> 01:07:47,174
I need to go. Eun Byeol must be so scared.

1073
01:07:47,254 --> 01:07:49,036
Eun Byeol!

1074
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,959
-Eun Byeol!
-Seo Jin!

1075
01:07:53,163 --> 01:07:55,653
Is my mom following Eun Byeol?

1076
01:07:55,733 --> 01:07:57,752
What if something happens to her?

1077
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:02,470
She'll be fine. Don't worry.

1078
01:08:13,253 --> 01:08:14,304
Dad.

1079
01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:17,210
Dad, where are you?

1080
01:08:18,335 --> 01:08:19,558
Dad!

1081
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,102
My gosh!

1082
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,075
You startled me!

1083
01:08:29,155 --> 01:08:32,268
You're home. Mr. Joo isn't home yet.

1084
01:08:32,643 --> 01:08:34,187
Have this while you wait for him.

1085
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:39,533
Put this away.

1086
01:09:01,442 --> 01:09:02,584
Why am I so sleepy?

1087
01:09:09,883 --> 01:09:11,483
(Gimpo Farm)

1088
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,392
What do we do now?

1089
01:09:28,862 --> 01:09:30,449
-What's going on?
-Take her away.

1090
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:31,848
Let go!

1091
01:09:31,928 --> 01:09:33,256
Let go of me!

1092
01:09:40,373 --> 01:09:41,783
(Gimpo Farm)

1093
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:47,883
(Nuri Gene Laboratory)

1094
01:09:48,323 --> 01:09:49,460
Oh Yoon Hee?

1095
01:09:50,534 --> 01:09:51,719
Get her!

1096
01:09:55,661 --> 01:09:56,789
Get out!

1097
01:09:58,223 --> 01:09:59,521
Stop!

1098
01:10:07,848 --> 01:10:09,736
Those useless jerks.

1099
01:10:22,653 --> 01:10:27,017
Oh Yoon Hee. You must have a death wish.

1100
01:10:42,764 --> 01:10:44,001
Darn it.

1101
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,221
Eun Byeol! Wake up!

1102
01:10:51,301 --> 01:10:53,399
Eun Byeol, can you hear me?

1103
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:56,417
Eun Byeol, please wake up!

1104
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,218
Oh Yoon Hee, that little...

1105
01:11:03,323 --> 01:11:04,819
I need to tell Su Ryeon.

1106
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:07,792
That Seok Kyung
is her biological daughter.

1107
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,533
That her daughter is alive.

1108
01:11:24,283 --> 01:11:25,283
(Su Ryeon)

1109
01:11:26,053 --> 01:11:27,262
I'll kill you.

1110
01:11:56,352 --> 01:11:58,150
That wench.

1111
01:12:29,113 --> 01:12:30,988
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

1112
01:12:32,411 --> 01:12:34,219
Wake up, Eun Byeol!

1113
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:39,228
Eun Byeol! Please wake up!

1114
01:12:43,498 --> 01:12:44,987
Where am I?

1115
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:54,572
What do you mean
you still haven't found her, Secretary Do?

1116
01:12:54,652 --> 01:12:55,972
Find Yoon Hee's car first.

1117
01:12:56,052 --> 01:12:58,523
Find it, even if that means
you have to search all of Gimpo.

1118
01:12:59,358 --> 01:13:00,750
What about Oh Yoon Hee?

1119
01:13:01,592 --> 01:13:02,871
She's not answering.

1120
01:13:03,336 --> 01:13:04,828
It's my fault.

1121
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:07,974
I shouldn't have sent Eun Byeol there.

1122
01:13:08,054 --> 01:13:11,070
She called me and asked me to pick her up,

1123
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,675
but I hung up on her.

1124
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:15,008
She'll be okay.

1125
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:18,620
Yoon Hee will be taking good care of her.
I'm sure.

1126
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:31,993
(Staff only)

1127
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:33,393
(Steep slopes, no access control)

1128
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:01,938
There we go.

1129
01:14:03,033 --> 01:14:04,088
Eun Byeol!

1130
01:14:04,937 --> 01:14:06,660
Eun Byeol, wake up!

1131
01:14:11,089 --> 01:14:12,187
No!

1132
01:14:17,353 --> 01:14:19,603
Stop. Stop. Stop!

1133
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:24,580
Why do you always make me the bad guy?

1134
01:14:33,963 --> 01:14:35,080
You're all dead.

1135
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,077
Eun Byeol, please wake up.

1136
01:14:40,813 --> 01:14:42,405
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

1137

Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

1139
01:14:57,148 --> 01:14:59,567
Eun Byeol, wake up. Eun Byeol!

I told you.

1141
01:15:03,087 --> 01:15:06,003
Why did you do it, Oh Yoon Hee?

1142
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:12,681
Stop it!

1143

01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:53,139
She's still in the car!

1150
01:15:55,098 --> 01:15:57,159
Let's see how strong you are.

1151
01:16:01,753 --> 01:16:03,866
Darn it. I swear...

1152

I'll die if I have to.
Please save Eun Byeol.

1171
01:19:22,278 --> 01:19:23,598
What were you going to tell me?

1172
01:19:23,693 --> 01:19:24,983
The things he did to me...

1173
01:19:25,063 --> 01:19:27,153
It's horrifying you were my father!

1174
01:19:27,233 --> 01:19:29,279
I'll kill your wife and your daughter.

If I lived as Joo Dan Tae,
Su Ryeon and I...

1177
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,403
When did you ever treat me
like a daughter?

1178
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:35,592
You're not my daughter anymore.

1179
01:19:35,672 --> 01:19:37,413
You killed Seok Kyung too?

1180
01:19:37,526 --> 01:19:40,857
Oh Yoon Hee is not a woman
who can just disappear like that.
