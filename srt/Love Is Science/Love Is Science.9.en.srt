1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,180
Do you want Chiao An Na's phone number that badly?

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,460
Hey! It's not because I want Chiao An Na's phone number, all right?

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,560
I didn't want you to be embarrassed in front of that b*stard.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,840
I kissed you and used my strength. My effort should be appreciated, if not my achievement.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,650
Can't you tell that I truly wanted to help you?

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,930
About Cho An Na's phone number... Next week we're having a meal together. You can pretend to pass by coincidentally.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,510
Then can you move with me to Milan?

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,040
If Hsuan Yu comes to find you, I can allow you to meet him one last time to say your goodbyes.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,540
Hsuan Yu, do you really want to go?

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,180
If he goes, will he not have any regrets?

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,850
I will give priority to your needs.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,240
I believe you, and I believe in us.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,710
Little Piggy

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,080
I can do it.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,920
I can keep my distance. I will not call him or see him.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,160
Chin Lan is going to Milan, and I decided to go with her.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,760
♫ I've written your name ♫

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,450
♫ Fated to be together for life ♫

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,900

21

♫ Living in this city ♫

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,570
♫ It's so easy to get lost ♫

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,840
Love Is Science?

40
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,650
Voodoo

41
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,750
I wish for Voodoo to always prosper.

42
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,750
A light-colored scarf suits you, Sister Hsu.

43
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,820
This way you can look fashionable when you go dancing at the park in winter.

44
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,880
Sister Liu, you wash dishes a lot so your hands get dry. Remember to apply more moisturizer.

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,550
Wear this when you read the magazine next time. You will see much clearer.

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,360
Hsuan Yu!

47
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,660
Hsuan Yu, do you really have to go?

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,890
Cutting hair doesn't require you to speak English. Why do you have to go abroad to study it?

49
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,720
It's Italian.

50
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,860
Addio. Buon viaggio. (Italian for "Farewell. Have a nice trip.")

51
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,060
That's not the point.

52
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,850
Hsuan Yu, if you feel maladjusted there,

53
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,040
come back anytime. We'll be waiting for you here.

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,860
That's... that's right!

55
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,670
Thank you.

56
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,760
Who should I go to now?

57
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,490
Keep it.

58
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,660
Voodoo's door is always open to you.

59
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,770
Did you hear that? Since the boss already said that,

60
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,970
you need to graduate and come back soon.

61
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,320
Why are you all like this? Aren't I still here?

62
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,540
Can you alone really handle the three of us?

63
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,530
Just try me, and you'll get to know how amazing I am!

64
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,520
You may not even want Hsuan Yu anymore when he comes back.

65
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,820
Let's keep drawing.

66
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,890
Love Is Science

67
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,030
- Wow, there's more.
- Wow.
Stir Fry 130

68
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,530
Quickly eat up!

69
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,660
Lately, some things have happened to our company,

70
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,300
but thank you, all.

71
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,400
Everyone has worked hard.

72
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,130
Thank you for working hard.

73
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,640
I have something to report. I was a bit busy before,

74
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,920
but from now on, I will spend more time at the company

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,990
so you must all be good, okay?

76
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,960
Remember to hide the information of male members well. Hide it well.

77
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,870
That's mean! Am I that kind of person?

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,130
D*mn it. I can only say...

79
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,820
I am exactly that kind of person! Bring out the information!

80
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,590
Give me the male membership information.

81
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,860
Just ignore her.

82
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,090
- Just ignore her.
- I don't have any information,

83
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,800
but I have the red wine you love most!

84
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,560
You are the best! Learn from her, everyone.

85
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,290
Sheng Ying dotes on you the most.

86
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,230
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

87
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,280
- She is going to start shouting.
- We are doomed.

88
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,660
Watch over her.

89
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,200
Careful!

90
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,910
Let me help you.

91
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,230
Napkins.

92
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,330
- Napkins.
- Oh, napkins! Napkins!

93
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,460
Thank you, thank you.

94
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,200
Does anyone have a rubber band? Who has a rubber band?

95
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,230
A rubber band?

96
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,230
I have one!

97
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,860
Why do you have everything?

98
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,640
Because I am Little Ding Dang (character from the manga Doraemon).

99
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,040
"Stretch my round hands out!" (Give a helping hand.)

100
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,310
I'm your best employee.

101
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,020
I'm so great, will I get a raise?

102
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,430
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

103
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,070
Jia Jia, we're going to cut the cake. Hurry on out.

104
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,340
Jia Jia, we're going to cut the cake.

105
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,290
Okay.

106
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:20,230
♫ Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you...

107
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,800
♫ Happy birthday to you!

108
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,670
Jia Jia, let's make a wish.

109
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,980
I don't want to.

110
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,640
Maybe your birthday wish will come true.

111
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,720
Didn't you always want an ice cream maker?

112
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,980
I don't want Uncle to leave.

113
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,660
Jia Jia, didn't I already tell you?

114
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,200
Going abroad is good for Uncle. We should be happy for him.

115
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,590
I don't want Uncle to leave.

116
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,710
Jia Jia, actually—

117
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,720
You're a bad person! You stole my uncle!

118
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,350
- Jia Jia, how could you speak like that? That was very rude.
- It's all right. It's fine.

119
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,110
It's all your fault, stealing my uncle!

120
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,090
- Jia Jia!
- Jia Jia!

121
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,010
Sister-in-law, it's okay.

122
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,050
She probably just can't bear to see Hsuan Yu leave. I'll go talk to her.

123
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,190
Uncle!

124
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,420
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,020
Happy birthday. Do you like it?

126
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,220
Let me tell you a secret. Your uncle got you

127
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,620
an ice cream maker.

128
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,890
- Isn't that what you want?
- Yes.

129
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,660
- Then do you want to go look for it?
- Yes.

130
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,200
Where could it be?

131
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,850
Is it over there?

132
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,000
- No.
- No?

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,190
Then is it there?

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,740
You found it!

135
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,760
- It's so big. Do you like it?
- Yes.

136
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,910
- Who gave it to you?
- It's from Uncle.

137
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,140
- From your uncle... Then do you want to thank him?
- Yes.

138
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,620
Okay, let's go thank him.

139
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,910
This is for you too. Go on.

140
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,460
Uncle, I found the gift you got me!

141
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,980
Mark just called me saying there is something urgent so I need to make a trip to Voodoo.

142
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,250
I'm not sure what is going on.

143
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,820
Okay. Go ahead.

144
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,170
- I'm leaving.
- All right.

145
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,730
- You drank too much!
- I already did my best to control myself tonight.

146
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,920
Sure.

147
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
Thank you for treating us tonight, Boss!

148
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,910
Thank you for treating us tonight!

149
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,320
You're welcome! Go home soon and rest up, everyone!

150
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,470
- Bye bye!
- Be careful!

151
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,960
- Bye!
- Watch her.

152
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,730
Okay. Let's go!

153
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,150
Let's go.

154
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,160
You go home first. I want to find a place to wash my hair.

155
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,090
All right. Go now, or else the hair salon will be closed.

156
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:17,190
Voodoo

157
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,540
Hey, Hairstylist Number 29.

158
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,410
What did you want to talk about?

159
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,500
It's a farewell present for you.

160
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,990
All right, it's mainly sponsored by Brothers Chang Ching and San Ma.

161
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,720
This gift is... too precious.

162
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,060
You haven't even seen the really precious gift yet.

163
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,160
Not only is there "Italian Riding Wh*re" on here, there's also "It's Big" (sounds like "Italy").

164
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,100
This one... It's something related to you.

165
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,070
"Milan Is Truly Decadent."

166
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,200
This one! It's my latest favorite.

167
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,170
"Busty Empire."

168
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,070
You can happily learn a new language with these.

169
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,530
Here, as your bro, this is the extent to which I can help you.

170
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,270
No need!

171
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,370
Come on. Don't be shy!

172
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,270
Learn a few important phrases first.

173
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,220
This is the quickest way to learn a language.

174
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,580
- Enough.
- Come on.

175
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,040
I want to wat... I mean I want to watch it with you. At the same time, I can help you correct your pronunciation.

176
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,460
Enough. No!

177
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,310
Voodoo

178
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,520
This is the part! This is the part!

179
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,720
I heard from Mark that Hsuan Yu is going to Milan tomorrow.

180
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,520
Really? Why?

181
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,470
Probably to further his studies.

182
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,000
If you truly feel apologetic, then stop contacting Hsuan Yu.

183
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,340
Watch it when you get home.

184
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,300
You will definitely learn a lot from them, okay?

185
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,590
So have you watched them all?

186
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,800
Yes! Of course, I have watched all of them.

187
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,560
All of them?

188
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,220
NT$35.

189
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,890
Okay.

190
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,060
You're good to go. Thank you.

191
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,830
Thank you.

192
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,860
Do you want a hair wash?

193
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,990
Careful.

194
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:06,160
♫ Do you really understand what it means to be the one and only? ♫

195
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,670
♫ It's not as easy as breathing ♫

196
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,720
♫ Do you really wish to have clarity? ♫

197
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,760
♫ But if you don't lay your heart bare, how do you explain? ♫

198
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,130
♫ I truly love you ♫

199
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,260
♫ Every sentence spoken is not spoken lightly ♫

200
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,490
♫ Your eyes that tend to drift away ♫

201
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:53,220
♫ Can always see clearly at the critical moment ♫

202
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,050
♫ Your hesitancy ♫

203
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:05,780
♫ Coupled with my drifting about ♫

204
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,970
♫ In death, there comes a clarity ♫

205
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,930
♫ I understood that you're acting smart behind my back ♫

206
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,410
♫ Do you really understand what it means to be the one and only? ♫

207
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,390
Can you cut my bangs while you're at it?

208
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,610
Yes.
♫ It's not just about always being together ♫

209
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:59,120
♫ Do you really wish to have clarity? ♫

210
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,820
♫ Close your eyes and see with your heart ♫

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,160
♫ I truly love you ♫

212
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:17,190
♫ No one can compare ♫

213
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,520
♫ The unsure glances ♫

214
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:32,290
♫  Can always see clearly at the critical moment  ♫

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,020
♫ Your hesitancy ♫

216
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,040
Take a look. What do you think?

217
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,620
- Let me help you call a cab.
- Okay.

218
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,600
Thanks.

219
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,860
Love letter

220
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,710
What are you looking at?

221
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,860
It's the love letter you wrote me.

222
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,260
It's from Jia Jia.

223
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,550
I'm not sure, but

224
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,690
I think this is me.

225
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,660
The content of the love letter is really stupid, right?

226
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:48,100
The content of the love letter... is very touching.

227
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,490
If you had given it to me earlier, I might have said, "I'm willing."

228
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,990
- Did you call for a cab?
- Yes, I did.

229
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,350
You go ahead.

230
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,660
Love letter

231
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,040
I will take this.

232
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,880
There are... no more regrets from my youth.

233
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:53,510
I wonder when is Hsuan Yu's flight. Is he already at the airport?

234
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:01,630
Yan Fei, why are you so stupid? How could you forget to wish him a safe trip?

235
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,250
Let's take our chances.

236
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,480
Hello?

237
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,460
I'm at the airport. Where are you?

238
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,710
I already boarded.

239
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,860
My flight will take off in five minutes.

240
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,560
What do you mean?

241
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,380
Hsuan Yu,

242
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,470
let's end things here.

243
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,680
Chang Chin Lan, stop joking around!

244
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,910
I'm not joking.

245
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,650
I have actually been thinking about this for a long time

246
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,030
before making this decision.

247
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,520
Why?

248
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,360
Because... you're actually not ready.

249
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,470
What exactly are you saying? You are the one who wanted me to go to Milan.

250
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,350
You're the one who said I can do it! But now, the person saying I'm not ready is also you!

251
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,930
What exactly are you doing?

252
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,530
That's right.

253
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,780
It's all me.

254
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,710
Last boarding call for flight...

255
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,270
Wang Hsuan Yu, you really are too much.

256
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,510
From the beginning, I was the one who took the initiative.

257
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,720
Even our ending is initiated by me.

258
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,370
I don't want to be like this anymore.

259
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,590
I want to find a man who will be good to me on his own accord.

260
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,320
Why are you saying these things?

261
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,340
Didn't we already agree we were going together?

262
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:09,000
In two years, if I tell you that my dream is not here,

263
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,650
would you be willing to stay in Milan with me forever?

264
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,630
I would!

265
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,720
I'm serious.

266
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,080
I know it's my fault that I made you feel insecure.

267
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,690
I should have let you know about some things earlier, but I never found the chance to tell you.

268
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,730
When I was fifteen,

269
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,630
after Yan Fei left,

270
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,380
I closed my heart,

271
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,720
until I met you.

272
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,800
It's you who never gave up on me.

273
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:59,240
It's you who opened my heart.

274
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:06,140
I'm really grateful toward you. You are also the person who allowed me to see the world again.

275
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,810
I'm serious about you.

276
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,280
Also, I always believed that we would last forever.

277
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,420
I know. I know all of that.

278
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,360
The truth is, I'm well aware that with your character,

279
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,680
as long as I don't say anything,

280
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,740
you would definitely stay with me till the end,

281
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,750
no matter whom you truly love in your heart.

282
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,080
I've thought it through.

283
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,680
I have the right to have a boyfriend whose heart contains only me.

284
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,380
Help me tell Jia Jia

285
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,750
that I'm returning her uncle to her and wish her a happy birthday.

286
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,910
I really never thought I would ever see Yan Fei again in this lifetime.

287
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,300
I also underestimated her influence on me once she appeared back in my life.

288
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,610
I didn't deal with things well enough.

289
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,350
I never wanted to hurt anybody.

290
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,920
Yet on the contrary, it seems I hurt a lot of people.

291
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,820
I'm sorry.

292
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,500
Sorry for what, Wang Hsuan Yu?

293
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,470
I plan to have a passionate interracial romance the moment I land in Milan.

294
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,450
That will be my breakup gift for you.

295
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,840
There is another breakup gift I had planned to mail to you.

296
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:20,050
Now I can give it to you in person.

297
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,460
What are you doing?

298
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,730
Last night,

299
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,040
after searching a long time, I finally found a watch store

300
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,630
willing to change the battery for me.

301
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,450
Look, the time is moving again.

302
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,980
I should get going.

303
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,040
You should head back home, too.

304
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,900
With your character, as long as I don't say anything,

305
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,710
you would definitely stay with me till the end,

306
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,130
no matter whom you truly love in your heart...

307
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,290
From start to finish, it seems like I didn't do anything for you.

308
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:21,810
I hope that after leaving me, you will be happier than before.

309
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,610
Mr. Huo, can you answer some questions?

310
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,560
Mr. Huo.

311
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,980
Mr. Huo, regarding Royal Jodhpur winning this year's Best Hotel award, do you have any comments?

312
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,110
Mr. Huo, are you really in Taiwan for Royal Taipei?

313
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,740
Do you have the confidence to win the Best Hotel award again with Royal Taipei?

314
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,170
Mr. Huo, please make a statement.

315
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:53,270
Mr. Huo, can you make a statement?

316
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,030
Mr. Huo, please make a statement.

317
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,530
If you see Hsuan Yu in a bit,

318
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,390
you have to encourage him to study hard.

319
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,270
So he can one day be an internationally-known hairstylist.

320
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,140
Then I will fly to Milan and have him cut my hair.

321
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,810
Yan Fei.

322
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,460
Why are you here so early?

323
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,230
I'm here to buy braised dishes.

324
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,440
Really?

325
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,370
The braised dishes from last time were delicious

326
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,260
so I want to buy some for my employees for lunch.

327
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,590
That's great! Let's go inside to sit. I will cut some for you right away.

328
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,570
I'll also cut some skin from the pig's head for you. Let's go.

329
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,780
Your braised dishes are ready.

330
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,310
Thank you.

331
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,610
Oh, right. Is Hsuan Yu going to Milan today?

332
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,070
Has he left yet? Does he need a ride to the airport?

333
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,130
There's no need. He left very early this morning.

334
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,540
- Has he left already?
- Yes.

335
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,700
Although I will miss him,

336
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,820
this is a great opportunity for him, all thanks to Chin Lan.

337
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,780
Of course, he needs to take this opportunity, right?

338
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,790
Yes.

339
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,200
Oh, right. How much is it in total? I will pay you.

340
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,040
- There's no need.
- No way.

341
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,830
- It is just some braised side dishes.
- No, no.

342
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,740
- Don't give me money.
- Here.

343
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,070
Or else I can't bring myself to come next time.

344
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,160
Even though Hsuan Yu isn't around now,

345
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,040
you are still welcome here at our noodle shop.

346
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,710
Next time, we will invite you to try out some new dishes again. All right?

347
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,560
- I'm going to head to work now.
- Okay.

348
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,170
Do you like these types of shoes, too?

349
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,640
What shoes?

350
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,710
It's very popular among children these days. Jia Jia has a pair, too.

351
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,930
No... Originally I wasn't...

352
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,640
- This morning, I was originally—
- Don't you have to work today?

353
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,950
How come you're not going anymore?

354
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,780
This watch...

355
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,760
After replacing the batteries,

356
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,290
the time that had once stopped started to tick again.

357
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,250
Good thing you stayed.

358
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,010
Otherwise, everyone would surely be very disappointed.

359
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,020
Does that include you?

360
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,270
What?

361
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,950
My staying... does that make you happy?

362
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,120
I'm sorry.

363
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:30,190
I... I feel like I'm really selfish.

364
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:35,640
When you were going to leave, I couldn't even say a single word of blessing.

365
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,680
I was really happy to see you just now.

366
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,410
Thank you for staying.

367
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,260
I've always been alone.

368
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,350
I finally have you as a younger brother—

369
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,900
Stop calling me your younger brother!

370
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,790
But you... are younger than me.

371
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,250
Even so, I don't want to be your younger brother.

372
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,970
Royal Hotel's first Asian CEO, the pride of Taiwan, Huo Yung Tai arrived in Taiwan today.

373
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,400
Coming up next is the live broadcast of his press conference.

374
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,840
I came back this time to prepare the Royal Hotel in Taipei.

375
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,220
I hope to continue our success

376
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,840
and make Royal Hotel Taipei into Asia's top-notch five-star hotel.

377
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,460
Yes, sure.

378
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,890
Okay. Bye.

379
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,380
CEO Huo, I'll brief you on your schedule for the next three days now.

380
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,880
We already arranged a meeting with the structural engineers.

381
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,550
Daniel King has three paintings on display right now.

382
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,520
Also, there was a Ms. Yan who kept calling you.

383
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,730
Which Ms. Yan?

384
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,560
Beauty Queen's person-in-charge, Ms. Yan Wu Chun Fung.

385
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,920
Got it.

386
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,010
Mom, were you looking for me?

387
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,730
Yes. How come you didn't tell me ahead of time that you were coming back?

388
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,450
I only found out through the news.

389
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:36,930
Since I just arrived, I have much to tend to. I plan to see you after I'm settled.

390
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,800
You just got off the plane. You must have serious jet lag.

391
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,180
Do you want to come to Beauty Queen?

392
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,150
I will arrange a full set of hot coal massage treatments for you.

393
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,860
Okay. I would like to have a meal with you as well.

394
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,070
What are you looking at?
[Love Is Science Marriage Agency]

395
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,360
How come I can't see what he looks like?
[Tom: Talking to you makes me really happy.]

396
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,300
It's better that he uses a cute avatar instead of his real photo.

397
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,220
That way we can focus more on the content of the conversation.

398
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,390
How dare you!

399
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,180
You dare to use a social app in our company!

400
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,030
What? Do you think that our Love Is Science doesn't work?

401
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,970
No, of course not.

402
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,190
What is this?

403
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,330
No, it's not for me. I'm just getting to know our competition.

404
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,650
- Really?
- Really.

405
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,400
Lately, a lot of my friends have used Omi to get into relationships.

406
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,640
That's why I downloaded it to see it exactly.

407
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Let me see.

408
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,450
Who is this? Alex. Twenty-nine years old.

409
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:44,880
- Let's look over here.
- A Taurus.

410
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,260
What are you looking at? I want to see, too.

411
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:52,200
Omi Love Alarm. I know about this.

412
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,310
I ran into their boss when I was meeting with vendors last time.

413
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,530
At first, I thought it was another dat...

414
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,120
social app.

415
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,170
But after listening to their boss, they are quite serious about it.

416
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,010
The app has a sensitivity rating and offers 24/7 online complaint reporting.

417
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,730
This is to ensure that all of their users are serious about meeting people.

418
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,750
That's quite similar to our company.

419
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,720
Plus, I think besides the typical swiping, they have some interesting functions too.

420
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,610
Look. You have three love alarms each day. You can talk on the phone with the other person.

421
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:28,550
They even include suggestions based on your horoscopes.

422
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:32,780
Also, if you pay... you can unlock even more functions.

423
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,670
It sure sounds like a strong competitor.

424
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,760
Not really. They don't have too many requirements to use their service.

425
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,030
So their target market is a bit different than ours.

426
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,890
It is a very good amateur app to meet people seriously.

427
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,980
All right, everyone, get back to work.

428
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,480
This place has really good braised dishes. I got these for you all as a snack.

429
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,830
Thank you, Boss!

430
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,460
Has the client for our scheduled appointment arrived yet?

431
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,450
She should be here soon.

432
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,750
- Hello.
- Welcome. Are you Ms. Lo?

433
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,980
Yes.

434
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,020
Sheng Ying?

435
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,710
It is Liu Sheng Ying!

436
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,680
You two used to be stuck together! You haven't changed at all!

437
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:20,180
♫ Fantasize about a romantic love ♫

438
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,580
♫ Always be with you ♫

439
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:35,000
♫ We'll support each other from now on. I promise, your smile... ♫

440
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,610
- Hello.
- Welcome. Are you Ms. Lo?

441
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,270
Yes.

442
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,310
Sheng Ying?

443
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,730
It is Liu Sheng Ying!

444
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,930
You're my Yun Hsi's high school classmate!

445
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,950
You two used to be stuck together! You haven't changed at all!

446
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,070
I still remember you!

447
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,380
Do you work here?

448
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,990
That's great! That's great!

449
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,080
You're twenty-seven years old.

450
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,810
During college, you had one boyfriend.

451
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,040
You two were together for three months.

452
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,520
He is not really considered a boyfriend.

453
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,120
I didn't like that boy at all.

454
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,060
I could tell with a glance that he didn't know how to take care of my Yun Hsi.

455
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,860
Excuse me, Mrs. Lo.

456
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:26,200
We will directly discuss with Yun Hsi about her ex-boyfriend during our questionnaire later.

457
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,930
Oh, is that so? All right.

458
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,040
Miss Lo, why did you want to come to Love Is Science?

459
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,360
Because my friend's daughter

460
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,470
successfully found someone through your Love Is Science.

461
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,160
Now, she's married in the U.S. and her husband works in Silicon Valley.

462
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,940
She's super happy.

463
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,990
Look at our Yun Hsi. She's so introverted and obedient.

464
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,480
Mrs. Lo. How about this?

465
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,970
Let's have Yun Hsi fill out the questionnaire first. That way we can get an idea of the type of person she's looking for.

466
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,670
Oh, okay.

467
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,790
Sheng Ying.

468
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,660
Take her to do the questionnaire first. I will chat with Mrs. Lo.

469
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,790
Mrs. Lo, you can ask me any questions that you have.

470
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,410
That works. Sheng Ying, you know Yun Hsi well.

471
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,950
You'll know what type of men she likes. Please help her out.

472
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:17,860
Actually, we haven't been in contact for a long time now.

473
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,410
That's okay. You two were so close back then. It'll be seamless.

474
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,690
There definitely won't be a problem!

475
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,810
Love Is Science

476
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,180
What is your most memorable moment with your ex-boyfriend?

477
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,600
For "the most memorable moment with your ex-boyfriend,"

478
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,690
I don't really recall any.

479
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,490
- Liu... Sheng Ying.
- Yes.

480
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,370
What is it?

481
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,280
The most memorable moment with your ex-boyfriend...

482
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,080
To be more precise,

483
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,120
did he do anything special that touched you?

484
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,610
You can try to recall.

485
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,820
I don't think there was anything especially touching.

486
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,740
Really?

487
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,650
I guess having a bad memory is a type of advantage.

488
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,880
That's fine. Then that means you're generous and not hung up on the little things.

489
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,550
If you really can't recall anything, it's fine if you leave it blank.

490
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,020
- Thank you.
- Our pleasure. Anytime.

491

- Bye bye.
- Take care.

492

- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,550
Boss, this case I—

495
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:36,010
You don't want to take it, right? I know.

496
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,530
But can you tell me why?

497
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,770
Tai Ou Wen!

498
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,210
Can you take this case for me?

499
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,930
Why?

500
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,780
Is something wrong?

501

I... I don't plan to take on clients that I know.

502
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,450
Sure. I'm okay with that.

503
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,230
Thank you very much.

504
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,300
Then... I will go schedule dates for our other members.

505
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,700
Then it is settled.

506
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,210
I will have my company's legal team contact you.

507
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:32,040
That's fine. If any issues arise in the process, you can reach out to me.

508
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,750
Okay. That's it for now then.

509
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,070
- Okay, bye bye.
- Bye bye.

There you go again.

511
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,620
You're basically enslaved to your phone now.

512
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,900
That's not right. You're enslaved to love.

513

Cho Nai Hui: I found "you" again. Let's come here to have coffee together next time.

Wow!
You Fu Café

516
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,240
When did you open up a café in Taipei?

517
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,750
Not just a café. Look.

518

Wow, that's ridiculous! "You Fu" is everywhere!
You Fu Cake

519
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,600
Nai Hui said that the next time I go to Taipei,

520
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,540
she wants to take me to each place to get a picture there.

521
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:45,830
That's awesome! I want to date, too! Next time you go to Taipei, take me to that Love Is Science, all right?

522
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,790
All right?

Beauty Queen

524
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,430
Your previous idea of having successful members share their thoughts in a video was excellent.

525
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:09,230
So I want to hold an event for the "graduates" to go back to their "natal families."

526
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,870
This event can be a camping trip, picnic,

527
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:20,240
barbecue or karaoke. There's no limit to activities and we won't need that many people to attend.

528
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,110
We can group them according to their interests and expertise.

529
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:28,540
The most important thing is to allow the old as well as new members to participate and socialize.

530
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,520
This will be a very good event to have as our tradition.

531
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,610
Not only can this be an opportunity for new members to better understand their future married life,

532
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,840
but this can also be an additional service for graduated members.

533
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,240
We can use this event to know about their current situations.

534
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:52,180
Are you sure you won't answer? It could be about something important.

536
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:01,130
Remind Ou Wen that if Yan Wu Chun Fung calls our office for me, be sure to tell her I'm busy.

537
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,940

Mr. Huo, long time no see.

I'll be meeting your mom. Why don't we three have a meal together?

546
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,190
It is such a pity. That day I'm busy so I can't make it.

547
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,730
Oh, really? I haven't even said which day it is.

548
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,400
It doesn't matter because I'm busy every day. I'm going to leave now.

Let me see! Why did I wear this today?

No, they don't, Boss!

No! Unless you promise me you won't suddenly fly to Milan.

Okay. I promise you.

You can't go back on your promises.

- Yes, I promise.

- so unfair!

00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:18,980
Of course, I have to be unfair.

Is it because of Yan Fei?

It's because of me!

I should have honestly faced myself long ago.

- That's not important.

I'm Chiao An Na. We went to the same college. Don't you remember?

632
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:56,050
How did you end up like this?

Yan Fei?
[Organic. General Waste. Glass]

638
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,260
It's really you.

639
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:30,490
- No, you got the wrong person.
- Hey!

640
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,570
Wait! Hold on! Don't run away!

641
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:37,360
I'm Chiao An Na. We went to the same college. Don't you remember?

642
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,480
How did you end up like this?

643
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:03,320
It's okay now.

644
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:15,140
No way!

645
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,610
Your ex-husband is too cruel.

646
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,030
So didn't he pay you alimony?

647
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:24,730
No, he only gave me an open flight ticket for Taiwan.

648
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,020
D**chebag.

649
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,460
So for the past year, he didn't bother with you at all, did he?

650
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,050
Also, he doesn't know that you work three jobs to pay rent, does he?

651
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,180
Yan Fei.

652
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:43,750
Back then, you were a celebrity on the college campus.

653
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:46,760
The line of guys who wanted to date you blocked the entrance of our school's convenience store.

654
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,160
Each one of them was eager to buy you snacks and beverages.

655
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,460
They treated you like a princess.

656
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,450
So how's your ex-husband right now?

657
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:00,200
He gets a divorce without a second thought.

658
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,150
He abandons you just like that.

659
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:05,580
He doesn't pay alimony or bear any responsibilities. Does he just get to live so comfortably like that?

660
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,400
All right. Let's not talk about that b*stard.

661
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,280
You did graduate from college after all. You don't need to

662
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,110
find these jobs here or at a restaurant to wash dishes, right?

663
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:27,330
Since I was young, I learned art.

664
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,950
Besides painting and drawing, I don't know how to do anything.

665
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:33,570
These jobs pay daily salaries.

666
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,430
It can be used for emergencies.

667
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:44,180
Why don't you go back home?

668
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:48,220
I remember that your family is quite wealthy.

669
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,670
I didn't tell my mom that I'm divorced.

670
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:55,310
If she knows, she'll definitely force me back home immediately.

671
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,060
Housekeeping.

672
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,840
So... even though you are like this,

673
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,260
you still don't want to go home?

674
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,520
I want to prove that my ex-husband is wrong.

675
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,980
He said I couldn't survive without him so I should hurry home to my mom.

676
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,660
I want to prove that without him and my mom,

677
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,120
I can still live well

678
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,670
and still live in that house.

679
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:27,260
So... you work three jobs

680
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,320
to try to pay the rent.

681
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:33,910
Yet you are so poor you have to find leftover pizza from the trash to eat.

682
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:38,150
Thank you so much! I am thanking you on behalf of your landlord.

683
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,670
All right. I didn't mean that.

684
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:47,750
I honestly admire your perseverance.

685
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:52,560
But... you have got this all wrong.

686
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,080
Come. Listen.

687
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:03,490
Listen. What's important is not how many jobs you work at,

688
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:05,790
nor where you live,

689
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:09,190
nor surviving by eating food from the trash.

690
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:12,700
What's important is you must live more happily

691
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,320
than that b*stard.

692
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,730
If you want him to regret,

693
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,200
then not only must you live better,

694
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,480
but especially live successfully.

695
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,820
One day in the future, you two may run into each other.

696
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:30,990
When he sees you, his eyes will light up, and his heartbeat will increase,

697
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,410
falling for your charms once again.

698
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:38,090
Bang! That's the result we want.

699
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,320
I also want to live better,

700
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,530
but in order to pay rent,

701
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:49,470
I have already run out of options.

702
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:54,770
You have to clean rooms and wash dishes

703
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,560
so, of course, you have no other options.

704
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,300
I have an idea.

705
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:05,110
What?

706
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:08,000
Do you want to go back to Taiwan with me to start a business?

707
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,990
Honestly,

708
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:16,060
we were not close in college and did not hang out together.

709
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,760
Where did you get the courage to ask me to start a business with you?

710
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,660
Weren't you afraid of losing all your savings?

711
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,180
Indeed we weren't close,

712
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:29,520
but I know who your mom is.

713
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,650
If the business was successful, I would profit.

714
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,590
If the business failed, I could go to Mama Yan for comfort.

715
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,060
Besides, I'm the person who saved her silly daughter from the "fire."

716
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,930
Mama Yan wouldn't treat me horribly, right?

717
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:47,630
You evil businesswoman.

718
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:50,410
Forgive me.

719
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,110
Although we can laugh as we talk about it now,

720
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:57,600
don't ever forget

721
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,520
how miserable you were because of Huo Yung Tai.

722
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,610
Falling into a hole once can be considered carelessness.

723
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:09,180
But if you fall into it a second time, you're being dumb.

724
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:13,220
Don't worry. I won't!

725
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,670
- Are you that confident?
- Yes.

726
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,680
Then do you know what you are about to face?

727
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:24,390
The ex.

728
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:27,280
These things are scary

729
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,000
because first,

730
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,930
he's definitely your type,

731
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:36,730
or you wouldn't have loved him so much that you married him.

732
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:40,750
Second, you two definitely have mutual interests

733
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,260
as well as beautiful memories.

734
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,610
[Daniel King]

735
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:51,620
The third and most important reason

736
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,830
is that Huo Yung Tai did not age at all.

737
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:57,420
The years have only led him to be more handsome and charming.

738
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,660
So the person you are facing now is no longer the Huo Yung Tai from back then,

739
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:06,430
but the evolved Huo Yung Tai, version 2.0.

740
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:09,340
If you are not mentally prepared,

741
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,890
you will very easily fall for him again.

742
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,290
I won't!

743
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:22,870
I will certainly not fall in the same hole twice!

744
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:31,660
Beauty Queen

745
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:44,340
That person really did not change at all.

746
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,770
Good thing I'm not too shabby, either.

747
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,490
I'd better put on more lotion.

748
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:25,330
Very good, Yan Fei. Just like this.

749
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:27,900
Huo Yung Tai is not the only one who evolved.

750
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,620
It's been nine years now. You have become better,

751
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,090
calmer, and more mature.

752
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,530
In the face of any situation,

753
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:40,100
you can remain calm and logical. You're Yan Fei 2.0.

754
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:56,690
Didn't I hire an auntie to disinfect the place every month? Why are there still cockroaches that slipped in?

755
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,650
You are now Yan Fei 2.0.

756
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:07,780
You definitely will not be defeated by a cockroach!

757
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,920
Go die!

758
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,160
It's so disgusting! I can't do it!

759
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,120
There are still some things that can't be overcome with willpower.

760
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,260
What do I do? What do I do?

761
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:41,330
What should I do? Do I call 1-1-9 (police)?

Piggy's Love Diary

765
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:40,400
Little Piggy! Sorry, sorry!

766
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,070
All for you, here's more.

767
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:46,460
If this is not enough, I'll buy more for you.

768
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,850
Can you really not see a movie with me today?

769
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,090
You already promised me.

770

I'm sorry. It's all my mom's fault.

771
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:59,170
Her friend's son came to Taiwan to study for a short time.

772
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:02,530
They asked me to show that guy around.

773
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,270
It's so annoying.

774
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,360
Since it's so annoying, then blow him off (ignore him).

775
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,030
I want to as well!

776
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:11,710
But do you remember I promised to take you to have beef soup in Tainan?

777
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:16,110
The travel expenses are all paid by my mom, and I don't want to be on her bad side.

778
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:21,580
In any case, once I make my own money in the future, I won't have to listen to her anymore.

779
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,460
All right.

01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,350

01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:10,330
I'm just passing by on my way home after eating.

790
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:14,180
What a coincidence! How was it? Was the movie good?

791
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,720
It was all right, not that bad.

792
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,610
Really? Good thing I didn't go to watch it.

793
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:24,170
Then... then...

794
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:28,440
How was your day... showing that guy around?

795
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,840
Just... It was just all right.

796
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,600
It was boring.

797
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,980
What about him? How is he?

798
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:42,170
What do you mean by "how is he"? He was just all right.

799
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:45,750
But... not as bad

800
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,180
as I thought.

801
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:55,840
Hello, Terry?

802
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,710
I just got home.

803
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:04,270
Sure, sure.

804
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:16,930
♫ Fear that you don't think it's worth a gamble with me ♫

805
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,120
A cold chicken steak tastes horrible.

806
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:30,340
♫  Can't you see? ♫

807
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,310
You don't need to suffer to love a person.

808
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:35,750
No matter how much you love that person, you cannot wreck yourself for the relationship to work.

809
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,220
You are not helping him. You are harming him.

810
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:43,230
A person's feelings will be affected by the mood of the situation but a (computer) system will not.

811
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:47,860
But a system won't know who can make my mood better and who can make me smile.

812
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:50,450
How much are these things worth in the system?

813
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:53,620
You two are already divorced. You are just her ex-husband.

814
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:56,350
Even if you two get back together, so what?

815
01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:01,980
Why can he get chance after chance after treating you like that, yet I can't even get one chance?

816
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,680
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

817
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:09,410
It can't be seen nor be discovered.

818
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:14,710
♫ Are you planning to stop responding? ♫

819
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:21,200
♫ Finding excitement in an absurd relationship ♫

820
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:26,030
♫ My melancholy and my monochromatic world  ♫

821
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:31,640
♫  Have become the most laughable accessories  ♫

822
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:37,170
♫ In the end, you're so far away ♫

823
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:42,950
♫ You became a pointless, transparent existence ♫

824
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:49,060
♫ I thought it was only because I came late ♫

825
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:57,030
♫ Turned out I was the only one playing the game ♫

826
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:02,770
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

827
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:08,750
♫ Fantasize about a romantic love ♫

828
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:14,770
♫ While lonely, thinking of someone ♫

829
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:20,020
♫ He will come and warm you up ♫

830
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:25,660
♫ I think what you sometime remembered ♫

831
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:31,280
♫ Is for "just in case" ♫

832
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,670
♫ To treat the hug you give me ♫

833
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:43,370
♫ As something to bring you warmth ♫
