1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Are you going to meet with that giraffe again?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,570
Two handsome men in a hotel, the night before parting.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,220
No!

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,760
After the class reunion, I'd like to meet your parents.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,810
- Our family is already preparing (for our wedding).
- Back then, you two were not yet mature enough.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,140
Not at all because right now, we are ready.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,050
It's your heart that will tell you you're ready to welcome the next relationship.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,080
When it comes to objective and subjective qualifications,

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,720
the difference between you and Yung Tai is this big.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,680
Mr. Huo's qualifications are very good, but they shouldn't be a reason for me to give up on liking Yan Fei.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,400
Some things may change, but some people are unforgettable once you have loved them before.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,240
For example, Daniel.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,630
After many years, you two may meet by chance one day.

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,030
Once again, he will be captured by your charisma.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,210
That is the result we want.

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,740
Although it took me nine years, I have finally succeeded.

39
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,930
Love is Science

40
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,620
Surprise! Are you home?

41
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,520
Why are we here?

42
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,760
Where are we? Why are we moving?

43
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,800
Didn't you say our old house had cockroaches?

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,490
That doesn't mean we need to move!

45
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,760
- It was your mom who told us to move.
- What?

46
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,230
I met your mom at the party, and I just casually brought up

47
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,780
that our old house housed cockroaches. She said,

48
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,370
"I have many empty homes without cockroaches."

49
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,760
By the time I got home, the movers were already there.

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,920
Why did you tell her?

51
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,680
I just casually brought it up. How could I have known she'd do this?

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,030
But I must say,

53
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,910
there is even a fireplace here.

54
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,620
And most importantly, the best ocean view.

55
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,770
But I think living in my mom's house

56
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,700
means she can show up whenever. There is so much psychological pressure!

57
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,790
But I think it's beautiful here. I really like it.

58
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,520
No wonder, it's President Yan.

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,820
As long as you like it.

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,060
Where are the rooms?

61
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,740
- There.
- Okay.

62
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,730
After getting cleaned up, I need to go to work. You... enjoy it. Enjoy.

63
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,440
The best ocean view...

64
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,920
What are you doing? You scared me. Did you run all the way here?

65
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,320
Are you crazy? Don't you like women?

66
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,280
I do like women, but I also like you.

67
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,340
Are you sure you are clear-headed? Don't regret it after waking up.

68
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,440
If you regret it now, I can pretend nothing has happened.

69
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,690
Are all of you gays this talkative?

70
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,780
D*mn it!

71
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,720
Good morning.

72
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,790
Good morning.

73
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,710
I...

74
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,040
I'll take a shower first.

75
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,500
Let's do it together.

76
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,340
Before, he was chasing after me for Chiao An Na's number.

77
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,840
What is going on this time?

78
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,320
Is he changing flavors?

79
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,760
Or is he treating me as Chiao An Na's replacement?

80
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,430
Hey! Stop playing with your boiled egg.

81
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,400
I only drink coffee in the morning.

82
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,860
Is there still a problem?

83
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,350
After last night's event, attendees gave positive feedback.
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

84
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,180
I found some information on campgrounds. You can take a look.

85
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,400
Since it's camping, we can invite graduated members who already have children

86
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,710
to come back and attend. Even though there may be plenty of unpredictable events,

87
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,190
they can cooperate and help each other out,

88
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,400
and experience marriage and parenting early on.

89
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,170
Wouldn't that scare everyone?

90
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,680
Then our clients would refund their membership and be afraid to get married.

91
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,700
Would that scare them off? That's good. It's better to face it sooner

92
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,690
to avoid getting divorced after marriage.

93
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,200
That's true.

94
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,220
That's right. It's almost Miss Luo's first arranged date, right?

95
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,970
- That's right.
- Is everything okay? Do you need help?

96
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,720
There's no problem. It's part of my job.

97
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,430
I will do my job properly.

98
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,940
Good morning, Brother Ou.

99
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,140
Is our Mr. Gentleman late today?

100
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,830
And you didn't even change your clothes?

101
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,870
This isn't like you. Who are you?

102
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,660
Did some alien

103
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,690
take over Ou Wen's body? Come out!

104
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,810
Come out. Come out. Come out!

105
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,770
How lame!

106
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,950
Usually, when I diss him, he serves it back eight hundred times.

107
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,490
Today, his battle capacity is so low. It's suspicious.

108
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,380
Why are you so late today?

109
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,840
Thankfully, Chang Ching isn't here.

110
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,180
In total, I'm late by one hour

111
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,630
and twenty-three minutes.

112
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,200
No worries, just deduct what should be deducted from my salary.

113
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,480
Did something good happen?

114
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,480
Daniel King

115
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,800
Daniel King

116
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,830
Daniel King - End of Time

117
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,480
Daniel King is to hold an art exhibition in Taiwan. He launches a ticketed event, including a dinner and an art exhibition.

118
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,090
Buy tickets and the advanced-purchase photo album,

119
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,720
for the opportunity to receive Daniel King's autograph.

120
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,560
Hsiao Hsi Tsai and Chou Chiong Wen - 96%

121
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,200
Wu Cheng Sheng and Lin Ya Chi - 93%

122
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,590
Hsu Tsong Jie and Lee Jia Ru - 92%

123
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,720
I used to think I wanted a traditional wife who assisted her husband and educated the children.

124
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,390
But it turns out, I prefer my significant other to have her own career.

125
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,540
I never realized that what I wanted wasn't romantic surprises,

126
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,240
but someone who was willing to listen and accompany me.

127
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,970
Thanks to your system, we were able to find each other.

128
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,930
The system is undoubtedly perfect.
[Su Tsong Jie and Lee Jia Ru - 92%]

129
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,570
Liu Hsiu Kang and Tsai Yi Chiung - 95%

130
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,320
So where is the problem?
[Jian Ming Shan and Tsai Yi Ting - 94%]

131
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,830
Chien Ming Shan and Tsai Yi Ting - 94%

132
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,330
Huo Yung Tai and Yan Fei - 98%

133
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,750
Unknown

134
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,390
Hello?

135
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,030
There's no reason for us to meet anymore, right?

136
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,320
- Hello?
- Hello, Little Piggy?

137
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,830
Something suddenly came up today. I can't have dinner with you anymore.

138
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:00,120
No worries, something suddenly came up for me, too.

139
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,950
Bye bye.

140
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,500
Bye bye.

141
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,090
Hurry! I'm worried I won't be able to get the tickets.

142
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,540
There are still three hours until sales begin. Why are we rushing?

143
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not like you're trying to get concert tickets.

144
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,240
Trust me.

145
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Tickets are really hard to get. I'm going to wait in line at the venue. I'm sure everyone else will, too.

146
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,220
As if! You can tell it sounds unpopular.

147
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,340
I was originally going on a date tonight.

148
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,260
Silks Palace
(high-end restaurant in the National Palace Museum in Taipei)

149
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,290
What did you say? A flight delay?

150
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,230
It's all right.

151
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,440
Okay.

152
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,540
Yes, just continue waiting there.

153
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,500
Sure, it's fine.

154
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,240
Yes, just pick him up.

155
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,510
That sounds good. Okay, sure, see you later.

156
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,930
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,240
You don't need to apologize. Even in the past, President Huo had a myriad of things to attend to.

158
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,520
Let's just be more direct. What would it take for you to sell "Yellow" to me?

159
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,750
I'm not planning on selling it to you.

160
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,200
I plan on giving it to you as a present.

161
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,340
This is what I promised before.

162
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,460
In this three-color series, we are just missing "Yellow." Give me some time.

163
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,520
I will definitely get it for you.

164
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,000
You've made many promises to me and broken them too.

165
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,480
I will pretend you never made this promise.

166
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,920
With our current relationship, just name a price.

167
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,430
Do you know when I bought that painting?

168
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,970
- I—
- Ten years ago.

169
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,640
It was originally supposed to be your birthday gift.

170
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,420
I thought the greatest gift we gave each other that day

171
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,180
was freedom.

172
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,200
I never considered separating from you.

173
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,750
Then why didn't you chase after me?

174
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,390
When I had nowhere to go and no choice but to return home,

175
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,090
do you know what was waiting for me?

176
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,990
Something suddenly came up at the company. I need to fly to Seattle.

177
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,090
Sorry for ruining your birthday.

178
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:37,420
When I come back, I'll make it up to you. Wait for me. Terry.

179
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,860
Divorce Paper

180
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,450
At the time, when I saw the divorce paper on the table,

181
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,700
I thought that was what you wanted most.

182
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,760
Therefore, I always thought it was you who had given up on us.

183
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,810
Did I give up on us?

184
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,100
Who exactly gave up on whom?

185
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,670
Didn't I take the wedding ring with me? That was the last chance I gave you!

186
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,470
But what did you do? Did you try to get me back?

187
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,180
You didn't. Instead, you signed your name on the divorce paper!

188
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,620
Not only did you sign it, you also returned the home we rented.

189
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,370
You left an airplane ticket for me. What was our marriage to you?

190
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,980
Did you ever care about whether I was alive or not?

191
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,860
Do you know how I got through that period of time?

192
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,430
Then do you know how I got through that time?

193
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:13,160
I know. All thanks to my mom, I know everything about you.

194
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,610
After the divorce, your career took off, and the women beside you changed one after another.

195
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,220
So you don't care, right?

196
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,820
I don't care at all.

197
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,410
I just wanted to find your shadow in them.

198
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,880
Because in the end, I realized my heart contained only you.

199
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,960
Save those words to trick those twenty-something young girls.

200
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,440
In those days, happiness for me was

201
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,920
hearing Mom sharing your news with me in excitement.

202
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,660
Only when I heard you were doing well, would I feel a bit of happiness.

203
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,610
I really miss the food you cooked.

204
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,680
I miss the empty half of the closet.

205
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,290
I miss the light scent of mineral spirits in your art studio.

206
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,190
I also miss the cut fruit in the refrigerator.

207
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,060
I miss us going to see art exhibitions together.

208
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,610
I even miss

209
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,730
your countless badgering phone calls during meetings.

210
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,290
You are right. Perhaps only after obtaining success,

211
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,340
people want to get back what they had before. So, Finley—

212
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,700
Don't say anymore. I don't want to hear it.

213
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,650
No matter how you explain it,

214
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,330
you are that selfish

215
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,600
b*stard who abandoned me!

216
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,390
- You don't love me! You only love yourself—
- I love you!

217
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,090
I have always loved you.

218
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,430
And I've only ever loved you.

219
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,020
Daniel King!

220
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,880
Terry,

221
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,170
I heard you were in such a hurry to find me.

222
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,940
I'd like you to meet someone very important.

223
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,490
Come here.

224
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,660
This is my wife,

225
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,120
Finley.

226
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,260
Pleasure to meet you.

227
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,600
Kingstone Bookstore

228
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,270
I can't believe we were able to get them.

229
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,060
Hey! Hey!

230
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,790
So lucky, it's the last pair.

231
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,420
Are there actually people who would want to see things like art exhibitions?

232
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,950
They fought so intensely for the tickets.

233
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,590
Just because you don't want to go,

234
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,430
doesn't mean no one else wants to.

235
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,180
Daniel King - End of Time

236
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,790
Yan Fei will definitely be surprised when she sees these.

237
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,000
Just like back then,

238
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,120
I hope it will give her a beaming smile.

239
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
I'm glad to finally meet you.

240
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,030
I've heard a lot about you.

241
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,130
Actually, I'm not his wife.

242
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,370
I'm his ex-wife.

243
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,210
Really?

244
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,940
What a pity.

245
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,560
Well, he showed me your work before.

246
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,300
It's great.

247
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:47,490
And I think we can do a crossover work for the next exhibition.

248
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,040
Yes, that's a good idea.

249
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,940
No. No, no, no, no.

250
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,590
I haven't painted in such a long time.

251
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,710
Come on. Don't give up.

252
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,870
I think you are very talented.

253
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,240
Please come in.

254
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,240
Thank you.

255
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,680
It's one of my favorite works.

256
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,220
I hope you don't mind if I sign it.

257
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,360
It would be my honor, please.

258
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,510
Please.

259
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,480
Happy birthday,

260
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,700
even though this gift is ten years late.

261
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,110
To my partner for the next exhibition. - D.K.

262
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,100
Happy birthday.

263
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,250
Thank you.

264
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,390
Hey, Guys, let's take a photo.

265
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,410
Okay.

266
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,800
Say cheese.

267
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,930
- May I join?
- Of course.

268
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,430
Thanks.

269
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,300
One, two, three... cheese.

270
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,520
One, two, three... cheese.

271
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,730
One, two, three.

272
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,340
This is... Cyan!

273
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,330
Daniel King's breakout work Cyan,

274
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,660
the first painting in the color series.

275
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,250
Marry me.

276
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,580
It's Magenta!

277
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,350
Happy marriage.

278
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,370
Happy birthday.

279
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,440
Thank you.

280
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,910
Say cheese.

281
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,370
That's just despicable.

282
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:27,400
He used Daniel King as a weapon.

283
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,340
Feifei,

284
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,230
have you seen the digestive medicine?

285
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,020
I'm about to go crazy.

286
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,320
I found the medicine box.

287
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,970
Let's see what there is.

288
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,500
There's only anti-diarrheal medicine.

289
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,120
Or anti-itch cream...

290
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,250
But its coming out from the top,

291
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,580
not the bottom.

292
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,540
Then... let's see what else there is. Wait a moment.

293
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,170
I'll make you some honey water, all right?

294
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,240
Wait a moment.

295
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,990
You came home so late.

296
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,280
Were you on a date with Hsuan Yu?

297
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,470
You went out with Huo Yung Tai, didn't you?

298
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,550
My goodness,

299
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,850
Huo Yung Tai really sharpened his sword.

300
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,430
Don't worry. I didn't fall for his trap at all.

301
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,950
I am just trying to help our system debug.

302
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,120
So you matched yourself up with that trash? (lit.: betel nut dregs)

303
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,950
What was the score?

304
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,070
Ninety-eight percent!

305
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,070
If you and Betel Nut Dregs

306
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,030
can get ninety-eight percent,

307
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,880
then would you and Hsuan Yu be one hundred percent?

308
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,660
Twenty-nine percent...

309
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,400
- So what?
- What do you mean, "so what"?

310
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,330
Our company uses this system

311
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,600
to help match up our members.

312
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,510
If there is a problem in our system,

313
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,780
then it's a major fundamental problem!

314
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,670
I must uncover where the bug is!

315
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,670
Okay, okay, don't worry.

316
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,290
Listen to me.

317
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,610
Our system doesn't have a problem.

318
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,320
Our system is wonderful.

319
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,380
Look, hasn't that Betel Nut Dregs

320
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,990
got you all worked up,

321
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,450
while you've made no progress with Hsuan Yu?

322
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,560
Perfection is good,

323
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,340
but... we are humans.

324
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,720
Humans like taking the harder path.

325
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,000
They like chasing after excitement,

326
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,490
repeating the same mistakes,

327
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,900
doing what they know they shouldn't do,

328
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,370
willfully going through the hills knowing there are tigers (taking risks despite the dangers),

329
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,560
like moths attracted to the flame. Yet undaunted by the dangers.

330
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,930
What?

331
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,100
I will explain it to you in a different way.

332
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,830
Dating the school's model student

333
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,270
or dating the school gang leader,

334
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,780
which one do you think is more exciting?

335
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,990
Dating the

336
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,000
gang leader sounds too dangerous.

337
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
If you're not careful, you can ruin your whole life!

338
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,870
Of course, it's the model student.

339
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,310
Forget the school gang leader.

340
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,470
I've even been with

341
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,160
the school teacher before.

342
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,480
Has my life been ruined?

343
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,340
Maybe

344
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,950
this is your life's biggest problem.

345
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,420
And it's the biggest problem in our company's system.

346
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,370
What problem?

347
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,400
Dad, Mom,

348
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,860
the investment opportunity in Nai Hui's bank

349
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,820
seems to provide better returns than Auntie Ah Jiao's investment opportunity.

350
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,930
So Nai Hui wants me to ask if you two are interested.

351
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,240
Really?

352
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,000
This afternoon, I was about to transfer money to Ah Jiao.

353
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,920
Then let's do this. Let's directly

354
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,930
deposit the money to Miss Cho's bank.

355
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,350
It seems like Miss Cho

356
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,950
can really assist her husband (bring her husband luck).

357
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,360
Such a good opportunity!

358
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,190
She immediately told our You Fu.

359
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,190
Then what is her routing number?

360
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,620
I-I forgot to ask.

361
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,370
Such important information and you forgot to ask?

362
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,240
I-I will ask her tomorrow when we see each other.

363
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,160
Okay,

364
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,250
bring your identification card and personal seal.

365
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,090
Settle what you ought to settle

366
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,770
with Miss Cho.

367
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,130
W-We are not there yet.

368
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,010
I haven't even proposed yet.

369
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,870
What are you thinking about?

370
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,920
I am talking about opening an account!

371
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,250
What are you thinking about?

372
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,840
May the seasons always be favorable.

373
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,400
You Fu!

374
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,160
Wear this. Wear this.

375
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,270
This is my preferred

376
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,770
suit for picking up girls.

377
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,070
Th-This style...

378
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,910
Isn't it too old-fashioned?

379
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,690
Isn't vintage in fashion now?

380
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,110
This is perfect. Try it on.

381
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,180
Here, here, wear these.

382
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,610
I'm not near-sighted.

383
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,620
These complete the style.

384
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,880
Come on. Put them on.

385
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,720
All right.

386
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,440
- Thanks, Dad.
- You look so nice.

387
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,010
Go look in the mirror. Go, go.

388
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,930
Are you ready yet? Are you ready yet?

389
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,660
Is this my son?

390
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,930
All right, all right, you are running late.

391
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,680
Hurry and go.

392
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,320
Don't forget to bring your identification card and personal seal, for opening a bank account.

393
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,390
I have them with me.

394
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,210
- Then... I'm off to catch the bus.
- All right.

395
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,520
Okay.

396
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,160
You are so pretty today.

397
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,040
Your suit...

398
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,520
This is the suit my dad wore in his youth.

399
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,960
Back in the days, my dad wore this suit

400
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,060
to woo my mom.

401
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,170
- Your cake is here.
- Thank you.

402
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,030
Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom—

403
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,630
Sorry, sorry, let me get a towel.

404
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,190
I-I'm sorry.

405
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,850
It's okay.

406
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm sorry.

407
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,800
It's all right.

408
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,090
I will buy you a suit to make up for this.

409
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,480
It's okay.

410
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,240
I insist.

411
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,620
Hello, Miss Cho.

412
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,740
Miss Cho, which style are you looking for today?

413
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,350
My friend needs a suit that is suitable for an important social gathering.

414
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,290
Please wait a moment. We shall get things ready for you.

415
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,970
Thank you.

416
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,150
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

417
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,750
- Let's start with these.
- Okay.

418
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,020
Sir, please follow me.

419
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,500
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

420
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,160
Then let's try the next set.

421
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,000
It really suits you.

422
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,860
I think... I look like...

423
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,150
You Fu-rella (word play on Cinderella).

424
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,340
We will take this one,

425
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,620
and the shoes, too.

426
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,540
Nai Hui,

427
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,300
- I can pay for it.
- That won't do.

428
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,400
I ruined your suit.

429
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,020
The suit only needs to be washed.

430
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,060
I still need to thank you for coming with me to buy clothes.

431
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,740
I have it.

432
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,280
How much?

433
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,800
With Miss Cho's VIP discount, it would be NT$57,000 (US$2,057).

434
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,920
One moment, please.

435
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,140
Hello?

436
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,790
Yes.

437
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,660
I-I am buying clothes.

438
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,440
Please help me raise my credit limit.

439
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,970
Thank you.

440
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,360
No worries, I usually don't spend that much with my credit card.

441
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,260
The bank called out of concern. That's all.

442
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,530
Okay.

443
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,570
Thank you.

444
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,040
Oh,

445
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,150
please express deliver this to my house.

446
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,700
- This, I—
- At least let me clean it for you.

447
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,640
You can't refuse!

448
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,410
Okay.

449
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,940
- Okay, how about this color?
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

450
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,920
But my mom said, this hair color makes me look like a bad girl.

451
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,640
Then...

452
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,810
This one, let's not look at the hair color yet.

453
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:50,200
This entire style is similar to your original hairstyle.

454
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,170
It's just a bit more fresh and lively.

455
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,990
Then the length will be about here.

456
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:59,810
- Take a look in the mirror, around here.
- That short?

457
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,690
Will that affect my face shape?

458
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,570
If you want to keep it mid-length,

459
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,770
this is about the length of your original hairstyle.

460
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,980
Then at the ends, we just need to create a luxuriant, romantic curl.

461
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,740
But I've never done this type of style before.

462
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,290
I'm not sure if it will be suitable.

463
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,670
Miss Luo, excuse me. Have you not decided yet?

464
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,620
It's been almost an hour.

465
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,630
I want to kindly remind you, your arranged date will be in two days.

466
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,360
The hairstylist has been discussing this with you for two weeks,

467
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,360
and he is very busy. He isn't only in charge of you.

468
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,260
I really can't make up my mind.

469
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,150
Sorry, I didn't mean to do this on purpose.

470
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,460
I really can't make up my mind so quickly.

471
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,200
Am I being difficult?

472
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,010
- It's okay, no worries. Take your time and discuss slowl—
- Yes,

473
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,150
you are being difficult!

474
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,310
We provided this information a long time ago!

475
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,650
We even said you could show the stylists pictures of styles you liked for reference.

476
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,570
But what now? Are you here crying crocodile tears?

477
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,780
As if the entire world is picking on you!

478
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,590
That... Hsuan Yu will take care of the situation here. Come with me.

479
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,990
- I'm talking to the clien—
- Just come with me.

480
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,530
What is it?

481
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,630
You are so fired up. Did you find a gun?

482
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,940
Isn't she your client?

483
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,220
I have been frustrated with her for a long time.

484
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,870
It feels great to let it out.

485
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,710
You really have more guts than Ou Wen.

486
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,810
Last time I yelled at a client for him, he said something like,

487
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,220
"clients are my salary. They are my gods."

488
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,830
"Don't break off my livelihood."

489
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,150
What?

490
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,310
You are acting strange!

491
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,270
What?

492
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,620
Hold on!

493
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,990
What?

494
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,790
This is the birthday present I deliberately picked for Ou Wen to disgust him!

495
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,930
Why is it on you?

496
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,350
Why are you laughing? You'd better explain everything.

497
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,900
Understood?

498
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,770
Let me take a look.

499
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:47,150
It suits you so well.

500
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,160
Let's go.

501
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,030
It's great! It's great!

502
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,050
You became a big boss.

503
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,910
- Manager of a restaurant? Then you're treating us today.
- Okay, okay.

504
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,060
- I will go greet the others.
- Go ahead.

505
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,600
- Hey, long time no see.
- Hi!

506
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,770
- Hi, Wen Kai!
- Hey, Ying Xuan, long time no see.

507
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,040
Right?

508
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,810
This is...

509
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,150
My fiancée.

510
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,210
When did he break up with Nai Hui?

511
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,830
Who knows? I thought they already had children!

512
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,320
- So young! Come sit there.
- Okay.

513
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,260
- Sit there.
- Thank you.

514
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,970
Long time no see!

515
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,140
Cho Nai Hui!

516
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,460
Hey! You have maintained yourself too well.

517
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,160
So annoying...

518
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,230
Hey, this handsome guy is...

519
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,680
This is my boyfriend.

520
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,380
Among our classmates, either we married early,

521
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,540
became mothers and lost our figures,

522
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,250
or we ended up as old maids who can't get married,

523
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,030
but Nai Hui is different. She stays in the best condition forever!

524
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,330
- Not at all.
- Come, sit here.

525
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,870
Come. Sit here.

526
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,840
Nai Hui, how did you two meet?

527
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,470
- We... we—
- We coincidentally met at a café.

528
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:11,560
I wore a pair of uncomfortable heels that didn't suit my feet.

529
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,970
He even helped me buy band-aids.

530
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:18,090
- So romantic!
- So considerate!

531
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,820
He is so thoughtful.

532
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,570
Nai Hui, congratulations.

533
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,740
Did you find your true love so quickly?

534
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,190
Of course.

535
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:41,580
We can't have you... enjoy happiness alone.

536
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,930
Wen Kai is Nai Hui's ex-boyfriend.

537
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,620
- Long time no see!
- Long time no see!

538
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,900
I think right now,

539
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,800
US Dollar is likely to depreciate. That's good for investing.

540
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,440
I think it's good to invest in gold, copper, zinc,

541
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,470
and agricultural products.

542
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

543
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,890
Are you in investment as well?

544
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,510
No, I'm a farmer.

545
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,970
What?

546
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,840
Isn't that very trendy nowadays?

547
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,620
Oh, like engineer farmers... micro farmers!

548
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,980
Since you have Nai Hui, the investment goddess, to give you advice, did you invest in anything?

549
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,410
Yes, I was going to invest in a structured note.

550
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,650
I heard that if I invest NT$100,

551
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,700
I can gain NT$50 in forty-five days and double my investments in ninety days

552
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,750
to make it NT$200.

553
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,890
I stopped him.

554
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,170
Nai Hui,

555
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:14,340
when we broke up two months ago, you said you would definitely marry before me and Hsiao Ying.

556
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,450
There is only one month left.

557
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,920
Did you panic?

558
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,810
Is that why...

559
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,560
Actually, I didn't take what you said seriously.

560
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,600
You really don't need to do this.

561
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,290
He doesn't even know what a Ponzi scheme (investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors) is. It looks like

562
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,520
he really is just a farmer from the country side.

563
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,600
That's right.

564
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,340
I am a farmer from Yunlin.

565
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,670
Do you know what the specialties of Yunlin are?

566
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,130
Do you know the differences between domestic and imported cabbages,

567
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,030
which crops need to be planted in crop rotation,

568
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,340
and which crops can be planted continuously,

569
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,320
which vegetables are in season each month?

570
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,590
Do you know how many kinds of crop pests there are?

571
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,100
That's ridiculous.

572
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,270
We're not farmers so why would we need to know all of that?

573
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,910
That's right. You all are not farmers

574
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,040
so it's very normal for you not to know those things.

575
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,870
Then why is it embarrassing when a farmer doesn't know about Ponzi schemes?

576
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,620
Fortunately, Nai Hui broke up with you.

577
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,340
People like you don't deserve her at all.

578
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,780
Ever since working with Voodoo, our success rate for pairings

579
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,750
has increased by thirty percent these months.

580
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:09,050
I have organized the restaurants and hotels that have worked with us lately,

581
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,260
and planned some events. The first one is camping.

582
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,730
- The location—
- As for the event details, Ou Wen, you can just confirm them with Sheng Ying.

583
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,370
I still have something to do this afternoon.

584
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:21,990
Then we can end today's meeting. Give me the meeting minutes before the end of the day.

585
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,910
Then I... I'm...

586
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,290
leaving, too.

587
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,420
Love Is Science

588
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,740
Are you done with work?

589
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,400
Not yet.

590
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,230
However, I'm the boss.

591
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,870
Let's go eat.

592
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,370
Do you have time tomorrow? Can I pick you up in the morning?

593
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,500
To have breakfast?

594
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,360
To go on a date,

595
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,550
not between an older sister and a younger brother.

596
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,770
It's the type between a man and woman,

597
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,390
an official date.

598
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,580
♫ The quietest thing isn't the deep sea ♫

599
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:20,050
♫ It's the street where I met you ♫

600
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,490
♫ The hardest things to calm down are not the stormy waves ♫

601
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:27,120
♫ It's my heartbeat that broke through the sky ♫

602
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,690
♫ That day, I flipped through all the books ♫

603
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,250
♫ I love you yet still can't say why ♫

604
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,760
♫ The straight line belongs to men, the curved one to god (Antoni Gaudi) ♫

605
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,330
Let's go eat.

606
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:44,890
♫ Can't you see? ♫

607
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,450
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

608
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,800
♫ Like a panicky amateur player ♫

609
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:57,610
♫ It's just that the bargaining chip on the table is me ♫

610
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,420
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

611
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,380
Daddy is bad. I hate Daddy the most!

612
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,240
Jia Jia is the bad one.

613
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,690
If you continue like this, I won't buy you toys from now on!

614
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,010
What happened?

615
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:20,630
Wang Hsuan Yang, aren't you childish for fighting with your four-year old daughter?

616
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:24,310
It's your daughter who is childish, so noisy!

617
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,480
I want to go see Mei Mei. Mei Mei is my friend.

618
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,530
Who is Mei Mei?

619
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,490
Mei Mei is a rabbit at the flower shop.

620
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,830
Last time, we passed by and she couldn't forget about it.

621
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,960
Don't you know how far that is? I have to go all the way around and cross two main streets. It's dangerous.

622
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,920
You said you would take me there to see it!

623
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,190
I did. I did say that, but when?

624
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:47,830
When you are on vacation, right? Right now is off-work time. So there are a lot of cars, and it's dangerous. Do you know?

625
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,110
- I want to see Mei Mei...
- Are you going to keep crying? Are you?

626
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,390
We won't go see Mei Mei even when we are on vacation!

627
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,260
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

628
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,260
And are you such a big man because you can threaten a child?

629
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,390
Besides, are you in a rush now? What's wrong with taking her to see it for a bit?

630
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:01,780
It's you who spoiled her.

631
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,170
Right now, she doesn't have the ability to go see the rabbit herself.

632
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:08,240
When she grows up, she will run even further. And you'll have to chase after her. What will you do?

633
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,070
The child agrees with you now because of your authority as the dad, not because she really agrees.

634
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,750
In the future, whether it's to take the long route or whatever it is,

635
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:20,610
it will be the life she chooses. If you can't walk this path for her,

636
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,480
then don't use a father's authority to make the decision for her.

637
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,900
It's just about seeing a rabbit. Why are you talking about life philosophies and all?

638
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:36,440
That's right. It's just about making a detour, yet you were childish enough to fight with our daughter!

639
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,810
All right,

640
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,630
Daddy is sorry.

641
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,530
Don't cry anymore.

642
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,050
Daddy was wrong. We will go see Mei Mei tomorrow, all right?

643
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,540
Pinky promise.

644
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:11,720
You are such a troublemaker. Yes, you are.

645
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,360
Yes, you are.

646
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,180
Since you know how to apologize, I guess there is hope for you.

647
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,360
However, is there still someone whom you forgot to apologize to?

648
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,940
Older Brother.

649
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,330
Eat breakfast at school.

650
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,710
Is Older Brother still mad that I didn't go to Milan?

651
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,790
That's not the same. It's for his sake.

652
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,770
You're his older brother, not his dad.

653
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:42,300
Also, even if Dad was still alive, you two cannot help him make decisions about his life.

654
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,800
Did you forget that he's been an adult for a very long time now?

655
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:58,110
Hey, you're here.

656
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,460
What's going on? Where is Mr. Chou?

657
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,780
And where is Yun Hsi?

658
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:12,680
♫ Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you ♫

659
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,250

660
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,230
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

661
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:22,880
Yes!

662
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,360
I think it's very disgusting and dirty!

663
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,640
Hey, you have never encountered such a considerate client, right?

664
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,110
If she hadn't reminded me, I would have almost forgotten it's your birthday.

665
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,920
Sheng Ying, happy birthday.

666
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,770
Here, blow out the candle and make a wish.

667
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:16,830
I want to tell you I'm sorry.

668
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,620
- Back then—
- I don't accept your apology!

669
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,460
Don't be like this.

670
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,800
How long has it been now?

671
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,820
Who asked you to be a busybody?

672
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,910
Congratulations on successfully ruining my birthday!

673
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,490
It's okay. It's okay.

674
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,720
Did you see Cheng Wen Kai's expression?

675
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,020
It was so satisfying!

676
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,070
I had never thought you would serve it back to him like that.

677
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:11,120
Seeing the image of him and his fiancée fleeing,

678
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,380
- th-that feeling is really—
- Let's—

679
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,790
It's really—

680
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,930
Let's stop here.

681
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:24,320
We are still quite far from the bus stop.

682
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,610
I mean,

683
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:33,590
after today... let's not contact each other anymore.

684
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,720
What... what's wrong? Are you angry?

685
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,440
Did I say something wrong? Did I do something wrong?

686
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:53,680
Before, I couldn't understand why a woman as good as you

687
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,450
would go to Love Is Science, why you would set an arranged date with me.

688
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,090
It turns out...

689
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,940
I was just helping you put up a show. Just a replacement...

690
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,110
That's not the case!

691
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:19,140
I admit, in the beginning, I didn't want to lose to him.

692
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,140
So I registered at a marriage agency.

693
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,040
But as I spent time with you,

694
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,080
I-I really was happy.

695
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,520
I had long forgotten all the stupid words I said back then.

696
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,660
This morning, that coffee...

697
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,780
You intentionally spilt it, right?

698
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,720
You were afraid people would discover I'm just an ordinary farmer.

699
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:54,720
You don't want people to know we met through old-fashioned blind dates.

700
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,050
What you like

701
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,270
is Wu You Fu who looks like this,

702
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,360
but this isn't me.

703
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,180
That's not true. It really isn't!

704
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,750
I know that spilling the coffee was really despicable.

705
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:20,160
It was my fault. I really don't know what I was thinking,

706
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,220
but... all the places we've been to before,

707
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,420
and checked in online... All those beautiful memories

708
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,510
are all real.

709
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,140
I like you.

710
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,900
Is that true?

711
00:56:54,610 --> 00:57:00,720
Miss Cho Nai Hui, I, Wu You Fu, am just an ordinary farmer.

712
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,470
I only own one old ox,

713
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:06,580
one plot of farmland, and a Farmers' Association.

714
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,440
I am willing to entrust my everything to you.

715
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,500
Will you marry me?

716
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,650
We are also each other's Ponzi scheme.

717
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,250
We clearly know we will lose all our investments,

718
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,650
but until the last moment,

719
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:01,860
we are unwilling to believe in this ending.

720
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,730
Thank you.

721
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:13,760
It's like I've dreamt a very beautiful dream.

722
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:18,260
It's just that time is up.

723
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,070
"You Fu-rella" should wake up now.

724
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,420
I'm sorry.

725
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,990
Promise me,

726
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,250
you will live happily.

727
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,720
I'll get going first.

728
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,030
National Taipei University

729
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,320
It's so hot.

730
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:04,110
Little Piggy, the sun is so bright today,

731
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:08,030
and we have to ride so far to buy Daniel King's limited-edition picture album.

732
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:11,050
Will we die from a heatstroke on the way there?

733
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:13,990
It's not like the picture album is F4's (popular Taiwanese boyband) photobook.

734
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,450
There probably will still be more by the time we get there.

735
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,890
What do you know? Limited editions are harsh.

736
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,700
Do you know how difficult it is to buy Daniel King's spin-off merchandise?

737
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,660
Last time I was only ten minutes late, only ten minutes!

738
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,490
And some of the popular ones were already sold out.

739
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,760
I have decided. Let's rush.

740
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,220
Let's go.

741
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:37,930
Yan Fei?

742
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:42,290
Terry, why are you here?

743
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,360
Mother Yan asked me to pick you up.

744
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,560
But we decided on going to buy the picture album.

745
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,090
Do you mean Daniel King's?

746
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:53,660
