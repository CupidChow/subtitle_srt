I only like you. How many times do you need me to say this?

10

11

Actually, I know that your family must have a hard time accepting me.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,780
What I really want is to find an opportunity to formally introduce you to my family.

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,290
Instead of having them discover our relationship in a sloppy manner.

14

Sister-in-law is in the delivery room, and my brother is in surgery for his fractured arm.

15

- I'll take care of it.

16

I'm very happy that when you need me, I can use my own strength to help you.

I don't want to turn into the type of hairstylist that you want me to become.

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,570
You really have not changed a bit!

159
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,500
Why are you here?

160
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,990
Why aren't you picking up my calls?

161
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,690
I just wanted to be by myself.

162
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,290
Why are you hiding away by yourself?

163
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,270
I didn't want you to worry.

164
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,810
You are at it again.

165
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,040
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

166
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,050
You're so nice that it becomes a problem!

167
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,410
Being kind-hearted is your biggest strength but also your fatal weakness.

168
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,220
I just don't want to trouble others.

169
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,670
You don't want to trouble others. You don't want others to worry.

170
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,920
That means you're simply unwilling to interact with others.

171
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,840
If you're unwilling, how can others know your thoughts?

172
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,070
Am I a worm in your stomach?

173
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,770
When your parents left, you hid. When you liked me as a child, you also hid it in your heart.

174
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,460
Before, when you were going with Chin Lan to Milan,

175
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,900
and even now with your resignation, I learned it from others.

176
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,240
How come you never say anything?

177
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,980
I just need time to find a solution!

178
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,010
I dislike tearing things down without rebuilding them or throwing my emotional problems to others.

179
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,020
- That's very irresponsible!
- But what's wrong with that?

180
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,190
Is it wrong to vent?

181
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,720
Why can't we discuss together? You're not trying to evade your problems.

182
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,310
How is that irresponsible?

183
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,270
Pray tell. Is hiding away like this taking responsibility?

184
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,210
I'm just this kind of person! What's wrong with being a horribly good person?

185
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,730
Strengths and weaknesses are always the two sides of the same coin.

186
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,020
I want to think through my problems. Is that so wrong?

187
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,490
Isn't thinking through problems better than you always acting impulsively

188
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,930
and having regrets later?

189
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,170
- Am I always being impulsive?
- Yes!

190
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,320
You saw my brother playing basketball and started to like him.

191
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,500
Marrying Huo Yung Tai upon graduation, then getting divorced just after three years, if that's not impulsive, what is?

192
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,150
What's wrong with that?

193
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,960
My personality is just like that! Is this the first day you've met me?

194
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,280
That's right! That's why I never said anything about it!

195
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,730
I can only watch helplessly as you act on impulse then get hurt!

196
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,430
Do you think it was easy for me?

197
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,970
That's because no one has ever stopped me!

198
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,840
- Who can stop you?
- You!

199
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,080
You can stop me!

200
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,540
Next time I'm acting impulsively,

201
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,250
you can remind me

202
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,330
to wait a minute.

203
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,390
"Calm down first. Don't act on impulse."

204
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,460
Okay?

205
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,600
I promise you.

206
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,100
I will also learn to slow down my steps.

207
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,730
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,040
But later, if you discover I'm looking a bit strange,

209
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,560
you can tell me directly.

210
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,850
"Cut the nonsense. Hurry and tell me."

211
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,290
"I don't have all day." Say something like that.

212
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,220
I will work hard to learn how to communicate.

213
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,430
I promise.

214
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,260
Then in the future, do you have any plans?

215
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,630
Maybe going to a different hair salon first.

216
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,260
Actually, I've always had a plan.

217
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,660
I want to open a hair salon myself.

218
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,740
That's great! Why not do that now?

219
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,830
You're acting impulsively again.

220
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,330
Actually, I have been saving money.

221
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,390
I have a vision, a dream in my heart.

222
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,170
I want to achieve it slowly, a step at a time.

223
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,670
How slow do you mean by "slowly"?

224
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,410
About... ten years?

225
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,330
Ten years? That's too long.

226
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,130
Let me tell you. Nowadays, hair salon owners have their own business philosophies.

227
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,500
Only if it's your own store can you use your own method and style to treat your customers.

228
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,110
It doesn't need ten years. Right now, this timing is just right.

229
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,260
Of course, at first, it can be very difficult.

230
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,690
But you are still young. You can take on the challenge, right?

231
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,450
Could I really open my own shop right now?

232
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,300
I always thought it would happen much later.

233
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,730
As long as you cross over the first step,

234
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,180
"Later" won't be that far away.

235
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,910
Let's get you home first.

236
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,870
When I came earlier, your brother was worried about you.

237
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,190
Come home with me.

238
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,330
About us... it's time to let them know.

239
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,850
Are you ready?

240
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,280
I'm ready.

241
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,040
Then why are your hands so cold?

242
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,000
Don't be nervous.

243
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,190
Even though my brother may be a bit surprised, I believe

244
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,470
that he will give us his blessings.

245
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,970
Let's go.

246
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,040
Hey. Last question.

247
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,420
How's my condition today?

248
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,150
You will always be very beautiful.

249
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,880
Hey, did you guys come home?

250
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,240
I made some sesame oil chicken. Hurry and come try it.

251
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,560
Hsuan Yu, pull up another chair.

252
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,420
Okay.

253
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,010
Let me come help you.

254
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,860
Let these two worry about it. Take a seat.

255
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,070
You are our guest. Just leave it to Hsuan Yu and me.

256
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,660
- I'll bring some more appetizers.
- Okay. Okay!

257
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,480
A bowl, a bowl, where are the bowls?

258
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,820
Eat. Eat. Eat.

259
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,820
That–

260
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,720
Actually, Hsuan Yu has some things he wants to tell everyone.

261
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,440
You are already calling me big brother.

262
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,310
Then I won't treat you as an outsider.

263
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,290
Actually, I have some things I want to say.

264
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,880
I think he was acting too impulsively when he quit his job.

265
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,440
So I want to say that we who are his elders—

266
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,010
Hey! Do you know how to speak? Who are Hsuan Yu's elders?

267
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,900
No. She's not.

268
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,700
Actually, I support Hsuan Yu leaving Voodoo to start his own business.

269
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,060
He's young. He also has a set customer base.

270
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,640
And our company's members all acknowledge his skills.

271
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,950
I truly believe that while he is young, he can strive for it.

272
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,580
That's true. What Yan Fei said makes sense.

273
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,200
To be honest, Yan Fei, you took care of Hsuan Yu a lot ever since he was young.

274
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,520
With you by his side, we can all rest assured.

275
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,310
To be honest, I stopped treating you as an outsider a long time ago. How about this?

276
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,720
Instead of tomorrow, let's seize the occasion.

277
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,470
How about you two here today become...

278
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,150
sworn brother and sister?

279
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,810
- What?
- What?

280
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,370
Sworn siblings?

281
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,980
Here. Consider this sesame oil chicken as alcohol.

282
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,620
I'll drink first (to seal a newly sworn relationship). Once you finish, you'll become my younger sister.

283
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,290
Okay.

284
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,300
Hsuan Yu, call her Older Sister.

285
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,300
- She's not my older sister! She's my—
- Hsuan Yu, you're so impolite!

286
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,780
- That's not it.
- Who's being rude? Hsuan Yang, you're the rudest one!

287
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,390
- Can't you tell they're dating? Why are you telling them to be sworn siblings?
- What?

288
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,500
- Are you two dating?
- Yes!

289
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,370
Yan Fei is very old! Yan Fei has divorced before.

290
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,910
- Do you hear yourself speaking? What generation is it now? Who cares about such things?
- Brother!

291
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,890
Yan Fei is my girlfriend now.

292
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,480
And I am very certain that the person I like is her.

293
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,770
Did you hear that?

294
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:50,700
I-I-I-I heard him. But I-I...

295
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,480
I've arrived.

296
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,650
Did my brother's words make you sad?

297
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,890
No.

298
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,440
Maybe just a little?

299
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,310
Okay. Maybe this much?

300
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,510
Thank you for telling me how you feel.

301
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,400
Before, I only liked to report good news and hide bad news.

302
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,620
But now that I heard you confess how that made you feel,

303
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,020
I actually find that very reassuring.

304
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,040
I'm sorry you have to go through this.

305
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,120
I promise that it won't happen anymore in the future.

306
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,440
Now, I really feel like your girlfriend,

307
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,970
even though your brother is so tactless.

308
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,800
But at least we made things clear with them.

309
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,800
How strange.

310
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,560
After our argument, I finally feel like I'm your boyfriend.

311
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,990
Arguments have always been a type of communication.

312
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,970
And your past self would not have been brave enough to talk back to me.

313
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,890
That's true. You used to be a goddess.

314
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,310
Used to be a goddess? Then what about now?

315
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,080
Now you're...

316
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,540
my girlfriend.

317
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,420
Go home. It's late.

318
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,890
I'll watch you go inside.

319
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,130
- Good night.
- Good night.

320
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,000
She will be right here. Please wait a bit longer.

321
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,710
Okay.

322
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,030
What is the situation now?

323
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,150
Why are you here? Didn't I say I would take care of things?

324
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,450
I heard from Mu Chi. The client insists on seeing me.

325
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,810
Miss Lo is just being temperamental. We–

326
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,000
You already helped me enough.

327
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,780
The rest of it, I'll handle myself.

328
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,180
I heard you insisted on having me here.

329
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,460
There are so many wedding dresses. I don't know which one to pick.

330
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,260
You should ask your family, friends, or husband about this.

331
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:06,210
I remember the contract includes help with picking a wedding dress and hosting the wedding banquet.

332
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,600
Okay.

333
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,270
Mu Chi said you were having a church wedding.

334
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,860
So if you're having a long or short train,

335
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,840
paired with a long veil will give a dignified, elegant feeling.

336
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,550
This one or

337
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,040
this one should suit you.

338
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:39,100
If I wear a wedding dress that you've picked, will you stop being angry at me?

339
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,550
Lo Yun Hsi. Can you stop throwing a tantrum?

340
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:47,930
With business affairs, you're the client. I can unconditionally follow your wishes.

341
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,960
But with private matters,

342
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,810
you turned my life into h*ll.

343
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,900
Why should I forgive you?

344
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,300
Was only your life affected?

345
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,610
Mine was, too!

346
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,480
At the time, I had no choice.

347
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,120
If I didn't act like that,

348
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,250
they would be angry.

349
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:09,000
I was clearly being forced. Why am I turning into the bad person here?

350
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,010
If you're not the bad person, then am I?

351
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,870
I was also bullied until graduation. Am I the bad guy?

352
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,940
Have you not done anything wrong?

353
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,690
Why did you write a love letter to me?

354
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,950
If it wasn't for that letter, nothing would have happened.

355
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,480
Stop passing off the responsibility!

356
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,020
How could you say that?

357
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,470
Did I say anything wrong?

358
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,670
You clearly knew I liked our senior.

359
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,160
Why did you confess to me?

360
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,300
Stop pretending to be innocent. You selfish ghoul!

361
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,980
You're the selfish one! You disregarded my feelings and confessed!

362
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,360
What I regret the most is liking someone like you!

363
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,720
I regret being your best friend–

364
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,160
How could you say something like that!

365
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,200
It's only the truth. You wrote me that love letter, turning my life upside down. Now you are blaming me!

366
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,790
I treated you so well!

367
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,240
How could you treat me like that?

368
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,570
Did I treat you poorly?

369
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,240
It's fine! It seems that the bride and the planner's discussion on the choice of style

370
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,440
is getting a bit intense, isn't it?

371
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,930
A bit too intense, maybe.

372
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,210
But didn't the bride just say that whatever happens,

373
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,350
- don't disturb them? Thank you!
- I was so nice to you!

374
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:14,230
Haven't I been good to you?

375
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,930
I remember when you transferred to our school,

376
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,990
you were terrible at studies.

377
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,250
Nobody wanted to be your friend.

378
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,510
I lent you my notes, helped you with homework, took care of you.

379
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,840
I've always been grateful to you.

380
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,750
So at the dorm,

381
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,390
I blow dried your hair, knowing you considered it a bother.

382
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,950
I folded your clothes, knowing you considered it a bother.

383
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,760
I knew you liked chocolate milk,

384
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,180
hated soy milk, liked chicken,

385
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,030
and hated peeling shrimps.

386
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:57,130
I'm telling you. All my life, I've only peeled shrimps for one person, and that's you!

387
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,040
You were my best friend!

388
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,830
Why did you have to confess to me?

389
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,560
I was so young.

390
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,580
Someone who claimed to be my friend suddenly said she loved me.

391
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,350
I was scared. I didn't know what to do, how to turn you down.

392
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,620
They didn't teach that at school.

393
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,100
Actually,

394
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,720
all you had to say was "thank you"

395
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,940
and "sorry."

396
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,360
That would be enough.

397
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,730
Good morning, Uncle and Auntie.

398
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,620
I say, You Fu, what is going on?

399
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,650
Are you bringing Nai Hui in the field to work with you?

400
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,850
The boy has lost his mind!

401
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,730
No.

402
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,260
You're mistaken. I insisted on going to help.

403
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,940
- What?
- Miss Cho.

404
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,600
That won't do!

405
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,130
It's hard labor!

406
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,700
Exactly!

407
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,550
Don't worry. I do a workout everyday.

408
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,670
Besides, I've seen the videos. It won't be a problem!

409
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,830
Papa and Mama Fu!

410
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,680
A huge truck is parking outside!

411
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,860
What did you buy?

412
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,840
A massage chair? I didn't order this!

413
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,050
Actually, I did.

414
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,300
I thought the harvest season required hard labor.

415
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,360
So I ordered a massage chair for Uncle, Auntie, and You Fu, of course.

416
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,400
Well, well...

417
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,400
Where should we put it?

418
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,150
Put it in the living room.

419
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,630
Thank you!

420
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,620
Wu, your future daughter-in-law is so sweet.

421
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,360
How nice!

422
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,830
Thanks!

423
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,830
Daikon radishes...

424
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,150
don't need to be peeled so we must wash them carefully.

425
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,630
Okay.

426
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,220
Here.

427
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,640
Chop off the top first.

428
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,610
And then cut it in halves.

429
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,560
Slice it about 1.5 cm thin.

430
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,190
You try.

431
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,670
- Be careful.
- Like this?

432
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,640
Right?

433
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,090
Be careful.

434
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,090
Look!

435
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,060
You are doing great.

436
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,210
Not only is Miss Nai Hui beautiful, but she's also good at everything.

437
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,830
It's fine. I got this.

438
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,800
You two go to the fields, okay?

439
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,720
Come.

440
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,940
Are you sure?

441
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,730
Leave it to me!

442
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,130
If you get tired, just go in and rest.

443
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,250
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

444
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,520
Breakfast!

445
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,990
Where is the breakfast?

446
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,240
Here! Nutrition for an empty stomach.

447
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,710
Ou Wen said later he would take you to the prenatal yoga class.

448
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,240
Before you leave, I need to make sure

449
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,940
that you take all these in the right order.

450
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,660
First, take a mouthful of swallow's nest on an empty stomach.

451
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,540
Plus 100 cc warm water which helps your bowels.

452
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,900
Then a glass of sesame soup and pregnancy formula.

453
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,110
Here we have eight pills: vitamins for pregnancy, folic acid, calcium.

454
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,430
And we finish with pearl powder.

455
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,510
Fei, as Ou Wen's boss, can you pull rank and send him on a business trip?

456
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:59,190
Please.

457
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,250
I don't want to see you suffer, either.

458
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,320
Actually, I asked my mom once.

459
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,880
She said I almost had a big brother or sister.

460
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,040
Unfortunately, the embryo was never fully developed.

461
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,400
Later it was no more.

462
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,720
How are things with Hsuan Yu lately? All good?

463
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,420
His big brother doesn't seem to like me.

464
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,220
Do you mean Wang Hsuan Yang who doubled his own size?

465
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,500
What does he have against you?

466
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,360
Actually, I can understand how he feels.

467
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,780
Understand, my foot!

468
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,750
People want their children to have the best.

469
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,150
He wants his little brother to find someone nice.

470
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,470
Since we both want what's best for Hsuan Yu,

471
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,790
we have to be on the same side.

472
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:18,400
As long as I can make Hsuan Yu happy,

473
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,550
his brother won't have any reason to object, right?

474
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,520
It's a lot of work to start your own business.

475
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,870
Even though Brother Chang Ching still sounds bitter,

476
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,280
I can tell his bark is worse than his bite.

477
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,720
If you apologize, he will accept it.

478
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,530
It's fine. Now I finally have Yan Fei, my brother, and my sister-in-law

479
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,640
to support me in starting my own shop.

480
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,040
I want to give it a shot.

481
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,280
Forget it. You only look agreeable on the outside.

482
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,200
Once you make up your mind, you're more stubborn than ten cows.

483
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,420
So did you come all this way just to talk about Chang Ching?

484
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,870
No...

485
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,810
It's just I'm a bit nervous.

486
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm thinking about going home this afternoon to tell my folks about Ou Wen and Chiao An Na.

487
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,660
It's hard enough to ask them to accept Ou Wen.

488
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,220
Now there's Chiao An Na...

489
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,520
Take good care of yourself.

490
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,390
Anyway, we'll cross the bridge when we come to it.

491
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,760
I've turned gay, and I have a child. These are facts.

492
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,190
Whether they agree or not agree, they can only accept it.

493
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,790
Ultimately, all the parents in the world will want their children to be healthy and happy.

494
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,900
Hsuan Yu likes her, and she is good to Hsuan Yu. That's enough then.

495
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,400
You don't understand. Hsuan Yu is too nice.

496
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,270
He will surely be totally controlled by Yan Fei.

497
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,320
I hope Hsuan Yu will find a partner

498
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,070
who will respect him, admire him, and be thoughtful of him.

499
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,070
There's nothing wrong about Yan Fei.

500
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,010
I should say Yan Fei is too good.

501
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,540
I'm worried that there is too much pressure on Hsuan Yu.

502
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,820
I'm simply thinking selfishly as an older brother for the younger brother. Okay?

503
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,650
Why are you smiling?

504
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,310
I think you are right.

505
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,010
Once my older brother sees that I'm becoming better,

506
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,700
he won't disapprove of Yan Fei anymore.

507
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,370
Listen, you need to tell your parents clearly.

If the situation looks bad,

512
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,630
you must not rush to tell your parents about me.

I know that. I understand.

I noticed that it's about to rain.

518
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,480
Mark told me to take in the clothes drying on the balcony.

519

I forgot about it. What do I do?

Have you ever seen Mark ride the roller board (skateboard)?

So are you the young miss that Hsiao Kai previously mentioned?

I heard Hsiao Kai tell A Wei that Mark had a new girlfriend.

542
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,060
He even specially introduced her to his friends.

543
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,190
It seems that he is very serious and wants to settle down.

No, no, no, no. We are not in that kind of relationship that you are thinking about.

Mark was afraid that there would be a downpour this afternoon.

You called at the perfect time. I happen to have good news to tell you.

This is telepathy.

I also have good news to tell you.

I just sent you a few photos. Take a look now.

Oh, okay.

Did you see them? This is referred by my mom's good friend, Uncle Chang.

556
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,990
Uncle Chang helped my mom find all of the stores and even the flagship store for Beauty Queen.

557

My mom especially asked him to keep the best shop for us.

558
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,420
I took a look just now, and I thought it was really good.

559
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,350
Triangle windows, large space and in an affluent residential area.

560

I think the residents here should have a very high spending power.

561
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,600
Also, let me tell you this. Uncle Chang said that considering you're a young, start-up entrepreneur,

562
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,780
he won't charge you the broker fee. Isn't that great?

I think the budgeted amount may be a little...

You get what you pay for. Most important is the quality.

It's so small here. It can't even be considered a shop.

Yes. But if you start off with such a place here,

584
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,820
how would other people think? What would your older brother think?

585

When our partner salon is changed from Voodoo to a place like this,

588
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,340
don't you know it'll be very hard for me to explain to club members?

589
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,270
Also, your older brother already dislikes me.

590

If you leave Voodoo to work at a place like this,

591

he will only think that you are doing worse and worse after being with me.

00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,590
Almost three months.

634
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,800
Not three months yet so you can't announce it.

635
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,990
We are the grandfather and grandmother. It's okay.

636
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,250
Yes, yes, yes.

637
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,630
But the situation is not what you think.

638
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:49,490
Is Mark not the baby's father?

639
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,010
It's true that he is the baby's father.

640
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:56,170
Or are you not the baby's mother?

641
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,070
I am definitely the baby's mother.

642
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,840
There's no problem then.

643
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:11,170
D*mn Mark. Stinky Mark. You'd better hurry back.

644
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,040
Don't feel awkward. We are very open-minded.

645
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:25,940
But this is all an accident.

646
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,030
I understand. Of course, it's an accident.

647
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,880
A life has been created. How is this not an accident?

648
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,200
Don't worry. We don't mind that you take the bus and buy the ticket later (idiom: pregnant before marriage).

649
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,510
What ticket? I want to rip up (implies killing someone) the ticket!

650
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,470
What kind of work do you do?

651
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:49,330
I'm a flight attendant.

652
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,450
He is indeed my son.

653
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:55,260
His standard is as high as mine.

654
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,410
Mark Lee, if you don't come back now,

655
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:06,340
the grass on your grave will be as tall as you this time next year.

656
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,800
Oh, Mark is back.

657
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,990
How is the situation?

658
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,870
You are...

659
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,650
He is...

660
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,510
I am...

661
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,830
♫ Always be with you ♫

662
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:50,680
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile...  ♫

663
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,930
Oh, Mark is back.

664
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,200
How is the situation?

665
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,930
You are...

666
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,790
He is...

667
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:09,550
I am...

668
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,520
I know.

669
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,570
He is the one in the group photo in the Baby Diary.

670
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,690
You must be Mark's good friend.

671
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:19,160
Oh, yes.

672
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,340
Mr. and Mrs. Lee,

673
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,950
let me formally introduce you.

674
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,990
Tai Ou Wen is Mark's—

675
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,910
Sworn brother!

676
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,620
Yes.

677
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,990
Sworn brothers whose relationship is really good.

678
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:51,560
Don't be like this. Mark asked me to come save you.

679
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,320
Save me? You're adding oil to the fire.

680
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,170
How can I explain after you messed it up?

681
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:01,560
At least, let's get through this together first.

682
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:48,850
Do your best, Cho Nai Hui. You can do it. Nothing can defeat you.

683
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,030
You definitely can do it.

684
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,840
Nai Hui.

685
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,740
Nai Hui!

686
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,040
I'll go get some water.

687
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,970
Nai Hui, are you all right?

688
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,380
Nai Hui, are you okay?

689
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,040
Can you hear me?

690
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,550
Nai Hui.

691
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,860
You're awake! How do you feel?

692
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,220
- Go get a sports drink.
- Okay.

693
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,090
Here.

694
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:12,560
Drink a sports beverage with water to replenish some electrolytes.

695
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:18,790
I... What happened to me?

696
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:20,840
You must have gotten a heatstroke.

697
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:25,410
It's fine. My mom will do Gua Sha (traditional medicine treatment) for you. Take a warm bath.

698
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,550
You'll feel much better after getting some sleep.

699
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:33,580
W-We will go prepare stuff for Gua Sha. It's just heat stroke, not a big problem.

700
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,280
Go.

701
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,340
Rest well.

702
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,910
Oh.

703
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,280
I actually caused more trouble when trying to help.

704
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,720
No, no.

705
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,600
Because of you, all the radishes

706
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,800
have been set out to dry ahead of schedule.

707
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,040
How is that possible? When I left, most of them were not done yet.

708
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:14,080
When I came home, folks were still lining up to try the massage chair.

709
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,910
When they found out you fainted,

710
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:21,270
all volunteered to help so it was done early.

711
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,460
You mean,

712
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,280
everyone saw that I fainted

713
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,170
and you carried me inside?

714
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,750
It's so embarrassing!

715
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,980
How can I show my face again?

716
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,170
It's fine.

717
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:53,180
The sun is really strong now so heatstroke is common.

718
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,230
Really?

719
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,760
Really.

720
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:16,230
Baby, your Uncle Chang said there's no need to find a shop anymore.

721
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,890
What's the matter? Did anything happen?

722
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:35,500
Nothing. It's difficult to explain. I'll tell you another time.

723
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,360
Nothing?

724
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,390
Nothing, but your shoulder looks like it's carrying a huge rock.

725
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,430
I understand why you want to help me find a prime location.

726
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,830
But I hope you can understand that

727
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:57,810
I want to find a place that I can manage and afford within my capability.

728
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,060
But it's an inspiration to set up a goal

729
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,910
that's above your capability. Besides, I already said

730
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:11,090
you don't need to constrain (limit) yourself because of the budget.

731
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,070
I know that.

732
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:19,300
But I'd be going against my original reason and intent for opening my own shop.

733
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,210
I've been through it.

734
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:24,680
My hope is for you to experience less needless hassle,

735
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,060
and also take fewer falls in your life.

736
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,040
I don't mind it.

737
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,770
I believe my life will change because I'm doing something that I want to do,

738
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:41,210
no matter how many extra steps I'll walk or how many falls I'll take.

739
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,380
I really don't understand what I did wrong.

740
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,430
Baby.

741
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:01,020
There's something here that you haven't understood clearly.

742
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:07,540
I don't think what you did was just for Hsuan Yu.

743
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,600
You are doing it to show his older brother.

744
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,560
You want to prove to his older brother that Hsuan Yu

745
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,890
is better and more accomplished after being with you.

746
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,970
That's not why I did it! I–

747
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,940
No rush. There will be time for you to refute me later.

748
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,000
Do you remember when you were young,

749
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,210
you started walking later than other children of the same age?

750
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:37,240
Of course, I remember. Since young, you always mentioned it and poked fun at me.

751
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,900
I'm sorry.

752
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,010
I only joked about it after it was not a problem anymore.

753
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:46,810
But do you know how anxious I was at that time?

754
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:51,340
I was so worried that I took you to see the doctor.

755
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:56,610
I was afraid that you really had a problem. Did I not bear you well?

756
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,190
You mothers,

757
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:02,960
can you not be so anxious and not pressure yourself so much?

758
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,740
What could I do?

759
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:09,000
You are my flesh, my blood, my life.

760
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:15,740
Luckily, your dad was around at that time.

761
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,630
You dad said to me,

762
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:24,140
"Different plants have different flowering seasons."

763
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:29,560
"Spring flowers have their unique way to bloom."

764
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:34,710
"Autumn flowers are distinctly rich in colors."

765
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:41,260
"Regardless if a flower blooms early or late,"

766
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,760
"it will eventually bloom beautifully."

767
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,000
Dad was so romantic.

768
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,080
I picked him.

769
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,800
I know.

770
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,410
Later,

771
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:57,300
I went to research information related to a child's growth.

772
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,110
I discovered that

773
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:04,940
the children who crawled longer actually stimulated their prefrontal lobes more robustly

774
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,920
and it would actually benefit the brain's development.

775
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,840
Look at how outstanding I am.

776
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,330
I gave birth to you.

777
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,650
I know.

778
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:21,160
In summary, the me from years ago only cared that you couldn't walk.

779
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:26,810
But where I didn't see, you were growing fast.

780
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:33,510
You said all these things about my childhood. Are you hinting at something?

781
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:40,260
I hope that you will use the same logic to think about what's going on with Hsuan Yu.

782
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:46,220
Perhaps the Hsuan Yu you see right now is walking slower than other people,

783
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,800
but he can walk steadily.

784
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,050
You see the shop that he wants is small and simple.

785
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,460
But you didn't notice that, behind him,

786
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:01,000
he has actually accumulated many customers' anticipation and hope.

787
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,460
Hsuan Yu is transforming from an employee to a boss.

788
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,890
There will be drastic changes in his mindset.

789
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:13,310
He needs time to adjust.

790
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,500
So right now,

791
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,610
you can't rush it. If you rush it,

792
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:22,240
it will disrupt his own original pace.

793
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:27,750
You mean, I shouldn't interfere in his matter.

But...

795
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,970
If I let him be, and he fails?

796
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:38,910
So he fails, and the shop shuts down.

797
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,320
Just like when you learned how to walk when young,

798
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,930
you could stand up by yourself when you fell.

799
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:48,710
Let Hsuan Yu bravely face some obstacles.

800
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,820
There's nothing wrong with that.

801
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:56,630
This is a road to entrepreneurship. Hsuan Yu is a manager.

802
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:00,260
He must walk every step by himself.

803
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:04,490
You can only accompany him, but not do it for him.

804
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,310
Let me put it this way.

805
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:10,810
If you want me to open a fleet store for him at Taipei 101, of course, I can do it.

806
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,240
No need. Hsuan Yu won't accept it, and I won't, either.

807
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,810
Okay, hear me out.

808
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:22,600
What I wanted to emphasize is that if we really do it this way,

809
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,830
then Hsuan Yu wouldn't have walked those ninety-nine steps properly.

810
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:32,440
He will take a shortcut to leap to the 100th step. Do you think that is good?

811
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,500
What if he really fails?

812
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,390
If he really fails, he won't even have the strength to stand up again.

813
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,540
There you go.

814
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:43,530
Therefore, all those problems that you were worrying about,

815
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:46,970
don't they suddenly seem meaningless?

816
