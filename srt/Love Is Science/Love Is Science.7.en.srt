1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,120
It seems like you don't want to keep in touch with me.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,910
That's not what I meant.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,020
Even if you wouldn't have asked me for my LINE, I would have asked you for yours.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,840
What the heck is this?

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,880
Besides looking up to me, didn't you forget to say something to me?

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,490
Didn't someone say he's going to show Ou Wen who is boss?

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,270
Why are you suddenly so good to him?

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,130
Quickly look at Yung Tai's Facebook page. He might be coming back to Taiwan!

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,030
She married so well. Why is she so low-key about it?

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,790
Something is definitely wrong!

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,920
When did you write that letter?

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,880
I didn't give it to you... because of this.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,470
So do you really not know who the person in the love letter is?

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,360
If he won't even tell you, then how would I know?

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,490
- So does Yan Fei know because I said it while drunk?
- Yes.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,600
Because it happened so long ago, let's not fight anymore.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,100
I'm the one who is with you now.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,130
♫ Can't you see? ♫

19
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,930
♫ I've written your name ♫

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Fated to be together for life ♫

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,910
♫ We've both been hurt a few times ♫

22
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,740
♫ And now we've grown ♫

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,510
♫ Living in this city ♫

24
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,550
♫ It's so easy to get lost ♫

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,110
♫ So blessed to be in love with each other ♫

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,300
♫ We've written the same address ♫

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,900
♫ From now on, we'll live life together ♫

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,520
♫ Our story ♫

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,220
♫ Is just beginning ♫

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,890
♫ We've exchanged rings ♫

31
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,250
♫ Happy or sad, we'll face it all together from now on ♫

32
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,970
♫ Always be with you ♫

33
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,930
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫

34
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,550
♫ I promise, your smile ♫

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,070
♫ Will be more real than before ♫

36
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,380
♫ Always be with you ♫

37
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,370
♫ Your love is like a diamond ♫

38
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,890
♫ Zero defect, so genuine ♫

39
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,230
♫ Love needs no explanation ♫

40
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,210
♫ We'll be holding hands for the rest of our lives ♫

41
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,990
Love Is Science

42
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,780
Some people say

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,830
that one's password represents the most important thing to that person.

44
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,350
So...

45
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,290
Hsuan Yu's most important thing is...

46
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,800
Delicious (my vote).

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,680
Brother, every dish you chose was the exact same as Yan Fei.

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,100
No wonder Yan Fei calls you "Little Piggy."

49
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,620
Really? Did I call him that?

50
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,590
Why are you two talking so quietly?

51
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,310
Are you hiding secrets from me?

52
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,940
So do you really not know who the person in the love letter is?

53
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,280
What did Hsuan Yu say?

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,070
He would never tell.

55
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,450
Exactly.

56
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,010
If he won't even tell you, then how would I know?

57
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,300
Yan Fei

58
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,710
Chang Chin Lan!

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,100
You're so useless!

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,680
You don't even have the courage to question them.

61
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,200
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

62
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,140
Miss Liu, I already exchanged LINE info with Miss Cho.

63
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,590
Tai Ou Wen, look.

64
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,650
Just now, Mr. Wu messaged me saying he already got Miss Cho's LINE info.

65
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,920
Even though their matching index is very low, they still make people look forward to their progress.

66
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,620
Did you send her a goodnight message last night?

67
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,210
I haven't sent a message yet.

68
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,340
D*mmit.

69
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,700
Liu Sheng Ying

70
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,970
Hello?

71
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,410
Do you know what the result is of not sending a message the same day you add someone on LINE?

72
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,720
Correct! There will be nothing.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,060
The flame of love

74
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,850
is that fragile.

75
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,550
We once had a male member who hesitated just one night.

76
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,560
The next morning, the female member told us she wanted other dates arranged.

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,020
Is it that scary? T-T-Then I will i-immediately—

78
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,390
I, the teacher, am not done speaking.

79
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,620
Do you know what you're going to send?

80
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,540
The first message is to break the ice,

81
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,710
- and make "amands."
- The word "amands" (last Chinese character was written incorrectly)–

82
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,310
Break the Ice. Make "amands."

83
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,990
Tell Miss Cho that you had a very happy day yesterday.

84
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,430
That yesterday left an endless aftertaste and you kept on thinking about it.

85
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,480
It's just that... you accidentally fell asleep!

86
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,590
- Let her know that you have her in your heart.
- Okay.

87
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,470
The times at which you send messages must be according to "doctor's prescription."

88
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,860
At lunchtime, dinnertime, and right before bedtime, three times a day to keep things fresh.

89
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,410
That way you won't be interfering with the other person's work either.

90
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,400
Once her replies start to slow down, you can naturally

91
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,360
end the conversation. Okay?

92
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,060
Lastly!

93
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,020
The more one speaks, the more mistakes one makes. Generously use stickers (GIFs).

94
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,710
Constantly remind yourself not to casually joke around too much

95
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,560
to prevent her from getting offended.

96
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,310
But I doubt Student Wu has this issue.

97
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,140
A lot of members fail during this messaging phase

98
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,550
so if you have any questions, contact me at any time.

99
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,960
All right, I-I understand.

100
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,880
Thank you, Teacher.

101
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,620
Goodbye.
 Wu You Fu

102
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,990
Who was it, who was it?

103
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,670
M-Miss Sheng Ying just

104
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,210
called me to teach me how to message Miss Cho.

105
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,090
Wu You Fu! I can't believe that you would one day worry about how to message a girl.

106
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,180
I'm so happy for you!

107
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,060
So what are you going to text her?

108
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,310
She wants me to send more stickers, but my phone doesn't have those.

109
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,870
Oh! I'm an expert at that. Look, I will show you.

110
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,770
This one is great, right?

111
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,510
This sticker is pretty good.
 "Don't wait for opportunities. Go make opportunities." (These stickers are usually used by the elderly.)

112
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,590
Here, I'll send it to you, then quickly send it to Miss Cho.
"Success does not give up on anyone. Only people give up on success."

113
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,860
Wu You Fu: I was really happy yesterday.

114
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,850
I hope you will have a smooth day at work. You Fu.

115
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,270
Path to Success: "When we are sleeping, those in the U.S. are diligently working."

116
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,260
Didn't you ask me out to lunch? How come you're not eating?

117
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,930
Who messaged you?

118
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,010
My sister-in-law.

119
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,000
What about?

120
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,180
Nothing.

121
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,960
To let me know that she just paid for the water and electricity bill.

122
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,330
Then does Yan Fei message you?

123
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,200
Sometimes.

124
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,570
Can I see what you two message about?

125
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,670
Do you want to see that?

126
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,140
Do you really want to see?

127
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,250
Sorry.

128
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,880
I've become the most annoying type of girlfriend.

129
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,460
What's wrong? You can talk to me about anything.

130
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,620
- Do you want to hear the truth?
- Yes.

131
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,910
I don't like it when you and Yan Fei meet.

132
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,330
I don't like you messaging her. I hope

133
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,360
you two stop contacting each other.

134
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,870
Didn't you two get along really well before?

135
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,260
You even invited her to write a column for your magazine.

136
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,060
That was before. It's different now.

137
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,310
Since she knows you used to have a crush on her, she should have kept her distance.

138
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,100
That was such a long time ago.

139
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,300
Besides, didn't we agree not to fight over this trivial matter?

140
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,200
But this matter has never passed.

141
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,890
What do you mean?

142
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,150
Is Yan Fei's birthday the passcode to your baggage?

143
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,960
At first, I didn't understand, but now I do.

144
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,280
Your suitcase, your sports shirt,

145
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,260
your phone password,

146
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,600
and your mailbox password all have 29 in it.

147
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,810
All of these important things have to do with Yan Fei. How am I supposed to trust you?

148
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,490
Hairstylist number 29.

149
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,090
My girlfriend is you.

150
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,060
Plus, she's already married. I don't know what you're worrying about.

151
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,580
Then what if she wouldn't be married?

152
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,500
There is no "if." She is already married.

153
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm sorry, I'm not purposely trying to upset you.

154
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,630
You are right.

155
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,770
All my passwords are Yan Fei's birthday.

156
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,380
But it's not what you think.

157
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,320
It's just that I have always used this number.

158
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,430
It just became a habit. I have no other intentions.

159
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,760
Then starting right now, can we change it?

160
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,800
Of course, we can.

161
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:34,220
We can change it all to...111 (her birthday). All right?

162
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,250
- Really?
- Really.

163
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,160
- Won't you regret it?
- I won't.

164
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,880
Love is Science Marriage Agency

165
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,230
- Hello?
- Are you okay?

166
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,570
I'm doing quite well.

167
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,220
- Are you back?
- Correct. I'm already in the car.

168
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,010
Don't answer any calls and don't look at your phone.

169
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,060
Wait for me. I will be there soon.

170
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,520
Hello—

171
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,600
Sorry. Please don't come any further.

172
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,590
You will be crossing into our work area if you move forward.

173
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,680
Please step back. Thank you.

174
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,940
No comment. Really, no comment.

175
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,520
All of you are already interfering with our work.

176
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,430
She's here!

177
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,930
Are you Huo Yung Tai's ex-wife? How long have you been divorced?

178
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,370
You manage a marriage agency, yet you hid your own divorce

179
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,480
and pretended you were happily married. Were you never suspected of fraud?

180
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,190
Your "Love Is Science" members were left in the dark. Have you thought how you will explain this to them?

181
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,950
Does Mr. Huo Yung Tai know you've been using his name to deceive the public?

182
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,250
Why didn't you tell the truth?

183
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,600
Are you really his ex-wife?

184
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,860
How can you face your members like this?

185
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,280
Why didn't you tell the truth?

186
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,060
Tai Ou Wen! What! Are all your muscles made of plastic?

187
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,820
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!

188
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,600
Thank you, everyone. Our boss has a lot of meetings today.

189
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,200
You've worked hard! Our boss still has a lot of meetings to attend!

190
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,420
- Everyone, please return, thank you!
- Sorry, thank you.

191
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,220
- Thank you!
- Please, return.

192
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,630
Love is Science

193
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,710
Why did my relationship with Yung Tai suddenly get exposed?

194
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,050
Actually, starting last week,

195
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:35,070
for some reason... your wedding photo with Huo Yung Tai has been circulating on the Internet.

196
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,690
What?

197
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,070
But a wedding photo is nothing, right?

198
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,760
The biggest problem is your ex-husband....

199
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,460
How is he?

200
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,700
He is... just too great.

201
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,880
The Bharatpur Royal Hotel that he worked on for a long time was awarded the world's best hotel this year.

202
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,740
You should know this is the first time a Taiwanese CEO won the award.

203
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,890
The pride of Taiwan so you know everyone feels like "Wow!"

204
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,160
What should I do?

205
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,090
Everyone knows I'm divorced now.

206
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,160
What is going to happen to Love Is Science?

207
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,080
Don't worry. We will definitely think of a good way to resolve this.

208
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,490
A well-known marriage agency's scandal has been exposed.

209
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,860
The general manager, Yan Fei, hid her identity as a divorcee,

210
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,630
and lied to numerous consumers.

211
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,710
Based on a reliable source, Yan Fei's ex-husband

212
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,980
is the first Asian CEO of

213
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,590
Royal Hotel, making headlines these past few days.

214
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,110
He's the pride of Taiwan, Huo Yung Tai.

215
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,860
Is Yan Fei divorced?

216
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,250
No wonder she doesn't live with her husband.

217
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,050
Oh, no. Oh, this is bad. Earlier, I asked her if they considered having children.

218
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,380
I practically put salt on her wounds.

219
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,450
Can we slightly adjust the product to be straighter so the logo can pop out more?

220
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,220
- Okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

221
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,600
Adjust it to face more straight forward. Make the logo show.

222
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,460
Let me see.

223
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,370
Hello, Editor-in-chief.

224
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,240
Yan Fei's column cannot be published. Take down this month's draft.

225
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
Did something happen?

226
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,360
That Yan Fei is basically a fraud. She is already divorced.

227
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,090
- Divorced?
- Indeed.

228
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,050
A divorced woman writing a column about managing marriages and relationships,

229
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,060
isn't that very laughable?

230
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,800
Anyway, quickly look for someone to write an article to replace hers.

231
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,890
My girlfriend is you.

232
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,540
Plus, she's already married. I don't know what you're worrying about.

233
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,620
Then what if she wouldn't be married?

234
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,500
There is no "if." She is already married.

235
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,170
This is "Love Is Science." How can I help you?

236
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,520
Thank you.

237
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,200
Regarding my boss's personal business, the company cannot comment.

238
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,480
The company's finances and members' rights are not impacted.

239
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,570
- Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.

240
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,590
Hello, this is "Love Is Science."

241
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,410
Bye bye.

242
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,430
- Hello, it's "Love Is Science." I'm Tai Ou Wen. Happy to serve you.
- Hello, this is "Love Is Science." I am Liu Sheng Ying.

243
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,920
Yes, I understand. Okay.

244
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,400
Your pizza is here. Please sign for it.

245
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,650
Did you guys order pizza?

246
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,950
I ordered it.

247
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,620
My fellow scientists,

248
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,950
come have some pizza when you finish.

249
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,700
- Ou Wen, come have some pizza.
- I am so hungry.

250
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,030
When you came up just now, were there still a lot of people outside?

251
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,970
Well ...

252
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,940
It's okay. You can leave now.

253
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,190
- Here is NTD$1500 ($54 U.S.) Keep the change.
- Thank you.

254
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,190
The reporters left in the afternoon. Is Boss okay?

255
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,510
Your boss has me.

256
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,400
It's you guys that I'm worried about. How is it going with the clients?

257
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,260
Quite a few of them are "taking advantage of the fire to rob us." However, it won't be that easy to get a refund.

258
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,570
The company will probably be having a tough time the next few days.

259
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,900
But we just discussed it and think we can use this opportunity to visit our clients.

260
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,490
We can explain it to them in person and let them vent.

261
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,760
That's right. "It's harder to be cold and detached when you look someone in the eyes."

262
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,840
I'm confident that we can minimize the damage,

263
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,970
and help the company make it past this obstacle.

264
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,990
We can handle this!

265
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,660
No problem! We can handle this!

266
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,590
- We can handle this!
- We can handle this!

267
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,730
Love Is Science

268
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,920
Is the situation really bad?

269
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,430
It's not that bad.

270
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,960
At least we are still able to order takeout.

271
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,730
Enough! You're not allowed to mention dieting on such a chaotic day.

272
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:18,300
We're not going to die if we get fat. The world won't end if we treat ourselves once in a while. You're being too much.

273
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,430
I just wanted to ask if there is chili powder.

274
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,290
Of course, that's a must.

275
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,060
Hold on.

276
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,300
Wait a second.

277
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,400
Wow, did you actually hide wine in my office?

278
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,260
Hey, a bottle of wine is nothing. Hold this for me.

279
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,230
Watch carefully.

280
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,790
Next, you are welcome to watch Chiao An Na's magic show.

281
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,440
Ta-da (presto)!

282
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,570
Brilliant!

283
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,630
Cheers!

284
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,580
The company is in such a serious predicament

285
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,390
so why are you still so relaxed?

286
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,170
Because we have a group of great employees.

287
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,610
Today, I saw them all do their very best to resolve the issue.

288
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,930
My heart of stone was really touched, and I felt invigorated.

289
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,980
Fei.

290
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,490
Actually, there's no point in you worrying right now.

291
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,160
First, we didn't financially scam anyone. Second, we didn't scam anyone of love.

292
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,280
We cannot possibly collapse because of this matter.

293
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,250
We are just in the midst of a storm now.

294
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,260
So we will suffer a bit.

295
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,690
Besides, what if we'd have to close the company? You and I won't be homeless because of it.

296
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,930
In the worst case, you'll just go back to being the daughter of a wealthy family.

297
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:38,650
I will keep being a flight attendant. I'll keep flying, shopping and falling in love. We have nothing to fear.

298
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,660
That's true.

299
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,120
No matter how awful the situation is now, it will never be as awful as nine years ago.

300
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,760
Exactly.

301
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,340
Cheers to our current happiness.

302
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,400
Cheers.

303
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,380
I am actually very aware of the fact

304
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,380
that lies will one day get exposed.

305
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,560
For the past nine years, I have been living in constant fear,

306
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,480
like I was walking a tight rope.

307
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,650
I even get nightmares in which I fall off the rope.

308
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,020
Now I've really fallen off. It hurts a lot.

309
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,840
However, at least,

310
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,470
I am standing on the ground now.

311
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,960
Fei.

312
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,220
In fact, I want to apologize to you.

313
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,820
Because I was the one who suggested pretending to be happily married.

314
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,290
Financial reports.
[Love Is Science Marriage Agency: Financial Reports]

315
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,350
Don't look at me. I don't know how to read financial reports.

316
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,370
Then let me tell you the conclusion. Basically, the company's money is almost gone.

317
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,700
The cash flow won't even cover two more months.

318
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,100
Sorry, I messed up.

319
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,860
If you don't want to give up,

320
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,810
you still have one choice left.

321
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,850
I don't want to.

322
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,560
Back when I was in the U.S. and was starving to death, I still held on, not asking my mom for help.

323
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,310
I have even less reason to ask her now.

324
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,930
Missy, this is not when you should be stubborn.

325
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,160
You're the type of person born at the finish line (born with silver spoon).

326
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,390
- Why would you run the marathon of life with the rest of us normal folks? Hey!
- Yes?

327
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,930
I've been talking for a while. Did you hear any of it?

328
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,310
I am closely looking at the questionnaire.

329
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,760
The reasons why so many people didn't consider joining after listening to my introduction is because...

330
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,590
Look, "the fees are too expensive so I cannot afford it."

331
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,590
"The required conditions to join are too much so I don't want to."

332
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,960
What else? "Too many survey questions. It's very annoying."

333
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,760
"Why should I join when the person in charge is still single?"

334
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,040
What kind of reasons are those?

335
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,330
- It makes a lot of sense.
- What?

336
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,970
What does my marital status have to do with my career?

337
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,930
Of course, they are related.

338
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,590
If you want the customers to spend money, then you need to give them an...

339
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,070
example of success.

340
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,430
Would you ask a single person... Would you ask someone, who has failed at marriage,

341
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:46,970
to teach you how to get married? It's like asking a fat person,

342
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,320
"Hello, can you teach me how to lose weight?" Or asking to buy shampoo from a bald person,

343
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,170
it's ridiculous.

344
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,900
Then do those who sell coffins have to lay in coffins?

345
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,120
How do you know they don't?

346
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:08,430
However, your marriage problem isn't completely without solution.

347
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,870
Isn't this okay?

348
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,960
No way! I'm already divorced. Besides, I'm afraid that he would feel...

349
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,230
Hello! You and he are already divorced.

350
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,570
So you don't have to care about what he feels at all. In fact,

351
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,650
he doesn't feel anything at all.

352
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,770
You have to remember, after a divorce,

353
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:46,010
men toss their ex-wives into the trash. Okay?

354
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,170
Is this really okay?

355
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,040
He is far away in the United States. His parents are in Canada.

356
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,740
You just opened a marriage agency here. It's not like you're becoming an idol.

357
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,310
No one will pay attention to you.

358
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,130
- Do you think this will work?
- Yes.

359
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,440
Just try it out. Even if this fails, there will be no loss.

360
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:27,540
We sincerely believe that the data can find you the most suitable life partner.

361
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,760
These are all of the services "Love Is Science" offers.

362
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,750
Here is our membership application form.

363
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,950
Signed membership

364
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,790
Please take care of me.

365
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,690
Success! I've finally succeeded!

366
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,530
[Love Is Science Marriage Agency Membership Application Form]

367
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,830
I've succeeded because of the wedding ring, yet I've failed because of the ring too.

368
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,620
No matter how hard I've worked these past eight years,

369
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,970
without it,

370
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,150
I'm just like Cinderella at midnight.

371
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,870
Everything disappears.

372
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,820
I am still that "loser."

373
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,240
I also don't have a wedding ring.

374
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,710
If you are a "loser," then so am I.

375
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,310
I will lose with you and cheer with you.

376
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,050
"Loser!"

377
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:25,900
Are you okay now? You have suffered.

378
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,570
Hurry!

379
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,140
Ms. Yan, "Love Is Science" members are officially suing you for fraud. Do you have any comments?

380
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,580
- Fraud?
- You lied to the customers by pretending to be happily married.

381
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,780
- Is that kind of marketing legal?
- Last time you had fraudulent members. Now the person in charge has a fake background. What is your response?

382
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,510
Wait, are you all done?

383
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,640
Ms. Yan, please answer our questions.
- Please, give us your response.

384
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,320
Our company is a legal marriage agency.

385
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,900
Besides not honestly sharing my true marital status,

386
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,230
we haven't done a single thing to harm our members.

387
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,120
We treat each member the best we can—

388
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,900
Who threw the wing mirror?

389
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,750
Whoever threw this thing, come out!

390
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,070
I did it! So what?

391
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,310
Photograph them!

392
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:07,460
It seems that you did not learn your lesson last time, when I splashed water on you. You've learned now, right?

393
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,900
Who are you? You harmed someone in the midst of chaos! Are you even a man?

394
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,650
- It's fine. He is our member, Mr. Lu.
- What?

395
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:18,470
How dare you speak? I trusted you last time, then I got scammed for NT$1,000,000 ($36,000 U.S.) by Mimi again!

396
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,600
Now I lost money and a potential partner. How are you going to compensate me?

397
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,900
That's right! I paid a huge amount of membership fees!

398
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,760
In the end, none of my matches were presentable!

399
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,670
- Scammer!
- Give me my money back!

400
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,730
Enough! You two gang up to bully women. Are you even men? How shameless!

401
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,170
Fine. I am going to sue you all for causing physical harm. I will see you all in court!

402
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,610
Come on and sue me!

403
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,600
This was all recorded!

404
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,330
I will sue you!

405
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,520
How can there be people like you in our society?

406
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,370
You can't just hit someone like this. The medical expenses—

407
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,290
Hey! Where are you going?

408
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,350
Come back! Miss Yan!

409
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,450
I got it. Thank you.

410
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,540
Get some rest.

411
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,350
Thanks, Bro.

412
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,170
It's nothing.

413
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,210
Where is my rear wing mirror?

414
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,120
Was your wing mirror the one Mr. Lu threw at Yan Fei earlier?

415
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:04,670
Sorry, sorry! That's so creative!

416
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

417
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,890
You were in the car. Didn't you notice someone take your wing mirror off?

418
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,270
No, the situation just then was too chaotic.

419
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,900
Everyone's attention was on Yan Fei so who would pay attention to that?

420
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,540
I'm sorry.

421
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,420
Or you can just let me know how much the mirror cost.

422
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,690
No need. You're not the one who took it.

423
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:34,900
Unexpectedly, in addition to your muscles, you're quite loyal to your friends.

424
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,530
Indeed.

425
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,840
Let me see.

426
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,880
Yan Fei's injury is quite serious so let's go to the hospital.

427
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,750
No need. I'm fine.

428
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,240
I don't want to go to the hospital. I just want to go home right now.

429
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,450
Your home is definitely surrounded by reporters.

430
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,710
Or I should take you to Auntie's (Yan Fei's mother) house.

431
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,180
- Absolutely not!
- No need!

432
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,910
Absolutely not.

433
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,260
What I'm saying is that if my mother saw me like this, with her personality,

434
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:20,580
forget about the ambulance. She will have a helicopter on standby at home.

435
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:28,900
You don't want to go home or to the hospital. Then who can tell me where I should drive?

436
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,500
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

437
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,750
Such a scary thing happened.

438
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,850
You were probably really scared, right?

439
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,290
Those members are really something.

440
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:48,720
No matter how angry they are, they can't just hit someone.

441
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,980
That's unacceptable.

442
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,980
Here, it will hurt a bit.

443
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,900
Thanks.

444
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,370
It is all ready.

445
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,940
I've changed the comforter, sheets, and pillowcases in the room.

446
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,940
Just stay in my room for the next few days.

447
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,760
How can I? Where will you sleep?

448
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,960
I can just stay at a hotel.

449
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,310
Why is it not okay? Our sofa is extremely comfy.

450
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:18,140
If you don't believe me, ask Wang Hsuan Yang. He sleeps there all the time.

451
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,360
That's right! My older brother usually hoards it. Now is the perfect time for me to sleep on it.

452
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,980
Sleeping here is more comfortable than sleeping my wife (he made a mistake in speech).

453
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,760
I should say it is more comfortable than sleeping with my wife,

454
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,040
but that sounds wrong too. In any case, just relax and stay here.

455
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,760
Right. Just relax and stay here.

456
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,190
My noodle shop is very inconspicuous. No one will find you.

457
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,300
Although our place isn't luxurious, you're injured so it's best if someone looks after you.

458
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,850
That's right.

459
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,490
Thank you for taking me in.

460
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,390
It is fine. There's no need to be polite.

461
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Do you want to call Auntie?

462
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,650
If she saw the news, she must be very worried.

463
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,370
That's right.

464
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,990
Oh, right.

465
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,700
Can I borrow a charger?

466
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,510
The person who cares about me most is indeed my mom.

467
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,700
Little Piggy?

468
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,280
- Hello?
- You're finally picking up the phone!

469
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,390
Mom, you don't need to be so loud. It isn't like I can't hear you.

470
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,800
Stop nagging. Send your location to me right now!

471
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,400
I will send the driver to pick you up.

472
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,060
I'm fine. Really.

473
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,780
I just can't go running around for the time being.

474
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,780
That's perfect. Come home. Obediently stay home,

475
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,570
and explain everything to me.

476
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:22,670
I don't want to. You'll definitely nag me to death if I go there.

477
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,240
Fine. You're not going to tell me, right? That's okay.

478
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,280
I will check all three-star and more hotels in Taiwan right now,

479
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,340
as well as your credit card records.

480
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,390
I'm not staying at a hotel. I'm staying at a friend's house.

481
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,690
A friend's house? What friend? Male or female?

482
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,730
Is it that Mr. Busy from last time?

483
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,100
Hello? Mom? I can't hear you. The connection is bad.

484
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,000
Hello? Hello?

485
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,570
Hello?

486
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,750
Come in.

487
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,660
Excuse me.

488
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,050
My Sister-in-law wanted me to bring you this.

489
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,460
Thank her for me.

490
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,730
You can put it over there.
- Okay.

491
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,360
Get some rest then. Good night.

492
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,880
Also, thank you...

493
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,600
Why did he leave so fast?

494
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,590
Why isn't she answering the phone?

495
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,360
Yan Fei

496
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,230
Why isn't there any noise?

497
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,590
She didn't faint because of a concussion, did she?

498
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,900
Yan Fei?

499
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,820
Yan Fei?

500
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,680
Yan... Yan Fei!

501
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,890
♫ Always be with you ♫

502
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,880
Love Is Science?
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫

503
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,170
Yan Fei.

504
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,270
Yan Fei?

505
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,730
Yan... Yan Fei!

506
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,700
Why are you crying?

507
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,260
Does your... wound hurt?

508
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,690
It is not the wound.

509
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:54,670
It hurts here.

510
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,320
I feel so wronged!

511
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,530
Is it because of your scandal?

512
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,170
No.

513
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,940
I was wrong to hide my divorce.

514
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,140
I knew I would be found out and get scolded one day.

515
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,290
It is those clients!

516
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,360
They're so annoying! They're the ones with the actual problem!

517
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,520
If it weren't for the principle that the customer is always right,

518
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,200
I would talk back to them! I would have...

519
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,940
I'm so upset!

520
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,060
Seeing you still have energy to scold them, I feel less worried.

521
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,460
Workaholic.

522
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,550
But they said... they were going to sue you.

523
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:30,860
I've asked my lawyer already. My marital status has nothing to do with the services provided by my company.

524
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:36,350
Unless they have evidence that we faked our members' information,

525
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:42,710
or we scammed them out of their money, I won't be found guilty.

526
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,120
Then that's good. I was worried when I saw they brought a bunch of reporters to your office.

527
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,440
The “keyboard masses" (media) don't care about the law at all.

528
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,980
Relationship arguments always lead to breakups.

529
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,430
Marital problems always lead to divorces.

530
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,320
Crimes always lead to death penalties.

531
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,740
It would be very nice if things were that simple.

532
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,400
Yell out all of my frustrations!

533
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,360
I feel so much better now.

534
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,090
By the way, why did you come to see me?

535
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,360
Have you finally thought of me?

536
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,820
- I'm hungry.
- I hear it (stomach).

537
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,140
Three?

538
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,120
Two? Three?

539
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,250
Thank you.

540
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,620
I'm going to start eating now.

541
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,010
Is it good?

542
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,980
It is very good!

543
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,160
Thank you, Little Piggy.

544
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,660
It is just ramen.

545
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,460
It is not just because of this midnight snack.

546
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,830
I actually wanted to thank you earlier.

547
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,450
Thank you for taking me home with you.

548
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,820
Thank you for letting me sleep in your room.

549
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,970
Also, thank you for coming to my company to see me.

550
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:01,390
Or else, I really wouldn't have known what to do.

551
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,040
Thank you for always appearing when I need you the most,

552
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:15,740
making me feel that I'm not alone, even though I'm by myself.

553
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,810
Wh-Wh-What I meant is that I have always been the only child in my family.

554
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,380
I don't have any siblings to lean on.

555
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,770
So I'm very jealous that you have your brother and Sister-in-law.

556
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,600
I see.

557
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,020
Here. Hurry and eat.

558
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,460
You should also eat, too.

559
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,610
Hsuan Yu.

560
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,770
Hsuan Yu! Wake up!

561
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,230
I've made breakfast. Come down to eat it.

562
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,780
Sister-in-law!

563
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,180
Yan Fei slept late last night. Let her sleep in more.

564
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,380
Chin Lan

565
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,100
Breaking news: A well-known marriage agency has been scamming their members.

566
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,170
This mystery hero who saved the beauty is you, right?

572
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:32,830
This mystery hero who saved the beauty is you, right?

573
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,380
If you're so worried about her, then take her home to take care of her.

574
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:51,370
Wang Hsuan Yu! Did you really take her to your home to spend the night there?

575
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,520
Aren't you going overboard?

576
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,060
She is hurt and needs help.

577
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,070
Does she not have any friends or family members to help her?

578
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,290
If she's hurt, can't she go to the hospital instead?

579
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,280
Are you... Are you purposely trying to make me angry?

580
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,890
Why would I purposely anger you?

581
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:09,360
Then why did you do that? Why do you keep pushing my limits?

582
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,300
You know I don't like you contacting her, yet you did this. If you're not trying to anger me, what is this? You clearly do it purposely!

583
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,080
Things aren't like what you're imagining. I'm not the only one at home.

584
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,090
So what?

585
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:22,000
My brother and Sister-in-law are also at home. She slept in my room, and I slept in the living room.

586
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,050
Is that the main point?

587
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:26,170
The two of us didn't do anything that would be considered crossing the line.

588
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,440
Even though nothing happened now doesn't mean nothing will happen in the future.

589
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,760
Do you want me to regret it after seeing something happen?

590
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,550
Are you arguing with me right now because of your baseless belief?

591
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,150
This isn't a "baseless belief!" Yan Fei lied!

592
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,560
Before, I thought she was a married woman,

593
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:50,330
and I was able to persuade myself not to think too much. But things are different now!

594
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,780
She's single! She's already divorced!

595
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,350
Is there any difference between being single and married? I know very clearly that I'm your boyfriend.

596
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,230
That's why I'm being honest with you and telling you all that happened between Yan Fei and me.

597
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,450
Did you honestly tell me about it yourself?

598
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,570
You told me only after I asked you about it!

599
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,110
Yan Fei even told me before that she had no idea!

600
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:13,800
If she didn't feel guilty, then why did she lie?

601
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,330
The level of trust I had in her before is the level of hate I feel for her now!

602
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,050
I-I know you're angry right now, but Yan Fei isn't someone like that.

603
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,700
Wang Hsuan Yu, enough!

604
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,800
This whole time you've been speaking for her.

605
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,680
Have you realized that?

606
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,720
Since when have I stopped being number one in your heart?

607
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:43,670
Did you ever care about how I feel?

608
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,890
Then what do you want me to do?

609
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,130
Stop being in contact with Yan Fei.

610
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,420
I... can't do that.

611
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,370
She's in a bad state right now. I can't just leave her alone and not care–

612
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,930
Can't you see that we are also in a bad state right now?

613
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:23,930
Do you want to come clean with me? It is not that you used to like her.

614
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:27,030
You essentially still like her now!

615
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,340
That's not it.

616
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,830
Whenever I encountered difficulties in my life—

617
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:37,140
Stop talking! Wang Hsuan Yu!

618
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,630
Everything you're saying right now,

619
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,730
makes me feel disgusted.

620
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,320
Mr. Wu! Mr. Wu!

621
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,080
Mr. Wu!

622
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,050
Why did you come here all of a sudden?

623
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:12,570
There are some things... that I think... would be better... if I explained them to you myself.

624
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,020
Is there something wrong with Miss Cho?

625
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:19,980
No, no! It is not about Miss Cho. It is... It is the news about our company.

626
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,100
What? What news?

627
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,050
What?

628
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,990
Miss Yan Fei's injury isn't severe, right?

629
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,210
You all have really worked hard.

630
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:41,260
Let me know if there is anything that I can help with. No need to be courteous.

631
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:45,540
Mr. Wu, you're such a good person!

632
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,080
I was yelled at by several clients whom I saw before you. You are the first one to comfort me.

633
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,250
You helped me...

634
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:58,300
match with Miss Cho. I am so grateful to you all. How could I yell at you?

635
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,620
No problem. Let's just go with what you all originally planned.

636
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,460
Thank you for understanding, Miss Cho.

637
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,450
Then...

638
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:21,730
if you have any questions, feel free to...

639
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,110
I won't bother your break time anymore.

640
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,790
Hey!

641
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,550
Wait a moment.

642
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,280
Do you know how to make...

643
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,990
those pictures with beautiful sceneries or flowers and grass in the background,

644
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:48,540
that have some greetings or messages written on them?

645
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:53,060
Are you talking about "elderly stickers"?

646
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,010
- Of course, you're not referring to those. How is that possible–
- You're correct.

647
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:03,630
I am referring to the "elderly sticker" (graphics). Do you know how to make them?

648
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,490
[Love Is Science Marriage Agency]

649
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,750
Hey, it's time for the meeting. Where are you?

650
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,210
Okay, hurry.

651
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:16,800
Okay, we'll talk when you get here. Bye bye.

652
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,610
Love Is Science

653
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,980
Sheng Ying is on her way back right now.

654
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,860
Let's not delay the meeting. Let's start.

655
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,650
I'm not late, right?

656
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:35,330
I bought some afternoon snacks for everyone.

657
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,780
You're the most handsome here. Why don't you help me pass it around to everyone?

658
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,670
We can eat and discuss at the same time. Everyone will be happier that way.

659
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,740
Where did you go yesterday? You didn't pick up your phone nor change your clothes.

660
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,910
You're in the same boat.

661
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,460
Boss Chiao, the meeting material.

662
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:58,180
All right. After proposing our compensation plan,

663
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,800
about a quarter of our members still want to terminate their contract.

664
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,730
Among the members who want to terminate their contract, more than half the contracts are about to expire.

665
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:08,840
It's very clear. They are "taking advantage of the fire to rob us."

666
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,960
How's the public opinion?

667
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,880
I've looked into it.

668
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,520
More than half of the online comments telling us to close are from fake accounts.

669
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,650
Who do you think are trying to "kick us while we're down" right now?

670
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,320
Let's hold a press conference.

671
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,370
Let's make it clear all at once.

672
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:39,470
We can't let those people continue to use this opportunity to ruin our reputation.

673
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:43,660
I think that we already said everything we needed to last night. Will the press conference even help?

674
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:48,110
All those negative comments online are by random people. None of them are by our members.

675
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:52,460
Also, I think the news will be a hot topic for two days at most.

676
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:55,940
After two days, this will be old news.

677
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:01,090
The news will eventually die down. But I'm worried that our company's reputation won't be able to recover.

678
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,060
I have a plan! I have a plan!

679
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:12,600
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

680
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:18,590
♫ Fantasize about a romantic love ♫

685
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:47,880
I have a plan! I have a plan!

686
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,610
Come. Everyone, come and look.

687
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,010
Are you ready?

688
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,610
Well...

689
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:07,860
I never thought

690
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,720
that there would be someone willing to go on a date with me.

691
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,860
I had already given up on myself and rejected some decent women.

692
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,930
But my planner...

693
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:23,390
she never gave up on me.

694
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:26,610
Afterward, I met Miss Cho.

695
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:30,690
She's perfect. I don't deserve her at all.

696
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:37,270
But my planner helped me arrange a beauty lesson for me.

697
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:42,040
Now I use it every day.

698
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,040
Before my arranged date, she was more nervous than me, constantly reminding me what to pay attention to.

699
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:52,640
After my arranged date, she also reminded me how to maintain the relationship.

700
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,710
Thank you, everyone.

701
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,510
My happiness right now

702
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,610
is because you guys didn't give up on me.

703
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,290
Thank you.

704
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,660
This is only one of our members.

705
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,900
I believe there must be other members who were successfully matched

706
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:19,720
and carried the same happiness with them as they walked down the red carpet into the next chapter of their lives.

707
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,660
We've helped so many people in the past with our services.

708
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,100
There have to be other members just like Mr. Wu

709
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,800
who are willing to come out to say words of support for us.

710
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,050
I believe

711
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:32,380
having them speak up for us will be more convincing than

712
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,750
anyone in our company.

713
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,030
You're right! We have to keep our heads up now more than ever.

714
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,840
We have not betrayed our work.

715
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,830
W-What do you want?

716
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:49,000
My goodness. Liu Sheng Ying, you're so amazing!

717
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,170
Tai Ou Wen! Let go of me! I'm going to throw up!

718
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:55,450
Do you think I'm not holding the vomit in? But you're just too amazing!

719
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,730
Save me! Save me!

720
00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:00,650
- Go away!
- Okay! Okay! That's enough.

721
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,440
Thank you, everyone, for staying by my side

722
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,690
and working hard together.

723
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:11,270
Saying thanks now... why don't you...

724
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,670
give us a raise instead?

725
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,820
These next few days will truly be toiling.

726
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,300
So next month, I'll add... half a month's salary to everyone's paycheck as a reward. All right?

727
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,020
Yes!

728
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,840
You brought the idea up!

729
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,930
- It was your idea! Everyone, thank Boss Chiao.
 - Thank you, Boss Chiao!

730
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:41,580
I used to go on a lot of arranged dates. I had over 700 numbers on my cell phone from girls.

731
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,290
Now he has only my number.

732
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:46,360
I went on eighteen blind dates. None of them were successful.
 Maternity Clinic

733
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,680
We wouldn't have met if it wasn't for "Love Is Science."

734
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,870
I'm very grateful to "Love Is Science." I'm very happy now.

735
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:58,600
Thank you.

736
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,090
Originally, I thought it was strange.

737
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:12,120
Why wouldn't you just come home and be my little princess?

738
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,800
Now I'm starting to understand a little.

739
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:21,530
It turns out it's because of your mother's great genes.

740
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,130
What great genes of yours?

741
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,950
Back then, I used to carry you with me

742
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,490
where I gave people facials to clear their pores.

743
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:35,610
At the same time, I founded Beauty Queen Group

744
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:40,190
and helped all those who wanted to pursue beauty.

745
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:43,510
You... are clearly a divorced woman,

746
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:47,150
yet you help others meet their destined partners

747
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,580
and work hard for your members' marriages.

748
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:57,280
Scenes before you remind you of your past, and people sprinkle salt on your wounds.

749
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,080
Baby, you're so pitiable.

750
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,830
I'm not pitiable at all.

751
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:10,090
You're right! You're not pitiable.

752
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,510
Everyone now knows

753
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,390
that you're single.

754
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:16,950
You can look for suitable partners for your members

755
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:20,710
while simultaneously looking for your own suitable partners.
- Stop.

756
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:24,010
I'm scared of marriage now after experiencing it just once.

757
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,620
Really?

758
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:34,710
Or is it because there's already a suitable person in your heart?

759
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:38,080
What? What suitable person?

760
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,570
"Mr. Busy"!

761
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,630
I saw the news the other day, and he came out running like this.

762
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:50,830
He then took his jacket and covered you. The hero saved the beauty.

763
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,710
Come on! He likes you.

764
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:57,930
Which eye of yours sees that he likes me?

765
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,200
Both of my eyes see that he likes you.

"Mr. Busy"!

772
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:40,180
I saw the news the other day, and he came out running like this.

773
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:46,310
He then took his jacket and covered you. The hero saved the beauty.

774
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:50,450
Come on! He likes you.

775
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:53,530
Which eye of yours sees that he likes me?

776
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:58,890
Both of my eyes see that he likes you.

777
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,570
You're thinking too much. He has a girlfriend.

778
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:05,540
What? Are you a step late again?

779
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:08,230
Say, you have so many members in "Love Is Science,"

780
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:11,960
and you help them all find their suitable partners. Why can't you also help yourself find a suitable partner?

781
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:17,560
- Hello? Hello? Hey.
- What is this lame method again? Hey, Chiao An Na.

782
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,570
Did you get into an accident again?

783
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,600
Bye bye.

784
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,220
Bye bye.

785
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,460
I am really saying goodbye to you this time.

786
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,920
From today on,

787
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,490
no one will continue to think that I am Mrs. Huo.

788
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,310
Why are you so honest?

789
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:25,810
Just tell Chin Lan that you will no longer be in touch with Yan Fei.

790
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:28,090
She won't know if that's true.

791
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:36,800
I don't want to lie.

792
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,390
You're her boyfriend. No matter what method you use,

793
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:44,740
you're responsible for protecting that ideal love in her heart.

794
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,990
It's also your duty.

795
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:54,570
A fantasy world built on lies

796
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,440
is not love.

797
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,880
Okay, since you can't tell white lies,

798
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,970
then you need to be completely devoted to your girlfriend.

799
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:08,390
Delete the contact info for all other girls, including Yan Fei.

800
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:12,350
You two lost touch for over a decade anyway, and you were fine.

801
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:13,850
I can't.

802
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,750
Why not?

803
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:20,740
Wang Hsuan Yu, I think you're acting strange.

804
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,910
Could it be...

805
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:25,220
that Chin Lan is right?

806
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,070
Do you still like Yan Fei?

809
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,800
No.

810
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,330
Senior, I like you!

811
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,190

812
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,060
Sorry.

I'm taking off, Bro.

Bye bye.

I'll pull your hair up and give it more volume.

Brother, I brought you your lens.

837
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:53,310
What are you doing? You're so clumsy!

838
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:54,640
Sorry.

839
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,730
Please wait a moment.

840
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:00,420
I'll help you.

01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:03,060
Thank you.

842
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,610

Get up first.

845

Wait. You can use this.

01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,510
It got on your skirt.

847
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,860
It's not convenient for you to clean up so just let me.

Hi! Are you off work now?

850
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:06,570
I already said that I have no plans of getting a girlfriend right now.

851
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:15,400
I know. But must you be so cold to me?

852
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,640
I have come to see you a total of twenty-seven times.

853
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,440
I've gone back empty-handed ten times and got rejected seven times.

854
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,200
I broke three pairs of high heels just to chase after you.

Every time I bring midnight snacks.

856
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:33,820
Popcorn chicken, egg tart, peanut soup, hot grass jelly, hamburger, pot-stickers.

857
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:37,730
I would eat two people's portions.

858
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:40,500
I've gained three kilograms already.

859
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:48,090
I know you have no plans to get a girlfriend,

860
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:50,920
but are you not going to make friends either?

861
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,750
Can't we be friends?

862
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,960
- We can be—
- Be careful.

863
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:07,560
Are we...

864
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,280
friends now?

865
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:27,890
Are we friends now?

866
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,590
Right?

867
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,820
Right? Right?

868
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,980
Stop walking backward. You're going to fall.

869
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:45,510
Hold my hand like this, and I won't fall.

870
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,700
Why are you ignoring me?

871
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,020
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

872
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:04,330
I didn't hit you so that means I love you.

873

Do you really not like Wang Hsuan Yu?

877
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,030
Of course, I like him. Hey!

878
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:17,010
He is just a younger brother I really like.

879
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:20,890
You clearly knew that Hsuan Yu has a girlfriend so why didn't you keep your distance?

880
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:25,790
Hsuan Yu already agreed to go to Milan with me to work.

881
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:30,370
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

882
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:34,140
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
