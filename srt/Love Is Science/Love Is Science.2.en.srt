Normal people wouldn't have feelings for a mannequin head, right?

Wanda is different. She has been there for me through many difficult situations.

How long are you going to stay in Kaohsiung this time?

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,420
I only have a seminar scheduled. I will be back after one night.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,840
You want to ask me if I want to share a lamb hot pot, right?

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,970
So can you put all my hair up with just one hairpin?

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,030
I am a hairstylist. It looks nice! I will send it to you.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,750
If we get the chance to meet again, send it to me then.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,170
I will always love you, my younger brother.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,800
Either "brother" or "sister" is fine.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,650
Did somebody get the wrong suitcase?

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,280
It's you.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,480
It's Wang Hsuan Yu, oh! Little Piggy, I missed you so much!

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,870
You two basically just switched heads. You can't blame me for not recognizing you after all these years, right?

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,810
It's been twelve years.

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,600
After twelve years, five months, and three days,

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,820
I met my goddess again.

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,420
Today I was very happy to see you again! Good night, Little Piggy.

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,260
Good night, Kim Tae Hee.

Sorry, I would like to try on this pair.

I still remember; you're a size 37, right?

Okay. Please, wait a moment.

What do you think?

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,250
I finished. We can go now.

00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,650
Don't you have another dress?

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,190
How pretty!

52
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,700
- I've decided on this pair.
- Okay.

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,680
- Thank you, Ms. Yan.
- Please, wait a minute.

Why can't someone wear what she wants on her own feet?

60
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,170
Hi, Miss Lin. This is our first time meeting.

61
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,490
And who is this?

62
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,620
- This is my friend—
- My name is Wu Hsiao Wan. I'm Ya Ying's friend.

63
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,470
Her best friend.

64
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,240
She is here for a consultation. I worried she would be too nervous to explain clearly

65
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,300
so I took time off work to accompany her.

66
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,600
Thanks.

67
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,950
Okay, great. Let's get started.

68
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,110
Okay.

69
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,580
Miss Lin, which type of man are you looking for?

70
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,980
Well... I think...

71
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,880
Ya Ying's personality is very simple and innocent so she doesn't really know what type of men she likes.

72
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,460
Her personality is really very simple, honest, and cute. She loves men who are stable.

73
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,380
- The best ones are down-to-earth men, such as civil servants or teachers.
- Oh!

74
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,400
Let me interrupt for a minute. I already know what your basic requirements are.

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,830
But, Miss Lin, do you have anything you want to add yourself?

76
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,580
Well... I think...

77
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,760
If the man has to fly often for work, or has a very flexible work schedule,

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,340
that is a definite no!

79
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,930
I agree. I don't like that, either.

80
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,190
It would be best if he had a stable job and would be financially stable as well.

81
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,520
He should be able to come home everyday to keep our Ya Ying company, chat with her, help her cook,

82
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,950
and walk the dog with her.

83
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:21,150
You must host your wedding at places such as Hualien or Taidong, where it's very green and grassy.

84
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,250
- That would be beautiful!
- Of course, it would be beautiful! The sea would also be nearby.

85
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,980
For the man's surname, we prefer Liu or Tsai. Oh is fine too.

86
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,560
- Hsiao Wan–
- We can't do I.V.F. (in vitro fertilization).

87
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,550
You surely can't! Doing something like that TV show, "Future Mother," will scare people to death.

88
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,490
There could also be problems with the mother-in-law. We must verify his parents' background.

89
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,510
I'll never let that happen to you.

90
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,020
For your wedding dress, the best would be to reveal a bit of your shoulders.

91
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,140
But you can't reveal your chest too much.

92
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,000
- Hsiao Wan, you're so good to me.
- Of course.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,590
You're the best!

94
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,840
I'll do my best to input all this data into our file. We will notify you once we have good news!

95
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,750
- Okay. Thank you.
- Bye bye.

96
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,640
Bye bye.

97
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,050
- Oh, right. Wait for me.
- Okay.

Mr. Ou Wen.

99
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,870
What's wrong?

100
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,010
When I meet with my potential partners later on,

101
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,010
can I bring Hsiao Wan with me?

102
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,620
There's nothing wrong with that, but important first step meetings are to get to know each other so—

103
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,120
Yes, I know. That means Hsiao Wan must be present!

104
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,620
I hope my future partner can get along well with her.

105
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,880
Ya Ying!

106
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,900
I won't omit such a major event about your future marriage.

107
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,400
- Thank you for your time, Mr. Ou Wen.
- Thank you.

108
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,530
- Take care.
- Let's go.

109
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,660
Boss, this is Miss Lee's information.

110
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,530
No matter how much data we have, or how perfect our matchmaking index is,

111
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,000
if she doesn't separate from her best friend, she will never be able to marry.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,300
Can't we just directly tell Miss Lin?

113
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,480
There's no point. Do you know the cold temperature when your grandma decides you are cold?

114
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,030
There is a type of "good" which refers to "good intentions" from your friends.

115
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,320
There is a type of "happiness" which refers to when others think you are truly happy.

116
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,690
All of the above are exclusive to Asia.

117
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,690
I call it "Asian Pressure."

118
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,580
What?

119
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,430
You're living in the UK's time zone. You don't understand.

120
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,750
Then should I still be pursuing this case for my sales quota?

121
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,200
You should! You definitely should!

122
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,380
I just wanted you to understand all data are not enough when facing this "Asian pressure."

123
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,810
You have to use this here to figure things out.

124
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,320
Good luck. You can do this.

126
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,460
I want to dye it like this.

127
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,850
You know the trends well. A few days ago, a model also came to dye her hair this special color.

128
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,330
The color will also suit your small face well.

129
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,510
Really? Do you think this color will suit me?

130
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,590
Yes! I think it will be very suitable.

131
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,780
Okay, then I'll go with this color.

132
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,110
Okay. Leave it to me.

133
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,850
Take a look at these pictures first and see which style you want.

134
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,530
I'll be right back.

135
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,530
Recently, a lot of Korean actors have hairstyles that are puffy on the top,

136
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,630
wavy and also curly.

137
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,700
- Like this one!
- I see.

138
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,760
But do you know how to use hair mousse on your hair?

139
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,550
If you don't, I promise it will be a disaster.

140
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,690
How about...

141
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,450
something similar to this type of hairstyle?

142
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,850
Are you sure about bleach dyeing for that customer?

143
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,900
Of course, the customer asked for it.

144
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,760
Did you tell her it's hard to manage that kind of hair? She will have to spend a lot of—

145
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,360
My customer wants to try something new. Why would I discourage her?

146
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,760
Maybe it is her new starting point.

147
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,980
Take a look.

148
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,410
It is curly, but... it is not the type of curls I like.

149
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,780
I think it suits you. It looks good.

150
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,790
Hair that was bleach dyed needs to be conditioned well.

151
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,960
That way it won't get frizzy. You can always return for touch-ups,

152
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,310
to maintain the vibrancy of the color.

153
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,340
I understand, thank you. Bye bye.

154
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,970
Bye bye.

155
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,220
I made another contribution to improving the cityscape today.

156

00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,770
Okay. Plus one.

158
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,360
Okay.

159
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,000
Hsu Kai Li.

160
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,830
Miss Kelly likes gentlemen with taste.

161
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,270
So please don't look directly there.

162
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,270
I know Mama Chao wants a grandchild soon.

163
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,640
But a relationship still needs time to nurture.

164
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,850
I understand.

165
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
These are Ms. Kelly's favorite roses.

166
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,760
It's best to leave a good first impression.

167
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,030
Hi, I'm Kelly.

168
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,280
Hi, Miss Kelly.

169
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,640
Thank you, Mr. Chao. You are so thoughtful.

170
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,400
It's a must. Miss Kelly, please sit.

171
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,110
Thank you.

172
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,640
Would you like something to drink?

173
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,770
I heard their hand brewed coffee is quite well-known. Would you like one?

174
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,280
Sure. Thank you.

175
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,380
Do you like the roses?

176
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,410
Roses are my favorite flowers.

177
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,250
How is it going over there?

178
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,750
Not much is going on.

179
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,740
What about you?

180
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,720
- You will bring great luck to your husband (palm reading).
- Really?

181
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,870
And it looks like you will have two sons and a daughter.

182
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,870
Just wait. We'll get wedding invitations in 3 months, and a grandchild within a year.

183
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,110
- You have to come with me to pick out a bed.
- Of course. It's good for you to sleep well.

184
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,550
- Hi.
- Hello. Welcome.

185
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,840
The usual, two orders of fried rice to go.

186
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,260
Sure, please wait.

187
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,130
Business is not bad today.

188
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,000
Mr. Chang, I saw on your profile that you both like to exercise.

189
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,990
Coincidently, Ms. Lu wanted to sign up for a swim event at Sun Moon Lake next year.

190
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,630
Would Mr. Chang like to join?

191
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,480
I think I wrote that I like to bike around the island.

192
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,900
That shouldn't have much to do with swimming.

193
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,130
What about Ms. Lu? Do you like to ride bikes?

194
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,370
I prefer running.

195
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,220
I remembered that you used to participate in marathons too.

196
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,430
Then what about the international marathon race early next year? Did you sign up yet?

197
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,120
- Yes.
- Am I a third-wheel here?

198
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,570
Why isn't the consultant familiar with the customer's profile?

199
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,690
Yet the customer knows everything about the consultant's schedule?

200
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,710
Okay. I'll go back right now.

201
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,520
Something came up at the company. I need to return.

202
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,130
Am I the main focus today or are you?

204
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,720
Am I paying for you to come on a date?

205
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,500
Today was my mistake. Next time–

206
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,080
Next time? Will there even be a next time?

207
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,050
Haven't you embarrassed me enough?

208
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,130
Mr. Chang, that's not what I meant.

209
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,240
What did you mean? Tell me!

210
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,050
I gave you two hours, and you wasted the two hours!

211
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,220
Do you even know how much I can make in two hours?

212
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,640
How much money does a planner make? Can you even make it up?

213
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,240
There's nothing wrong with someone being better looking than you.

214
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,020
Hanawa. (He looks like "Hanawa" in the manga "Chibi Maruko-chan.")

215
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,940
Who are you talking to?

216
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,850
Whoever responds is the one that I'm talking to.

217
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,030
Hanawa.

218
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,230
Please respect my client, Sir.

219
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,700
I'm trying to help you.

220
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,550
Mr. Chang, I'm so sorry about today. We will do our best to plan your next appointment.

221
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,520
The company will cover today's expenses.

222
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,840
I can still afford a cup of coffee.

223
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,540
Hey! You–

224
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,940
He's leaving.

225
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,740
Did you not see?

226
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,980
He is leaving.

227
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,640
What does that have to do with you, Sir?

228
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,500
Hey.

229
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,110
What? Do you want to touch it?

230
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,380
No, but do you want to be splashed again?

231
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,930
Didn't I say it before?

232
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,380
During the date, you can't have eye contact with the female clients for more than 3 seconds.

233
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,750
You can't flirt, send the wrong signals, use hair gel, or dress up.

234
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,290
Boss. I've already dressed down today.

235
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,850
If I keep going down, my fashion sense won't allow it.

236
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,920
Is this handsome? How so?

237
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,340
I don't understand.

238
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,190
Your sense of beauty has always been lacking.

239
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,730
Wear this for all future arranged meetings.

240
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,640
I don't want to. No way!

241
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,380
I'm not asking for your approval. This is an order.

242
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,290
Why don't you let me dress according to my taste?

243
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,390
I can attract new female members.

244
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,820
It's because of your stubbornness.

245
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,500
Take a look at Sheng Ying's desk.

246
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,710
We just had another client asking for a planner change.

247
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,670
This is for you.

248
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,890
And I can't make it to the arranged date tonight.

249
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,410
You two can go.

250
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,100
What?

251
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,190
Today is that one day of the month.

252
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,710
No problem, I'll go to the arranged date.

253
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,510
Please take care of yourself.

254
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,510
Miss.

255
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,010
- Where's my mom?
- She is upstairs changing.

256
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,020
Changing? Where is she going?

257
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,350
Yes. I saw the poster for next month.

258
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,110
It's too simple.

259
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,650
Even though our product is 100% natural, we don't need to make the poster that simple.

260
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,010
Okay. Please make that change.

261
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,620
Where's the creative director?

262
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,040
Tell him that I want to meet with him tomorrow.

263
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,070
Why are you dressed like that?

264
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,890
We're not on the same wavelength at all.

265
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,270
How was I supposed to know what you were going to wear?

266
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:40,120
You should know women always love new things and often change their minds.

267
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,900
Yes, it is all my fault.

268
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,850
I'm sorry.

269
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,360
Jessica, bring over the Lafite 2000 that I just opened.

270
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,190
Yes, Madam.

271
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,170
Wow! Lafite 2000? Did something good happen?

272
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,390
Did you open a new branch store?

273
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,820
It's something more worthy of a celebration.

274
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,570
Yung Tai and his French girlfriend broke up.

275
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,430
Why are you celebrating other people breaking up?

276
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,570
This means my daughter has a chance.

277
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,950
Honey, listen to your mom.

278
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,600
Although you two already divorced, I thought it through very carefully.

279
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,670
You and Yung Tai were already divorced nine years.

280
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,110
He was in a total of five relationships since then.

281
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,830
The longest didn't even last over six months.

282
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,610
Your short-term marriage

283
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,440
lasted at least three years. What does this mean?

284
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,480
This means that you are his best partner.

285
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,180
Also, let me tell you something else.

286
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,470
Never mind, my dress is too puffy.

287
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,860
Come here! Come here!

288
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,690
Hurry up!

289
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,000
Look at this!

290
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,800
This broken marriage of yours,

291
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,380
I worked hard to hold onto it.

292
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,080
Look here!

293
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,600
For every New Year, holidays,

294
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,480
and my birthday,

295
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,290
Yung Tai always sent me a message.

296
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,760
He never missed once.

297
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,620
Mom, that's enough!

298
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,720
When Dad passed away, you didn't bother finding another partner.

299
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,350
So why do I have to get back together with him?

300
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,400
Do you think it was my choice to remain single?

301
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,340
It's because I married the best man in the entire world.

302
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,410
Your dad was perfect in every possible way.

303
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,540
Except he left a little early,

304
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,980
leaving me alone to take care of you.

305
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,850
I had to carry you on my back when I cleaned blemishes and tried to get more business.

306
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,250
Now look at me!

307
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:05,330
All the men around me just fancy me for my mansion and my sports cars.

308
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,810
Honey, tell me.

309
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,810
Is there any man who is like your dad,

310
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,430
who sincerely loved me?

311
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,420
Mom! I would love to marry someone like Dad.

312
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,970
Silly.

313
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,670
You should marry someone like Yung Tai.

314
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,080
Why?

315
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,760
Your dad's life was short.

316
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,370
Yung Tai is handsome and polite.

317
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,530
Most importantly, he does a good job operating his business.

318
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,790
But Mom, we are unsuitable for each other.

319
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,790
Stop acting so tough.

320
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,630
It's already been nine years since your divorce.

321
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,660
You're still wearing your wedding ring.

322
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,370
You just don't want to admit you regret the divorce.

323
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,810
These past few years, you met many suitable marriage partners.

324
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,930
Yet none of them moved your heart once.

325
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,310
My phone is ringing. Hold on a second.

326
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,110
I have to answer this.

327
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,250
Hello? Chiao An Na?

328
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,850
What? Were you in a car accident?

329
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,750
Which hospital are you at?

330
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,410
Okay, I'll be there very soon.

331
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,960
Chiao An Na got into a car accident. I have to go to the hospital to see her now.

332
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,010
- I'll eat with you another time, okay?
- Hey, hey, hey!

333
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,620
How many times has Chiao An Na been in a car accident?

334
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,190
Why does she always get into a car accident whenever you dine with me?

335
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,550
She has been having bad luck recently. Mom,

336
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,320
I have to go now! I'll come home another time to eat with you. Okay?

337
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,250
Bye bye!

338
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,520
Welcome back! Where do you want to meet?

339
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,750
- The light is green.
- Oh.

340
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,180
Mr. Driver, could you please drop off my luggage

341
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,450
at this address?
- Okay.

342
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,780
Here's NT$1000 ($35 U.S.) Keep the change.

343
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
♫  I'll be coming up hot for a minute  ♫

344
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,180
♫  Everybody know the drop when I'm in it  ♫

345
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,350
♫  Drop the top when I'm in it, I'm in it  ♫

346
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,330
♫  Everybody know the drop when I'm in it, yes  ♫

347
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,360
♫  I go. So show. Everybody, everybody know ♫

348
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,800
♫  You, you know when the click, click goes ♫

349
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,320
- Joanna!
- Hi!

350
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,720
You're still so beautiful today.

351
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,210
Hi!
Ruff. Bonny and Read.

352
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,550
Come in! Come in!

353
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,190
♫  I'll be coming up, I'll be coming up  ♫

354
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,270
♫ Everybody, everybody know, oh, oh, oh. You, you know when the click, click goes ♫

355
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,930
Oh, my babe!
♫  To the sh*t, then it's about  ♫

356
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,360
Do we have to meet here right after you just landed?

357
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,690
I'm starting to doubt whether you're a Love Is Science Agency shareholder or this club's shareholder.

358
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,420
You should be used to this already.

359
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,400
I was on the plane for ten hours. My bones have all hardened.

360
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,720
Of course, I have to come here to loosen up a bit. Did you see me dancing up there?

361
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,470
Yes, yes, I did.

362
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,020
- It's so noisy here. I want to go home.
- What?

363
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,320
I want to go home.

364
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,690
You promised that you would come here with me.

365
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,770
♫ I'll be coming up hot for a minute ♫

366
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,590
♫ Everybody know the drop when I'm in it ♫

367
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,830
♫ I-I drop the top when I'm in it, I'm in it  ♫

368
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,290
♫ Everybody know the drop when I'm in it, yes ♫

369
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,170
♫  I go. So show. Everybody, everybody know, oh, oh ♫

370
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:03,590
♫  You, you know when the click, click goes... It shall be fun  ♫

371
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,320
Get moving! Get moving!

372
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,180
Be more natural!

373
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,960
When you're not embarrassed, other people will feel it.

374
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,190
Do you want to eat this?

375
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,950
I'll drink instead.

376
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,300
You read the company's revenue report already, right?

377
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,560
Revenue report?

378
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,260
Do I still need to look at the revenue report when I have you keeping an eye on it?

379
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,490
How have you been?

380
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,400
I'm doing very well! You can tell from the revenue report,

381
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,860
our company has been completely on track–

382
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,460
You know what I'm talking about.

383
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,520
I'm doing well! You don't need to worry.

384
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,120
I helped you get back on track.

385
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,720
If you don't treat yourself well, then you should be sorry to me.

386
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,690
Okay, I know.

387
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,580
Excuse me, we didn't order this drink.

388
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,790
That gentleman over there paid for it.

389
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,620
You just wait quietly for me here,

390
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,190
- while I go over to say thanks.
- All right.

391
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:11,000
It's okay with me if you want to be taken away by someone though.

392
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,420
- Hey!
- Oh!

393
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,330
Look who I found here! Little Piggy!

394
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,900
I didn't expect to meet you here.

395
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,160
I see you're a player.

396
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,800
I'm not a player. I'm... not...

397
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,100
I-I-I...

398
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,950
Come eat with me. Let's go!

399
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:04,240
You're still the same as before. You love to twirl my hair.

400
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,060
Before?

401
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,570
What does he mean before?

402
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,330
Give me a hint!

403
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,960
My name starts with an S.

404
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,890
Starts with an S?

405
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,340
Sam.

406
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,730
You're shocked, aren't you?

407
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,230
Steven.

408
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,990
Shawn?

409
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,720
Simon?

410
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,430
Kevin. It doesn't even have an S in it.

411
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,420
I was saying that I'm not a player.

412
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,890
I rarely come to a nightclub.

413
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,790
Okay, okay. You're the most well-behaved.

414
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,330
Here, eat this cuttlefish ball.

415
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,460
You caught someone so young and handsome very fast.

416
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,670
No, I'm not—

417
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,860
Let me introduce you guys. He is... my younger brother.

418
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,300
Little Piggy.

419
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,790
- Your younger brother?
- Yes.

420
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,020
Little Piggy?

421
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,820
But you don't look like a pig.

422
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,030
My name is Wang Hsuan Yu.

423
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,700
Yan Fei...

424
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,210
The brother-in-law that wasn't meant to be.

425
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,700
Wow, he's Yung Tai...

426
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,430
He is not related to that guy in any way.

427
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,690
It's the unspoken past.

428
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,050
How can you have a history that I don't know about?

429
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,850
Let's add each other on LINE later. I'll add you first.

430
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,240
Don't "hit on" my Little Piggy!

431
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,600
Where's that handsome guy you were just with?

432
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,880
Please, he was just a boyfriend I was with several years ago,

433
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,100
and only for about three days.

434
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,190
But I forgot his name so he left angrily.

435
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,480
So...

436
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,930
There's no point in staying today.

437
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,290
- Isn't there?
- Let's go home!

438
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,560
Hsuan Yu!

439
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,480
What are you doing here?

440
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,740
Let me take you home.

441
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,820
- Are we going, too?
- Let's go.

442
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,230
I...

443
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,930
You go first.

444
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,920
You go first.

445
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,260
My brother and his wife are going on a picnic to a hot spring this Sunday.

446
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,200
Little Piggy, you're so cute.

447
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,110
Did you forget that your brother and I are both already married?

448
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,820
Oh, you're right.

449
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,000
Then what did you want to tell me earlier?

450
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,080
I was worried about what to say when I call you.

451
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,030
I thought it would be awkward since we haven't seen each other for so long.

452
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,960
So I kept hesitating and ended up not calling you.

453
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,500
But who knew we would see each other again so soon?

454
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,020
Staying at the club for so long while risking losing my hearing was worth it.

455
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,920
Even now, I still have a small headache.

456
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,580
My hair also smells bad. Smell it.

457
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,920
It is late already. Where can I wash my hair?

458
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,010
Or should I only wash my bangs?

459
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,380
I'm too lazy to wash my hair, but I do want to wash it.

460
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,220
I know a hair salon

461
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,210
that is open till very late.

462
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,320
Voodoo

463
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,190
Is it okay if we sneak in like this?

464
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,780
I'm currently preparing for the hairstylist exam.

465
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,980
My boss told me that I could use this place after work hours to practice.

466
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,660
Please come this way.

467
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,390
May I ask Ms. Yan Fei

468
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,020
if she is willing to accept hairstylist Number 29's invitation

469
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,700
to help you wash your hair?

470
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,910
Number 29?

471
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:10,700
Yes, I do.

472
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,550
Please take a seat here.

473
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,890
Here you go.

474
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,700
Thank you.

475
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,750
Sorry.

476
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,740
You're like a real hairstylist.

477
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,820
Okay, it's good now.

478
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,790
- Careful.
- I'm lying down now.

479
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,130
Please come this way.

480
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,870
May I ask Ms. Yan Fei

481
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:21,330
if she is willing to accept hairstylist Number 29's invitation to help you wash your hair?

482
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,390
Number 29?

483
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,220
Yes, I do.

484
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,060
Please take a seat here.

485
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,380
Here you go.

486
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,160
Thank you.

487
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,280
Sorry.

488
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,450
You're like a real hairstylist.

489
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,450
Okay, it's good now.

490
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,490
- Careful.
- I'm lying down now.

491
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,350
I'm placing a hot towel over your eyes.

492
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,400
- I'm taking it off now.
- Okay.

493
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,590
I'm going to wash your hair now.

494
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,480
This is rose oil.

495
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,600
It will help you relax.

496
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,410
I'm done.

497
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,780
You massaged it so well

498
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,690
that I fell asleep and even had a dream.

499
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,630
What did you dream about?

500
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,820
I don't remember anymore.

501
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,890
Can you...

502
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,520
massage this area a bit more?

503
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,670
Hurry! Right here!

504
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,810
Okay.

505
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,700
Are you awake?

506
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,020
Did you come back already?

507
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,900
Of course, I came back already.

508
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,340
Yesterday, you left first with that brother-in-law who wasn't meant to be.

509
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,080
I was worried that I would disturb you guys if I came home too early.

510
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,540
What are you saying? He's my younger brother.

511
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,570
Your younger brother? Liar!

512
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,320
I saw him yesterday on the dance floor.

513
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,050
- Go away!
- You better tell me the truth!

514
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,870
Was he useful?

515
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:43,090
What do you mean by useful?

516
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,370
Your hair smells so good. Why did you wash your hair for no reason?

517
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,800
And you didn't use the shampoo from home.

518
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,730
I caught you, didn't I? Did you spend the night together at a hotel?

519
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,820
Are you awake?

520
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,110
Did you come back already?

521
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,800
Of course, I came back already.

522
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,430
Yesterday, you left first with that brother-in-law who wasn't meant to be.

523
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,150
I was worried that I would disturb you guys if I came home too early.

524
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,850
What are you saying? He's my younger brother.

525
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,150
Your younger brother?

526
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,640
Liar!

527
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,250
I saw him yesterday on the dance floor.

528
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,940
Go away!

529
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,170
You better tell me the truth!

530
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,880
Was he useful?

531
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,430
What do you mean by useful?

532
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,140
Your hair smells so good. Why did you wash your hair for no reason?

533
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:15,030
And you didn't use the shampoo from home. I caught you, didn't I? Did you spend the night together at a hotel?

534
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,590
Did you do it before or after? Before or after?

535
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,500
Neither! You're thinking too much! He only helped me wash my hair. That's it!

536
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,130
- Did he only wash your hair?
- Yes!

537
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,540
Did you spend the night together at a hotel just to wash your hair?

538
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,920
You made a big mistake!

539
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,040
That's very non-environmental, disrespectful, and impolite behavior.

540
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,840
You really deserve a beating!

541
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,810
We didn't go to a hotel!

542
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,850
We only went to the hair salon where he works to wash my hair.

543
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,340
Are you still unable forget about Yung Tai?

544
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,430
What? What does this have to do with him?

545
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,360
It is obvious. It has been so long since you divorced.

546
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,250
A perfect, handsome, young man is right in front of you, yet you're not making any moves on him.

547
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,050
If it's not because you can't forget about "that person," what is it then?

548
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,110
Not everyone's life revolves around love like yours does.

549
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,500
I want my life to revolve only around work right now.

550
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,930
Miss, if there's nothing else, I need to go to work now.

551
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,360
Good luck, Wife.

552
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,450
Your life has already revolved around work for many years now.

553
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,630
Who will accompany me to the battlefield today?

554
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:40,120
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

555
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,170
That Mr. Chao,

556
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:46,370
ever since we went to that wine tasting event together, he has been avoiding me.

557
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,880
He even blocked me.

558
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:53,480
He was just toying with my emotions.

559
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,520
He's trash! He's the worst!

560
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,780
Please don't cry. We're going to take care of this issue as fast as we can, okay?

561
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,160
Wipe your tears with this.

562
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:21,250
I originally wanted to introduce Kelly to my friend at the wine tasting event.

563
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,670
Yet when my friend met Kelly, he saw how shallow her conversations were.

564
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,890
She's just an attention-seeking, selfish airhead, unsuitable as a marriage partner.

565
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:33,070
Then may I ask what qualities your friend is suggesting for a marriage partner?

566
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:36,860
- My friend is suggesting I look for someone who is pure and cute–
- Cute,

567
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:42,430
natural-looking, a good wife and mother, and who has never had a boyfriend before.

568
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,690
These members fully meet your conditions, Mr. Chao.

569
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,530
Why are they all just teachers, accountants, and nurses again?

570
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,720
I'm sorry, I opened the wrong file.

571
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:17,090
These are pure, cute, natural-looking, will be a good wife and mother, and never had a boyfriend before.

572
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,100
You must kick him out!

573
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:32,120
You can't let him hurt the other women here!

574
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,460
You don't have to worry about that.

575
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:40,570
To make up for your emotional trauma, the next three arranged dates will be free of charge.

576
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:46,680
These are our newest members' information. Let me know whom you're interested in. I'll arrange for you to meet first.

577
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,690
Thank you, Yan Fei.

578
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,070
Voodoo

579
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:13,340
Did you not sleep again last night? Where did you go to play?

580
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:19,000
First, we danced until the place closed, then we went to sing.

581
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,930
After karaoke, we went to eat Taiwanese cold noodles.

582
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:25,120
After eating, it was finally time to go home, right?

583
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,600
Apparently not, because she still invited me to a fat-burning aerobics boxing class.

584
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,150
More burning? My whole life will be burnt out at this pace.

585
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,210
How can you laugh?

586
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:42,240
If I hadn't insisted on coming to work today, I'd be dead.

587
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,630
Welcome!

588
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,180
- Hello!
- Hey! Hi!

589
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,380
This is my hairstylist, Hsuan Yu.

590
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,410
My friend loved this haircut you styled for me.

591
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:59,570
He said it looks good and is easy to take care of. I brought him to you today for a haircut.

592
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:06,590
It is curly, but... it is not the type of curls I like.

593
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,050
No problem!

594
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,620
Please come in!

595
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,210
Take a seat there.

596
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,710
Okay.

597
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,810
Hello.

598
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:23,550
My boyfriend told me I look weird dyeing my hair purple.

599
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:26,150
My colleagues also kept staring at me while whispering to each other.

600
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,690
My friend even told me to go buy new clothes and shoes to pair with this hair.

601
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,690
Who was the one who told me this looks good?

602
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:34,100
I don't care. You must fix my hair back to what it looked like before.

603
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,510
Okay, okay. Okay.

604
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,350
Have the new arranged dates been decided yet?

605
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,520
For Kelly, I want to arrange courses for her on wine and financial investment

606
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,970
before her next arranged date.

607
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:53,990
I hope that can help increase the success rate of her dates.

608
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,410
In regards to Mr. Chao,

609
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,450
his personal preferences and his friend's requirements are complete opposites.

610
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,720
It's almost impossible for him to have successful arranged dates.

611
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:10,520
Our company can very accurately match people up, but...

612
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,380
it's the clients who can't rationally make the decision that best suits them.

613
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,920
Is this then the only way, continue going in circles?

614
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,120
Well, we can't force them to make a decision.

615
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,770
We've been going through lots of issues lately, right?

616
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,250
Hasn't it been a long time

617
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,040
since we've visited our Big Boss?

618
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,210
Bodhisattva Guanyin.

619
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,830
Big Boss! I'm so sorry I came very late to see you.

620
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:09,470
I hope you can bless each of our clients to help them think clearly.

621
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,210
I hope our arranged dates will be successful.

622
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:15,060
I hope I can meet my Mr. Right.

623
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,130
Please allow our clients to match successfully.

624
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:22,040
I hope I can meet my Miss Right.

625
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,970
I'm going to log the clients with an arranged meeting into the temple's marriage book.

626
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,510
I'm going to pray for a red thread (The marriage god gives a red thread as a lucky love charm).

627
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,080
Then I'll go pick a fortune message for the company.

628
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:10,500
Marriage Book. Name: Huang Ru Yu. Prayer: May the gods grant me a good relationship.

629
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,770
Number 19 (Worshipers pick a stick for a fortune message).

630
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:29,490
[Fortune number 19]

631
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,740
"After a long period of drought comes the long-awaited rain."
[Extremely good fortune: number 19]

632
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,370
"You might encounter someone that you knew from childhood."

633
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,920
"The joyous wedding night"

634
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,480
"is also when you'll gain great honor and prestige in your work or school."

635
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,680
This sounds very incredible.

636
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,790
After a long period of drought comes the long-awaited rain.

637
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,070
You might encounter someone that you knew from childhood.

638
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,340
Sounds about accurate.

639
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,730
Your divination fortune says that my marriage is uncertain,

640
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,320
but the decoding slip says,

641
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,370
"When winter leaves, spring will come."

642
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:32,740
Does that mean I'll have a chance in the springtime after the new year?

643
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,840
The interpretation of the decoding slip

644
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,090
may vary for each person depending on one's situation.

645
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,710
No.

646
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,050
I don't care about others. I'm just asking

647
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:48,490
what mine means? I heard that this temple is very effective.

648
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:51,690
A lot of people got married after praying for the red thread.

649
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:56,650
I just got the red thread, but I also got

650
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:01,380
this fortune that says, "Fate: Hope is lost. Marriage: Unlikely."

651
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,260
Information Desk

652
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,220
Hi, do you need help?

653
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,120
CEO Yan Fei: Love Is Science

654
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,630
"Love Is Science?"

655
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:27,360
I have seen your advertisements in group chats.

656
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,770
Can you find me a marriage partner?

657
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,390
That is our specialty.

658
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:36,060
Within three months.

659
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,400
If you can get it done,

660
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,750
I will join immediately.

661
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,030
Love Is Science

662
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,940
Do you need to fly again? How come you are only back for such a short time?

663
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,980
I can't help it.

664
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,620
Are you done yet?

665
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,700
Come have dinner with me.

666
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,150
Sure, but you will have to wait.

667
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:44,060
Fine, take your time.

668
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:56,680
Who is making my Yan Fei work so late, causing her to be stressed about it?

669
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,640
Let me take a look.

670
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,630
A woman.

671
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,130
- Is she a "3G woman" (great education, income and job)?
- Yes.

672
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,280
She doesn't look bad.

673
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,600
Her educational background is great. Her income is great.

674
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,180
Isn't this the deadly combo for the matchmaking market?

675
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,840
That's right.

676
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:29,100
But don't you think it is strange?

677
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,980
Why is a 3G man a hot commodity,

678
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:35,540
but a 3G woman is a deadly combo? It's very unfair.

679
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,870
It was never fair to start with.

680
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:42,510
At that age, a high-income man has plenty of money.

681
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,880
They don't want a woman who is successful at work.

682
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,500
They just want a young body.

683
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:53,610
In this cruel world, women lose their value once they reach thirty.

684
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:58,100
Especially when it's a hen that can't lay eggs. That's an automatic no.

685
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,270
So what if they can't have babies? Just like how I've decided not to have babies or get married.

686
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:04,650
Look at how happy I am.

687
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:09,250
Don't speak so soon. Even if you don't want it now, it doesn't mean you won't want it later.

688
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:12,060
Don't give up. Never say never.

689
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:15,940
Hey, I didn't give up. I just know myself.

690
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,910
My love is always short-lived. I'm only fond of new things.

691
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:25,600
Do you still remember when I first introduced Lily to this company? The one who gossips a lot?

692
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:31,150
She had a sudden elegant wedding and guess what? She divorced him forty-five days later.

693
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,980
Her life was terrible, and it was embarrassing. That's not for me.

694
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,870
What's wrong with divorcing?

695
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,760
Just get back up again, and the world is still beautiful.

696
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,000
That's right. The world is still beautiful.

697
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,230
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.

698
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,980
- You have worked hard. Bye.
- Bye.

699
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,550
I'm in need of your help. I'm depending on you!

700
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,190
Okay. Leave.

701
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,310
Hi, Little Piggy.

702
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,440
Why are you here?

703
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:22,970
I... finished my headache medicine.

704
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,300
I want to get bangs.

705
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:35,890
Have a seat first. I'll grab the cape.

706
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,240
Wait.

707
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,420
Can you wash my hair first?

708
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:22,390
My head has been hurting all day.

709
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:27,470
This is the best moment ever.

710
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,740
Was it rough today?

711
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,590
We were matching up arranged dates for our clients.

712
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:39,930
We can reference statistics and a personalized interview,

713
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:44,950
confirm their interests, looks, previous relationships, etc.,

714
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,990
then we can precisely

715
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:52,520
predict the success rate for each date.

716
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:58,280
But... often because of one word from their friend,

717
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,150
everything goes to waste.

718
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,580
- Actually, you're not alone.
- What?

719
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,300
Yesterday, a customer dyed her hair to a bright color.

720
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:16,450
But because her friends and co-workers said it didn't suit her, she came back and demanded to dye it back to a dark color.

721
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:20,440
- Darn that Asian Pressure.
- Asian Pressure.

722
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,680
So you were doing well in the U.S. Why did you come back?

723
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,690
Because I saw a good job opportunity.

724
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:38,310
What about you, Little Piggy? I always thought you would work in the food industry.

725
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,980
Why did you become a hairstylist?

726
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,890
Because I was encouraged by someone.

727
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,360
By whom?

728
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:16,110
So you were doing well in the U.S. Why did you come back?

729
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:21,120
Because I saw a good job opportunity.

730
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,120
What about you, Little Piggy?

731
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:28,490
I always thought you would work in the food industry. Why did you become a hairstylist?

732
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:34,260
Because I was encouraged to by someone.

733
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,220
By whom?

734
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,020
Kim Tae Hee (Korean actress).

735
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,730
- Kim Tae Hee?
- Yes.

736
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,640
Of course.

737
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:47,280
It's true. I need to be well-prepared for my goddess.

738
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:54,250
When I was choosing majors, I thought that if one day, my goddess appears in front of me,

739
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,380
I can...

740
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:00,850
A. Help treat her dog's constipation;

741
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:05,350
B. Help make a beautiful bouquet for her;

742
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:10,210
C. Help her fix toilets or clear pipe drains;

743
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:16,940
Or D. Help cut and style her hair.

744
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,670
Yes, sure that's it.

745
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:24,310
It's true. I think it worked out well.

746
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:28,890
At least I've achieved half of it.

747
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:30,590
Which half?

748
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,170
Becoming a stylist.

749
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:37,100
The rest is just waiting for her to show up.

750
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:43,120
If one day you really washed Kim Tae Hee's hair,

751
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,180
that would be totally inspiring.

752
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:50,120
Then Kim Tae Hee would be...

753
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,150
your Asian Power.

754
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,480
- Asian Power?
- Right.

755
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,570
Okay, time to rinse.

756
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:05,020
Wait, this area is still dirty.

757
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,590
Where? I already washed that area several times.

758
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,260
It's still dirty!

759
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,880
How can that be possible?

760
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,350
A little more massaging will clean it up.

761
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:18,530
- I have almost rubbed your skin off.
- Then do the other side.
- What?

762
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,780
Voodoo

763
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,870
Feifei, hang in there. Don't move.

764
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,910
Hey! I won't be responsible if it looks like a dog chewed on it later.

Piggy's Love Diary

780
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:02,620
My older brother will go to the park tonight to practice basketball.

781
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,880
What if he doesn't show up?

782
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,180
Wait.

783
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,470
You will owe me a chicken cutlet

784
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:12,050
and one boba (bubble) tea.

785
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,700
I swear, he will be there.

786
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,700

♫ The hardest things to calm down are not the stormy waves ♫

791
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:43,440
Do you... do you know how to cut bangs?

792
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,230
♫ I love you yet still can't say why ♫

793
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:49,930
♫ The straight line belongs to men, the curved one to god (Antoni Gaudi) ♫

794
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:53,470
♫ And perhaps my existence pertains to you ♫

795
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:57,080
♫ Can't you see? ♫

796
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:01,130
Just like that, a small amount each time...

797
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:04,610
and do a straight cut a small part at a time.

798
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:07,350
I am a little nervous

799
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:09,450
to cut your hair with my hands in the air.

800
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,190
Otherwise, how do you want to cut?

801
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:14,580
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

802
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:18,080
♫ Like a panicky amateur player ♫

803
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:21,780
♫ It's just that the bargaining chip on the table is me ♫

804
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:25,850
Oh, this side is a little high.

805
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,120
♫ Besides my deeply affectionate eyes, everything else belongs to you ♫

806
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,760
♫ Even if I have nothing, I'll still be able to see you ♫

807
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,150
The right side is a little bit higher again.

808
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,240
Let's cut a little bit more here...

809
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,830
I'm finally finished.

810
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:48,040
Little Piggy, are you really a pig?

811
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:51,770
If you cut it like this, how can I meet your brother?

812
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,910
How can I go meet your brother?

813
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:00,100
Perhaps I made up my mind then.

814
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:04,610
If one day my goddess needs me to cut her hair again,

815
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:08,440
I absolutely cannot mess up.

816
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,330
Her outfit made her look really old.

817
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,350
Doesn't give people the feeling of being in love.

818
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,250
If you don't make any changes in that area—

819
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,780
How could you not find even one person

820
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,680
who's willing to cooperate with me?

821
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,390
As soon as he got off work, he went online to post the news.

822
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,810
Can you afford the penalty of losing advertising endorsements?

823
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,320
Apologize immediately.

824
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,360
Wang Hsuan Yu!

825
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:32,000
No one will be interested in me when I am at this age.

826
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,720
Who said that? Even if you are divorced, I'll still choose you.

827
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:40,900
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

828
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:44,300
It can't be seen nor be discovered.

829
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:50,140
♫ Are you planning to stop responding? ♫

830
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:56,420
♫ Finding excitement in an absurd relationship ♫

831
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:01,340
♫ My melancholy and my monochromatic world  ♫

832
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:06,910
♫  Have become the most laughable accessories  ♫

833
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:12,600
♫ In the end, you're so far away ♫

834
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:18,180
♫ You became a pointless, transparent existence ♫

835
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:24,410
♫ I thought it was only because I came late ♫

836
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:32,340
♫ Turned out I was the only one playing the game ♫

837
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:38,180
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

838
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:44,100
♫ Fantasize about a romantic love ♫

839
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:50,080
♫ While lonely, thinking of someone ♫

840
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:55,280
♫ He will come and warm you up ♫

841
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:01,030
♫ I think what you sometime remembered ♫

842
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:06,700
♫ Is for "just in case" ♫

843
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:11,980
♫ To treat the hug you give me ♫

844
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:20,150
♫ As something to bring you warmth ♫
