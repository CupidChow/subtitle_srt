1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,080
Since we have the intention to get married, I don't want a long-distance marriage.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,620
You can't leave your field behind, and I can't leave you behind.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,680
Nai Hui!

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,180
- You must have gotten a heatstroke.
- I actually caused more trouble when trying to help.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,870
All the radishes have been set out to dry ahead of schedule.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,260
Are you the young lady whom Hsiao Kai mentioned before?

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,950
Mark's new girlfriend?
[Baby Diary]

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,730
Your parents are at your house right now.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,770
I'm coming back right now. You must hold down the fort!

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,250
Mr. and Mrs. Lee, let me formally introduce you.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,240
- Tai Ou Wen is Mark's—
- Sworn brother!

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,280
Sworn?

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,290
Consider this sesame oil chicken as alcohol. Once you finish it, you'll become my younger sister.

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,030
Brother, Yan Fei is my girlfriend now.

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,370
And I am very certain that the person I like is her.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,920
He already dislikes me.
[For Lease]

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,620
By leaving Voodoo to work here, he will only think

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,950
that after you started seeing me, you're just going downhill.

19
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:53,170
I trust that by doing things that I enjoy, my life will change.

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,950
Let Hsuan Yu bravely face the obstacles in his path.

21
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,080
You can only accompany him on his run, not do it on his behalf.

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,520
This money is for opening your shop.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,620
Whether Yan Fei is good or not isn't important.

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,310
What matters is that you're my younger brother.

25
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,440
I really just want you to live life smoothly.

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,470
Right now, I'm doing really well.

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,760
That's all just talk.

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,500
Prove it to me.

29
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,850
♫ I've written your name ♫

51
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,020
Love Is Science?

52
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,070
As a child, you loved to draw.

53
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,830
I never stopped you. I just let you fumble around.

54
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,200
So don't rush to make decisions for Hsuan Yu.

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,520
There will be a day when he will be sure which path he wants to take.

56
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,780
I trust that by doing things that I enjoy, my life will change.

57
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,290
No matter what paths I must take, or how many times I fall.

58
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,090
Things he enjoys.

59
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,650
Where in the world is Mark?

60
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,240
The sun is setting, and he still hasn't appeared.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,130
He just keeps saying, "I'm almost there. Almost there!" But...

62
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,160
What does "almost there" mean? Did he take a trip around the island?

63
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,490
Don't!

64
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,610
Ou Wen! What happened?

65
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,890
What did you do to him?

66
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,600
Just direct your anger about everything at me.

67
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,960
W-What's wrong with you?

68
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,290
Is it too hot outside so you got a heatstroke?

69
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,860
That's right. Your parents rarely come to Taipei. Why did you get back so late?

70
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,410
Uncle and Aunt. D-Don't just stand. Sit and chat.

71
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,250
Pregnant women shouldn't stand for long.

72
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,660
Come, come. Sit, sit.

73
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:39,370
Mark, should we arrange a time for the parents of both sides of the family to meet?

74
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,660
What meeting?

75
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,870
Of course, it's to propose marriage and to discuss how the wedding will go.

76
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,340
We can't wait any longer. Otherwise, once your stomach gets bigger, it'll be difficult to pick a wedding dress.

77
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,080
You're the bride. You must care about that a lot.

78
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,530
What should we do?

79
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,880
You want to discuss marriage, right?

80
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,850
Fine. If you want me to get married, that's no problem.

81
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,900
I will only marry him.

82
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,030
Ou Wen is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.

83
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,180
Dad, Mom. The person I like is Ou Wen.

84
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,540
The person I want to marry is and has to be Ou Wen.

85
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,070
Wh-What?

86
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,240
You... and him...

87
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,900
- Honey!
- Mom! Mom!

88
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,830
Mom!

89
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,960
Wake up! Wake up!

90
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,890
- Honey!
- Mom!

91
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,050
Call an ambulance!

92
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,970
Did you think what you did earlier was very amusing?

93
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,550
- I'm serious.
- It's impossible!

94
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,240
How do you expect your mom and me to accept that our son is—

95
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,330
Is gay?

96
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,130
I don't know whether I'm gay or not. I just know the person I love is Ou Wen.

97
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,830
Shut up!

98
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,720
My son's father.

99
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,850
Are you feeling better?

100
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,800
I want to go home.

101
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,830
Leave! Don't upset your mom any further.

102
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,790
Let's go.

103
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,770
Are you all right?

104
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,210
I'll ask the nurse to get you an ice pack.

105
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,750
No need. It's fine.

106
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,160
Are you ready? Let's go.

107
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,370
- Let's go.
- Let's leave.

108
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,820
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Sorry!

109
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,420
Sorry, I overslept. Sorry.

110
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,170
Why did you get up? I wanted to let you sleep a bit longer.

111
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,090
Why didn't you wake me up?

112
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,880
Nai Hui, I heard from You Fu

113
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,420
that you stayed up late to watch the U.S. stocks.

114
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,440
In the future, don't wake up so early.

115
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,880
Not getting enough sleep is bad for your health.

116
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,980
I'm all right.

117
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,970
You just suffered a heatstroke yesterday. Don't force yourself.

118
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,780
That's right. What if you faint again today?

119
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,040
What should we do?

120
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,150
These two men. If you don't know how to speak properly, then don't speak.

121
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,990
These men don't know how to have a conversation. Ignore them.

122
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,210
Your breakfast is in the rice cooker to stay warm. Remember to eat.

123
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,630
Thank you, Auntie.

124
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,750
We can leave now.

125
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,160
We're leaving now.

126
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,970
Then if anything comes up, remember to call me.

127
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,470
Then I'll wait for you to come back.

128
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,430
Then what do I do now?

129
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,270
Why are you here?

130
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,620
For you. I drew it myself.

131
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,930
Yesterday, I kept thinking about and reflecting on what you're feeling.

132
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,580
I was imagining what type of hair salon would suit you.

133
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,000
Then an image appeared in my mind.

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,060
An image that's very suitable for you to be in.

135
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,070
Thus, this drawing was done.

136
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,480
After I completed this drawing, I discovered

137
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,500
that I was really wrong before.

138
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,380
This is the hair salon that suits you.

139
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,600
I shouldn't have forced you into an image that I wanted.

140
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,850
It is just as Ms. Yan Wu Chun Fung said.

141
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,150
This is your life. I can only accompany you on the run, not do it on your behalf.

142
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,700
You have to find your answer yourself.

143
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,900
Thank you for being willing to trust me and giving me space to grow.

144
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,000
Even if another seven years pass by

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and I can't become Huo Yung Tai.

146
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,760
You don't need to become Huo Yung Tai!

147
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,160
You are you! Just be yourself, Wang Hsuan Yu.

148
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,700
Besides,

149
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,560
I'm not lacking money. So don't worry.

150
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,700
With this painting, my goal is clearer now.

151
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,330
I will work hard.

152
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,600
By the way, I am meeting the real estate agent to see the new storefront.

153
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,080
Do you want to go with me?

154
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,250
She can only accompany him on the run, not do it on his behalf.

155
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,120
Do you understand?

156
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,370
From now on, Jia Jia must brush her teeth by herself. We can't help her anymore.

157
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,560
Please, she is only five years old right now.

158
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,670
Move that food farther away. It makes me nauseous.

159
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,620
Is this better?

160
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,590
May I ask? Are you Mr. Mark Lee, who was slapped by and still has a misunderstanding with his father,

161
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,550
and who could lose his relationship with his father at any time?

162
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,450
What's the matter?

163
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,430
I think even if the Earth is destroyed in a disaster, he can live very well by himself.

164
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,150
Then what should I do?

165
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,370
I still have to live my life.

166
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,970
I really don't know whether you are oblivious or you are deliberately evading the problem.

167
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,930
Do you know that your parents are going home this afternoon?

168
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,780
I know.

169
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,220
Are you going to see them off?

170
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,950
It depends.

171
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,110
You were clearly not ready, so why did you casually come out of the closet?

172
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,360
Hey! Don't keep saying that to me, okay?

173
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,280
You two were there to witness it. A plan can never keep up with the changes.

174
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,890
Okay, fine.

175
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:38,000
May I ask the Master of Crisis Management, what do you plan to do next to resolve it then?

176
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,570
Is the problem with me? It's clearly my parents' problem for not accepting.

177
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,840
You should think in their shoes, too.

178
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,670
It happened so suddenly. How can they accept it?

179
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,850
I can't help it.

180
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,460
Even I don't know if I really am what I am.

181
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,080
I do like you, but I don't like all the men in the world.

182
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,040
Okay, let's not discuss that for now.

183
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,310
Do you know that when you come out of the closet, it's the equivalent of having them go into the closet?

184
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,780
What does that mean?

185
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,650
Perhaps the environment you've been in has been friendly to gays.

186
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,160
So it's not particularly stressful for you to come out.

187
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,260
But it's not the same for your parents.

188
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,770
Their friends are probably just as conservative as they are.

189
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,390
How will they face the questions from their friends and family in the future?

190
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,470
When they are faced with friends who criticize gays,

191
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,150
how should they react?

192
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,980
What do I do then?

193
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,130
It's already happened.

194
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,230
Based on my experience, the first reaction of parents

195
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,650
who can't accept it is denial.

196
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,220
They will think that there must have been a mistake somehow.

197
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,420
Or that perhaps you got tricked by me.

198
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,310
That's not exactly wrong.

199
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,070
And then?

200
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,230
And then they probably will blame themselves.

201
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,960
They may get angry, thinking that you betrayed them.

202
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,570
But most likely,

203
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,510
they will be sad.

204
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,340
Because they will feel utterly heartbroken.

205
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,910
They will worry about how arduous your journey will be going forward.

206
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,630
It will be like mine in the past.

207
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,900
I get it now.

208
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,120
I will patiently wait for the day that they accept it.

209
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,640
Why is it so boring?

210
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,300
I've already done all the assorted miscellaneous stuff.

211
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm still very bored.

212
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,280
Has it been only twenty minutes?

213
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,890
How could time here pass so slowly?

214
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,710
I...

215
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,780
Actually, moving here to the countryside is not bad.

216
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,790
There's the internet and the high-speed train.

217
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,290
It seems there's no difference in where I'm working from.

218
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,280
Boss.

219
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,470
How is it?

220
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,960
How is that Wang Hsuan Yu who shouted to me that he's resigning?

221
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,210
I heard he is opening his own shop.

222
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,040
I don't know anything.

223
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,730
Boss, you receive news so quickly.

224
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,030
He can't even pass our internal promotion exam in the salon. How can he open his own shop?

225
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,580
How would it be that easy?

226
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,290
No, Boss. You know about Hsuan Yu's capability.

227
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,900
He was an official hairstylist in our salon, after all.

228
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,590
Our official hairstylist is basically the same as those out there.

229
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,530
Also, if you didn't set up your subjective exam on aesthetics,

230
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,200
he could have been on his own long ago.

231
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,270
So are you complaining about our system at Voodoo?

232
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,240
That's not it. You clearly saw a lot of potential in him before.

233
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,940
Didn't you criticize him so harshly before because you admired him?

234
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,980
Do you remember what you said to me when you were drunk?

235
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,950
You said you would give the salon to Hsuan Yu to run in the future.

236
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,030
Now, you are belittling him, saying he is overestimating himself.

237
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,370
Aren't you just saying the grapes are sour because you can't eat them?

238
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,170
You said something about sour grapes. My ears can't hear well. Do you want to say it again?

239
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,900
I was saying that Hsuan Yu was so disrespectful toward you, Boss.

240
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,580
So many people want to enter Royal Taipei but can't get in.

241
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,080
If it weren't for your leadership, Boss, we probably couldn't even touch its doors.

242
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,140
I'm going to call him right now and scold that rascal.

243
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,550
- You are all set.
- Thanks.

244
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,670
Hello.

245
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,930
I was just opening an account. It's already opened now.

246
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,610
You just need to wire in the amount I asked you last time.

247
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,440
Auntie, everything is set.

248
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,100
Thank you.

249
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,050
How is your daughter lately?

250
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:36,190
Didn't she faint during class in college? Did she go to the hospital for a checkup?

251
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,930
The doctor said that she had endometriosis (abnormal uterus tissue).

252
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,160
It's good that I listened to you.

253
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,210
I got her medical insurance in advance, so at least some of the costs were subsidized.

254
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,680
That's all. Let me know after you do it.

255
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,940
Otherwise, how could our family afford it?

256
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,700
Did you also apply for insurance reimbursement from your daughter's college?

257
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,690
What school insurance?

258
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,570
Schools usually will provide safety insurance for the students when the school year starts.

259
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,160
Can you file a claim with that too?

260
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,570
Of course. Since it's insurance, of course, you can apply for reimbursement.

261
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,260
Auntie, don't worry.

262
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,290
She is a bank vice president who came from Taipei. You can't go wrong listening to her.

263
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,090
Is it you? Thank you very much.

264
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,460
It's nothing.

265
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,560
Didn't you faint from a heatstroke yesterday? Are you feeling better now?

266
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,060
I also have some questions related to insurance. Can I ask you?

267
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,830
I also ran into some insurance disputes last time.

268
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,890
I wonder if you can help me, too.

269
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,730
My son is getting married. Do you have any investment tips that can help me save more money?

270
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,460
- Please.
- Please.

271
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,380
- Don't rush. Let's take turns, one at a time. No rush.
- All right.

272
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,910
You Fu! You Fu!

273
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,620
Why are you walking so fast? Are you rushing home to see Miss Cho?

274
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,820
No.

275
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,590
No? It's so obvious. It's not like she'll disappear.

276
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,670
You Fu! You Fu!

277
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,560
- What is it?
- Something happened to your wife at the Farmers' Association.

278
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,770
Oh.

279
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,260
Farmers' Association

280
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,080
Does everyone think there's more coverage if the premium is higher?

281
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,460
Actually, it is not true.

282
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,440
It's not true that the higher the premium, the higher the coverage.

283
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,060
Some people think it's a waste if they buy insurance and not use it.

284
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,930
Wrong! Insurance companies are not charitable entities.

285
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,730
In order to ensure the capital repayment, the coverage is lower.

286
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,510
Then there's the situation of a high premium but low coverage.

287
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,700
- Then the cause and effect are reversed.
- So that's how it is.

288
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,630
I brought over my policy. Can you help me take a look?

289
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,390
I brought over my whole family's. Look at mine first.

290
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,110
Wait, wait! Line up and one at a time. Don't cut in line.

291
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,720
Line up. Me first.

292
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,290
Line up well.

293
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,330
A'Hsin, it looks like there's nothing here for us to do.

294
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,230
We can go back.

295
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,520
Where did A'Hsin go?

296
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,060
A'Hsin? He ran home to get his policy.

297
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,640
I talked too much. I'm very thirsty.

298
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,750
Boss, give me another one.

299
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,590
I think you spoke really well just now.

300
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,380
I originally thought you wouldn't be used to the countryside.

301
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,290
However, seeing what you did for the villagers today,

302
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:43,120
I guess nothing can really stand in your way.

303
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:49,620
Do you still remember what I said to you on our first arranged date?

304
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,520
Whether I'm helping a customer with 500,000 or 50 million in assets,

305
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,220
the handling fee is always 1%.

306
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,130
If it were you, how would you choose?

307
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,070
- Five hundred million?
- That's right.

308
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,440
Most people would choose five hundred million.

309
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,470
But in my view, those with less savings

310
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,210
are the ones who really need financial planning to change their life.

311
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,150
I will never forget those customers,

312
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,610
the sincere smiles on their faces,

313
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,840
and the warmth of their hands.

314
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,760
I really enjoy helping investors with small capital.

315
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,860
Ever since I was promoted to be the vice president,

316
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,470
it's been a long time since I faced these front-line customers.

317
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,330
Hearing their troubles and needs,

318
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,180
I seem to regain the passion I had in the beginning.

319
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,330
There are many people who need me here.

320
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,820
I have finally found something I could do here.

321
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,300
What do you want to do here?

322
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,170
I've thought it through already.

323
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,140
The first thing is

324
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,050
to help the people here gain a basic understanding,

325
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,530
whether it's in regards to investment or insurance, as long as I have the knowledge.

326
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,640
Next, the second step is...

327
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,310
I should just go back and directly write a proposal.

328
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,170
Maybe I can collaborate with the Farmers' Association.

329
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,150
You indeed can shine anywhere.

330
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,090
You make me sound like Guan Yin (Bodhisattva of Compassion).

331
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,160
You are a bodhisattva who can do anything.

332
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,660
But you are not suited to do farm work.

333
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,510
You are also not suitable for working under the sun.

334
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,340
If you dare to mention that again, you'll be doomed.

335
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,760
Please come inside to take a look.

336
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,630
I don't think this layout here is very suitable for a hair salon.

337
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,980
I feel like this wall has to be taken down.

338
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,170
But that would be another expense.

339
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,700
Also, look there.

340
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,850
This entrance is inside an alley.

341
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,210
How inconvenient would it be for customers to come in and out?

342
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,590
I think we can look some more to find a more suitable place.

343
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
We'll keep looking then.

344
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,640
Sorry, we'll keep looking.

345
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,230
Thanks.

346
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

347
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,030
Hello.

348
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,490
I found a very good place and want to show you.

349
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,670
- Okay. Show me.
- Look.

350
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,390
This would be the customers' waiting area.

351
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,090
Then this is the rest area.

352
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,240
Here, we could have hair styling stations. We can put a few here.

353
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,560
Would it be too crowded to put there? Is there room for two?

354
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,880
This will be the counter's place.

355
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,490
- It's near the noodle shop.
- You can walk to work.

356
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,250
- The transportation is also convenient here.
- I think it looks good.

357
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:41,070
But maybe we should keep looking to see if there's a more suitable one.

358
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,750
One, two, three.

359
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,380
It's cute.

360
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,430
The lighting is very good.

361
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,960
♫ Easily, you overturn gravity ♫

362
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,580
♫ I can only drift about the path where your footprints were once left ♫

363
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,960
♫ The world starts anew after a rain ♫

364
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,620
♫ This time, I'll no longer hate summer ♫

365
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,130
♫ Can't you see? ♫

366
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,820
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

367
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,550
♫ Permit me to become a devoted pilgrim ♫

368
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,700
♫ Who sets out to kiss you ♫

369
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,180
♫ Can't you see? ♫

370
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,820
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

371
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,220
♫ Like a panicky amateur player ♫

372
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,600
♫ It's just that the bargaining chip on the table is me ♫

373
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,860
Yes!

374
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,770
Let me. Thanks.

375
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,600
It's not that much. I can get it.

376
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,800
You should save the money for the opening of the shop.

377
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,910
I insist because you are my girlfriend,

378
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,660
not my older sister.

379
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,200
Thanks.

380
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,180
My boyfriend was so manly just now.

381
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,130
I've always been this way.

382
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,600
- Is that so?
- Haven't I been?

383
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,210
Then can I ask you a question?

384
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,480
- What's the question?
- You are about to open your shop very soon.

385
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,750
Can your girlfriend give you a present for the opening of your shop?

386
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,240
Sure.

387
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
Wait.

388
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,900
What do you want to gift me?

389
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,690
J-Just something small, a small gift.

390
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,990
It's to celebrate the opening.

391
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,830
You won't say it, so something is not right.

392
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,840
What exactly do you want to gift me? Tell me, or I'll reject it.

393
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,260
I-It really is a very small, very tiny, very little thing.

394
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,160
Why do you keep asking?

395
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,060
Don't I know you well? Are you going to tell me or not?

396
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,450
If you don't say, I'll bite you.

397
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,410
Okay, I'll tell you.

398
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,370
I ordered one washing station.

399
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,570
- No, that's too expensive.
- Wait, wait!

400
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,700
I did it for you and me both.

401
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,130
In the future, won't I be the one who goes to your shop the most often to get her hair washed?

402
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,630
I want to get my hair washed in the chair that I selected myself. Is that not okay?

403
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,720
It's still not okay.

404
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,660
Then how about you pay me back in installments?

405
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,740
Okay, how many installments? Three or six?

406
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,110
It has a constant temperature massage, and it's imported from Japan.

407
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:55,900
If you don't wash my hair a hundred times, you surely won't pay it off.

408
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,980
You're clearly playing tricks with me.

409
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,130
If you keep bargaining, I'm going to increase it to one hundred and fifty washes.

410
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,070
You clearly know that you are my biggest weakness.

411
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,540
It's a deal then.

412
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,810
Do you really want your hair washed every day?

413
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,680
How about three times a day?

414
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,310
Five times?

415
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,080
Hsin Hsin Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic

416
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,580
Can you hear it? It's the heartbeat of the fetus.

417
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,440
The heartbeat is very strong. The baby is very healthy.

418
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,090
Oh, right, Doctor.

419
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,120
She has been throwing up whatever she eats. Is this normal?

420
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,630
Don't be nervous. Pregnancy nausea is very normal.

421
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,450
Just eat whatever you feel like. If you don't want to eat, don't force it either.

422
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,010
Basically, whatever the mother eats in the first three months, the fetus won't absorb that much yet.

423
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,450
Not absorb that much? Where does the baby get its nutrients then?

424
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,800
When the fetus is developing well, it means the embryo itself has good overall nutrition, to begin with.

425
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,570
Would one checkup a month be too long in between?

426
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,810
That's right! What if something happens within that month?

427
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,410
How would we know if the fetus is healthy during the month?

428
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,750
Hey, you two.

429
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,500
Do you want to scare away my doctor?

430
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,800
It's fine. It's fine.

431
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,330
This is for you to send to your parents.

432
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,580
I want them to participate in the baby's growth process.

433
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,650
Will it work?

434
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,620
The me in the past would definitely want to say,

435
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,560
"If ties are severed, then fine. It would give me some peace and quiet anyway."

436
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,280
However, suppose Little Pearl tells us one day,

437
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,270
"If ties are severed, then fine. It would give me some peace and quiet anyway."

438
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,780
How will you feel?

439
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:14,200
Dad, Mom, this is a photo of your grandchild.

440
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,210
I hope you will protect the child with us as we watch him grow up.

441
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,100
They'll be very happy to receive it.

442
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,600
What about your parents? Aren't you going to tell them about such a big event as a pregnancy?

443
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,120
Mark and I can go with you to visit them.

444
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,230
No need. Please don't be a busybody. Thanks.

445
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,080
Do you really not need us to go with you?

446
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,550
Really.

447
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,940
When I was very young, my mom left our home.

448
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,800
My dad always gets into trouble. I actually don't want him to find me.

449
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,390
The only person that I can rely on in this world

450
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,160
is probably Yan Fei.

451
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,120
What kind of nonsense are you saying? There's also us.

452
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,430
There's also the baby.

453
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:14,200
We are your family. We will support you unconditionally.

454
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,170
No matter what happens.

455
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,160
We will also be your cheerleaders and cheer for you.

456
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,700
Really? You said it.

457
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,500
I recorded it all, so you can't go back on your words.

458
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,330
You will definitely find your happiness.

459
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,600
If you want to go on a date in the future, don't worry about the child. Ou Wen will be there.

460
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,610
If anyone dares to mistreat you, don't worry. I'll be there.

461
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,440
- What's wrong?
- You should forget it.

462
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,830
You can't fight as well as I do.

463
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,210
I drank too much that time.

464
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,640
Don't forget I've won a national championship in weight squatting.

465
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,460
What does squatting have to do with fighting?

466
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,720
- How are they unrelated?
- They are not related at all.

467
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,260
Enough. Enough.

468
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,110
Thanks to you both.

469
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,760
Here. Jia Jia, be careful. The soup-soup is hot-hot.

470
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,560
- Call Mom to come down and eat.
- Mom is here.

471
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,450
- Are you done?
- Rui Rui fell asleep.

472
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,250
Let's eat, let's eat.

473
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,790
Is Hsuan Yu not coming back for dinner?

474
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,490
His shop is opening tomorrow. He probably won't make it back tonight.

475
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,790
Lately, I've been busy taking care of Rui Rui. I haven't had the time to care for him.

476
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,970
Don't worry. He's someone whose shop is opening tomorrow.

477
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,290
Don't worry.

478
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,120
The night before the grand opening is always the busiest.

479
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,890
Take some food over later. We can't help him with the opening of his shop,

480
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,020
but we can't let him go hungry, right?

481
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,660
Who was the one that said he's no longer a child?

482
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,150
If he's hungry, he can just order takeout for himself.

483
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:32,310
What's important is not eating. It's showing your concern.

484
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,270
You're wasting your role as an older brother.

485
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,890
Later, personally bring some food to him. While you are there, give him some words of encouragement.

486
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,290
Shouldn't you?

487
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,680
Look. Do you like it?

488
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,990
I like it.

489
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,780
But you really didn't need to spend this much money.

490
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,850
I'm not spending my money in vain.

491
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:07,330
Don't forget. You still have to help me wash my hair a hundred times.

492
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,780
Your hair has long been mine to care for.

493
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,530
Will you only take care of my hair?

494
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,280
Your life has also long been mine to care for.

495
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,630
♫ Always be with you ♫

496
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,960
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise... ♫

497
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,850
♫ Always be with you ♫

498
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:50,130
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile...  ♫

499
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:55,590
Look. Do you like it?

500
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,710
I like it.

501
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,590
But you really didn't need to spend this much money.

502
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,520
I'm not spending my money in vain.

503
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,260
Don't forget. You still have to help me wash my hair a hundred times.

504
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,470
Your hair has long been mine to care for.

505
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,190
Will you only take care of my hair?

506
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,970
Your life has also long been mine to care for.

507
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:35,440
Wang Hsuan Yu, where did you learn to say such disgusting words?

508
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,010
When I see Mark say things like these to girls,

509
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,760
they are always very happy.

510
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,760
Okay. Then reality proves that being Wang Hsuan Yu suits you best.

511
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,180
I didn't think the shop would be opening so quickly.

512
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,770
Without you, my dream wouldn't have come true so quickly.

513
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,930
Then what about you?

514
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,990
What?

515
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,940
What is your dream?

516
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,200
Is "Love Is Science" your dream?

517
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:51,730
A long time ago, my dream was to marry a prince

518
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,910
and then be the world's happiest bride.

519
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:01,980
But you know what happened later on.

520
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,080
No worries.

521
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,880
Although there's no prince, you can still be the world's happiest bride—

522
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,980
No, no, no.

523
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,970
That was my dream when I was young and inexperienced.

524
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,040
It has long been tossed into the trash.

525
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,490
Then what is your current dream?

526
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,650
A current dream?

527
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,310
I really haven't thought about it before.

528
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,300
Thank you.

529
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:02,790
I think it's time for me to turn around and properly take care of myself.

530
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:07,350
Start with your dream.

531
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,590
Start with my dream.

532
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,800
This... Ju Yueh Noodle Shop's loving dinner is here.

533
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,230
Hsuan Yang. Are you here?

534
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,280
I remember I still have some things to do at the office.

535
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,330
I'll head back to work first.

536
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,330
Let's eat together.

537
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,840
What?

538
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,890
I know I speak very obliviously. But we were classmates after all.

539
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,470
Or do you still mind?

540
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,700
I mind? Why would I? I'm not that kind of person.

541
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,060
My heart is even wider

542
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,210
than your body. Okay?

543
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,610
We agreed not to discuss my body.

544
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,120
Let's eat together.

545
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,530
Let's eat.

546
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,650
Alley No. 29 Hair Salon - Opening Celebration

547
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,730
- Hsuan Yu.
- Hi!
- Long time no see!

548
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,380
Hi! Thank you.

549
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,340
- Congratulations. Congratulations on the grand opening!
- Thank you.

550
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,700
Brother!
[Come in]

551
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,930
- Congratulations!
- Come and give me a hug.

552
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:17,060
But take it slower.

553
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,160
- For you.
- Why are you being so formal?

554
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,110
Seeing you with your own shop, I'm very touched and jealous.

555
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:29,670
You're also about to enter the next chapter of your life. You're going to be a dad.

556
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,580
Oh, speaking of that, you can't run away from being the godfather.

557
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,760
Prepare your red envelopes.

558
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,830
Little Pearl. Your godmother is right here.

559
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,790
In the future, go to your godmother for red envelopes and allowances.

560
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:46,720
I feel like the two of you are just faking your congratulations. You're really here to rake in money.

561
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,600
Are we? Ask for more.

562
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,350
Okay, okay. Take Little Pearl inside. Hurry.

563
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,730
Go in first.

564
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,460
- Hsuan Yu!
- Hsiao Yu!
- Older Brother. Sister-in-law.

565
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,690
- Thank you.
- Seeing your shop for the first time makes me so proud!

566
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,660
Hey! Don't steal what I wanted to say.

567
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,650
Hsuan Yu.

568
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,630
- I, as your brother, am very proud.
- Thanks, Brother.

569
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,400
Come in and take a look.

570
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:32,110
♫ I'll live out my beautiful life. Life may be a bit frustrating ♫

571
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:37,160
♫ Dreams can also be very sweet. Among a noisy crowd, I give myself some space ♫

572
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,060
♫ Right now, I want to vent my feelings, sing and dance for a whole night ♫

573
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:47,000
♫ Before tomorrow, I'll live out my beautiful life ♫

574
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,220
♫ I'll live out my beautiful life ♫

575
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:10,110
Alley No. 29 Hair Salon

576
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,270
- Hsuan Yu!
- Hsuan Yu!

577
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,550
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

578
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,360
A new shop.

579
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,250
I can't believe our Hsuan Yu really opened his own store.

580
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,800
It's like my youngest son is getting married. I'm so happy!

581
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,770
Hey! Why are you crying? It's such a happy occasion. How unlucky.

582
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:36,290
Seeing you so happy makes me feel like opening this shop was worth it.

583
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,790
Hsuan Yu. Are you open?

584
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,660
- We want to be your first group of customers!
- Really?

585
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,680
Okay, take a seat!

586
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:49,430
You first. I'll wait on the side.

587
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:54,030
- Okay. Then we'll go first. Sorry.
- We'll go first.

588
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,580
This way, please.

589
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,870
Older Sisters, my apologies. The store is a bit small.

590
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,400
- No worries.
- Don't worry.

591
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,170
Being next to each other makes it easier to chat anyway.

592
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,580
That's right! Later, when it's Sister Lo's turn,

593
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,700
won't we still have to wait for her?

594
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,760
- That's right.
- It's fine.
- In the waiting area, we have tablets for you to use.

595
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,380
If you'd like to watch a movie, catch up on a drama,

596
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,130
or play a game, it's all up to you. Would you like coffee or tea today?

597
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:24,030
We also have macaroons. You can give it a try to see if it suits your taste.

598
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:29,000
You are Hsuan Yu's girlfriend, right?

599
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,760
Hello, I'm Yan Fei.

600
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,580
Wow. A girlfriend.

601
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,860
- So pretty!
- Thank you.

602
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,490
- Hsuan Yu, when are you getting married?
- No.

603
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,130
Hurry, hurry, hurry! You have to get married soon so you can have children sooner!

604
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,770
That's right. That's right.

605
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:50,760
You must have at least four babies. Don't waste your good genes.

606
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,870
The owner of this store is a hairstylist who is a long-term partner of Love Is Science.

607
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,550
Everyone praises his styling. You will be satisfied for sure.

608
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,490
Welcome!

609
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,790
I think you should select some new clothes first.

610
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:15,540
With the framework of a new style, it would be easier to pick a new hairstyle.

611
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,820
That's right. That's a good point.

612
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,800
Then my apologies. Let's go this way.

613
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,880
Love is Science Marriage Agency

614
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,010
I want to switch back to the previous salon.

615
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:53,560
But the hair stylist is the same person. His professional capabilities haven't changed, only the location did.

616
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,410
The interior changed so much.

617
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:59,870
Are you trying to save money? Clearly, the previous store is more high-end.

618
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:03,390
But I remember that you previously liked your hair style done by this hair stylist.

619
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:07,990
He's not bad, but the space is too small. He keeps asking me to wait.

620
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,320
Trying so hard to persuade me,

621
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,990
could it be that you are taking a commission from him?

622
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,190
- Of course not!
- Of course not!

623
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,630
Okay. Then next time,

624
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:23,530
I want to switch back to the previous store. That's all.

625
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,190
- All right. We're leaving.
- Good luck!

626
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,720
We support you!

627
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,790
I'm sorry there isn't enough space. You always wait so long.

628
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,540
Don't worry. Don't worry. We'll still come.

629
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,310
Bye bye. We will come back next time. Bye!

630
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,850
- Thank you. Thank you!
- Bye!
- Take care.

631
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,520
Yunlin's coffee beans are really not bad.

632
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,430
It tastes so much better than Voodoo's.

633
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,930
Brother Chang Ching.

634
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,340
Oh my gosh!

635
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,800
♫ Always be with you ♫

636
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:05,330
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile...  ♫

637
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,550
Yunlin's coffee beans are really not bad.

638
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,500
It tastes so much better than Voodoo's.

639
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,010
Brother Chang Ching.

640
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,380
Oh my gosh!

641
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,370
Is this the store you wanted to open?

642
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,620
For this type of store, you gave up on Voodoo

643
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,190
and were unwilling to go to Royal Taipei.

644
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,400
You're even more of a disappointment than I thought.

645
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,590
I used to have such high regard for you.

646
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,960
I admit I was blind.

647
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,680
I even thought, would it be possible that I was wrong?

648
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,520
After seeing your shop, I finally understand

649
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,200
that the one who is wrong isn't me. It's you!

650
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,140
Ignore his foul mouth.

651
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,660
What's the big deal?

652
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:17,180
What's the big deal of getting into Royal Taipei...

653
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,420
It's indeed quite a big deal.

654
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,360
But you have your own goals.

655
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,570
What's wrong with this store? I think it's great!

656
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:33,840
At least the coffee is much better than Voodoo's.

657
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:38,680
Brother, don't worry about it. I support you.

658
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,360
Okay. Who wants to speak?

659
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:24,030
Boss. There are already clients who say they want to return to Voodoo for their hair styling.

660
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:28,420
I asked our members if there were any areas that Hsuan Yu needed to improve on.

661
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,190
They said that there were no problems with his skills,

662
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,410
just that the space is a bit small.

663
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,150
The interior decoration is a bit crude.

664
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,040
Sometimes, even with a scheduled appointment, they still have to wait for a long time.

665
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,620
Then arrange appointments with Voodoo's hairstylists for them.

666
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,290
- What?
- What?

667
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:50,500
Since members have requests, we should respect them.

668
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,680
Those who prefer Voodoo can continue to go there.

669
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,560
I also believe that there are clients

670
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,840
who see value in Hsuan Yu outside of the decor.

671
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,680
As the boss, he also needs to find ways to solve his problems.

672
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,500
- We understand.
- Okay.

673
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,340
Brother Sheng. Just now, the bridal shop called,

674
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,180
saying there was a problem regarding Miss Chu and Mr. An.

675
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,890
- Miss Yan.
- Mr. An.

676
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,890
Mr. An. What is the situation with Miss Chu now?

677
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:24,620
She locked herself in the dressing room and won't let me in.

678
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,710
I really didn't do this on purpose.

679
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,420
I don't know why but whenever I hear "congratulations"

680
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,060
or words related to happiness,

681
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,150
I feel very irritated.

682
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,660
My mood is especially bad.

683
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,490
I know.

684
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,770
I have no reason to be angry.

685
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,770
But I just can't stop myself from getting angry.

686
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,830
Miss Chu. Are you feeling

687
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,840
regretful for having accepted his proposal?

688
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,630
I really can't think of anything that might have happened.

689
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:23,550
I'm not sure if it's from all the preparations for the wedding recently

690
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:26,960
that has caused Li Li to become quieter.

691
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:31,880
Also, her mood swings have been quite drastic lately.

692
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,680
It's gamophobia (fear of marriage commitment).

693
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,570
What?

694
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:40,750
Marriage could be causing Miss Chu to fear for the future.

695
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,210
We previously had members with this type of condition. It's quite common.

696
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,150
I advise you to chat with Miss Chu.

697
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:00,550
I admit. I do have some signs of gamophobia.

698
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:05,520
But what's holding me back is that I feel like there is still something missing

699
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,950
between Anthony and me.

700
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,290
Missing a bit of what?

701
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:13,590
Missing a bit of...

702
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:18,020
passion (literally: feeling of a frantic heartbeat).

703
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:23,260
"Passion?"

704
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,940
We are not selling that. Does she not understand the situation?

705
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:32,400
We're trying to help her find a marriage partner. We're not playing a game of heart signals.

706
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,270
They dated for three years before deciding to get married.

707
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:40,100
We can tell that it is a decision they came to after careful consideration.

708
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,520
Furthermore, their compatibility rate is 95%.

709
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,750
The process also went very smoothly. Did Miss Chu say anything else?

710
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:51,940
Did she want us to help her turn down the marriage proposal?

711
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,090
She didn't say she didn't want to get married.

712
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,630
Then at least, it's not the worst-case scenario.

713
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:02,790
Should we help them arrange a marriage consultant?

714
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,730
Consult about what? The most important thing right now

715
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,990
should be helping them create some romantic situations to help them

716
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:12,330
reignite their fiery passion.

717
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,240
Oh, is that right? Then what about this?

718
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,590
We arrange for Miss Chu to go skydiving.

719
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:19,400
Then purposely let her get stuck in a tree. Next, we'll have Mr. An dress up

720
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,750
as a North Korean officer to save the damsel in distress (from K-drama "Crash Landing on You").

721
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,240
What about this? Love on a deserted island.

722
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,700
Once the entire world is left with a single man and single woman, we have them stranded

723
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,810
on Keelung Islet together. We'll let them enjoy multiple days of passion.

724
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:39,440
How great! Then should I help you check if Miss Chu has any heart disease or high blood pressure?

725
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,530
If she can even go skydiving, or should I check how to even get onto Keelung Islet?

726
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,560
Wow. Then I have to inconvenience you.

727
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,820
Not at all. It's not an inconvenience at all.

728
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,250
That's not impossible.

729
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,000
After all, marriage is a serious matter.

730
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,790
Anything that could help can be attempted.

731
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,950
More importantly, you two should first write the proposal.

732
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:04,000
I'll go speak to Mr. An and Miss Chu.

733
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,030
- All right.
- Okay.

734
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,750
Go on.

735
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,500
Alley No. 29 Hair Salon

736
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,470
Come on.

737
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,820
The damage to your hair is a bit serious.

738
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:35,560
I recommend a thirty-minute hair treatment. Are you in a rush?

739
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:40,400
I'm not in a rush. But do you have time?

740
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:03,690
♫ Always be with you ♫

743
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,550
Come on.

744
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,780
The damage to your hair is a bit serious.

745
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:28,590
I recommend a thirty-minute hair treatment. Are you in a rush?

746
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:33,390
I'm not in a rush. But do you have time?

747
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,190
Sorry, my salon is a bit small and it's only me working, so—

748
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,250
Give me a second.

749
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,740
It's done.

750
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,280
So many people.

751
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,250
We've been waiting for too long.

752
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,960
Leave it to me. Just go take care of the customers you were already attending to.

753
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,790
All right. I just applied a conditioning treatment on her.

754
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,730
Hey. Find some time to eat your breakfast.

755
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,340
I'm sorry about that. This way, please.

756
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,500
Give me a second. I will go wash my hands.

757
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,610
Just one minute. I will go get the conditioning treatment.

758
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,230
I'm sorry. Please wait a bit.

759
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,910
Alley No. 29 Hair Salon

760
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,030
Wow.

761
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,400
It's so late now.

762
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,800
Come in, we are open

763
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,210
Let's go eat first. I'll return later to clean up.
Sorry, we are closed.

764
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:05,450
Thank you. If it weren't for you today, I don't know how late I would stay.

765
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,100
Now you know how nice I am to you. I won't go easy on you during dinner tonight.

766
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:15,400
Of course. I'll buy you anything you want to eat or drink.

767
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,320
Awesome!

768
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,680
Being a boss is just different. I'm so hungry.

769
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,540
I'm so hungry, I can smell food in the air.

770
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:31,210
The French restaurant is closed, and the steakhouse is also closed.

771
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:35,970
The Japanese bar is full, and there's no spot at the seafood place.

772
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,800
I'm starving to death.

773
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,810
Okay. Let's just go to my house then. I will make noodles for you.

774
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:44,260
I'll also add braised dishes and beers.

775
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,560
That's more like it.

776
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,570
I think it's not bad.

777
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:52,720
- That's right.
- I've never had this style before. I'm not used to it.

778
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,510
That's right. The curls are so cute.

779
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:58,520
Sister Liu. Sister Chao.

780
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,440
Hsuan Hsuan.

781
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:05,930
- Such a coincidence.
-W-We are touring the island tomorrow.

782
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:10,780
We need to leave early in the morning so we got our hair done in a rush.

783
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:15,160
That's right. We didn't have much time this time. When we have more time,

784
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,250
- we will definitely go support you.
- That's right, that's right!

785
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:23,780
It's all right. I understand. There's only me in the salon so I get too busy.

786
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,330
- That's right. That's right.
- Exactly.

787
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,020
You need to find someone to help you as soon as possible.

788
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,470
- Right?
- That's true.

789
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,300
- I will.
- As soon as you can.

790
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,800
Do you all want to get home early to rest? You have to wake up early tomorrow.

791
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,640
That's right! We'll get going then.

792
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,820
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.
- Goodbye.

793
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,740
Bye bye.

794
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,910
They are really disloyal.

795
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:49,110
Resigning from your job for the customers is really not worth it.

796
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:53,570
Don't be like this. It is true that we don't have enough workers at my shop.

797
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:56,980
There's no way to serve three customers at a time.

798
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,190
Let's go. I'll make noodles for you.

799
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,490
This is for you.

800
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,170
Drink a bit with me.

801
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:33,160
Let me tell you.

802
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,970
Don't give it too much thought because this problem can't be solved.

803
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,380
It's like looking for penguins in the north pole.

804
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,590
Looking for passion at a marriage agency

805
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,600
is a mistake as it's the wrong location.

806
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,920
You are completely right!

807
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,350
Furthermore, at our age,

808
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:56,990
the butterflies in our stomachs have all died already.

809
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:02,410
Having passion is harder than getting an orgasm. I want to feel the passion as well.

810
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:08,300
"Passion."

811
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:18,320
Before, I thought that passion would be fiery.

812
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:24,460
But Hsuan Yu often makes me feel passion.

813
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,520
That's what is called "Comparison makes a difference."

814
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,540
Wait.

815
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:49,500
I thought of a way to resolve the problem between Miss Chu and Mr. An.

816
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:08,340
♫ Always be with you ♫

817
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:19,830
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile...  ♫

818
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:27,670
Piggy's Love Diary

819
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:43,880
Isn't that the convenience store owner's daughter?

820
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,260
Is she the type of girl you like?

821
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,330
No!

822
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:51,370
I like... girls with long legs.

823
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,580
Long hair, too.

824
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:56,160
Older sisters who are very beautiful!

825
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,710
Clearly, she's the type you like.

826
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,570
Then what type of boys do you like?

827
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:08,380
Me? I like someone who's tall, handsome,

828
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:11,480
and a bit like an overbearing CEO.

829
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,840
He knows how to create surprises and confess his love with fireworks.

830
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,930
In any case, the type you read in romance novels.

831
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:24,100
But my brother is not like an overbearing CEO.

832
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:29,920
Ever since your brother started liking the cheerleading team leader, I stopped liking boys with shallow, sunny personalities.

833
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:34,270
♫ Like a panicky amateur player ♫

834
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:38,850
♫ It's just that the bargaining chip on the table is me ♫

835
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:43,040
♫ Do you want to make a gamble? Gamble that I'll willingly lose everything to you ♫

836
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,230
♫ Besides my deeply affectionate eyes, everything else belongs to you ♫

837
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:48,700
Strange.

838
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,860
Why is Little Piggy still not here yet?

839
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:00,790
♫ I can only drift about the path where your footprints were once left ♫

840
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:04,670
♫ The world starts anew after a rain ♫

841
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:07,040
Let's go. You can do this.

842
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,630
Hi!

843
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:17,210
What are you doing, Little Piggy? You scared me!

844
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:19,400
Don't you like surprises the most?

845
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,770
How is this a surprise? This is a scare, okay?

846
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,850
Why are you dressed like this?

847
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:30,640
Don't you like the overbearing CEO type the most? Also, your favorite, fireworks!

848
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:34,070
Here.

849
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:51,630
It's so pretty.

850
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,590
So pretty.

851
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:58,060
Then... how does it feel to be an overbearing CEO?

852
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:04,070
I think being an overbearing CEO feels very warm.

853
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:09,120
Then you should just be Little Piggy.

854
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,170
Hold this for me.

855
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:17,250
♫ Permit me to become a devoted pilgrim ♫

856
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:20,660
♫ Who sets out to kiss you ♫

857

♫ Can't you see? ♫

858
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,640
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

859
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,160
♫ Like a panicky amateur player ♫

860
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,780
♫ It's just that the bargaining chip on the table ♫

861
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:40,900
Preview: We plan to set Miss Chu up with someone new.

862
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,660
What if Li Li falls in love with someone else because of the arranged dates?

863
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:47,080
- What do I do then?
- Stop obsessing over it.

864
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,370
The problem is that you are not romantic enough.

865
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:53,470
I've been hungry for many days now!

866
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:56,940
If you don't want to marry him because you got married before,

867
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,130
then it's a bit unfair to him.

868
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:03,250
You are basically punishing him for the mistakes you made in your last marriage.

869
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,850
He doesn't know how scary marriage is, but I do.

870
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:08,470
Do you think Yan Fei will say yes?

871
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:14,790
Some love can only hide in the dark.

872
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:18,660
They can't be seen or discovered.

873
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:23,830
♫  Are you planning to stop responding?  ♫

876

♫ In the end, you're so far away ♫

878
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:52,080
♫ You became a pointless, transparent existence ♫

879
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:58,190
♫ I thought it was only because I came late ♫

880
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:06,110
♫ Turned out I was the only one playing the game ♫

♫ While lonely, thinking of someone ♫

884
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:29,220
♫ He will come and warm you up ♫

♫ I think what you sometime remembered ♫

01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:40,450
♫ Is for "just in case" ♫

887
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:45,840
♫ To treat the hug you give me ♫

888
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:53,570
♫ As something to bring you warmth ♫
