1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,270
I'm at the airport. Where are you?

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,990
Let's end things here.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,100
I have the right to have

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,940
a boyfriend whose heart contains only me.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,310
I didn't deal with things well enough. I never wanted to hurt anybody.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,260
Yet on the contrary, it seems I hurt a lot of people.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,100
I hope that after leaving me, you will be happier than before.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,510
Royal Hotel's first Asian CEO,

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,260
the pride of Taiwan, Huo Yung Tai arrived in Taiwan today.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,090
Hello, Feifei. Long time no see.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,070
Mr. Huo, long time no see.

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,730
Why did he come back?

13
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,810
My hairstylist number 29, you're back!

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,370
Why did you meet up with Huo Yung Tai?
[Old flames are still the most beautiful. Huo Yung Tai and Yan Fei's secret joyous meeting at a hotel...]

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,970
You even went to "open a room" with him!

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,790
I will certainly not fall in the same hole twice!

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,010
Then do you know what you are about to face?

18
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,970
The ex.

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,250
My staying... does that make you happy?

20
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,300
I finally have you as a younger brother—

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,650
Stop calling me your younger brother!

22
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,240
But you... are younger than me.

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,550
Even so, I don't want to be your younger brother.

24
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,740
♫ I've written your name ♫

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,410

46
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,880
Love Is Science

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,700
Just order whatever you want to eat.

48
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,210
The company is paying for this. However, it is my treat.

49
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,780
Then I... won't hold back.

50
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,440
Order.

51
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,140
We're at the restaurant.
[Mark Lee: I'm in the neighborhood. Let me know when you're here.]

52
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,370
What about you?

53
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,480
- Then I will have... a fillet steak.
- All right.

54
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,170
- That's all then.
- Thank you.

55
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,130
Thank you.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,370
Just directly tell me what you want to say.

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,920
Wh-What is there for me to say?

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,280
Before, I was rarely at the company.

59
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,290
Luckily, the company has you and Sheng Ying.

60
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,020
So I want to ask what suggestions you may have for the company.

61
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,180
If you couldn't say anything to Yan Fei,

62
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,810
that's fine. You can let me, your Boss Chiao, know because from now on,

63
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,910
I will be spending a lot of time at the company.

64
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,520
Why did you suddenly decide to stay in Taiwan?

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,780
Is it because... you got a boyfriend?

66
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,770
- Ou Wen.
- Yes?

67
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,590
Could it be that you're worried...

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,130
about our company's male members?

69
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,260
Hey. Hi.

70
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,890
What a coincidence.

71
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,700
Are you two here, too?

72
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,400
That's right. Such a coincidence.

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,110
Do you mind if I join you?

74
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,360
It should be fine, right?

75
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,810
If you don't have suggestions,

76
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,750
then, of course, we can eat together.

77
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,800
You can, you can.

78
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,530
What do you want to eat?

79
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,460
I'm fine with anything.

80
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,460
Hello. Please give us a menu.

81
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,370
That person really did not change at all.

82
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,040
Good thing I'm not too shabby, either.

83
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,720
I'd better put on more lotion.

84
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,540
Very good, Yan Fei. Just like this.

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,150
Huo Yung Tai is not the only one who evolved.

86
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,820
It's been nine years now. You have become better,

87
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,260
calmer, and more mature.

88
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,840
In the face of any situation,

89
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,260
you can remain calm and logical.

90
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,200
You're Yan Fei 2.0.

91
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,910
Didn't I hire an auntie to disinfect

92
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,020
the place every month? Why are there still cockroaches that slipped in?

93
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,790
You are now Yan Fei 2.0.

94
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,860
You definitely will not be defeated by a cockroach!

95
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,070
Go die!

96
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,350
It is so disgusting! I can't do it!

97
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,720
There are still some things that can't be overcome with willpower.

98
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,490
What do I do?

99
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,300
What do I do? What should I do?

100
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,530
Do I call 1-1-9 (police)?

101
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,740
I brought lamb hot pot. Do you want to eat it?

102
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,130
What is wrong?

103
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,490
Little Piggy!

104
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,910
- The chicken is very good. Do you want some?
- No need!

105
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,950
You ordered the exact same thing as I did.

106
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,180
Hey, onions are very nutritious.

107
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,550
You need to eat your vegetables. Don't just take vitamins.

108
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,380
"Don't put the cart in front of the horse."

109
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,390
Try it.

110
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,600
Boss Chiao, didn't you ask me to introduce you to our male members?

111
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,430
I have matched you two before. The score is very high.

112
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,180
Wait. I remember that our company's entrance fee

113
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,870
- is NT$88,000 ($3182 U.S.), right?
- Yes.

114
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,300
I'm a major shareholder so that makes sense, but what about him?

115
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,890
How could you use the company's system to help him find a match?

116
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,650
If you want to find a match, that's fine.

117
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,480
Pay NT$88,000 first.

118
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,950
Or do you want to pay the fee for him?

119
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,820
I was saying... horoscope suitability.

120
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,230
I read in a book that Sagittarius

121
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,820
falls in love at first sight with Gemini.

122
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,980
I think it is very accurate!

123
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Plus these two horoscopes have great social skills,

124
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,170
and they both love to be free, right?

125
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,850
That's right. You are very correct.

126
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,270
Since we both love our freedom,

127
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,550
can you let me be free?

128
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,250
You can just make a friend.

129
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,070
You two can first go to the gym together.

130
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,400
Or go to a nightclub! Having someone accompany you is safer.

131
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,020
That's right, someone to accompany you.

132
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,660
Who brings a "bento" with them when they go out to play?

133
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,920
I slipped.

134
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,890
Sorry, sorry.

135
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,720
Th-There on the ground.

136
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,640
It might have run out.

137
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,690
I brought lamb hotpot. You go eat first. I will look for it a bit.

138
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,360
No, let's eat together.

139
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,270
Just now, I happened to see it

140
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,270
so I wore it for fun.

141
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,720
Wait a second.

142
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,680
By the way, I happen to have something to show you.

143
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,250
Let's go.

144
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,760
Let me show you something.

145
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,510
Sit!

146
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:18,420
Guess what this is.

147
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,860
- Did you still keep it?
- Yes!

148
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,150
Of course, I kept it!

149
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,150
You had used up your entire savings to buy it for me back then. How could I throw it away?

150
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,270
There's also this! I took a closer look at your love letter.

151
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,170
What you wrote is way too exaggerated.

152
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,900
For example, you wrote how the first time you met me, I accidentally knocked your ice cream down,

153
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,650
and you immediately fell in love with me.

154
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,990
It wasn't exaggerated. It is the truth.

155
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,960
I don't believe you!

156
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,350
I already liked you at that time.

157
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,390
You were still a young child back then!

158
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,840
Then how about now?

159
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,920
What do you mean now?

160
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,890
Can I... like you now?

161
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,380
I...

162
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,100
The content of the love letter... is very touching.

163
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:24,580
If you had given it to me earlier, I might have said, "I'm willing."

164
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,180
♫ That day, I flipped through all the books ♫

165
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,800
♫ I love you yet still can't say why ♫

166
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,320
♫ The straight line belongs to men, the curved one to god (Antoni Gaudi) ♫

167
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,890
♫ And perhaps my existence pertains to you ♫

168
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,440
♫ Can't you see? ♫

169
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,070
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

170
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,790
♫ Permit me to become a devoted pilgrim ♫

171
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,990
♫ Who sets out to kiss you ♫

172
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,530
♫ Can't you see? ♫

173
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,970
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

174
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,540
♫ Like a panicky amateur player ♫

175
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,830
♫ It's just that the bargaining chip on the table is me ♫

176
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,100
Cockroach! Cockroach! Cockroach! Cockroach!

177
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,830
Let me kill it!

178
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,020
Hello?

179
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,870
This is she.

180
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,560
Did my mom faint?

181
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,460
You're the one who told Mark where we're eating today, right?

182
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,460
Sorry.

183
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,260
Sorry? Yet you still did this to me?

184
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,850
Mark... is a very good person.

185
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,390
Even though he looks a bit oblivious,

186
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,030
he is actually very considerate.

187
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,400
Even though he can be a bit reckless sometimes,

188
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,730
he is very loyal.

189
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,030
He is willing to sacrifice himself and do everything for his friends.

190
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,360
I...

191
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,430
I hope you can give him a chance.

192
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,730
You like him, don't you?

193
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,680
You like him, yet you're helping him pursue me?

194
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,320
Tai Ou Wen! Is your head flooded with water?

195
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,920
He likes women. This is not something that I can change by working hard.

196
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,990
His liking women is the same as how I don't like him.

197
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,270
Both can't be changed by working hard.

198
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,530
- You can—
- I can't!

199
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,450
You clearly know that I don't want to settle down.

200
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,360
You are not helping him. You are harming him.

201
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,700
Okay, I will let it pass this time.

202
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,290
But you can't do this next time.

203
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,270
Please don't let him use you to get close to me.

204
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,400
You don't need to stoop so low to love a person.

205
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,980
No matter how much you love that person, you cannot wreck yourself for the relationship to work.

206
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,460
I understand.

207
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,260
Why are you following me?

208
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,190
Give me back my purse!

209
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,570
I can go home myself! You don't need to accompany me.

210
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Madame is inside.

211
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,940
Why are you here?

212
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,830
Mom was eating with me when she started to feel unwell and had trouble breathing.

213
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,660
Why did you not send my mom to the hospital if she's not feeling well?

214
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,140
It's not that I didn't want to take her there. Mom insisted on not going to the hospital.

215
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,410
She said she will be fine as long as she rests for a bit.

216
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,840
Let me go see her first.

217
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,630
Mom! I'm here.

218
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,400
Have we met before?

219
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,600
No.

220
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,680
Are you still feeling unwell?

221
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,330
Can you hear me?

222
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,170
Get up! Stop acting!

223
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,950
- Are you still acting?
- It's painful!

224
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,610
That hurts! That hurts!

225
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,540
That really hurts! You shifted all the facial injections I just got!

226
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,920
Why did you lie to me?

227
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,090
That's your fault for not answering my calls.

228
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,600
I don't need to answer your calls to know what you're going to say.

229
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,160
What was I going to say then?

230
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,270
Let me just tell you directly.

231
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,130
Huo Yung Tai and I are game over, okay?

232
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,360
I'm single because of my skills, not because of him. It's the same for him, too.

233
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,780
No, no, no! It's not the same for him. He's single for you.

234
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,130
No, no, no!

235
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,560
During these past nine years after our divorce, he has been dating different girlfriends nonstop.

236
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,870
He's trying to find your shadow among those girls.

237
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,260
Find my shadow? That's a bunch of cr*p.

238
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,890
How are they similar to me?

239
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,750
See! That's why they all broke up.

240
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,810
It's because he couldn't find your shadow.

241
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:18,190
Then why hasn't he asked a single thing about me these past nine years, but now he suddenly returns?

242
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,370
When we exchanged greetings, he always asked about you.

243
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:29,520
Although the first thing he does when he returns to Taiwan is to have a meal with his ex-mother-in-law...

244
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,180
But all we talked about was what recently happened to you.

245
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,000
Even though Yung Tai seems uncaring from the outside,

246
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,400
he is actually very worried for you.

247
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,150
Think about it.

248
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:53,230
Why did he specifically choose to open a hotel in Taiwan when he won the award?

249
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:59,220
There's only one reason. It is because of you.

250
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,970
Are you back?

251
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,120
Are you feeling okay?

252
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,210
You have a fever!

253
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,880
Why didn't you tell me you're sick?

254
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,550
You didn't answer your phone.

255
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,320
Oh... Sorry.

256
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,070
There's a big fire in California and it is causing a delay to our entire hotel project.

257
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,720
All our employees had to work overtime until now.

258
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,410
Did you take medicine?

259
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,920
I finished all the medicine already. There's no more left.

260
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,610
I originally wanted to ask you to buy some on the way home.

261
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,460
Okay. No problem! Sleep a bit more.

262
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,530
I will take you to the hospital later.

263
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,590
Rest up, okay?

264
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,970
Hello?

265
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,660
No! No!

266
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,150
Listen to me!

267
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,480
We cannot afford any...

268
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,050
What's wrong?

269
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,340
Fei.

270
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,880
- I have to leave right after I finish taking a shower.
- What?

271
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,240
I have to fly over to California later today.

272
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,480
Then wh-what about me?

273
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,390
Don't worry! I will ask our neighbor to send food over the next few days for you to eat.

274
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,000
But I've never talked to our neighbor before.

275
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,700
Her name is Jenny. Jenny. This is her phone number.

276
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,140
If you need any help, just call her.

277
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,660
Do you understand?

278
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,500
But...

279
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm scared.

280
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,310
Don't be scared. I'll be back very soon. Okay? I have to leave now.

281
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:29,380
At that time, you both were very young so you two surely weren't able to handle things maturely.

282
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,770
But it's different now! You two are all grown up now.

283
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,070
Both of your careers are also on track. Come on!

284
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,450
All those problems in the past

285
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,520
don't exist anymore.

286
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,420
The person you are facing now is no longer the Huo Yung Tai from back then,

287
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,500
but the evolved Huo Yung Tai, version 2.0.

288
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,030
If you are not mentally prepared,

289
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,190
you will very easily fall for him again.

290
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,270
Come on, Baby!

291
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:04,270
You two are both single right now.

292
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,320
Why don't you just give each other another chance?

293
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,500
This hotel's coffee beans are from Panama's most famous brand, La Esmeralda.

294
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,540
What do you think? Do you want to try a cup?

295
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,030
Actually... the world's best coffee isn't from Panama.

296
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,280
It's from... Chiayi (city in Taiwan).

297
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,640
- Did mom wake up?
- Did Aunt wake up?

298
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,340
My mom is fine.

299
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,780
Then... do you want to stay over for dinner tonight?

300
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:41,160
We didn't get to have our lamb hot pot back home. So we plan to go back.

301
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,620
Since you're free right now, I have a few things I want to discuss with you.

302
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,500
- Give me a Daiquiri.
- Okay.

303
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,420
The Negroni here is quite good.

304
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,370
Or do you want what you always used to get, a martini?

305
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,150
You rarely drank alcohol back then.

306
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,810
People always change.

307
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,530
Oh, really?

308
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,710
But I still love martinis.

309
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:40,060
It seems this is our first time being together in a place with such a beautiful, well-lit atmosphere to talk.

310
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,850
Before, I worked too much and was always working overtime–

311
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,520
I'm not here to reminisce with you.

312
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,280
I have some things I want to clear up with you.

313
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,130
Can you really not see a movie with me today?

314
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,670
It is all my mom's fault. They asked me to show that guy around.

315
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,380
It is so annoying.

316
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,520
Since it is so annoying, then blow him off (ignore him).

317
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,510
When people succeed, they tend to want to review their past mistakes.

318
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,940
They want to make up for some of their past regrets.

319
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,240
But some things are like this saying, "A lost chance never returns."

320
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,040
Regardless of whatever you do right now, my answer will always be no.

321
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,270
Are you scared now, Huo Yung Tai?

322
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,330
Did you think I am still the Yan Fei from nine years ago?

323
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,700
I know that old flames are still the most beautiful.

324
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,210
But I'm not your martini anymore.

325
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,980
Let's part ways with no hard feelings.

326
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,720
I think you've misunderstood something.

327
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,410
I never thought about getting back together with you.

328
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,500
Who told you that?

329
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,210
My mom.

330
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,700
She said you've been contacting her, caring for me, and asking about my news.

331
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:02,030
Your mom is the one who keeps texting me, telling me about your circumstances and asking for news from me.

332
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,740
I had to reply out of courtesy.

333
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,080
Then... why did you voluntarily ask her out for dinner?

334
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,850
Royal Taipei has plans to partner with a top spa company.

335
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,640
I wanted to collaborate with Beauty Queen Group.

336
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,850
Then why did you call her "Mom"? She's my mom, not your mom!

337
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,120
Oh... it is... because I'm used to calling her that.

338
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,380
See! Isn't that very easy for someone to misunderstand?

339
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,290
But it is okay. I understand everything now.

340
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,010
It is fine. Everything is fine.

341
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:41,370
So you thought I came back because I wanted to get back together with you?

342
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,190
Yan Fei! You're so dumb! How could you be so naive that you believed

343
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,230
what Yan Wu Chun Fung said?

344
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,280
- Of course not.
- Oh.

345
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,890
Then it must be because you used to really love reading those romance novels about powerful CEOs chasing after their wives.

346
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,150
I was young back then so I didn't understand things.

347
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,740
Now, I don't read romance novels anymore.

348
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,320
I see.

349
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,660
What are you doing? Don't move!

350
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,090
President Huo! That man who came together with Yan Fei is in trouble.

351
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,510
- Is he in trouble?
- Is he in trouble?

352
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,590
Let go of me!

353
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,030
Let's go.

354
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,040
What happened?

355
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,620
- What's wrong with your hands?
- They're fine.

356
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,990
This person was secretly taking pictures of you two, and this man caught him.

357
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,220
Fingerprint.

358
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,460
Please bring him up.

359
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,020
Finger, please.

360
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,550
President Huo, take a look.

361
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,290
Verify all these pictures, including the ones on his Cloud Drive.

362
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,350
Yes, Sir!

363
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,460
Before you clean up this area, make sure you take pictures as evidence.

364
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,670
Also, he got injured at your hotel.

365
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,680
The hotel should take responsibility for paying for his hospital fees and the cost of losing work days.

366
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,410
That's a given. We will take responsibility for everything.

367
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,750
This is my business card.

368
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,020
Please contact me with any follow-up concerns.

369
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,160
Take him inside.

370
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,780
President Huo, I'm going to go check his phone first.

371
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,020
Why didn't you just let him take the pictures? They're just a few pictures of us together.

372
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,440
And now you've injured yourself. You're a hairstylist. How can you work with injured hands?

373
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,750
I definitely couldn't let him take pictures!

374
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,200
If he did, who knows what new scandals would erupt this time.

375
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,110
They might say you're back together or on a romantic hotel date.

376
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,480
Do you not care about your reputation anymore?

377
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,050
This is a public area.

378
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,930
Two people eating and drinking together is a normal social interaction.

379
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,790
Even if the media wants to spread gossip about us getting back together,

380
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,850
that wouldn't be any loss to Yan Fei, right?

381
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,640
I'm telling you the truth! Even if our pictures were taken

382
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,740
and we really did get back together, what's wrong with that?

383
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,680
My qualifications aren't considered bad, right?

384
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,390
You two are already divorced. You are just her ex-husband.

385
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,500
Are you angry?

386
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,580
Did Huo Yung Tai say something wrong?

387
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,280
Let me tell you! Don't pay any attention to what he says. He's always been like that–

388
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,870
It is not Huo Yung Tai! It is you!

389
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,910
I'm angry at you!

390
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,400
Me?

391
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,530
He treats you like this, yet you give him chance after chance.

392
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,560
Why can't I even get one chance?

393
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,170
How could I forget what happened? This is the first time after so many years...

394
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,000
The process is what's important!

395
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,490
Did you forget what happened?

396
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,420
It's okay.

397
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,370
I will help you

398
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,740
do a good review.

399
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,180
Luckily, it was a dream.

400
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,850
Why doesn't she go back to her own room to sleep?

401
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,370
Why did I have such a dream?

402
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,860
It's all because Wang Hsuan Yu was saying crazy things.

403
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,540
He treats you like this, yet you give him chance after chance.

404
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,810
Why can't I even get one chance?

405
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,800
Do you know what you're saying?

406
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,870
Do you really plan to get back together with Huo Yung Tai?

407
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,760
Why are you saying this, too?

408
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,630
Why does the whole world think that I want to get back together with Huo Yung Tai?

409
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,920
What is so great about him?

410
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,580
My mom says so. The media says so. Chiao An Na says so. And now even you!

411
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,170
It's because you all keep saying such things! That's why I embarrassed myself in front of him!

412
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,960
I tell you this! Whoever says "getting back together" again, will see me angry, including you!

413
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,250
What are you smiling about?

414
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,260
You're not allowed to smile!

415
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,980
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

416
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,340
It's your favorite, little chicken bits (chicken nuggets).

417
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,570
Good morning, Older Brother and Sister-in-law.

418
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,000
Good morning, Jia Jia.

419
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,280
- Good morning, Uncle.
- Let's go, Jia Jia.

420
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,470
- Let's go to school.
- I'm not done eating yet.

421
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,390
Why are you in such a rush? It's still early.

422
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,450
What happened to your hand?

423
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,850
I'm fine. I just accidentally sprained it.

424
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,630
I'm not waiting for you anymore.

425
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,630
Brother...

426
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,080
Eat it on your way to school. Let's go.

427
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,850
You...

428
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,360
Is Older Brother still upset at me about not going to Milan?

429
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,830
He feels very disrespected since you didn't tell him something so important.

430
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,190
But I didn't mean it that way.

431
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,980
I know.

432
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,910
You didn't go to Milan.

433
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,580
Is it because of Yan Fei?

434
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,870
I knew it. The way you look at her is different.

435
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,090
I guess I was right.

436
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,580
- It's not because of her. It's because... becau—
- It's fine.

437
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,660
You don't need to make up excuses in front of me.

438
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,640
Your brother would never, in his dreams,

439
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,320
think this was your reason for not going.

440
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,940
When he comes back, I will talk to him.

441
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,900
Don't be silly. Your brother likes Chin Lan so much.

442
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,750
What would he think if you told him about Yan Fei right now?

443
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,380
He'd think she's a bad woman, who snatched his brother from a girlfriend, and she's a vixen.

444
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,350
- She isn't.
- Sh-She is not.

445
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,200
Yan Fei isn't like that. She's not.

446
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,970
- She didn't.
- I know.

447
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:04,310
But whom you fell in love with first

448
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,070
is something only you know.

449
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,250
As long as you are honest with yourself,

450
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,870
don't worry too much about what others think.

451
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,440
All right?

452
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,010
I have finished eating. I'm going in.

453
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,410
Love Is Science

454
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,850
What? Didn't I give you Lo Yun Hsi's case?

455
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,240
The client specifically wants you to handle the case.

456
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,650
- Why?
- "Why?"

457
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,770
I don't know. Why would she specifically want you?

458
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,520
And why don't you want to do it?

459
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,820
Just who is this Lo Yun Hsi?

460
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,370
Didn't I tell you? She's my high school friend.

461
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,630
And? Did something happen between you two?

462
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,990
What?

463
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,530
Were you dumped?

464
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,330
Oh, no! Really?

465
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,990
I was just messing around. I really was just messing around!

466
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,760
May the weather bless you with good wind and rain.

467
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,340
- Dear!
- Yes?

468
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,660
No matter how I calculate, it's not enough.

469
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,250
Including my gold, local loans,

470
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,370
and even the debt Second Uncle still owes me,

471
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,230
it's still not enough.

472
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,490
What are you buying that costs so much money?

473
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,530
Miss Cho has such a great background. We don't have much to offer when they get married.

474
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,770
Have you thought about that for You Fu?

475
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,020
The bridal gift, the wedding, and the honeymoon.

476
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,890
We should also decorate their newly-wed room,

477
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,710
and buy some imported appliances. These all cost money!

478
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,670
Didn't we have a timed deposit account for You Fu's wedding fund?

479
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,810
The interest on that account is so low!

480
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,350
It's not even enough to pay for the banquet!

481
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,430
I thought of something!

482
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:27,140
A Jiao told me that she invested in a structured note.

483
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:32,430
You invest NT$100 in it. Ninety days later, it has doubled to NT$200.

484
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,720
How is that possible? It totally sounds like a scam.

485
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,800
It's not a scam! A Jiao already got her money back.

486
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,810
And the person who is selling the structured note is her son.

487
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,380
He wouldn't scam his mom!

488
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,040
Is that so?

489
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,320
We can invest... just a little bit.

490
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,630
Just NT$20,000, nothing more, okay?

491
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,190
Love Is Science.

492
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,930
I picked out the location for the member's homecoming sharing event.

493
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,240
It's that first hotel we went to see.

494
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,630
Fame Hall Garden Hotel

495
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,480
Fame Hall Garden Hotel

496
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,620
I never thought about getting back together with you.

497
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,610
Why does it have to be this one?

498
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:28,940
Their pricing, the service, the food,

499
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,050
and the location, as well as their flexibility are the best.

500
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,600
Are there no other choices?

501
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:41,950
We do have another choice but... the price is 20% higher.

502
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,350
This one...

503
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,470
This one is good! Let's pick this one. Twenty percent more is fine.

504
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,110
Boss, don't you want to consider it a bit more?

505
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,640
No. The company won't go bankrupt by paying 20% more.

506
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,830
All right, I understand.

507
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,110
Wait.

508
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,890
Why should I let the company pay more just because of him?

509
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,540
Who does he think he is? He's no one important.

510
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,170
Does he think I'm afraid of him?

511
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,220
No way!

512
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,830
What was I thinking? That was dumb.

513
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,790
- Sheng Ying.
- I'm here.

514
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,530
- Let's switch back to the first one.
- Okay. Understood

515
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,910
Yan Fei, Yan Fei, you're awesome.

516
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,600
So calm and professional... You're a natural businesswoman.

517
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,120
You Fu went on a date in Taipei today. Did it go well?

518
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,450
He sounded happy on the phone.

519
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,940
Nice.

520
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:05,060
I really hope he and Ms. Cho can get married soon.

521
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,170
I'm glad it went well.

522
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,390
Come on, Boys, time to eat.

523
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,660
Okay, in a minute...

524
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,150
Quickly come and eat!

525
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,870
Time to eat!

526
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,970
- That's yours.
- Thanks a lot.

527
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,050
Let's eat!

528
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:24,150
Let me tell you what I heard on the way.

529
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,350
Do you recall the structured note we invested in?

530
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:30,100
A Jiao and Village Chief both invested in it.

531
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,090
Oh, really?

532
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:35,460
Even the rich lady, Mrs. Hsieh, invested. She did, too!

533
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,800
Principal Chen put a few million in.

534
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,220
What, even Principal Chen?

535
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,320
He put in his retirement fund.

536
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,970
He invested two million. And now it's doubled to four million.

537
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:55,890
People who have been principals really are different.

538
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,700
They look at the long-term results.

539
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,630
Four million.

540
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,820
Dear, we only invested 20,000.

541
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,960
Would it be too little? Shall we put in more,

542
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,970
as our son’s marriage fund?

543
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,410
Put it higher! It's blocked. See, it's blocked.
You Fu Cafe

544
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:31,500
Lean your head this way. That's right! Exactly!

545
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,860
That's a good angle. Keep it like that.

546
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,640
- Are you ready for the picture?
- Yes!

547
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,050
One, two, three...

548
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,740
♫ Always be with you ♫

549
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,140
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫

550
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,040
That's right! Exactly!

551
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,550
That's a good angle. Keep it like that.

552
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,320
- Are you ready for the picture?
- Yes!

553
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,340
One, two, three...
You Fu

554
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,680
Let me see!

555
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,180
Oh, I'm sorry!

556
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,670
It's not a big deal.

557
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,440
Perhaps I should get a selfie stick.

558
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:27,110
That would be nice so we won't have to try so hard for poses next time, and not have to get this close.

559
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,460
I'm sorry about that.

560
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,010
No need to apologize. I didn't say I disliked it.

561
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,340
Okay, I'm hungry.
You Fu

562
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,440
Let's get some food!

563
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,680
Voodoo

564
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:01,970
What's wrong with your hand? Can you still work?

565
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,950
It's okay.

566
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,810
That's impressive.

567
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:25,430
You're better than most people in your styling skills.

568
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,360
It doesn't make sense.

569
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,840
You have great skills. How come they won't let you pass the stylist qualifying test?

570
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,910
Maybe there's a lot more I need to learn.

571
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:40,950
Or it's about the timing.

572
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,060
Timing? I think it's because of your nonchalant attitude.

573
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,420
You'd better not be like that when you're dating.

574
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,070
Don't forget you have a boss-level competitor.

575
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,740
Who's that?

576
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,880
Huo Yung Tai.

577
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:05,480
He's... out.

578
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,880
What? What about you?

579
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,540
Me? I think I got the entrance ticket.

580
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,810
Perhaps I'll even have a chance to go onstage.

581
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,970
Hsuan Yu, Ms. Wang is here.

582
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:30,140
Ms. Wang, I'm sorry, I injured my hand. It may take longer today.

583
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,870
But I guarantee I'll still do a great job with your hair. It won't be affected.

584
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:37,200
No problem, I trust you. You gave me a great style for my date last time.

585
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,160
Please have a seat first.

586
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,650
Ms. Wang, please wait just a little bit.

587
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,940
I am going to get things ready.

588
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,960
What do you want?

589
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:05,200
Did Chiao An Na say anything that day?

590
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,070
She has something to tell you for sure.

591
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,150
What does she have to tell me?

592
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,380
Simply, if you want to date her,

593
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,460
the fastest way is to get reincarnated.

594
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,650
There is zero chance in this lifetime.

595
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:33,100
She said you should give up now and stop wasting your time.

596
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,790
Did she say those words for real?

597
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,090
Chiao An Na is a straightforward person.

598
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:43,130
If she's not into you, she'll tell you right away.

599
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:47,470
Isn't that great? It'll save time for the both of you.

600
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:11,070
With your looks, you can easily find a new girl.

601
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,790
What are you doing tonight?

602
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,050
I got dumped. Can you keep me company?

603
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,160
How old are you? Do you still need someone to be with you?

604
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,070
Sorry, I can't.

605
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,510
I have plans with friends tonight.

606
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:34,550
Bring me with you.

607
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,900
Bring you? Why would I take you with me?

608
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,620
I don't care. You have to help me heal.

609
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,410
Take me with you.

610
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,170
Are you sure?

611
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,730
Yes, I am sure.

612
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,470
No matter where you go tonight, I'm following you.

613
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,670
You Fu Cafe

614
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,330
Look,

615
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,110
there are many restaurants named You Fu in Taiwan.

616
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,700
There are all kinds of stores.

617
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:18,510
There is even tofu pudding! I want it.

618
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:23,250
Sure, and there's also a wonton restaurant. I like it.

619
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,440
Sounds good. I think we can start

620
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,750
planning a You Fu food journey going all over Taiwan.

621
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,490
That would be great.

622
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:37,990
Then how many days and nights would we need for that trip?

623
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:48,400
Do... do you think

624
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,500
I am a bit...

625
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,220
A bit what?

626
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,550
Nothing!

627
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:07,080
I feel so relaxed with you, and I can say things freely.

628
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:12,860
I'm happy to hear that.

629
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:17,430
But we only planned for "You Fu" stores in our trip.

630
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:21,900
We don't have any stores named "Nai Hui." That's a pity.

631
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,410
That's totally fine.

632
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:30,330
That represents how You Fu is a lucky name. ("You Fu" means lucky.)

633
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,290
It sounds like the business will be prosperous.

634
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,580
No wonder they use "You Fu" a lot.

635
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:39,200
Also, a restaurant named Nai Hui...

636
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,450
sounds like it'll go bankrupt...

637
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:46,310
Of course not, I'd like to open a restaurant...

638
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,730
and name it "Nai Hui's Shop."

639
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,950
We would only sell the food you like to eat.

640
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,270
Who would come?

641
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:02,010
And how would you know what I like to eat?

642
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,830
I know

643
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:09,320
you like black coffee in different flavors.

644
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:14,270
You don't like eggs in your sandwich.

645
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,600
You don't eat beef, but you like to eat ginger duck stew.

646
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:23,120
Also, every time you pass by a stinky tofu stand,

647
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,370
you can't help but stop to smell it,

648
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:33,190
probably because you are too shy to eat that with me.

649
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:37,000
And tofu pudding...

650
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,200
I think selling these items will be enough.

651
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,850
Then... let's agree on this first.

652
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:54,250
If you're really going to open a restaurant, I want to be a shareholder.

653
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,490
Okay. I promise.

654
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:09,100
It's nothing. It's my classmate who works at the Farmer's Association.

655
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,060
It's probably not important.

656
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:17,830
Don't worry about the dating rules. You should answer the call.

657
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,020
Hello? Ah Ren.

658
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,100
My mom terminated the savings account?

659
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,970
I didn't hear about that.

660
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:39,420
Okay. I-I'll go find out more information.

661
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,770
Thank you. Bye bye.

662
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,650
Is something wrong?

663
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:50,840
Everything is fine. It may be because my mom needed cash immediately.

664
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,450
We'll think about it and let you know later.
[Love Is Science Marriage Agency]

If you can't think of anything, then you're buying, okay?

666
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:04,300
Boss! We're going out to eat together. Do you want to come with us?

667
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,420
You guys can go without me.

668
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,160
Are you not eating again? You're going to ruin your stomach.

669
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,280
Fine... then buy me a sandwich on your way back.

670
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,100
Okay. Then we're leaving now.

671
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,860
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

672
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,070
How about you guys? Do you have any ideas (on where to eat)?

673
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,300
I suddenly remembered that I still have some tasks left to do.

674
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,430
Why don't you two go eat first and bring something back for me?

675
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,060
- I can eat anything.
- Okay.

Did you finally realize it hurts?

678
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,970
We just went to get an X-ray done.

679
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:27,400
Why did we come to see a Chinese medicine doctor right after?

680
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,030
Western medicine can only see whether any bones or muscles are injured.

681
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,390
What if you strained your tendons instead?

682
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:36,450
It's safer to see a Chinese medicine doctor as well.

683
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,460
Why are you smiling again? What are you smiling about?

684
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,870
Smiling means I'm happy.

685
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,730
How are you happy when your hands are injured?

686

I worked very hard to prepare a lot of food for everyone.

I even spent a lot of money to buy lobster.

I think so.

Whenever I see something delicious, you're the first person I think of.

730

It's very interesting.

731

When I'm hungry, you're also the first person I think of.

732

Does that mean

733
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,830
you'll have to come all the way over here to have lunch and dinner with me?

Eating well is always something very important in life.

People's relationships all start with eating together.

You will definitely like it. I'll take you there after we finish eating.

The only bad thing about that store is

751
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:21,440
they are always very busy so they have a limited supply.

752

There is only one month left before your ex-boyfriend's wedding.

I heard you recently rejected all of the arranged dates.

Are you planning to give up on getting married before your ex-boyfriend?

Did time fly by that fast?

783

Back then, you had added this clause to your contract.

784
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:50,540
So if you've changed your mind now,

785
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:53,640
we have to sign a new agreement that allows us to revise the old contract.

that your compatibility percentage with Mr. Wu is only 33%.

791
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:18,700
A person's feelings will be affected by the mood of the situation

01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,360
Our computer pairing system at Love Is Science especially does not rely on feelings but only on people's conditions.

794
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,760
It won't make mistakes and can withstand the test of time.

796
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,400
- Boss.
- Yes?

797
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,370
There are some hotel contract sections that need to be fixed.

798
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,570
Do they need it this soon?

799
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,930
They said they have to look over the contract first before they can confirm the venue for us.

800
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:56,300
The file is on my laptop. Give me a second.

801
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,120
All right.

802
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:05,240
But my laptop is...

803
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,440
Can you find it?

804
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,740
It's in my purse. I forgot I took it with me when I went out.

805
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:16,220
Did you forget something like that?

806
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,930
It's because it's so light. I don't even feel it when it's in my bag.

807
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:21,570
That laptop color is very pretty. It suits you.

808
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:24,920
It's pretty, right? Also, you rarely see this color of a laptop.

809
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,560
The important thing is that it can last for thirteen hours straight. You won't have to keep charging it while you're outside.

810
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,550
That is very important.

811
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,230
That function is very convenient! It's quick and safe.

812
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:40,770
Boss, do you want to consider changing my laptop for me?

813
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:44,460
Its sound quality is quite good. I really recommend it.

814
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,500
How about... If your performance next month

815
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:52,100
exceeds 30%... then I'll change your laptop for you as a reward.

816
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,900
Deal!

817
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:57,370
Come over here. What needs to be changed?

818
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:02,300
The venue wants to change the rent part.

819
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,530
The rent part is... over here.

820
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:08,230
They want to change the payment to 30%.

821
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:10,400
To 30%?

822
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:13,350
The deposit will remain the same.

823
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:16,240
The remaining payment balance will be 30%.

824
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,400
- Is that it?
- Yes.

825
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,440
Thank you, Boss. I'll get back to work now.

826
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,470
You're right.

827
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:36,460
A computer system doesn't make mistakes.

828
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,970
The people it partnered me with

829
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:44,300
must have matched all of my specific conditions, abilities, and values,

830
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:48,300
making them suitable to be my marriage partner.

831
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:52,910
But a system won't know

832
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:57,510
who can make my mood better and who can make me smile.

833
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:00,970
I had no idea that I actually have a sense of humor.

834
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:05,430
That I can act so freely. It's You Fu.

835
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:08,800
He let me discover another side of me.

836
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,530
Also...

837
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:15,360
He embraces all different sides of me.

838
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,330
I wonder,

839
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:22,550
how much are these things worth in the system?

840
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,990
Male: Wang Hsuan Yu

841
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,050
Personality: considerate, old-fashioned, gentle, and caring

842
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:07,810
Start pairing.

Piggy's Love Diary

847
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:57,020
It feels so nice.

848
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:00,570
♫ It's the speed at which I fell in love with you ♫

849
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:01,840
Choose a line.

850
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,450
What is this?

851
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:05,790
Just choose one.

852
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,320
This one.

853
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:13,770
Let's reveal the answer.

854
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,900
- That...
- Yes!

855
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,330
What does this mean?

856
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:22,110
If you had gotten the sun (Chinese character 陽 yang), then it means you'll be together with Wang Hsuan Yang.

857
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:24,460
Since I got the rain,

858
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:28,050
then does that mean Wang Hsuan Yang and I aren't fated to be together?

859
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,630
No.

860
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:33,230
That's good. What does it mean then?

861
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:34,800
It's a secret! ("Yu" from Hsuan Yu sounds like "rain.")

862
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,700
I don't care! I want to choose again!

863
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,170
It won't count if you choose again!

864
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:44,700
This won't do! I want to choose again! Give it back!

865
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:49,100
- You can't!
- Don't you want your milk tea?

866
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,070
What is your relationship with Roland?

867
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:53,610
- He's a friend.
- No!

868
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:57,080
Next week, I am attending my college reunion.

869
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,770
With me accompanying you, it won't be boring.

870
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:03,230
Sometimes, even though you've paid the money, it doesn't mean that you're ready.

871
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:07,740
It's your heart. It will tell you when it's ready for the next relationship.

872
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,710
It wasn't easy for me to get a second chance. I will definitely persist until the last moment.

873
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:16,890
Many things can change. But some people will never forget once they've been in love.

874
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,330
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

875
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:24,100
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
