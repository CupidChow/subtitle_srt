1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,200
I have to tell you something.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,820
I'm getting married.

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,910
I'm getting married!

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,690
So when did you write that letter?

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,150
I didn't give it to you because

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,100
of this.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,940
The content of my love letter

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,190
is really dumb, right?

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,240
What's in the love letter is very touching.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,250
If you had brought it out earlier,

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,640
I may have said "I do."

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,880
The first Asian CEO of Royal Hotel Group,

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,060
the star of Taiwan, Huo Yung Tai,

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,350
arrived in Taiwan today.

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,790
Hello, Feifei. Long time no see.

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,540
Why did you meet up with Huo Yung Tai?

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,640
You even did so at a hotel.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,250
Thank goodness you stayed.

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,590
Otherwise, everyone would have been very disappointed.

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,420
Does "everyone" include you?

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,860
I've always been by myself.

22
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,600
I finally have you as my younger brother—

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,640
Stop saying that I'm your younger brother!

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,210
You are younger than me.

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,660
Even so, I don't want to be your younger brother.

26
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,420
Do you want to stay for dinner?

27
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,000
How come he treated you like that and still gets chance after chance,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,130
while I can't even get one chance?

29
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,200
How come the entire world thinks I'm going to get back together with Huo Yung Tai?

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
What is so great about him?

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,040
Let me tell you, whoever says the words "getting back together" again,

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,330
will forever be scolded by me, including you!

33
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,290
Don't let him use you to get closer to me.

34
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,020
Loving someone doesn't need to be so humbling.

35
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,270
No matter how much you love him, you can't wreck yourself to make this happen.

36
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,270
That day when Chiao An Na returned,

37
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,780
did she say anything to you?

38
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,270
She wants you to give up before it's too late

39
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,080
and not waste your youth.

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,850
I got dumped. No matter where you go tonight,

41
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,690
I will follow you for sure.

42
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,180
I really think that when I'm with you
[You Fu]

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,560
I'm very relaxed.

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,640
I can say anything.

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,750
That's very good. I'm quite happy.

46
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,710
Miss Cho, I need to remind you

47
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,820
that your and Mr. Wu's compatibility percentage

48
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,530
is only thirty-three percent.

49
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,370
A person's feelings will be affected

50
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,110
by their emotions during the moment,

51
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,100
which may produce the wrong impressions,

52
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,730
but the computer system will not.

53
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,980
Especially Love Is Science's pairing system.

54
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,200
It doesn't consider emotions, but only considers conditions.

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,410
It won't make mistakes, and the results can withstand the test of time.

56
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,450
♫ I've written your name ♫

57

♫ We'll be holding hands for the rest of our lives ♫

78
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,250
Love is Science

79
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,950
You're right. The system won't make mistakes.

80
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,680
The people it pairs me with

81
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,660
surely have the conditions,

82
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,480
abilities, and values

83
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,950
that make them very suitable to be my marriage partners.

84
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,850
But the system

85
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,620
doesn't know who makes me happy,

86
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,910
and who makes me laugh.

87
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,850
I didn't even know

88
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,040
that after all, I can have a sense of humor

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,920
and be so carefree.

90
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,990
It's You Fu

91
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,160
who helped me discover another part of myself.

92
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,410
I wonder

93
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,350
how many points these are worth

94
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,250
in the system.

95
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,710
Male: Wang Hsuan Yu

96
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,860
Personality: warm man, old-fashioned, gentle, and caring

97
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,420
Wang Hsuan Yu and Yan Fei: twenty-nine percent

98
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,990
Male: Huo Yung Tai

99
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,750
Loading compatibility...

100
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,590
Huo Yung Tai and Yan Fei - ninety-eight percent

101
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,350
Structured notes (debt security issued by financial institutions)?

102
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,820
That's right.

103
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,690
It's exactly as the news reports.

104
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,050
Right now, even houses

105
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,300
and stock prices are increasing.

106
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,440
And so are structured notes.

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,200
If you invest for three months, you'll double your money.

108
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,530
A fixed deposit for three months can double your money.

109
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,230
That's much more than

110
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,460
the amount you've saved in three years at the Farmer's Association.

111
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,190
Wait a moment.

112
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,510
If such a great investment exists,

113
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,500
then wouldn't everyone be wealthy?

114
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,180
Could this be a scam?

115
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,210
- It definitely isn't!
- It definitely isn't!

116
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,300
I initially didn't believe it either,

117
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,720
but afterward, I asked Principal Chen.

118
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,530
He told me this was real.

119
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,900
He also told me not to be affected by the Lehman Brothers (bank which collapsed in the 2008 financial crisis) from the past.

120
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,580
It's very safe now.

121
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,250
He said it.

122
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,220
We have to believe those who are educated!

123
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,430
You Fu, even if you don't consider yourself,

124
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,720
you should consider Miss Cho.

125
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,530
How old are you now?

126
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,610
She can't possibly only date you long-term, right?

127
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,840
I... Miss Cho and I...

128
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,960
- We haven't—
- You have to plan and get ready early.

129
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,710
- That's right. That's right.
- You can't borrow money from others to get married, can you?

130
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,100
Exactly.

131
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,080
To: Cho Nai Hui

132
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,420
Invitation

133
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,820
A class reunion?

134
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,820
That person will also be there, right?

135
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,350
Will he bring his fiancée?

136
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,020
You left early this afternoon.

137
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,160
Is your family okay?

138
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,440
Everything's fine. My mom canceled our fixed deposit

139
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,970
because she wanted to invest it.

140
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,780
That's good then.

141
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,750
Invitation

142
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,500
By the way, next week,

143
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,560
I will attend my college class reunion.

144
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,160
Do you want... to join me?

145
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,500
Yes! Yes!

146
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,250
Of course, I do!

147
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,890
Really? I already told you that a long time ago.

148
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,490
You really are too much.

149
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,860
Forget it. The next one will appear very soon.

150
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,810
You say that every time.

151
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,200
Hi! I'm not late, right?

152
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,920
You aren't. You're the second to last to arrive,

153
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,620
because we have someone who will always arrive late.

154
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,160
It's full here.

155
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,900
Ou Wen,

156
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,400
who is that?

157
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,250
Hey, don't misunderstand.

158
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,580
This is Mark.

159
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,190
But... he's not.

160
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,890
- So don't think about it.
- What a shame.

161
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,730
The opportunity is mine.

162
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,690
- Hi! I'm Cindy.
- Cindy!

163
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,780
Come sit over here.

164
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,320
Cindy, you're so ridiculous.

165
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,030
Cindy, don't scare him.

166
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,820
Where is your restraint?

167
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,120
Ignore her. Ignore her. She's a bit strange.

168
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,140
- Can we order now?
- Yes.

169
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,760
We'd like to order.

170
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,920
Oh, right, regarding Benson,

171
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,120
we heard about it. Roland is very worried about you, too.

172
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,040
Benson is such a jerk.

173
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,160
Let's all block him.

174
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,990
You're probably very sad, right?

175
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,990
- Fried chicken, fries...
- Forget it. So what if you've been cheated on?

176
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,060
Six servings of each, please.

177
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,290
I'm okay.

178
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,500
Hey, did you know that if it hadn't been for me that day—

179
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,970
Hey, Guys! What's up? It's been so long!

180
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,440
- Hi, Roland!
- We were just speaking of you. You're the last to arrive.

181
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,920
- I haven't seen you in so long. How are you?
- Good.

182
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,760
- Are you good?
- Yes, I'm good.

183
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,830
- Have a seat.
- Thank you. Thank you.

184
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,020
- Hi.
- Sorry.

185
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,180
- Here you go.
- Really?
- It's really cute.

186
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,190
- Six servings.
- Hey!
- Stop cueing them.

187
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,360
Is everything okay with Benson?

188
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,350
- Actually, I've never been to France.
- France doesn't have stinky tofu.

189
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,200
I know!

190
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,550
Really, really.

191
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,830
Really? What about you?

192
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,420
- I'm very good.
- Is that so?

193
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,530
Let's see. Hurry.

194
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,490
- Then we can go tomorrow.
- Wait.

195
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,720
- No, I also want to go to...
- It's possible.

196
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,800
- You two totally did that on purpose.
- They don't want to get married yet.

197
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,530
- Wait.
- Go on. Say it once.

198
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,590
With a mug... twice the amount.

199
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,090
Roland wanted to show me, but...

200
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,770
Didn't you just say you were some youthful artistic girl?

201
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,720
I can be both!

202
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,150
What do you mean?

203
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,690
Really, don't be like that.

204
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,810
We can go to...

205
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,500
There are so many people. It's nice to see everyone.

206
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,750
Let's go together.

207
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,730
What you said about the seaside in southern France before...

208
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,490
I really want to go. It must be really pretty, right?

209
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,290
Also, in the south, there is...

210
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,770
So close to each other, as if he wants to swallow him.

211
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,150
Why is he so tall?

212
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,550
Is the air up there fresher?

213
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,920
It's not like he needs to eat leaves.

214
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,560
Giraffe.

215
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,590
Giraffe.

216
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,550
What are you laughing about?

217
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,850
Giraffe—

218
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,660
That... what is your relationship with Roland?

219
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,450
We're friends.

220
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,120
Another friend...

221
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
You really have a lot of friends.

222
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,780
Excuse me, check, please.

223
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,180
- Are we leaving?
- Do you want to eat more?

224
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,290
I can't eat any more.

225
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,720
Then it's about time to leave.

226
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,130
But you haven't talked to me all night.

227
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,050
Sir, I see you every other day. What more do we need to talk about?

228
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,880
Besides, didn't you come to make friends?

229
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,070
The total for today is NT$5,590 (202.14$ US).

230
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,830
How much did you eat?

231
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,750
No one was talking to me so other than eating, what could I have done?

232
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,760
What did you say?

233
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,340
I said this restaurant's food is very good.

234
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,610
Later, we will go our separate ways.

235
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,330
If you want to go somewhere else or if you'd rather go home, it's up to you.

236
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,680
- Then what about you?
- I'm going out with friends.

237
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,720
What's wrong with you?

238
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,570
I don't know what's wrong, but my stomach suddenly hurts a lot.

239
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,550
Endure it a little longer. We are almost there.

240
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,530
Okay.

241
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,160
I should have called an ambulance.

242
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,290
No!

243
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,970
There's no need to waste medical resources.

244
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,600
It doesn't hurt that much anymore.

245
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,270
I can still endure it.

246
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,480
Roland: We are waiting for you at the bar.

247
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,910
It still hurts a lot, right?

248
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,570
I'm okay. Is that your foreign friend?

249
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,370
You can go. I am okay on my own.

250
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,910
How could I possibly leave you on your own? I already told Roland I wouldn't be meeting up with them anymore.

251
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,790
Giraffe, bye, I am Ou Wen's most important friend!

252
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,590
Guess who's the most important now?

253
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,460
Driver, sorry, but could you speed up a bit?

254
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,470
Careful, are you okay?

255
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,770
I'm sorry. I don't know why my stomach didn't hurt as much anymore by the time we got to the hospital.

256
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,870
I even caused you to miss your date.

257
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:25,240
It's fine as long as you're okay. Remember, a stomachache has several causes. You should visit the hospital for a checkup.

258
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,960
Also, don't eat random things for now. Understood?

259
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,440
Okay, I understand.

260
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,650
Then I'll leave now.

261
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,090
Where are you going?

262
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,940
I'm going home. Where else would I go?

263
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,770
Okay.

264
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,620
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

265
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,360
I am Ou Wen's most important friend! Benson, Cindy, or whoever,

266
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,980
please move over. And then there's that giraffe.

267
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,830
So what if you're tall? I can jump higher than you!

268
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,410
Fame Hall Garden Hotel

269
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,660
Boss, the hotel's public relations representative said we could use the venue for free for another hour.

270
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,750
If the venue needs fresh flowers, the floral shop they work with can at any time provide them for us as well.

271
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,370
Okay, then let's later take a look at how we can decorate the venue.

272
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,050
All right.

273
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,890
Are you here to see me again?

274
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,980
Pay attention to the poster in the hallway.

275
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,720
Go ahead. I will find you in a moment.

276
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:11,280
The Art of Daniel King - End of Time 21/05/20 - 21/07/20

277
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,740
Huo Yung Tai and Yan Fei: ninety-eight percent

278
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,960
Do you know why Yan Fei and the others keep coming to this hotel?

279
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,660
I heard they are going to host a members' sharing event.

280
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,390
It's a members' party hosted by Miss Yan's marriage agency.

281
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,490
A party?

282
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,660
Huo Yung Tai, are you really going to give up on our family?

283
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,420
How many times have you missed our marriage counseling sessions now?

284
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,570
You just left me to stupidly talk to our marriage counselor by myself!

285
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,010
Is our marriage mine alone?

286
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,550
I was in a meeting all day, and just got out of it.

287
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,990
I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry.

288
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:11,030
Why am I always the only one holding on like an idiot?

289
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,470
Why is your job always more important than us?

290
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,220
Why couldn't you even give me one call or answer one call?

291
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,700
My phone was with my assistant all day.

292
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,990
This time, I was wrong. I didn't see your calls.

293
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,430
But it's not like I don't value our marriage.

294
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,810
It's just that recently, I've been too busy.

295
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:41,700
Just a little longer... After this, things will definitely get better. I promise.

296
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,040
Do you promise? Another promise!

297
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,080
When we first came, you told me things would improve once you'd become familiar with the work.

298
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,550
Later, you said things would improve once you got promoted.

299
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,280
Now,

300
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,550
it's supposed to get better only after the company gets its approval to build hotels in Asia!

301
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,150
What about afterward? Will the whole world be yours to manage?

302
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,000
Then what about me?

303
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,800
When will you have the heart and the time

304
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,340
to care about me and us?

305
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,770
I'm sorry. I'm at fault.

306
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,140
How about this? Next week, for your birthday, I'll plan a party for you.

307
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,560
You only have to attend. You won't need to worry about anything.

308
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,320
I'll take care of everything, okay?

309
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,190
I promise you will have an unforgettable birthday.

310
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,590
So you remember next week is my birthday?

311
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,490
I thought you had forgotten.

312
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,110
How could I? It's your birthday.

313
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,350
For your birthday party, you just need to buy

314
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,270
the clothes, purses, shoes, and accessories you want.

315
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,750
Then attend the party prettily. Leave everything else to me, okay?

316
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,230
All right, are you ready?

317
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,180
- Okay, turn left.
- Turning left.

318
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,300
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

319
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,610
- One, two, three!
- Wow,

320
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,000
these are all of my favorite flowers and food!

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,930
Of course, because it's your birthday.

322
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,420
Did you invite others?

323
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,790
I don't have any friends here. I thought it would be just the two of us.

324
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,670
Actually, later—

325
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,920
Hold on.

326
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,000
Please, this way. Fei!

327
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,500
This is my wife, Finley.

328
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,210
These are my boss and his wife. I spent a lot of effort to invite them here.

329
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,840
Come here.

330
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,590
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

331
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,170
- This is my wife, Judy.
- Happy birthday, Finley.

332
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,510
Thank you.

333
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,130
- Finley.
- Hi.

334
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,140
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

335
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,110
Jessica, David. He is the vice sales manager and a good friend of mine.

336
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,840
This is my very important client, Hanson.

337
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,050
Hello, Mr. Hanson, thanks for coming.

338
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,080
- Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi.

339
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,500
- My wife, Finley.
- Very nice to meet you.

340
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,200
Happy birthday.

341
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,690
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

342
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,080
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

343
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,940
- Cheers!
- Cheers, Guys!

344
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,710
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

345
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,700
- Please enjoy the meal.
- Okay.
- It's nice to meet you guys again.

346
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,490
- Good to see you guys.
- Good to see you, too.
- Good gathering.

347
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,200
Thank you.

348
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,230
I remember him.

349
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,370
Yes, and he's super smart.

350
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,360
He's the first one to...

351
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,950
- Busy bird.
- I have to compliment the chef. This is very good.

352
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,960
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

353
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,290
Yes.

354
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,450
- That would be great!
- Yes, thank you. I like it!

355
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,280
- That's very nice.
- Really?
- He is super smart, number one in class.

356
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,880
That is a good memory.

357
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,590
Cheers!

358
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,500
Cheers, cheers!

359
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,890
- It's very nice.
- Yes.

360
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,760
- That's white wine, right?
- Yes!

361
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,690
The candies on the table are beautiful.

362
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,920
- Do you like candy?
- Yes.

363
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,200
Hey, Finley!

364
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,620
What are you doing here?

365
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,950
What a great night!

366
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,880
Earlier, Johnny—

367
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,780
What are you doing?

368
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,980
How could you be so selfish? You said you would host a birthday party for me.

369
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,690
But it's clearly a social gathering for yourself!

370
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,140
Why did you invite your boss and your clients? I don't know any of them!

371
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,430
As long as it helps you save money,

372
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,740
as long as it allows you to discuss business,

373
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,010
you would even use my birthday! My birthday! I'm just your stepping stone!

374
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,810
What are you saying? Who is selfish?

375
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,620
I've always been working hard for our future! What about you?

376
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,180
You only think about your own feelings all the time!

377
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,080
You also always so clearly separate "you" and "me"!

378
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,600
What about it? Who is selfish? You are the selfish one!

379
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,020
Am I selfish?

380
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,540
This type of birthday party, I'd rather not have it!

381
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,080
It's clearly my birthday!

382
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,580
If you want to invite people, it should be my friends and family, right?

383
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,930
What are your clients and your boss to me?

384
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,090
Do you have friends here?

385
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,620
Is your family in the United States?

386
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,570
If I hadn't invited my clients and my boss,

387
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,490
would you have had such a grand birthday party?

388
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,040
Grand?

389
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,270
- Is it grand for me or for you?
- Look!

390
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,210
If it's grand for me, isn't it grand for you, too? Why do you have to separate us so clearly?

391
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,690
Fine! If you want to separate us, then let's separate!

392
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,200
Other than painting, you know nothing!

393
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,690
You only know how to hold people back.

394
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,380
You can't take care of yourself at all!

395
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,930
You don't even know how to park!

396
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,160
You crossed the line!

397
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,620
Who crossed the line?

398
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,650
Fine, since you're not satisfied with anything I do,

399
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,440
leave.

400
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,400
Go back.

401
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,530
Go back to find your mom. Go find your mom!

402
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,010
Princess!

403
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,370
Okay,

404
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,270
I will go home.

405
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,530
I will go home.

406
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,650
I will go home.

407
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,890
I will go home!

408
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,990
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

409
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,510
Really?

410
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,620
Yes! Yes, of course! Yes!

411
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,410
Okay! Three?

412
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,030
Okay.

413
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,080
President Huo, the car is here.

414
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,420
- Eric.
- Yes.

415
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,690
Order a box of champagne, and send it to Miss Yan's party. The best one.

416
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,660
Okay, understood.

417
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,800
- So the members can have a Q&A.
- All right.

418
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,450
Please help me sign and accept this.

419
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,340
Did we order champagne?

420
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,230
- I didn't order this.
- Then—

421
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,250
It wasn't me, either.

422
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,850
It was Mr. Huo Yung Tai who ordered it.

423
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,650
- Please help me retu—
- This is a very good champagne.

424
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,790
- Do I sign here?
- Yes, right there. Thank you.

425
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,090
- I think we should—
- Put it away.

426
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,140
Testimony of Happiness Sharing Party

427
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,370
President Huo, the champagne was just delivered.

428
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,850
Okay.

429
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,180
- Yung Tai.
- Mom.

430
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,560
Yung Tai, I'm sorry about that day.

431
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,880
Our Yan Fei was too impolite.

432
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,650
Mom, don't worry. Even though Yan Fei and I got divorced,

433
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,880
our relationship won't change.

434
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,080
Regarding business, I also plan to work with you long-term.

435
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,560
I like how you don't separate work and personal matters!

436
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,920
I mean, how you clearly separate work and personal matters.

437
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,650
Girls... Once they grow up, their wings harden.

438
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,150
I can't manage her anymore, either.

439
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,850
Today is Yan Fei's company party.

440
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,690
Come with me.

441
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,930
Mom, I still have to prepare for an important meeting tomorrow.

442
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,890
Besides, I just sent a box of champagne over. I believe it will go very smoothly.

443
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,550
Then that's a shame.

444
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:30,000
I was thinking it would be great to have you, the star of Taiwan, show support for our Yan Fei.

445
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,820
Auntie.

446
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,760
Hello. You're here.

447
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,580
I heard you hurt your hand the other day. Is it better now?

448
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,310
It's fine now.

449
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,130
Auntie, this is the owner of our hair salon.

450
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,790
Brother Chang Ching, this is Yan Fei's mom.

451
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,400
President Yan, nice to meet you. I am Voodoo's Chien Chang Ching.

452
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,650
Nice to meet you.

453
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,490
Nice to meet you.

454
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,660
We were able to resolve the matter with Stella last time, all thanks to your help.

455
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,870
I want to thank you on Hsuan Yu's behalf.

456
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,820
You don't need to thank me.

457
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,380
If you need to thank someone, you should thank our Yan Fei.

458
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,180
It was the first time in Yan Fei's life she asked me for help.

459
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,620
Just for you, Mr. Inconvenient.

460
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,050
It's almost time.

461
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,320
Auntie, then let's go in together.

462
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,340
You all can head in first.

463
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,960
Later, I will accompany you inside.

464
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,990
I will ask the hotel's stylists to help you fix your makeup, okay?

465
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,930
Okay!

466
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,680
You have to support our Yan Fei.

467
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,750
Our Yan Fei having such a considerate ex-husband

468
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,690
is really a great blessing (lit. trans: a fortune collected from three lifetimes).

469

Testimony of Happiness Sharing Party

470
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,040
Miss Cho is already here. Are you at the subway station yet?

471
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Which gate are you at?

472
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,030
Darling!

473
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,820
Please take a seat first. I will find you later.

474
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,350
Darling, I asked Yung Tai to come.

475
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,360
Why did you ask him to come?

476
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,230
The grand appearance of the star of Taiwan is free publicity.

477
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,700
Don't forget that the relationship between you two now is best exes.

478
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Who is his best ex?

479
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,980
So many of your members here are watching.

480
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,830
Enough, greet him. Hurry.

481
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,730
So annoying!

482
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,160
Mr. Huo, welcome.

483
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,550
Miss Cho, this is the CEO of World Magazine.

484
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,560
He is very interested in the development of the financial industry in the future, and in economic news.

485
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,870
This is my business card.

486
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,710
- Chiao An Na.
- Please do share your experience with me.

487
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,320
- Mr. Wu! Mr. Wu, you've finally arrived!
- You can get to know each other.

488
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,100
I was afraid you wouldn't make it. Hurry and come inside.

489
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,580
Apologies, I will take my leave. I will contact you next Monday during work hours.

490
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,800
Okay, okay.

491
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,070
- Chiao An Na.
- Stop being so noisy.

492
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,720
Why do you keep calling for me?

493
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:52,720
I feel that I have already expressed myself very clearly.

494
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:57,680
You misunderstood me. I'm not trying to pester you.

495
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,490
I do look like I'm trying to pester you,

496
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,600
but I'm just trying to properly tell you "goodbye."

497
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,670
We are all adults here. We should be able to part on good terms.

498
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:14,250
Besides, we have so many mutual friends. How awkward would it be if we continued like this?

499
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,120
Not bad.

500
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,910
So you know how to make yourself clear-headed after getting seasick, don't you?

501
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,290
This is the last time you can enjoy my muscles.

502
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,310
It's more like it's your last time to enjoy me.

503
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,770
- Do you want to eat this?
- Yes.

504
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,200
Do you really want to invite me to your class reunion?

505
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,360
Your classmates must all be very outstanding.

506
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,980
I am a bit worried I will embarrass you.

507
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,960
- How could you?
- But...

508
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,050
I think you look a little unhappy.

509
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,960
Is that so?

510
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,110
It is probably because we haven't met in so long.

511
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,390
Therefore I'm worried I'm not used to it anymore.

512
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,220
Don't worry. I will keep you company

513
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,190
so you won't get bored.

514
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,720
Members of Our Testimony of Happiness Sharing Party, we are about to get started.

515
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,070
You may get seated.

516
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,170
What's your ideal version of Royal Taipei?

517
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,830
Actually, in my heart,

518
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,540
Royal Taipei is not just a hotel.

519
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,860
Rather, it's a place to provide VIP members

520
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,810
with an all-encompassing luxurious experience,

521
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,210
to allow our clients, whether they're attending private parties, marriage ceremonies,

522
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,990
or other events, to experience

523
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:52,260
a high-class and all-encompassing service.

524
00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:00,260
Huo Yung Tai, you really have not changed at all.

525
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,820
It is Yan Fei's big day today. Let's not discuss business now.

526
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,590
We can privately meet another time to discuss the rest of the details.

527
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,160
All right.

528
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,670
Honestly, the first time we were matched, it was not a success.

529
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,490
It was a year later when I changed my job and had arranged to meet him again,

530
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,370
that we realized we were each other's ideal other half.

531
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,780
I want to thank Ou Wen for not giving up on us.

532
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,420
That's right. As long as we don't give up and work hard,

533
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,000
when the time is right, fate will arrive.

534
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,630
That is our story. Thank you.

535
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,000
Many thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Chao for sharing their story.

536
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,900
I want to tell everyone that sometimes, paying the fee does not mean you are ready.

537
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,900
It's your heart that will tell you you're ready to welcome the next relationship.

538
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,140
We have already started planning the next camping event.

539
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,200
We hope it can allow new members and married couples to interact with each other.

540
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,600
It can be considered a pre-marital workshop. It'll let everyone understand and interact with each other.

541
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,650
I hope none of you will make the same mistake I did back then.

542
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:44,060
What a pity. Back then, you two were not yet mature enough.

543
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,700
Not at all,

544
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,700
because we are ready right now.

545
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,810
Then you need to work hard.

546
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,020
Daniel King

547
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,510
♫ Always be with you ♫

548
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,920
♫ We'll support each other from now on.
I promise ♫

549
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,640
Fame Hall Garden Hotel

550
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,140
Banquet Hall

551
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,190
How do you eat this lobster?

552
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,320
Hurry and eat.

553
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,960
Once it ends, you won't be able to eat it anymore.

554
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,240
Why do you have such a good appetite?

555
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,020
I have let go of a huge weight in my heart. Of course, I have a good appetite.

556
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,200
Auntie.

557
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,690
Is it a convenient time for you right now?

558
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,430
Let's find a place to chat.

559
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,610
All right.

560
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,820
Get it?

561
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,000
Where's Hsuan Yu?

562
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,710
He went to chat with Mother Yan.

563
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,150
With Mother Yan?

564
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,270
And I need to go find my friend.

565
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,920
I wonder at what time things will end tonight.

566
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,020
The schedule says 9 p.m.

567
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,040
Then... will you make it to your appointment with your friend?

568
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,040
Wait. Why are you asking?

569
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,640
No reason.

570
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,180
Rubbish.

571
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,960
Who told that giraffe to glare like a tiger watching his prey? (idiom: eye covetously)

572
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,390
Miss Yan, would you like to drink this?

573
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,870
Thank you.

574
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,730
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

575
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,630
Last time, I wasn't able to thank you in person.

576
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,240
Hsuan Yu is a very important friend of mine.

577
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,490
In the end, I have to trouble you to take good care of him.

578
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:06,460
Of course. He gave up on Milan and decided to stay at Voodoo.

579
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,790
I feel very touched,

580
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:14,450
but I'm also very apologetic. This way, he won't have the chance to go abroad to receive further training.

581
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,730
Isn't staying a good thing?

582
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,660
The stereotype that most people probably have

583
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,200
toward us hairstylists is that we aren't very educated and have lower salaries.

584
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,260
We are probably considered the cheapest stylists.

585
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,190
So the situation with Stella last time

586
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:33,750
is not unusual. It can be considered a daily occurrence for hair stylists.

587
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,020
How could that be?

588
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,900
After that situation,

589
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,800
I will see to one day make Voodoo the best salon.

590
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,110
I won't let people look down on my stylists anymore.

591
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,730
Let me take you to meet someone.

592
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,200
Okay.

593
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,050
Mr. Huo,

594
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,850
this is Chien Chang Ching, Boss Chien. Our company has a very pleasant working relationship with his hair salon.

595
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,150
Also, our members have only positive feedback about his stylists.

596
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:19,130
Other than typical hairstyling services, they also take on styling jobs for music videos and magazine shoots.

597
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,590
I believe they are quite suitable for Royal Taipei.

598
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,710
Hello.

599
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,610
Wait, wait. What is going on?

600
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:40,930
After I take this, rings or something like that won't be flying at me, right?

601
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,920
President Huo, you really love to joke.

602
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,580
Of course, I sincerely hope you two can work together.

603
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,130
Here.

604
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,240
I'll accept it for you.

605
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,980
You two chat.

606
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,410
Do you like this sharing party?

607
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,520
Please come next time then.

608
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,980
So you're hiding here.

609
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,410
Why are you not eating? It's very tasty.

610
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,280
Do you want to drink this?

611
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,270
Chiao An Na said it's very expensive. Do you want to try some?

612
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,130
I don't want to drink it.

613
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,940
Do you not want to drink it?

614
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,430
Why are you being like this?

615
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,290
Stop playing with it. Let's go.

616
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,850
Come with me to steal two bottles of champagne for your brother and sister-in-law.

617
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,800
This place is probably not a place anyone can just enter. Maybe we shouldn't take any.

618
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,140
But my alcohol is here. If we don't save some now,

619
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,920
there won't be any left later. Hurry and look for them.

620
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,540
Here, here, come, come.

621
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,160
Hold it tightly.

622
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,410
Let's find a bag. It'll look bad to hold it just like this.

623
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,480
Boss Yan,

624
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,200
using company resources for personal reasons like this is not good, right?

625
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,890
What do you mean by using company resources for personal reasons?

626
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,710
What you gifted me is mine. If I want to use it, do I still need to ask you?

627
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:44,300
That's true. However, seeing how much you like it, I'll send two more boxes to your company tomorrow.

628
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,820
You're welcome.

629
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,590
♫ Always be with you ♫

630
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:10,130
♫ We'll support each other from now on.
I promise ♫

631
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,450
Boss Yan,

632
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,820
using company resources for personal reasons like this is not good, right?

633
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,840
What do you mean by using company resources for personal reasons?

634
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,590
What you gifted me is mine. If I want to use it, do I still need to ask you?

635
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:30,250
That's true. However, seeing how much you like it, I'll send two more boxes to your company tomorrow.

636
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,610
You're welcome.

637
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:41,370
This champagne is very valuable.

638
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:45,550
Are you certain you want to give up the chance to taste it?

639
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,870
No worries, there's no need for it now.

640
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,330
I can still afford a few bottles of champagne.

641
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,480
Just take it.

642
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,890
Don't give up on something good because of me, okay?

643
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,820
That's not necessary.

644
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:15,330
Actually, I prefer to drink this.

645
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:20,160
It just so happens I like to drink that, too.

646
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,090
Do you want to drink some? I can send you a couple of boxes, too.

647
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,770
Why not?

648
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,600
Feifei, you really changed a lot.

649
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:37,800
I said before that people would change after so many years.

650
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,660
Let's go.

651
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,120
Do you know that Daniel King is coming to Taiwan to hold an art exhibition?

652
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,610
So you did see the poster.

653
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,690
Some things may change, but some people

654
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:59,370
remain unforgettable once you have loved them,

655
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,420
for example, Daniel.

656
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,820
You're wrong.

657
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,370
I stopped painting long ago.

658
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,980
I feel they put a lot of effort into today.

659
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,280
They even found so many couples.

660
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,120
Nai Hui,

661
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,050
I want to attend the camping trip. Are you interested?

662
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,720
Sure.

663
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,250
After the class reunion, I'd like to meet your parents.

664
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:02,420
To be honest, our family is already preparing (for our marriage).

665
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,530
My mom even took her fixed deposit to invest with everyone else.

666
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,010
We heard that if you invest NT$100 (US$3.62),

667
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,190
it can double to NT$200 (US$7.24) in ninety days.

668
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,960
Is something wrong?

669
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:25,800
I just remembered our bank also has a good investment opportunity.

670
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,620
If you invest NT$100, you make a profit of NT$60 (US$2.17) in forty-five days.

671
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,930
In ninety days, including the initial investment, it's going to be a total of NT$220 (US$7.96).

672
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,990
Do you want to go back and ask Uncle and Auntie

673
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,640
to see if they are interested in trusting their investments to me?

674
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,490
Okay, then I'll tell my parents when I get home.

675
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,380
So I will leave now.

676
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,850
Bye bye.

677
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,850
Bye bye.

678
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:36,090
Are you calling a cab? Then I will get a free ride with you.

679
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,920
We're not going in the same direction. Also, I still have something to attend to later.

680
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,260
Hey, I'm leaving now.

681
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,470
Where are you? (At the) hotel?

682
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,850
Okay, see you later.

683
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,580
Bye!

684
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:58,420
- Are you going to meet with that giraffe again?
- What?

685
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,450
That very tall foreigner.

686
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,010
Yes.

687
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,950
Two single men meeting at a hotel in the middle of the night, what does he want to do?

688
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,450
What's strange about good friends meeting up?

689
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,030
Besides, Roland's flight is early tomorrow morning. If I don't see him tonight,

690
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:19,050
I don't even know when I'll be able to see him next.

691
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:22,750
Two handsome guys? In a hotel?

692
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,950
The night before parting.

693
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,340
I really have to go to sleep.

694
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,890
See you.

695
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:36,390
Don't go. Come back.

696
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,090
No!

697
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,090
Hey!

698
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,790
No! No!

699
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,930
No! Hey!

700
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:22,390
Red light!

701
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,780
What are you doing? You scared me!

702
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,690
Wait. Did you run all the way here?

703
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,450
♫ Always be with you ♫

704
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:00,290
♫ We'll support each other from now on.
I promise ♫

705
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:12,900
Red light!

706
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,160
What are you doing? You scared me!

707
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,050
Wait. Did you run all the way here?

708
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,250
Boss Chiao, can you be merciful today and let us go?

709
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,960
After being busy with the event all day, we still have to go into the office tomorrow. Isn't that right?

710
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,700
That's right! What's right?

711
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,320
You youngsters, if you can't play, then don't come out!

712
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,890
What's wrong? What's wrong?

713
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,230
Tissue.

714
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,860
Have some water. You will feel better.

715
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,300
What were we saying?

716
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,590
Next round! Where are we going for our next round?

717
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,860
Let's just call it a day. You're already this drunk, yet you want another round?

718
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,420
The lobster you ordered must have gone bad, right?

719
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,230
- Did you eat it?
- I did.

720
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,100
Did you eat it? Are you feeling unwell?

721
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,070
We are fine.

722
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,330
I know. It must be your body reminding you to rest!

723
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,220
How about we head home early today for some beauty sleep?

724
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,590
- Let's continue another day, all right?
- Another day?

725
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,450
Why another day?

726
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:50,170
Life is short and bitter. Rather than another auspicious date, why not today? (idiom: seize the opportunity)

727
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,780
You all—

728
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,340
What's wrong now? What's wrong now?

729
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,920
Do you like Yan Fei?

730
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,680
Okay, you've passed the most important round.

731
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,100
However, I still have to give you a warning.

732
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:55,750
I can feel that my previous son-in-law wants to get re-acquainted.

733
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,690
It just so happens that I want that very much, too.

734
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,380
It's not that I don't like you, okay?

735
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:08,820
Before Yung Tai showed up, you did perform very well.

736
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,710
It's just...

737
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:16,790
when it comes to objective and subjective qualifications,

738
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:22,300
the difference between you and Yung Tai is this...

739
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,070
big!

740
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,440
Mr. Huo's qualifications are very good,

741
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,390
but it shouldn't be a reason for me to give up on liking Yan Fei.

742
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,890
Rather, it should be my motivation to work hard.

743
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,650
The first time, I didn't even confess, and I got disqualified from the game.

744
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:49,650
Now that I finally have a second chance, I will persist until the last moment.

745
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:55,210
No matter what the results are, at least I will have tried. Even if I fail, I won't regret it.

746
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,200
Okay.

747
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,310
Working in the business for many years, I have listened to people draw large flat-breads (talking boastfully)

748
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,210
so many times that I could open a bread shop.

749
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:20,270
But toward your flat-bread (big talk),

750
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,620
I'm looking forward.

751
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,140
This youngster clearly has nothing.

752
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,590
Then why do I inexplicably want to cheer for him?

753
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,670
What's going on?

754
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,670
Storage Made Simple

755
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,950
Long time no see.

756
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,390
So pretty.

757
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,690
Did you know that in Eastern cultures, cyan is a symbol for strength,

758
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:00,950
hope, simplicity, and dignity?

759
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,290
It gives people a sense of security.

760
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:10,520
So in many traditional objects and clothing, they use cyan,

761
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,890
such as the porcelain or the clothing in Chinese operas.

762
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,820
They also represent a good character.

763
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,640
Do you think I talk a lot?

764
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:38,060
I think you said it very well. You gave me a new understanding of the color cyan.

765
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:42,430
But come with me.

766
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,990
- I have a gift for you.
- A gift for me?

767
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,770
You'll find out soon enough.

768
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:51,490
Wait a moment.

769
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,600
Not yet, not yet... Get ready.

770
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,660
One, two, three!

771
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:11,980
This is... "Cyan"?

772
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,400
Yes.

773
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,980
Daniel King's breakthrough, the first painting in the Cyan series.

774
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,150
Yes.

775
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:22,640
Is it the original?

776
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,110
I remember the first time you took me to see Daniel's art exhibition.

777
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:31,250
Not just you, even I was deeply moved by his art.

778
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:35,030
His works look simple,

779
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:37,420
but they are full of rich details.

780
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,930
You haven't told me

781
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,280
why it's here.

782
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,930
You said before

783
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:47,190
you had started painting because you like Daniel.

784
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,240
I know about Daniel because of you.

785
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,310
The works in this series are very important to us

786
00:58:55,310 --> 00:59:00,000
so I asked someone to buy this one in an auction.

787
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,540
I wanted to gift it to you.

788
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:07,600
Did you... buy it in an auction?

789
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,820
Did you buy it in an auction?

790
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,040
Did you buy it?

791
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,360
Then... it must be very expensive, right?

792
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,790
I... I can't accept this. I can't.

793
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:24,590
I can't accept it.

794
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:28,330
How about I buy it from you?

795
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:31,140
I will buy it from you. I will pay in installments for ten years.

796
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,250
- How about installments for ten years?
- Okay, okay.

797
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,740
If you're so reluctant to accept it,

798
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,640
there's actually a simpler way to pay.

799
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,020
What?

800
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:48,600
Marry me.

801
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,100
This way,

802
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,180
what's mine is all yours.

803
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,150
What's yours is, of course, still yours,

804
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:58,060
but at least this way, you won't feel so reluctant to accept it.

805
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,900
Who proposes like this?

806
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,390
Then what about like this?

807
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,110
My princess,

808
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,940
just like Cyan,

809
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,200
you can bring me a sense of security.

810
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,470
So from today onward,

811
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:27,220
I want to legally dote on and care for you.

812
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,350
Feifei,

813
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:33,410
are you willing to marry me?

814
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,120
Let me help you put it on.

815
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:50,060
Th-This box... Let me take care of it.

816
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,670
- Okay.
- You just have to

817
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:58,750
hang this in our bedroom.

818
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,860
Okay.

819
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:02,260
- Be careful.
- I got it.

820
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,580
It's Magenta!

821
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:19,080
What do you think? Do you like it?

822
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,530
I like it!

823
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,670
Happy marriage.

824
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:27,750
I hope every day from now on will be as romantic as Magenta.

825
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,180
Then you need to continue to work hard.

826
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,910
You also need to work hard

827
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:39,790
because I want to turn the children's room upstairs into your art studio, for now,

828
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,920
and hang Magenta and Cyan in there.

829
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,540
Then after you've become an amazing artist,

830
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,620
I'll invite Daniel to hold an art exhibition with you.

831
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,960
But in the Three Colors series, we currently are still missing "Yellow."

832
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,170
Give me some time. I will definitely buy it for you.

833
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,360
Why do you treat me so well? So well!

834
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,120
If I don't treat you well, who should I treat well?

835
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,070
Work hard.

836
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,700
If you want him to regret it,

837
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,230
then not only do you need to live better than before,

838
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,470
but also in a very successfull way.

839
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,700
After many years, you two may meet by chance one day.

840
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,840
When he sees you, his eyes will light up, and his heart will race.

841
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,560
Once again, he will be captured by your charisma.

842
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,160
That's the result we want.

843
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,710
Other than the typical hairstyling services,

844
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:49,610
they also take on styling jobs for music videos and magazine shoots.

845
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:53,930
I believe they are quite suitable for Royal Taipei.

846
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,870
Hello.

847
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,440
I'll accept it for you.

848
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,380
You two chat.

849
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,140
Feifei,

850
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,850
you really changed a lot.

851
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:13,010
I said before that people will change.

852
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:20,370
Although it took me nine years,

853
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:23,320
I have finally succeeded.

Piggy's Love Diary

859
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,850
- Do you want to drink more?
- Yes.

860
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:19,460
- This time, I want to drink the mung bean drink.
- Okay.

861
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,740
I'll go order.

862
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,500
- Excuse me, I would like to order.
- All right.

863
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:41,230
Has anyone ever told you your eyes are like stars?

864
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,050
They're round and beautiful.

865
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:49,050
Drink slowly.

866
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,350
My eye!

867
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,730
I think something got into it.

868
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:58,150
It hurts a lot. Can you help me take a look?

869
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,670
I can do it.

870
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,110
Little Brother, you're so cute.

871
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:06,780
That's right.

872
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:10,600
You two get along. I am going to the restroom.

873
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,960
Hey!

874
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,840
I will give you some allowance.

875
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,910
In a moment, go play arcade games by yourself

876
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,710
or buy some delicious food.

877
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:28,300
Remember, go by yourself.

878
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,930
Are you trying to send me away?

879
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:34,770
No, your older brother and sister are on a date.

880
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:38,250
You little light bulb (third wheeler), don't you think you're too bright?

881
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:41,400
I think you're the one who hurts my eyes.

882
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:47,030
Older Brother, where do you plan on taking my sister later?

883
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,400
Of course to MTV (Movie TV or private room to watch movies).

884
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,910
That is the best place to close the distance between a guy and a girl.

885
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,580
Okay, I should leave.

886
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,450
Where are you going?

887
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:09,690
I earned some allowance. I want to go to MTV.

888
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,390
I want to go, too!

889
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:14,100
Thank you for the drinks. Thank you.

890
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,460
- Hey.
- Let's go.

891
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:20,290
A few days ago, he was chasing after me for Chiao An Na's number.

892
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:23,870
What is it now? Is he treating me as Chiao An Na's replacement?

893
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:27,800
My dad wore this tuxedo to pursue my mom.

894
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,360
- I'll buy you another tuxedo.
- I'll pay for it.

895
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,010
After the discount, it will be NT$57,000 (US$2,062).

896
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,810
When Yan Fei sees this, she will definitely be surprised.
[Daniel King - End of time]

897
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,740
I have never thought of separating from you. My heart only has you.

898
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:42,360
Don't say anymore. You're the b*stard who abandoned me.

899
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,780
- You don't love me! You only love yourself—
- I love you! I have always loved you!

900
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,480
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

901
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,200
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
