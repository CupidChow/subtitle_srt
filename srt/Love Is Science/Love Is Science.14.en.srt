1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,240
Also, let me tell you, we're super lucky. Daniel King happens to be here at the exhibit.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,990
Later, we can wait in line and get his autograph.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,090
You!

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,610
Because I invited her and Daniel to dinner, you were unhappy.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,700
If Daniel comes to hold exhibits in Taiwan again,

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,530
I will arrange for him and Yan Fei to directly meet to talk so you don't need to bother.

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,540
Helping Yan Fei with anything is never a bother.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,590
I've thought it through. I want to introduce you to my friends.

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,810
What kind of introduction?

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,110
Introducing a boyfriend, that kind of introduction.

11
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,130
Are you pregnant? Does the child's father know?

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,310
Mark doesn't need to know.

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,810
- Mark?
- I haven't even decided whether or not I should have this child.

14
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,590
Should I keep this child? Keep this secret for me.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,670
How can I not say anything?

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,150
Sometimes you don't tell the other person to protect them.

17
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,450
You're too self-righteous.

18
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,750
Please, can you not be so stubborn? No wonder our compatibility is only twenty-nine percent.

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,810
Did you put us in the system to be scored?

20
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,130
It's impossible for you two to have an outcome.

21
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,260
What allows you to say that?

22
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,250
The history of our failure is repeating itself with you and Wang Hsuan Yu.

23
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,710
The system was right about the 33% compatibility.

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,020
We aren't compatible.

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,260
No. The system doesn't know who brightens your mood

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,660
and who makes you happy. So you can't give up.

27
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,630
No. It should be that neither of us can give up. We can't lose to the system.

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,250
♫ I've written your name ♫

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,830

50
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,400
Love is Science?

51
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,250
This morning, that coffee...

52
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,750
You intentionally spilt it, right?

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,360
Fortunately, Nai Hui broke up with you.

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,340
People like you don't deserve her at all.

55
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,450
I noticed that you were walking a little strangely.

56
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,900
It must have been your shoes rubbing against your heel.

57
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,450
I'm really happy today. Then let's go somewhere next time.

58
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,380
I really feel that when I'm with you,

59
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,140
I'm totally relaxed. I can say anything.

60
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,510
I haven't been this happy for many, many years.

61
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,540
The places we've been to before and checked in online...

62
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,870
All those beautiful memories

63
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,100
are all real.

64
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,060
I like you.

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,480
Miss Cho Nai Hui.

66
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,790
Will you marry me?

67
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,450
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,730
Promise me,

69
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,610
you will live happily.

70
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,440
Dummy.

71
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,130
You are my happiness.

72
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,750
The system doesn't know who brightens your mood.

73
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,190
So what if it's thirty-three percent?

74
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,660
There's one couple that scored even lower, twenty-nine percent.

75
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
So you can't give up.

76
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,120
No. It should be that neither of us can give up.

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,690
We can't lose to the system.

78
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,080
I just broke up with Nai Hui. I don't want to go on an arranged date.

79
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,380
Haven't you heard...

80
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,740
getting a new love is the best

81
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,850
medicine for healing broken heart.

82
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,180
Do you remember Sister A-Ruan's daughter Mei Chi?

83
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,970
When you were in elementary school,

84
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,370
one was a class monitor, and the other was a deputy class monitor.

85
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,470
You were a great match.

86
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,760
That was decades ago.

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,970
Didn't she end up with a moral monitor?

88
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,360
You're jealous!

89
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,890
That means you have feelings for her.

90
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,470
No! Definitely not!

91
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,060
It doesn't matter.

92
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,420
She is waiting for you at Spring Café.

93
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,490
Southbound Platform No. 1

94
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,380
Miss, where is your destination?

95
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,460
Do you know if there's a guy

96
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,110
named Wu You Fu around here? Do you know where he lives?

97
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,980
I'm not sure.

98
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,190
Him! Have you seen him?

99
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,420
I haven't, but you can ask around at the Farmer's Association.

100
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,870
All right.

101
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,080
Hsin Hsin Gynecology

102
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,550
Boss Chiao, why am I here?

103
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,960
- Miss Chiao An Na?
- That's me.

104
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,550
I'm here to verify the chart. When was the first day of your last period?

105
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,600
Two months ago on the seventh.

106
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,230
Please read the operation consent form.

107
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,660
Although it is a minor operation, please remain on bedrest for one to three days post-surgery.

108
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,450
If you consent, please sign your name at the bottom.

109
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,830
What operation?

110
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,740
"Appendectomy."

111
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,360
Daddy should also pay attention.

112
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,180
No sex within one week of the operation,

113
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,430
or there may still be a chance of getting pregnant.

114
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,160
Daddy?

115
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,160
Aren't you getting an appendectomy?

116
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,440
It's finished. Thank you.

117
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,820
- If you have no further questions, please change into the surgery gown.
- Okay.

118
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,630
Boss Chiao! This is such a major surgery–

119
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,970
Didn't you just hear the nurse say

120
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,290
this is just a minor surgery?

121
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,590
It's about a life. How can it be minor?

122
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,260
That's why I wanted Sheng Ying to be here.

123
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,030
Hey, I'm ordering you as your boss.

124
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,700
You are forbidden to try and morally persuade me.

125
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,670
If the doctor wasn't concerned about my special physical condition,

126
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,290
which may have an adverse reaction that requires a guardian,

127
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,210
I would've come by myself.

128
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,340
Miss Chiao,

129
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,220
The operation is ready to start.

130
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,430
The surgery anesthesia will induce seminarcosis.

131
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,700
You will be conscious the whole time.

132
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,860
We will use the suction method to remove the embryo.

133
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,770
It will take about fifteen minutes.

134
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,940
That quick?

135
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,280
Okay... Will it hurt?

136
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,960
You will not feel anything under the anesthesia.

137
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,610
I mean, will it hurt for him?

138
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,060
Maybe.

139
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,910
He may just be an embryo, but he already has a heartbeat.

140
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,500
In two more weeks, the embryo will form organs and become a fetus.

141
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,380
Two weeks?

142
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,900
So fast.

143
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,100
It's about time. Let's go in.

144
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,850
Thank you.

145
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,350
I'll be waiting for you right here. Don't worry.

146
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,780
- When was the first day of your last period?
- Two months ago on the seventh.

147
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,660
The last period start date

148
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,810
Congratulations! You are six weeks pregnant.

149
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,630
Six weeks?

150
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,640
Is that her phone number?

151
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,160
I beg you. Please give me her phone number.

152
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,170
- It's because...
- It's because she dumped you,

153
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,020
and you are bothering her.

154
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,680
I'm sorry, Baby.

155
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,050
I hope you will find a better mommy.

156
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,310
Sir, you can't come in!

157
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,890
What are you doing?

158
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,190
The child is Mark's,

159
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,880
right?

160
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,410
The child is mine!

161
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,020
- Let's talk.
- There is nothing to talk about.

162
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,100
It's none of your business.

163
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,740
- Then I'll have Mark talk to you.
- You can't!

164
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,240
Are you crazy?

165
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,160
Tai Ou Wen, what are you doing? Put me down!

166
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,410
I'm sorry about this.

167
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,640
Tai Ou Wen!

168
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,420
Could I bother you

169
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,080
to check if you have someone named Wu You Fu in your registry?

170
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,530
I'm sorry, Miss, but we're not allowed to give out personal information.

171
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,390
You know him, right?

172
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,850
Please. I need to talk to him about something very important.

173
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,650
I'm very sorry, but we really can't give out personal information.

174
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,460
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,330
What are you doing?

176
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,780
Don't be like that. Didn't you already agree to invest?

177
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,780
It's all right if you want to break your promise,

178
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:06,280
but you're telling everyone that my son encouraged everyone to invest in that scam.

179
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,480
What do you mean by that?

180
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,710
You were quiet when you were making money!

181
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,590
Now that you changed your mind, you say it's a scam?

182
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,470
You're so cold-blooded.

183
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:25,000
Excuse me. About the structured note you invested in, which companies does it invest in?

184
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,930
Was the company founded less than three years ago?

185
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,770
Emphasizing low risk, high returns, and no need to sell anything?

186
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,310
Of course, there won't be any products that they can sell, either.

187
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,290
What they do is professional. They use their brain to make money.

188
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,300
We don't understand it. We just need to wait and count the money.

189
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,350
Even if you buy vegetables at the market, you must be careful with your money.

190
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,020
Handing over such a large sum to someone to invest,

191
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,490
if the details are not cleared up, will you be at ease?

192
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,080
Who are you? Why are you talking nonsense?

193
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:14,240
I'm the Deputy Director of Fu Gui Bank's Finance Department.

194
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,360
Cho Nai Hui

195
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,270
It's Cho Nai Hui!

196
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:28,150
Miss Cho... Are you Miss Cho, who is dating You Fu?

197
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,320
Auntie, do you know how to find You Fu?

198
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,100
You Fu...

199
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,290
He's on a blind date at the Spring Café.

200
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,430
That b*stard. He just broke up with me,

201
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,160
and he's already going on a blind date.

202
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,650
Coffee Shop

203
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,710
Hi, Mei Chi.

204
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,670
Hi. I-It's been a long time.

205
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,480
You haven't changed at all.

206
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,220
But... you've become handsome.

207
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,400
- I came here today to tell you–
- I know.

208
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,770
You know?

209
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,600
It's obvious you've liked me since elementary school,

210
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
so, of course, I know.

211
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,600
I didn't... I really didn't.

212
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,530
I just became single, and you broke up with your girlfriend.

213
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,890
Isn't that because you love me?

214
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,000
N-N-No... It's just a coincidence.

215
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,990
There are no coincidences in love. We are fated!

216
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,830
What are you doing?

217
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,810
Nai Hui.

218
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,650
Why are you doing this?

219
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,470
I-I'm just...

220
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,890
What are you doing?

221
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,530
You were right.

222
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,640
This doesn't suit you at all. Change back!

223
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,190
And about that question you asked me last time,

224
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,740
my answer is...

225
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,720
I do.

226
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,590
From now on, your person, your field, and your old yellow cow

227
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,590
are all mine! Any objections?

228
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,790
- I object!
- It's none of your business!

229
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,960
Is that all right?

230
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,840
Why did you bring me here?

231
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,690
I have thought it through.

232
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,620
I want this child to arrive in this world safely.

233
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,480
I thought you liked Mark?

234
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,200
If I have this child, how is that good for you?

235
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,840
Tai Ou Wen, I told you before. You can't lower yourself so much no matter how much you love someone.

236
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,030
That's not it.

237
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,250
I...

238
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,720
probably will never have a child of my own.

239
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,120
That doesn't mean I don't want children.

240
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,820
This may be my only chance to have

241
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,550
the child of someone I love.

242
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,090
If it's Mark's child, I think I can love him.

243
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,520
Even if we break up,

244
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,730
I won't change my mind.

245
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,810
But excuse me, did you forget something?

246
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,020
The child is in my belly right now. I'm the mother.

247
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,220
Have I gone crazy?

248
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,700
I actually thought I could be a mother for a moment.

249
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,660
Actually...

250
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,480
I really don't know what to do.

251
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,450
Maybe we should ask the other involved party the question.

252
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,000
Asking Mark, that single-cell amoeba?

253
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,780
No.

254
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,490
Ask the child.

255
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,300
If you are the child,

256
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,990
will you choose yourself as the mother?

257
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:48,130
Actually, the child's not even born yet, but he already has me, Godmother Yan Fei,

258
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,860
and you to love him.

259
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,170
It doesn't seem so bad.

260
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,320
Have the child without any worry.

261
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,940
I can go with you to prenatal checkups. I can also be the child's father in name.

262
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,280
If you ever need it.

263
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,050
That solves the most difficult issue, the family registry.

264
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,830
Then let's enjoy the process.

265
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,330
How is this one?

266
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,360
Can't you stop moving your head?

267
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,330
- Just for twenty seconds.
- No!

268
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,180
If you keep moving your head, I may mess up your cut.

269
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,690
Hsiao Wei, stop being rude.

270
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,590
Sorry.

271
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,210
It's okay. I don't like children, and children don't like me.

272
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,380
It's fair.

273
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,090
I give up. I leave the child to you.

274
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,920
Boss, look.
Love is Science

275
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,480
Even a baby carrier can be so pretty. And if you wear it, you'll make it even more stylish.

276
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,380
What you're saying is true, but I think you would look better wearing it.

277
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,350
I can't. I have to visit customers.

278
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,750
You can show the baby the real world.

279
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,810
What's going on here?

280
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,130
I've decided to become a mom

281
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,520
so shouldn't we have a party?

282
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,120
My gosh, is today April Fool's day?

283
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,060
You've decided to have the baby, haven't you?

284
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,890
No... it's we who decided

285
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,920
to take care of the baby together.

286
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,790
You two?

287
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,470
What kind of combination is this? That is super cool!

288
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,280
- We bought so much for the baby this afternoon.
- We bought so much.

289
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,550
You'll have to help me take care of and play with the baby.

290
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,610
You're so beautiful, Boss Chiao. The baby will definitely be a beautiful daughter.

291
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,590
Okay, add one vote for me.

292
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,490
Come here. If you think it's a girl, then pick a pink tag.

293
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,600
I can tell.

294
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,450
Fine. I won't fight with you on this happy day.

295
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,520
- Fine.
- Please write it.

296
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,940
What do you think?

297
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,020
Yes, Mr. Wu?

298
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,660
Yes, of course, there's a spot.

299
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,690
Okay, no problem. Then I'll see you tomorrow.

300
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,380
You Fu and Nai Hui have reconciled. They will be attending tomorrow's camping trip.

301
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,230
That's terrific!

302
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,580
Since there's such good news, let's drink up.

303
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,870
- Let's drink up!
- Oh my goodness.

304
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,000
Okay, let me finish writing this.

305
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,830
I will leave this to you guys.

306
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,630
I will head out first.

307
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,150
Babe,

308
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,890
where are you going?

309
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,660
I'm going to wash my hair.

310
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,820
Voodoo

311
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,950
I want to have my hair washed.

312
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,540
Were you very busy today?

313
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,900
Why didn't you return my messages?

314
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,810

315

Fine, I was wrong.

♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

323
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,960
♫ Fantasize about a romantic love ♫

324

♫ While lonely, thinking of someone ♫

♫ He will come and warm you up ♫

I'm sorry. Don't be angry anymore, okay?
♫ As something to bring you warmth ♫

331
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,450
No, I can't.

332
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,330
I can't anymore. Don't tell me to drink anymore. I can't drink anymore.

333
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,950
Drink up. How can you not drink when I'm drinking?

334
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,450
Hey, Boss,

335
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,730
you're drinking grape juice. I'm drinking grape wine!

336
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,520
Do you think I don't want to drink wine?

337
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,170
Do you think I want to drink grape juice?
Line message from Mark

338
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,050
I-I know that you-you want to drink grape juice.

339
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,350
You don't want to have grape wine.

340
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,560
Tomorrow afternoon, remember to come to the skate park. Remember to dress more stylishly.

341
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,800
All right. I will drink more on your behalf.

342
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,070
Here. Drink more for me.

343
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,980
I will see you tomorrow.

344
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,660
- All right. Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

345
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,640
One more glass!

346
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,650
Where is my wine?

347
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,900
Why did you drink my wine?

348
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,630
Why don't you get some yourself?

349
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,990
That's fine.

350
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,240
I have more.

351
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,250
It is so sweet!

352
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,610
Yan Fei: It is my lucky day.

353
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,550
Interesting.

354
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,060
Let's go camping together.

355
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,610
Let's go camping together.

356
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,790
What if... really got together...

357
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,400
That would be very interesting.

358
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,660
Get off the car.

359
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,130
- Thanks.
- The weather is perfect.

360
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,700
Yes.

361
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,060
Let me do it. I will do that.

362
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,180
Okay.

363
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,820
Where?

364
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,520
- Here?
- Yes, here.

365
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,850
Hi.

366
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,080
Here. The view is good.

367
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,360
I will block the sun for you.

368
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,180
You shouldn't be out in the sun. It's not good for you. I'm used to the sun.

369
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,610
You nailed the tent nail in the wrong direction.

370
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,470
Why didn't you say so earlier? I already nailed them down.

371
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,210
Sheng Ying, don't go.

372
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,800
Arguing is part of the communication process. Let them solve it themselves.

373
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,270
No problem. I will help.

374
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,280
Thanks. Thanks.

375
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,880
Is it time for afternoon tea, everyone?

376
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,780
I brought many facial masks for everyone to enjoy.

377
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,270
Ms. Yan,

378
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,010
why are you here dressed like this?

379
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,140
I came to enjoy nature,

380
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,610
but I can't stay in your tent.

381
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,950
I reserved a small villa at the campground.

382
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,300
Oh, yes, everyone. Let's welcome everyone to have fun together!

383
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,630
Wow!

384
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:02,420
Sheng Ying, I hope you don't mind. Help me distribute the facial masks to everyone!

385
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,930
- Okay.
- Thanks.

386
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,680
Thank you.

387
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:13,940
She dressed up so formally. There must be something going on.

388
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,560
Don't say that. Perhaps Auntie is really here to have a vacation.

389
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,430
Nonsense.

390
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,810
I probably forgot to mention this just now.

391
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,050
I also invited

392
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,140
a mysterious special guest.

393
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,730
You forgot to say it, didn't you?

394
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,320
Mom, this place is really good.

395
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,120
It's really well-suited for us to spend a weekend.

396
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,630
Can you do it?

397
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,390
I secretly practiced.

398
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,610
It's dirty.

399
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,980
I have a wipe here.

400
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,820
Thank you.

401
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,610
You're welcome.

402
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,500
I know that you don't like being out in the sun. Do you want to get some cold air in the car?

403
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,490
- No—
- There is no need to trouble you.

404
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,410
It is no trouble.

405
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,910
How is it? Is this wine good?

406
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,790
It is very good.

407
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,570
Cheers.

408
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,610
Here. Let me.

409
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,800
Is it still not working?

410
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,100
Watch it for me for a bit.

411
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,610
I'm sorry. It's almost ready. Just wait a little longer.

412
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,830
Then when will we get to eat dinner?

413
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,360
Is that our only choice for dinner?

414
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,510
Sheng Ying, is the fire going?

415
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,030
I'm sorry.

416
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:50,660
I still encourage everyone to try and do it yourself. After all, we are in the great outdoors.

417
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,190
If you really don't want to wait, you can register with Sheng Ying.

418
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,400
We will order BBQ bento boxes for everyone.

419
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,320
What? We're here, and you still make us eat bento boxes?

420
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,730
The club fee is so high, and you actually make us eat bento boxes?

421
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,060
Sorry.

422
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,840
Club Members, actually, Love Is Science has made preparations.

423
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,170
In a while, a professional chef will prepare a BBQ feast for everyone.

424
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,390
Eat until you're full.

425
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,840
There will also be a professional bartender.

426
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,590
Later, there'll even be a mysterious show.

427
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:25,630
I hope everyone will enjoy a romantic and unforgettable evening.

428
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,080
- President Huo!
- President Huo!

429
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,500
This is the way to do it. Isn't that right?

430
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,830
What are you doing?

431
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,000
Aren't you introducing us to a friend?

432
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,510
My friend is coming soon. There is no need to rush.

433
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,220
Let's try the "tree-flip" later.

434
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,430
Do you want to drink something?

435
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,760
Where are you now? I'm waiting.

436
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,040
On the way.

437
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,510
Look at how you are smiling. Are you showing a new girl to us?

438
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,410
Whoever can tame a wild horse like you must not be simple.

439
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,990
How could she be simple? The physique must be curvey.

440
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,130
A hot personality.

441
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,150
What the heck is this?

442
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,150
Most importantly, they need to be hot in bed.

443
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,080
Enough, stinky rascal. Do you want us to envy you?

444
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,930
If the person I like isn't quite like what you are thinking...

445
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,130
No way. She's just like what we were imagining.

446
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,850
She's totally your type.

447
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,270
How come it's you?

448
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,770
I need to talk to you.

449
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,840
Boss Chiao.

450
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,080
Mark invited me to the skateboard ring.

451
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,410
He wanted to introduce me to his friends.

452
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,020
That amoeba finally got it through his head.

453
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,340
I hope that tomorrow...

454
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,160
you can go in my place.

455
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,680
I know exactly how coming out

456
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,220
could be a cruel reality for him.

457
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,100
I don't want him to experience it.

458
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Maybe he is doing this in the heat of the moment.

459
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,820
Mark is very nice. And simple.

460
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,730
Every day that I'm with him, I feel happy.

461
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,830
But the happier I am, the more scared I get.

462
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,980
I'm scared that he will wake up one day

463
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,360
and not love me at all.

464
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,850
Even when we are walking,

465
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,160
seeing him checking out a woman

466
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,810
would make me anxious.

467
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,050
I know very well

468
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:38,720
falling in love with a heterosexual man is like moths to fire.

469
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:47,640
Each day's happiness is a fluke.

470
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:56,350
The only thing I can do for him is to give him a chance to back out.

471
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,920
You should be more selfish, Ou Wen.

472
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,080
I'm already being selfish for asking you to have this child.

473
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,490
Mark is the child's father.

474
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:23,290
Even if you won't be together, he has the right to know about this child.

475
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,020
Doesn't he?

476
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,430
Please.

477
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,520
Where is Ou Wen?

478
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,190
He told me to come to see you.

479
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,960
Didn't we already agree to part amicably?

480
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,400
He is thinking nonsense again.

481
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,410
Didn't you tell him there is nothing between us anymore?

482
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,130
Before, there was nothing between us.

483
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,710
But now, there will be something.

484
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,290
What?

485
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,190
- Yours.
- Mine?

486
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,170
♫ Always be with you ♫

487
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:05,270
Love Is Science

488
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:09,120
- I didn't know we would get the chance to meet President Huo.
- Thank you for supporting Love Is Science.

489
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,260
Thank you, President Huo.

490
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,760
Take a small bite.

491
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,440
He is indeed President Huo. He easily turned this simple camping activity

492
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,680
into a six-star high-class camping.

493
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,490
That's right. He is truly the Light of Taiwan to arrange everything so carefully and thoughtfully.

494
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,740
- President Huo, can we take a photo with you?
- Of course.

495
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,960
Do you want to get some BBQ cooked by the chef?

496
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,010
I think mine is a bit burned.

497
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,840
No.

498
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:49,370
I only want you, this sausage, and this dry beancurd.

499
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,500
- Is that edible?
- Here.

500
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,870
Your favorite Daiquiri.

501
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,070
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

502
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,100
Come have a drink with everyone later.

503
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,210
Hi.

504
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,530
Auntie, were you looking for me?

505
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,770
I came to see how you are.

506
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,110
I'm...

507
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,930
fine.

508
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,930
I just get the feeling I'm chasing Huo Yung Tai's taillights.

509
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,300
Terry.

510
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,040
I'm leaving then.

511
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,900
I thought I was prepared this time.

512
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,100
I just didn't expect...

513
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:50,300
Why do you think that you are chasing after Huo Yung Tai's taillights?

514
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,950
Haven't you heard a saying?

515
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,310
"Don't look down on a poor young man."

516
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,890
Let me tell you a little secret.

517
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:10,780
As I see it, it's Yung Tai who is painstakingly chasing after your taillights.

518
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,850
Do you believe that?

519
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,880
Just wait and see.

520
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:39,730
Boss, are you sure you won't consider Huo Yung Tai?

521
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,670
Go away.

522
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:02,020
You choose first. You put up the tent all morning and didn't eat anything. You must be hungry.

523
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,940
I'm not hungry. You can have it all.

524
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,410
Can I have it all?

525
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,890
Are you not eating?

526
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,400
Here.

527
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,580
I especially asked the hotel to prepare your favorite roast corn. Do you remember this?

528
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,300
When we were in the U.S., once during midnight, you said you wanted to eat roast corn.

529
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,860
I mixed up a strange sauce, but you said the flavor

530
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,690
was what you wanted from roast corn.

531
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:36,550
At that time, we worked hard.

532
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:42,340
However, it's different now. I can always stay with you

533
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,100
to be your strongest support.

534
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,790
I'm really appreciative of you for everything today.

535
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,880
But

536
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,480
I already have the strongest support system.

537
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,830
Is that right?

538
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,610
I know that you like beer

539
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:38,070
so I specially asked them to prepare it. Tonight,

540
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:42,230
we also specially prepared a final surprise for all of you.

541
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,830
I hope all of you will enjoy it.

542
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:40,380
♫ Always be with you ♫

543
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,990
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

544
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,260
Are you all right?

545
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,630
Are you okay?

546
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,120
I'm okay. What about you?

547
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,640
Why didn't you take cover?

548
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:44,110
You said I was your biggest support system.

549
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,380
How can your biggest support system take cover?

550
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,760
Dummy.

551
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,260
Let me see. Are you okay?

552
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,120
Really?

553
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,390
Yes.

554
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,660
You lost.

555
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:20,060
FIB Fitness Club

556
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,370
Why didn't you come?

557
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,940
You heard from Chiao An Na, right? I barely convinced her to keep her child—

558
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,860
I asked you why you didn't come.

559
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,790
You really don't know what you're about face.

560
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,860
Bullsh*t!

561
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:14,780
Do you think I'm doing this on a whim? Do you know how nervous I was the day before?

562
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,880
But why am I doing this? Because you're very insecure.

563
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,930
I want you to feel reassured. I want you to feel my earnestness.

564
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:25,580
I want you to know that I'm ready to face the entire world. What about you?

565
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:37,380
It's not that I'm afraid to face it. Of the two of us, you're the coward.

566
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,230
Are you really okay?

567
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,920
Don't worry. I really am okay.

568
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:26,490
Then what if I really got hurt? What would you do?

569
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:30,500
What do you mean if you really got hurt? Don't speak so carelessly. Did you get hurt?

570
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,140
- Of course, I would take you to the hospital.
- I'm fine.

571
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:37,940
I am just curious. How would you... comfort me?

572
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,180
How would I comfort you?

573
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,700
Like this?

574
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,010
No?

575
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:55,700
Like this?

576
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,110
No?

577
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,310
Then this?

578
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:05,600
♫ This time, I'll no longer hate summer ♫

579
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,530
♫ Can't you see? ♫

580

584
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:24,510

♫ Can't you see? I've fallen ♫

585
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,710
Sleep tight.

00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,900
Thank you for tonight.

589
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,140
But in the future, you really don't need to anymore.

590
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,500
You really won't admit defeat. Okay.

591
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:14,660
But it's really no big deal because I'm doing it

592
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,190
for you.

593
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,990
- Actually—
- Come with me to the United States.

598
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:54,470
Thank you for tonight,

599
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,540
but in the future, you don't need to do that.

600
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,020
You really won't admit defeat. Okay.

601
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,340
But it's really no big deal

602
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,740
because I'm doing it for you.

603
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,680
- Actually—
- Come with me to the United States.

604
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,080
Do you know what you're saying right now?

605
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:26,130
What are you so nervous about? There will be an auction in New York next month.

606
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:29,720
You should know that Daniel has an impressive piece that everyone wants to collect.

607
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,600
"Color On Me." It's been out there somewhere.

608
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,420
- Next month—
- Don't do this anymore.

609
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,880
There are many more simple ways to make someone feel happy.

610
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,530
Your methods make people too pressured.

611
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:50,890
You don't need to feel pressured. You only need to enjoy everything I give you.

612
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,960
It's that simple.

613
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,020
But I don't want to.

614
00:56:55,610 --> 00:57:00,820
Or should I say we don't have to see each other anymore?

615
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,350
There's no need to continue to bother each other.

616
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,940
Are you rejecting me?

617
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:19,130
I'm wishing you well.

618
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:24,230
I wish for you to have an even better future without me.

619
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,230
Is it because of what happened today

620
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,790
that you are rejecting all that I have done for you?

621
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:35,390
Yes.

622
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,040
But also no.

623
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,920
All I can say is that tonight helped me figure out a lot of things.

624
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,510
I think you didn't think anything through.

625
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:53,080
This has always been an unfair competition. I and Wang Hsuan Yu

626
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:58,650
have a difference in age. In capability. We have a lot of differences. And I guarantee,

627
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:02,060
he cannot give you the things that I can.

628
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,810
That's what you think.

629
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:11,660
During those years when we were married,

630
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:15,690
we only lived according to what you think.

631
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,690
You never looked at it from my point of view.

632
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:20,910
Or thought about what I wanted.

633
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:25,140
What you want now,

634
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,360
Wang Hsuan Yu can't give you any of it.

635
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:31,960
Anything he can do, you can do yourself.

636
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,720
So why is this kind of man important to you?

637
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,190
You still don't get it, do you?

638
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:42,590
Loving someone is

639
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:46,180
doing things for them that they could easily do themselves.

640
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,970
When you do it, you're very happy

641
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:52,430
because you're anticipating their happy expression.

642
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,240
It makes you happy.

643
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,360
Yan Fei,

644
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:05,750
are you still angry at me

645
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:09,550
for agreeing to the divorce and not trying to hold on to you back then?

646
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,630
I know that I'm many years late,

647
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,180
but just give me some more time.

648
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,270
I will definitely try to understand you.

649
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,930
Yung Tai,

650
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,790
we're really over.

651
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:53,390
Actually, I've thought about it a lot during this time.

652
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:57,310
What your reason was for pursuing me.

653
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:01,250
And I figured out your ideal type

654
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:05,190
is someone who doesn't need coddling or to be accompanied.

655
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,990
Someone who comforts herself when she cries.

656
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:11,200
Who has her own career.

657
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,010
She has her own goals and is financially independent.

658
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:18,890
A woman who doesn't need a man hovering about or to take care of her.

659
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:27,570
That's right. Isn't being with that kind of woman the ideal life?

660
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:33,970
But this kind of woman doesn't need you.

661
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,610
Do you understand?

662
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:41,250
The me now doesn't need you.

663
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,300
Goodbye,

664
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,240
Yung Tai.

665
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,230
Yan Fei,

666
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,720
if you really want to be with Wang Hsuan Yu,

667
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,720
then I must give you one last warning.

668
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:14,020
The current you and him are just like me and you back then.

669
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,920
So any problems we experienced before,

670
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,990
they inevitably happen to you two.

671
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,480
It won't.

672
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,740
Because I'm not you.

673
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:40,040
I will cherish him like he cherishes me.

674
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:09,270
You worked hard! Be careful driving.

675
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:11,870
Bye bye.

676
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,540
Where is President Huo?

677
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,560
I think we won't see him again.

678
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,600
Good morning.

679
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,530
Are you all packed?

680
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:29,700
I'm packed. Let's go home.

681
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,610
- Okay.
- Bye bye.

682
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:39,500
Bye.

683
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:01,050
I'll do it.

684
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,950
So any problems we experienced before,

685
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,620
they will inevitably happen to you two.

686
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:19,360
I will cherish you well.

687
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,090
What?

688
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,530
Nothing.

689
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:27,890
I said, hurry up and go in. I'm going home.

690
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:35,590
What is it?

691
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:40,030
I'm a bit tired. Let me lean on you.

692
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,570
Are you playing cute?

693
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,970
I don't want you to leave.

694
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:02,850
I'll walk you to the door then.

695
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,250
Are we here already?

696
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,940
Hurry back and rest up.

697
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,490
If you don't let go, how do I go home?

698
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,470
That's right.

699
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:43,760
Yan Fei, you're here?

700
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,770
Brother, did you pick Jia Jia up from school?

701
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:48,020
Uncle, today is a holiday.

702
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,900
Dad took me to play in the park.

703
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,990
I forgot.

704
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:57,310
- Oh, that's right. How was camping?
- It was quite good.

705
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,480
Yan Fei, you're really good to Hsuan Yu.

706
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,680
Even taking him on your company outing.

707
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,110
If it were someone else, they'd think something fishy was going on.

708
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,350
Blood brother and sister.

709
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,090
Blood brother and sister?

710
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:13,580
Do you want to have noodles with us?

711
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,660
No. Maybe another day. Yan Fei needs to get back.

712
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,610
Then drive carefully. We'll go in first.

713
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,200
Bye bye.

714
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:27,880
Drive carefully.

Little Piggy,

720
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,910
why is your face so red?

721
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,830
You're dripping sweat.

722
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:37,640
Did you buy the picture album?

723
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,010
No. When we got there, we couldn't find a parking space.

724
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:44,310
So the picture album sold out.

725
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:47,630
Look! I was so lucky!

726
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:50,000
I grabbed the last one.

727
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:58,430
Why are you so foolish? You rode so far. What if you get a heat stroke?

728
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:02,310
Come in with me first. If you don't dry off, you'll catch a cold.

729
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,630
Go rinse off. I'll wash and dry your clothes.

730
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:08,940
Don't do this next time. The art is not as important as you are.

731
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,170
Calling you Little Piggy is really apt. You really are a pig (stupid).

732
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:13,030
What if you get sick?

733
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,120
Get inside.

734
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,850
- I will take responsibility.
- How do you intend to take responsibility?

735
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:24,540
As a man, I can't let a child be born without a father.

736
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,220
We've finally reached a consensus.

737
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:29,480
You don't need to do this. You and Chiao An Na... aren't you doing well together?

738
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,800
- I only like you. How many times do you need me to say it?
- Do you want to cheat?

739
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,610
I'm older than you, and I am a divorcee.

740
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:38,240
Your family must have a difficult time accepting us.

741
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,580
- What are you talking about?
- You're not saying anything. That means you agree.

742
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,620
You're the only one left who cares about how I feel.

743
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:47,460
Come down, Hsiao Yu! Come help! Something's wrong!

744
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:50,280
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

745
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,920
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
