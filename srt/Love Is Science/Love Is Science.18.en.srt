1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,070
How can you ask me and your mom to accept that our son is gay?

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,710
I don't know if I am gay. All I know is that the person I love is Ou Wen.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,620
Their friends are probably as conservative as they are.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,130
The parents who aren't accepting will probably

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,100
- end up being sad.
- I will patiently wait for the day when they will accept it.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,280
I originally worried that you wouldn't adjust to living in the countryside.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,120
But after seeing what you did for the village today,

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,060
there really isn't anything that is too difficult for you.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,110
I shouldn't have forced you into an image that I wanted.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,060
Thank you for being willing to trust me and giving me space to grow.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,700
Without you, my wish couldn't have been fulfilled so quickly.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,960
What about you? What is your dream?

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,160
I really haven't properly thought about this question.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,750
Start with a dream.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,100
Start with a dream.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,880
Is this the salon that you wanted to open? You are really more of a loser than I thought.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,390
Some customers are already saying that they want to return to Voodoo for styling.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,380
Sometimes, even with an appointment, they still have to wait for a long time at the salon.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,640
We didn't have much time this time. When we have more time, we will definitely go support you.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,330
- That's right, that's right!
- Yes, yes.

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,560
It is true that we don't have enough workers at my shop.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,400
There's no way to serve three customers at a time.

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,040
I'm not sure if it's from all the preparations for the wedding recently

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,350
that has caused Li Li to become quieter.

25
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,650
I feel like between Anthony and me,

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,010
we're missing that special feeling of passion.

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,060
"That special feeling of passion?"

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,110
♫ I've written your name ♫

29
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,740
♫ Fated to be together for life ♫

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,490

48
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,340
♫ We'll be holding hands for the rest of our lives ♫

49
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,550
Love Is Science?

50
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,910
See, it's just for you.

51
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,050
Just drink a little with me.

52
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,910
Let me tell you.

53
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,790
Don't think it too much because this question has no answer.

54
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,260
It's like going to the Arctic to find penguins.

55
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,460
If you're looking for that "feeling of passion" at a marriage agency, you're at the wrong place.

56
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,900
You are exactly right.

57
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,200
Besides, at our age,

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,730
those little deer in the heart (butterflies in the stomach) have all died.

59
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,360
Feeling the butterflies is even harder than getting an orgasm. I also want to know what that feeling is like.

60
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,180
The feeling of butterflies...

61
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,830
Without you, my wish couldn't have been fulfilled so quickly.

62
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,390
What about you? What is your dream?

63
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,120
Why are you smiling so happily? Speak.

64
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,260
It's nothing.

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,540
What is it?

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,090
It's nothing.

67
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,510
When did our Fei start keeping a secret from me?

68
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,000
- Tell me.
- Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,950
A little while ago, when Hsuan Yu and I were decorating the hair salon,

70
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,080
he asked me what my dream was.

71
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,980
Not our dream

72
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,800
but my dream.

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,230
Little Piggy is quite good.

74
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,650
He deserves a toast.

75
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,230
A dream.

76
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,640
Do you know why I haven't wanted to settle down?

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,560
It's because I really can't stand

78
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,080
to be kidnapped by this idea of "us."

79
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,300
Is it really that difficult?

80
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,840
Just like your dream is your dream,

81
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,490
and my dream is to be a flight attendant.

82
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,910
Mark's dream is to be a hair-style designer.

83
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,580
Ou Wen's dream is to be a planner.

84
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,800
Each person has one's own dream. It's no one else's business.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,050
Besides, at our age,

86
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,350
it seems like no one cares what your dream is anymore.

87
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,590
The old me used to think that passionate feeling would feel earthshaking.

88
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,300
But Hsuan Yu often makes me feel those butterflies.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,630
I am twenty-seven years old, and I choose you.

90
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,190
No matter if you are thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty,

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,810
even if you've divorced, I'll always choose you.

92
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,690
Do you want your hair washed?

93
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,260
Little Piggy.

94
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,730
What are you doing here now?

95
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:06,680
I... Okay, I just waited to see if I could see you.

96
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,640
I wanted to see if you were doing well.

97
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,990
Why are you here?

98
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,650
Have you eaten?

99
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,140
Are you planning to come all the way here to join me for lunch and dinner all the time?

100
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,430
Yes. May I?

101
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,360
These are all miscellaneous little things in life.

102
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,460
It's nothing particularly special to talk about.

103
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,400
But he made me feel extraordinarily touched in the heart.

104
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,920
Our Fei is really awesome.

105
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,780
But not everyone

106
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,660
will feel touched from these miscellaneous things in life.

107
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:12,990
Only those people who can cherish what others are giving and can sense others' feelings are able to do it.

108
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,350
Actually, I wasn't that sensitive at first...

109
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,050
It's really thanks to our unusual customers.

110
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,670
They helped me to deeply appreciate how precious Hsuan Yu is.

111
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,520
This is what's called "No comparison, no harm."

112
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,330
Wait.

113
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,710
I know how to deal with

114
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,550
Miss Chu and Mr. An's problem now.

115
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,270
Alley No. 29 Hair Salon

116
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,070
Are you not off yet?

117
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,920
What's wrong?

118
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,090
I saw Sister Liu and the others coming out of another hair salon.

119
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,700
They told me candidly the reason why they went to the other salon.

120
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,170
I realized that I can't handle everything if I'm the only person working here.

121
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:15,560
Brother Chang Ching is also right about something. I am too greedy.

122
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,060
I can't want everything. I need to know what to keep and what to give up.

123
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Then... what do you plan to keep and to give up?

124
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,470
I plan to change to appointments only.

125
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,260
This way the customers won't have to wait too long.

126
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,540
Then I'll find an assistant or a stylist.

127
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,520
But I must first calculate the customer flow every day to see

128
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,510
how to break even with the rent and the cost.

129
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,610
I probably need some more time. Should I escort you home first?

130
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,900
No need. It so happens

131
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,620
that I still have some work to do.

132
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,870
You do your work first. We can leave together later.

133
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,850
♫ Always be with you ♫

134
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,640

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,460
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

143
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:02,090
Leave Mr. An to me and Sheng Ying, and you are in charge of Miss Chu then.

144
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,680
This way, please.

145
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,710
Boss, Mr. An is here.

146
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,490
You're here. Please sit.

147
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,840
Miss Yan.

148
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,650
Sheng Ying has already told you about Miss Chu's situation.

149
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,980
We plan to arrange new dates for Miss Chu.

150
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,590
No, no, I don't agree!

151
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,070
Isn't this too much?

152
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,490
If I go on new dates,

153
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,030
what will happen to Anthony?

154
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,190
This isn't good, is it?

155
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,630
Miss Chu, don't worry.

156
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,460
We will definitely notify Mr. An.

157
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,310
Mainly, I want to confirm with you.

158
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,660
Miss Chu, are you interested in going on new dates?

159
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,140
Anthony won't agree to this, will he?

160
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,230
Of course, I don't agree with it!

161
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,360
Listen to me first. I totally understand how you feel now.

162
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,490
But if I were you, I would agree.

163
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,600
Would you?

164
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,540
Miss Yan, who would let his fiancée continue to date others?

165
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,500
Do you not have confidence in yourself or in Miss Chu?

166
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,030
I am very confident in myself.

167
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,170
Okay. What if

168
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,720
Li Li likes someone else because of the new dates? What do we do?

169
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,830
What if the same thing happens after marriage?

170
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,350
Will it be better?

171
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,020
This is not just for you but for both of you.

172
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,860
Rather than getting married with doubts,

173
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,760
why not let you have a chance to make corrections?

174
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,030
Please trust us. We didn't make this decision to break you up.

175
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,890
On the contrary, I think arranging new dates for her will be positive for you.

176
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,360
Instead of letting Miss Chu marry you while thinking

177
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,990
that maybe someone else is more suitable for her,

178
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,690
it's better to let her marry you without any regrets.

179
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,330
Okay, I agree.

180
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,020
Let Li Li start new dates then.

181
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,530
Yan Fei, Yan Fei, you are a talented woman.

182
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,240
After all these years, you are still so good at it.

183
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,160
I think we can do a crossover work for the next exhibition.

184
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,700
No, no, no, no. I haven't painted in so many years.

185
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,900
Come on, don't give up. I think you are very talented.

186
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,650
You still haven't told me.

187
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,130
What is your dream?

188
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,500
"My dream?"

189
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,570
Bye bye.

190
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,570
Hello.

191
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:32,400
I remembered. I remembered the dream that I've forgotten for a long time.

192
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,050
What is it?

193
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,540
I want to paint again.

194
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,800
"To paint?"

195
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,580
I want to paint again. I want to

196
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,360
pick up the paintbrush and start painting again.

197
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,670
I also think that I may even have a small exhibition in the future.

198
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,640
Hsuan Yu, I've found what I want to do.

199
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,230
This is great. Starting from today, you are also someone with a dream.

200
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,990
Yes. I am also someone with a dream now.

201
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,620
Alley 29 Hair Salon - Stylist Needed

202
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,920
Hey.

203
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,480
Can I apply?

204
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,990
Come. Please come in!

205
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,890
Wait.

206
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,460
- Continue here.
- Okay.

207
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,140
Thanks.

208
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,050
Thanks for waiting.

209
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,850
Because your hair's split-ends and breakage are more obvious, I want to

210
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,110
apply essential oil for you. It can provide the nutrients needed by the hair

211
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,590
to help repair the damage from hair dyeing,

212
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,240
to let your hair maintain softness and flexibility for the long term. Okay?

213
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,560
You really got a good deal.

214
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,710
This Golden Extract Hair Essential Oil was carefully chosen by our boss when he started the business.

215
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,970
He really uses the best products regardless of cost.

216
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,610
It has organic Golden Jojoba Oil from Argentina and golden silk protein.

217
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:55,040
It can completely cover your hair strands. Its moisturizing effect is much better than collagen.

218
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,030
You didn't mention an important point. It doesn't need rinsing. You can feel it right after applying. It's very convenient.

219
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,810
Oh, right! Excellent ingredients and convenience!

220
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,060
The key point is that it's easy to use and effective.

221
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,920
After listening to what you said, I want to buy one to use at home!

222
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,390
We don't usually promote products.

223
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,790
However, if you like it, I can help everyone buy a group order

224
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,090
as a community service. Can I do that, Boss?

225
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,120
Don't hide good things.

226
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,760
Can I take a look?

227
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,750
Sure. Wait a moment.

228
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,600
Be careful with the steps.

229
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,900
This way, please.

230
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,580
About Anthony...

231
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,060
Don't worry. Mr. An has agreed for us to arrange new dates for you.

232
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,530
He's here.

233
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,670
Mr. Cheng.

234
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,930
Mr. Cheng has opened a young intellectuals cafe. His interests are mountain climbing and photography.

235
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,640
If you add sugar to brewed coffee, it will not only turn sour,

236
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,390
the fragrance will also be damaged. The taste will also change completely.

237
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,810
It'd be a waste of the good beans.

238
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,430
How many packets?

239
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,290
Two packets.

240
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,520
Three packets then.

241
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,580
"Three packets?"

242
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,160
Do you have a sweet tooth, too?

243
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,680
I also have a sweet tooth! Such a coincidence!

244
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,010
Miss Chu?

245
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,770
Mr. Chuang is a Chinese medicine doctor. He is really into health and self-care.

246
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,920
Sorry, what did you just say?

247
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,090
I was just saying that if you stay in an air-conditioned room too long and do not sweat,

248
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,650
it can easily make the sweat glands function less and further affect the body's detoxification.

249
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,600
I suggest that we change to the outside seating. What do you think?

250
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,040
Gift Store

251
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,590
It's too sunny outside. I'll go buy the drinks.

252
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,140
You can enjoy the car's air conditioning.

253
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,840
Mr. Li is an internet blogger. He likes watching movies and anime in his free time.

254
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,300
- Have you seen that movie, too?
- I thought that "Touch Me" is really hilarious.

255
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,200
What?

256
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,650
It's when the male lead holds his mother's hand and says, "Touch me."

257
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,380
What?

258
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,870
"Touch me"?

259
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,110
Isn't his hand too awkward?

260
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,000
Really. The dialogue also happens to be "Touch me."

261
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,500
- Such a coincidence.
- DIdn't the director see it?

262
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,300
There are probably not many people like us who are so boring.

263
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,770
- Touch me.
- Touch me.

264
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,970
Touch me.

265
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,560
Are you sure we are talking about the same movie?

266
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,720
Are you mistaken?

267
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,260
Yes, you are right.

268
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,380
I am mistaken.

269
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,940
Sorry, I have something very important to do.

270
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,510
Li Li, what's wrong? Why are you in such a rush?

271
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm sorry.

272
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:44,760
Do you really not like me or want to marry me anymore?

273
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,470
Don't talk nonsense.

274
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,190
I came to propose marriage to you.

275
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,850
What?

276
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,110
How could I forget how difficult it was to find someone who laughed at weird jokes like me,

277
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,670
and also had the same sweet tooth?

278
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:08,170
Compared to momentary butterflies, a man willing to stay home and enjoy the air conditioning,

279
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,430
putting together a 3,000-piece jigsaw puzzle not feeling it's a waste of time,

280
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,110
is someone who can stay with me to the end.

281
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:25,810
Are you still willing to keep my name on your ID card? (Taiwan ID card has the spouse's name.)

282
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,770
♫ Holding your hand tightly ♫

283
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:35,800
♫ I fell in love with you, when you're upset. I fell in love with you. You shed tears for me ♫

284
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,290
I'm willing.

285
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:41,770
♫ My angry face and the tears I shed ♫

286
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,990
♫ You understood them all ♫

287
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,740
Forever.

288
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:53,230
♫ I fell in love with you. How you missed me! You compromised for me ♫

289
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,660
♫ I missed you so I'm willing to change for you ♫

290
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,480
♫ I missed you so I'm willing to change for you ♫

291
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,880
It's a promise. When we are old,

292
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,180
we will inject insulin for each other.

293
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,640
- No one can drop out first.
- Okay.

294
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,740
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

295
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,490
- Okay.
- Boss.

296
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,150
Okay, thank you, thanks.

297
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,050
Miss Chu called to say no more dates for her.

298
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,230
Boss, Mr. An called to say we can set up the appointment to try on wedding gowns again.

299
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,390
There's a reason why they've stayed together for three years.

300
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,990
It's just that, with time, it's turned habitual.

301
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,640
And they forgot their original reason.

302
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,530
Having a romance is dating with the other person's good points.

303
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:51,110
Every surprise and romance is adding to the score.

304
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,610
But marriage is living with the other person's bad points.

305
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,840
From how to squeeze a toothpaste, how to hang a towel,

306
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,600
to who takes out the trash today, and who does housework, it's subtracting points.

307
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,630
After getting married,

308
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,960
it's too easy for people to measure each other with their own standards.

309
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,930
The good points are taken for granted, and the bad points are expanded without limits.

310
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,600
As time goes on, there will be more and more arguments.

311
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,110
Therefore, we have to constantly remind ourselves that there is no free lunch in the world.

312
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,840
If he cooks, you should wash the dishes. If he folds the clothes, you should take out the trash.

313
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,140
The couple has to understand how to appreciate and cherish each other.

314
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,800
That's how the relationship can continue long and forever.

315
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,670
What is it?

316
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,830
Do you not believe all the wisdom that I got from my blood and tears?

317
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,680
Otherwise, tell me. Who has married before? Who has divorced before?

318
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,270
Who is more experienced than me to discuss marriage?

319
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,990
Boss, how can you talk about divorce so frankly?

320
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,990
Right. You even talk about it so easily and full of wisdom.

321
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,370
How else then?

322
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:10,440
Everyone knows already. I've been through it.

323
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,270
How about this then? From now on, our Love Is Science's slogan will be

324
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,780
"Let an experienced person teach you how to skip landmines and stay fresh in marriage." How about it?

325
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,610
Or "our Love Is Science's service will be from couple matching to marriage"

326
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,870
"and extend to divorce." It'll be a one-stop shopping service.

327
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,600
Because our boss is experienced.

328
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,160
Or we should get on talk shows to chat about a man before and after marriage, discuss what the ex-husband is really like.

329
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,250
Why be so negative? You can talk about how a person who fails in marriage

330
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,050
also has the right to be happy.

331
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,850
All good. Our boss is experienced anyway.

332
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,860
To discuss giving birth while unmarried or chat about pregnancy, we will go to Boss Chiao.

333
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,520
Anyway it's good if it can help "Love Is Science," right?

334
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,080
- It certainly sounds very good.
- Right?

335
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,930
Boss, do you think...

336
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,380
Okay.

337
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,230
This way, please.

338
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,330
Have you been here for a long time?

339
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,460
It's fine, just a little while.

340
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,140
Why didn't you come in directly?

341
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,870
You looked handsome.

342
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,370
I didn't want to disturb you.

343
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,800
Hello, I'm still here.

344
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,060
I can't watch this anymore.

345
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,090
You can get off work then.

346
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,900
So lame! I haven't had a date with Ou Wen for a while, either.

347
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,700
Hurry up and go then.

348
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,350
- I'm leaving. Bye bye.
- Bye Bye.

349
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,630
Would you like your hair washed?

350
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,380
Yes.

351
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,680
Sit.

352
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,130
During this time, you worked hard. Now, let me be at your service.

353
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,700
- No need. It's okay.
- Hey.

354
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,690
You're the boss. You need to personally experience this chair to know how the customer feels.

355
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,790
Are you sure you can do it?

356
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,840
I'm the hair-washing expert. Here, let me.

357
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,410
But you're not the one washing hair. Someone usually washes your hair.

358
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:39,880
Why do you say that? Haven't you heard, a long illness makes the patient knowledgeable?

359
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,690
I paid so much tuition. I may be even better than you professionals.

360
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,900
All right.

361
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,950
Then I'll begin rinsing.

362
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,470
No worries. No worries. Lie down. It's fine!

363
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,570
Lie down. That was just a trial run. Lie down, please.

364
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,640
Later, when I formally begin, there definitely won't be a problem.

365
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,390
You just need to close your eyes and enjoy it.

366
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,130
Okay?

367
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,390
I'm starting.

368
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,740
How is it? Don't I look like a natural?

369
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,300
I'll start rinsing.

370
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,540
Why did you suddenly kiss me?

371
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,900
It's because you seduced me first!

372
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,260
How? I was clearly helping you rinse off.

373
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,880
Lie down.

374
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:13,390
♫ Turned out I was the only one playing the game ♫

375
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,400
Mr. An's case has been solved. Should we celebrate?

376
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,470
We're not going home until we're drunk!

377
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,150
I don't want to. You don't handle liquor well.

378
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,060
Hey! Why do you have to be like that?

379
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,150
Don't you think sloths are very cute?

380
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,380
How come you're here?

381
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,240
I came to find you to go on a date.

382
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,970
That's not it. We were going to deliver a midnight snack for Joanna.

383
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I already called delivery for Joanna. So later,

384
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,820
it's you and me, our time for a date.

385
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,070
I've been hungry for so many days!

386
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,260
It's too bright! I can't see a thing!

387
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,310
- Let's go!
- Go!

388
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:31,330
So annoying! I also want to be dating!

389
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,150
Mr. Wang, let me ask you.

390
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,750
What kind of hairstyle would you like today?

391
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,640
- I am planning to go on a date with my girlfriend later.
- Oh?

392
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,690
I'd like a handsome, fashionable hairstyle.

393
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,930
No problem! I'm the best at it.

394
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,110
After I finish, I promise she'll fall in love with you again.

395
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:16,950
Are you sure my girlfriend would like... this style?

396
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,060
I think it's very cute.

397
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,360
Otherwise, let's try another one.

398
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,890
Yes.

399
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,210
Do you not like it?

400
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,120
Okay.

401
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,860
So is this the type you like?

402
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,440
I like it as long as it's you.

403
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:04,160
Are you free this weekend? I'd like to invite Mrs. Yan to a meal.

404
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,820
With my mom? Why?

405
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,970
Your mom has been worried about you.

406
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,760
I want her to know that I started dating you with the intent to marry.

407
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:24,630
It's really not necessary. No need. She is very busy.

408
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,880
You know that she exaggerates a lot.

409
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,200
Aren't you worried that she will nag you at every mealtime to marry me?

410
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,610
Then we'll get married.

411
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,160
But you just opened your salon.

412
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,310
You should place your attention on work. How we are dating

413
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,290
and supporting each other, isn't it great?

414
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,610
But I want to be responsible for you.

415
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,030
But I really don't want to get married.

416
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,030
What? Did you refuse Wang Hsuan Yu just like that?

417
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,070
Yes. How else would I refuse him?

418
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,540
Our little Hsuan Yu is so pitiful. He must be doubting himself now.

419
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,660
He must be thinking, "Yan Fei doesn't like me anymore. That's why she doesn't want to marry me."

420
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,220
How could that be? It's because I don't want to marry.

421
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,450
It's not that I don't want to marry him.

422
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:34,380
What's the difference? Isn't it the same to him?

423
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,970
I think Wang Hsuan Yu has to be very old-fashioned.

424
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,360
When he falls in love, he wants to marry. When he marries, he will want children.

425
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,090
In his marriage dictionary, there are only loving forever and growing old together.

426
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,260
The word "divorce" doesn't exist.

427
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,880
Let me tell you, it could be that if you die, he would even stay chaste for you.

428
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,570
He will also talk to your memorial tablet, "I miss you, Yan Fei."

429
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,660
Why are you making him sound so scary?

430
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,950
I just want to remind you that

431
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,450
if you don't want to marry him because you were married before,

432
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,910
it's really unfair to him.

433
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:14,030
You are essentially punishing him for the mistake of your previous marriage.

434
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,550
How am I punishing him?

435
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,400
I just don't want him to marry me only because he wants to "be responsible."

436
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,820
He doesn't know how scary marriage is, but I do.

437
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,460
Besides, don't you remember? The system showed Wang Hsuan Yu and I scored only 29 points as a couple.

438
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,650
Twenty-nine points!

439
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,730
It means that we have 71% of mutual conflicts between us.

440
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,920
Either he has to back down or I must.

441
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,820
- Isn't that how learning to adjust to each other works?
- Right!

442
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,030
But the worst kind of adjusting process is when two people are clearly in love,

443
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:49,920
but each makes the choice one hates in order to accommodate the other.

444
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,640
Aren't you overthinking this? Isn't Hsuan Yu very nice?

445
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,530
Being nice doesn't mean he's without principles. He is nice but has his own temper.

446
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:08,600
Besides, let me tell you. We already fought a lot over choosing the salon's location.

447
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,960
Did you fight?

448
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,490
That's why I really don't want to

449
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,660
change our current relationship for now.

450
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,480
It's really easy to fall in love but difficult to get along.

451
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,590
Have you told these to Hsuan Yu?

452
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,930
Tell Hsuan Yu? Why tell him?

453
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,210
Right, why not tell Hsuan Yu?

454
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,750
Marriage proposal is such an important matter.

455
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,460
And you just casually put it out there. It won't do.

456
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,090
Exactly. The marriage proposal is a really sacred ceremony.

457
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,030
Did you go down on one knee?

458
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,300
Did you prepare a little surprise?

459
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,110
Don't you at least have a ring?

460
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,090
Silly Youth, how could you propose with nothing?

461
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,950
Sister Liu, you are a real professional.

462
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:20,190
So how did Brother Liu propose to you back then?

463
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,450
So back then, your brother Liu dressed up

464
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,860
in a dashing suit...

465
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,090
He asked me to go eat a western-style meal.

466
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,620
Then he asked me if I would marry him.

467
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,830
Of course, I said I was willing.

468
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:56,970
Thinking back, your uncle Lo asked me to go see the city lights.

469
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,360
Look at the meteor!

470
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,370
Where?

471
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,890
Look!

472
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,080
And then I said,

473
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,530
"I do."

474
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:17,400
My Chun asked me to go to the beach all those years ago.

475
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,720
"Will you marry me?"

476
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,410
I do.

477
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,740
That's how I was kidnapped by my old man.

478
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,940
Do you see?

479
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,090
They've been married so many years, but they still look so vivacious when they talk about the proposal.

480
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,400
Wouldn't a good proposal take you to paradise?

481
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:05,740
So stop over-analyzing. The problem is that you aren't romantic enough.

482

Do you see?

487
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:48,670
They've been married so many years, but they still look so vivacious when they talk about the proposal.

488
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,970
Wouldn't a good proposal take you to paradise?

489
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,270
So stop over-analyzing. The problem is that you aren't romantic enough.

490
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,870
Hey.

491
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,910
I'm meeting a wedding planning provider. Who wants to go with me?

492
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,680
Sheng Ying.

493
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,020
I'm meeting a new customer so I can't leave.

494
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,840
Then Ou Wen?

495
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,940
I've been dealing with Miss Chu's case so I still have much info to—

496
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,140
No problem. I'll go by myself then.

497
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,630
- You do your work.
- Bye bye.

498
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,340
Bye bye.

499
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,160
- Bye, Boss.
- Bye bye.

500
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,880
Has everyone received the invitation?

501
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,720
Of course.

502
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,930
I've received it, too.
Hsuan Yu's Proposal Team

503
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:59,170
I can't believe that I'm lucky enough to see the exciting view of Boss being proposed to.

504
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,150
Last time, when Mr. Wu and Miss Cho got together, you cried so much that your eyeliner smeared.

505
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:08,520
When the Boss gets her proposal, I hope your makeup won't become a mud flood.

506
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,640
That's right. Since you mention it, I need to switch to waterproof eyeliner and fix my makeup.

507
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,100
I need to do the same. Let's do it together.

508
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,870
Breathe out. One, two, three.

509
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,270
Four. Suck in your belly button. Five.

510
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:32,620
Six, seven, eight. Breathe in.

511
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,930
Raise your upper body slowly.

512
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,500
Raise your arms to your shoulders.

513
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,630
Tai Ou Wen

514
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,950
Oh my gosh!

515
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,130
It's nothing. Keep driving.

516
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,980
It's very pretty.
Marry Me

517
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,690
This will work. It has the feels.

518
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,980
Right, spread some rose petals here.

519
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,440
Did you buy the ring?

520
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,510
Spread it for me.
Love Is Science

521
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,550
Marry Me

522
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,280
Is it okay to decorate it like this?

523
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,890
I was planning on doing something simple and warm.

524
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,460
Madam Yan Wu Chun Fung sponsored all these.

525
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,530
She was planning on putting two balloon figures outside by the front door,

526
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,950
but I was afraid that would spoil the surprise. So I let her put up some balloons inside the office.

527
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,190
This is Madam Yan Wu Chun Fung's style.

528
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:44,250
If we had more time, she would hire an orchestra to serenade.

529
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,880
When is Yan Fei coming back?

530
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,820
In about ten minutes.

531
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,550
We should get ready.

532
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,430
Hurry up, everyone. Let's finish it up.

533
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,420
Okay.

534
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,070
Do you think Yan Fei will say yes?

535
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:07,520
With such a nicely prepared proposal, I can't think of a reason for her to say no to you.

536
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,230
Do you need help?

537
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,760
- Bye bye!
- Bye!

538
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,210
- Bye bye!
- See you next time.

539
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,130
- We're leaving!
- Bye!

540
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,330
What is this?

- Everything is ready, right?
- It's ready.

543
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,630
We will split to two sides.

544
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,090
- One second.
- Okay.

545
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,610
- Hello, Boss Chiao.
-Tai Ou Wen, what are you guys doing?

546
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,590
Is Wang Hsuan Yu next to you? Give him the phone.

547
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,270
Okay.

548
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,860
Give me one second.

549
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,680
Okay.

550
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,650
Hsuan Yu, Boss Chiao asked to speak to you.

551
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,970
Me?

552
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,820
Thanks.

553
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,930
- Hello?
- Wang Hsuan Yu.

554
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,810
I know that you really really like Yan Fei.

555
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:35,130
But trust me, do not propose right now.

556
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,650
It's easy to just buy the ring.

557
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,700
And it's easy to propose.

558
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,770
But marriage is the beginning of the disaster.

559
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,940
No, it will be fine. Trust me.

560
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,820
Okay. Let me ask you a basic question.

561
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,780
Where are you two going to live after getting married?

562
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:05,150
Are you going to have Yan Fei sharing the little room you have above Ju Yueh Noodle Shop,

563
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,130
or are you moving in with Yan Fei at her mother's mansion?

564
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,290
Yan Fei just wants to have a relationship with you.

565
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:20,210
It will get really awkward if you do this. Believe me.

566
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,680
Thank you for telling me this.

567
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,220
I understand.

568
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,140
What's wrong?

569
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:57,730
I'm sorry, everyone. The proposal is canceled for now.

570
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:01,320
What? Why?

571
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,210
Okay, let's put everything away.

572
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,920
All right.

573
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,140
What's going on here?

574
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,890

This...

590
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,170
- Is this...
- No.

591
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,200
Don't tell me it's...

592
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,750
Everyone is here.

593
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,100
Right?

594
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,770
Actually, today is

595
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,340
me proposing to Tai Ou Wen.

596
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,720
What?

597
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,640
Oh, yes.

598
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,140
That's right. That's it.

599
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,660
Is he proposing to Ou Wen?

600
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,050
Yes.

601
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,400
Say yes! Say yes!

602
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,210
Say yes! Say yes!

603
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,300
Which one would you like to take a look at?

604
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:44,940
- This one.
- This one?

605
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,590
Here.

606
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,790
I would like to look at this one.

607
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,230
Okay.

608
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,050
Here.

609
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:12,030
You are not the only person who should take up the responsibility to your other half.

610
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,140
It's me, too.

611
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:21,040
Do you like it?

612
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,590
In the past,

613
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,000
we were both the impossible choice for the other person.

614
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,590
Hey.

615
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,060
Hey!

616
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,490
But now,

617
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:52,790
it's impossible for me to be without you.

Thank you for showing up for me when I need you the most.

My delayed realization

620
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,040
made you suffer a lot.

621
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,480
I promise you

622
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:27,120
that I will never let you cry.

623
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,180
I love you.

624
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,570
Tai Ou Wen,

625
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,800
are you willing to be my other half?

626
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,310
Mark...

627
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,840
You're too much!

628
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,220
Go! Go! Go!

629
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,310
Go! Go! Go!

630
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,110
Go, Mark!

631
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,300
Go! Go!

632
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,790
Okay.

633
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,410
This is me.

634
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,410
I'm going up. Thanks for everything.

00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,610
I need to take pictures for them.

636
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,260
You do know what it means to exchange rings, right?

637
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,760
I know.

638
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,540
It means that from now on,

639
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,330
you will be mine and mine only.

640
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,410
This is so nice!

641
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:29,020
Oh!

642
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,120
I'll use the 360-degree lens to take a picture.

643
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,820
At least someone has a successful proposal today.

644
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,140
Hello, everybody.

645
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,690
The climactic champagne is here!

646
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,490
What are you doing here?

647
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,270
Baby,

648
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,300
I didn't miss the most important moment, did I?

649
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,600
No ring.

650
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,130
But I will say it first!

651
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,410
I want to wish that you be the happiest couple

652
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:20,470
and grow old together!

653
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,320
- Aunty...
- What are you talking about?

654
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,510
- We didn't...
- Quiet.

655
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,310
Why are you still calling me Aunty?

656
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,970
So distant.

657
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:29,340
I don't mind at all.

658
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,840
Just call me Mom now.

659
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,380
W-Wait a second!

660
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,490
Why should he call you Mom?

661
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:40,710
Why are you dressed up like this and bringing a bottle of champagne to the office?

662
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:44,280
We planned it, didn't we? We are here to help Hsuan Yu

663
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,980
propose to you!

Hello, everybody.

667
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,950
The climactic champagne is here!

668
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:25,240
What are you doing here?

669
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,470
Baby,

670
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:30,480
I didn't miss the most important moment, did I?

671
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,780
No ring.

672
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:38,340
But I will say it first!

673
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,630
I want to wish that you be the happiest couple

675
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,600
- Aunty...
- What are you talking about?

676
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,660
- We didn't...
- Quiet.

00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,590
propose to you!

685
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:13,050
- What?
- Hi.

686
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,050
Oh, hi!

687
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:18,080
Hello!

688
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,690
I got the invitation.

689
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:26,980

691
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:44,440
I know I'm not ready yet.

692
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,460
If I propose to you now,

693
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,630
it will be a burden for both of us.

694
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:52,090
That's why...

695
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,060
I do.

696
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,720
Here.

697
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,400
I said, "I do."

698
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,540
I do.

699
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:50,020
I'm so happy! Congratulations!

700
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,700
Hey, everybody! Right?

701
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:22,360
I thought you were not planning on getting married.

702
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,330
What made you change your mind?

703
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,330
I don't know, either.

704
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:37,480
I really didn't think it's the right time for us to get married.

705
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,700
But when I saw you looking so disappointed, I felt bad.

706
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,610
Look at you... being impulsive again.

707
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:08,940
You told me that if you are being impulsive, I should stop you.

708
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,490
Give the ring back to me.

709
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:29,270
I want to get married, but I don't want to control you.

710
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:35,870
When we both are ready, you can say, "I do."

711
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:41,850
For now, let us just enjoy being in love.

712

727
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:12,690
You came with me for check-ups, shopping, and prepared all the things parents should prepare.

728
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:16,610
We are family. Why are you being so polite?

729
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,800
These two are nice.

730
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,650
- This one is cute! I want to wear this.
- Try it on.

731
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,770
Okay, okay.
Fit and Support

732
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,280
I'm so happy.

733
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,480
This one is over NT$1000 ($36 U.S.)?

734
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,290
Didn't my sister give you some of her used ones?

735
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:43,790
Your sister is fifteen kilos heavier than me. Hers are too loose for me.

736
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:45,090
We will buy second-hand ones online.

737
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:48,070
"Second-hand?" We won't know what the quality is like.

738
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:50,700
What was it? Was it comfortable?

739
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,570
It's so comfortable.

740
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:55,300
It's cute. Look at this one.

741
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,490
Did you book the postpartum care center?

742
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,370
Didn't we agree that my mother will come help?

743
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,440
I didn't agree to it.

744
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:08,520
The world is so interesting. The real father only cares about money.

745
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,790
And the one who isn't the father is more like family.

746
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:14,920
Do you want to try this one?

747
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:21,000
Excuse me, may I share the table with you?

748
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,060
- Okay.
- Thanks.

749
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:49,650
Sometimes, we think happiness is so far from us.

750
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:55,490
But sometimes, happiness can be so close.

751
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:59,120
What's your name?

752
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,310
Qiao Qiao. The first word is like chocolate, and the second is like knocking.

753
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:05,890
Qiao Qiao. Why this name?

754
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:16,770
Your business is doing so well. It's hard for us three to book appointments at the same time.

755
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:18,400
That's right.

756
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,760
Starting next month, we will move to the bigger place down the street.

757
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,790
- And we will be hiring more stylists.
- Really?

758
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:30,030
No need. We already have the right candidates.

759
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,490
Last week, I had dinner with some Voodoo stylists.

760
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,340
Che Ling and Hsuan Hsuan also decided not to work for Royal Taipei.

761
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,590
So I asked them if they wanted to join us.

762
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,560
Really?

763
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:50,690
Not everyone wants to go to Royal Taipei. Many of them agree with you.

764
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:55,460
That's so great! We can finally do our hair together.

765
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,460
That's right!

766
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,360
- Thank you, Ladies.
- Go, Hsuan Yu!

767
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:05,760
When I was little, I thought my dream was to make my loved ones happy.

768
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,810
When I grew up, I discovered that daring to dream and make it come true

769
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:13,990
will make me become the person I want.

770
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:17,370
♫ Put work aside for now
Let's recharge this weekend ♫

771

♫ Little blessings make everyday special ♫

♫ Right now I want to release my stress
Dance and sing all night long ♫

775
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:37,360
♫ Express the prettiest part of me
Before tomorrow comes ♫

776
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:50,160
How's the exhibition planning going?

777
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:56,590
I'm doing an exhibition with my classmates so it's not that bad.

778
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:03,970
Keep painting. Maybe one day, you can have your own exhibition.

779
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,430
Yes, maybe.

780
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,680
What should I do?

781
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,070
Is it good?

782
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,090
Very.

783
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:44,140
Love is science, marriage is chemistry, and life is philosophy.

784
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:47,380
No matter what the matching score is,

785
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:51,550
no matter if the other person is your ideal type,

786
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:55,270
the only thing to do is to work hard so you can "graduate"

787
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:59,260
and find your own method of being happy together.

788
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:18,070
The End

789
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:32,340
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

790
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,170
It can't be seen nor be discovered.

01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:41,440
♫ Are you planning to stop responding? ♫

792
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:47,810
♫ Finding excitement in an absurd relationship ♫

793
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:52,740
♫ My melancholy and my monochromatic world ♫

794
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:58,320
♫ Have become the most laughable accessories ♫

795
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:03,930
♫ In the end, you're so far away ♫

796
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:09,660
♫ You became a pointless, transparent existence ♫

797
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:15,740
♫ I thought it was only because I came late ♫

798
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:23,690
♫ Turned out I was the only one playing the game ♫

799
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:29,390
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

800
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:35,470
♫ Fantasize about a romantic love ♫

801
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:41,350
♫ While lonely, thinking of someone ♫

802
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:46,760
♫ He will come and warm you up ♫

803
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:52,320
♫ I think what you sometime remembered ♫

804
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:58,020
♫ Is for "just in case" ♫

805
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:03,350
♫ To treat the hug you give me ♫

806
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:11,530
♫ As something to bring you warmth ♫
