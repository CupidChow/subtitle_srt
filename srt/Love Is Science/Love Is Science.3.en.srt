1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,590
There's a type of "good" that refers to "good intentions" from your friends.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,380
I call it "Asian Pressure."

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,020
Please respect my client, Sir.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,470
- Hey! You—
- What does this have to do with you, Sir?

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,430
I heard that this temple is very effective.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,960
But I also got this fortune that says marriage is unlikely.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,200
If you can get it done, I will join immediately.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,400
Today is that one day of the month.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,340
It has already been nine years since your divorce. You're still wearing your wedding ring.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,160
You just don't want to admit you regret the divorce.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,540
What? Did you get into an accident?

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,990
Whose car accident were you spouting nonsense about on the phone?

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,090
I didn't expect to see you here. Player.

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,920
- I'm not a player.
- Little Piggy, you're so cute.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,100
Did you forget that your brother and I are already married?

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,390
May I ask Ms. Yan Fei, are you willing to accept hairstylist Number 29's invitation?

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,080
You better tell me the truth!

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,530
We only went to the hair salon where he works to wash my hair.

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,400
If one day, my goddess appears in front of me,

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,830
I can help cut and style her hair.

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,360
♫ I've written your name ♫

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,070
♫ Fated to be together for life ♫

43
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,570
Love Is Science?

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,490
What are you doing?

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,420
Million Convenience Store

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,980
Welco—

47
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,660
Small (Ice)

48
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,130
Ring me up.

49
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,280
Hurry!

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,120
Voodoo

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,880
Sorry, sorry. I thought it was the air conditioner that was blowing on me so when I opened my eyes

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,690
and saw you there, I... just reacted.

54
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,550
Sorry.

55
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,230
I was originally afraid of waking you up,

56
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,220
but I unexpectedly scared you.

57
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,680
I was the one who scared you, right? I'm so ridiculous.

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,540
At my age, no one would be interested in me.

59
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,510
Who said so?

60
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,630
The data.

61
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,720
My company's matching system shows

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,890
the most popular women are the young, beautiful girls under 25.

63
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,520
Male members, regardless of age,

64
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,130
will definitely choose the younger ones when given the choice.

65
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,850
Of course, there are outliers (exceptions), but those are rare. They only make up about 5% of the whole.

66
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,890
Especially the kind who have been divorced before...

67
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,050
I was talking about our female members' circumstances.

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,840
In any case, I'm almost in the unwanted five percent.

69
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,720
I don't care about some data.

70
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,770
I'm twenty-seven years old, and I choose you.

71
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,880
No matter how old you are: 30, 40, 50, or 60.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,460
Even if you were divorced, I would choose you.

73
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,440
Why?

74
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,030
Because it's you.

75
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,250
No matter how old you are, you are still you.

76
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,940
Of course, it is under the premise of having that choice.

77
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,360
You're already married so I can't choose you.

78
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,990
Let me (hold it).

79
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,960
Although you're just saying those things to encourage me,

80
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,090
I'm very happy to hear it.

81
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,480
I'm serious.

82
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,790
Have you forgotten the spectacle at your high school graduation?

83
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,120
Wow, those pursuers of yours filled up and blocked the whole hallway.

84
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,640
Afterward, you told me to sell those flowers they gifted you to the flower shop.

85
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,800
I even made a few thousand out of that.

86
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,320
So... age or even...

87
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,740
divorce status is not important at all.

88
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,590
In a certain moment or in someone's eyes, you are the one.

89
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,230
Little Piggy, you're basically a little angel who walks among humans.

90
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,750
Thank you for your one good deed a day.

91
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,450
Having you as my cheerleader

92
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,210
is really great!

93
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,230
I don't care about some data.

94
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm 27 years old, and I choose you.

95
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,390
No matter how old you are: 30, 40, 50, or 60.

96
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,880
Even if you were divorced, I would choose you.

97
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,460
Divorce Agreement

98
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,430
I originally thought that a divorce was just

99
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,280
the separation of two people who no longer loved each other.

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,340
At that moment, I realized

101
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,490
that separating and being abandoned are different things.

102
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,290
Feeling abandoned made me seem

103
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,890
like a piece of gum that has been spit out because it lost its flavor.

104
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,630
Divorced status is not important at all.

105
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,620
In a certain moment or in someone's eyes,

106
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,540
you are the one.

107
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,220
For a piece of gum like me,

108
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,470
being acknowledged once again

109
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,560
has really given me great comfort.

110
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,250
Thanks, Little Piggy.

111
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,170
You've finally redeemed yourself now.

112
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,610
I don't think I've ever heard her mention her husband before.

113
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,660
For a couple to be separated in two places,

114
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,710
not living together and not seeing each other often,

115
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,250
is that normal?

116
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,880
Wang Hsuan Yang, how many times did I tell you? If you didn't shower, you're not allowed to lay in bed.

117
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,980
Wife, I'm really tired today. Can I—

118
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,890
No. Get out. I don't want to see you.

119
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,030
Don't be mad. Don't be mad. Don't forget that you're pregnant, okay?

120
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,740
Go away!

121
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,650
It seems like all married couples are like this.

122
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,590
I've never been married so I'm just making a problem out of nothing.

123
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,610
Miss Cho, I've gone through your information.
 Love Is Science

124
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,030
You own a car, a house, and are debt-free.

125
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,750
You can live very well on your own, too.

126
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,600
Why do you want to get married all of a sudden? And in three months?

127
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,480
This is...

128
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,430
The groom was my ex-boyfriend.

129
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,830
I want to get married before him, even if it is only by one day.

130
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,460
Miss Cho, may I dare ask if you still love him?

131
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,900
Love?

132
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,460
Why would I love a man who wasted my youth and betrayed me?

133
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,810
I chose to break up.

134
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,930
I wasn't abandoned.

135
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,610
Because I believed that I deserve a better man.

136
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,350
I will prove to him that he is wrong.

137
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,310
He is extremely wrong.

138
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,240
Well said.

139
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,840
I've seen your seminars online.

140
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,480
I agree with you very much. Marriage is like finding a business partner.

141
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,450
I believe with my background and your professionalism,

142
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,890
you can help me find my best business partner very quickly.

143
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,290
Miss Cho, I've already filled out your basic information.

144
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,830
Please spend some time filling out the questionnaire below.

145
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,830
"How many boyfriends have you had before?"

146
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,820
"What about your ex-boyfriend were you attracted to most?"

147
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,770
"What did your ex-boyfriend do that you could not stand most?"

148
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,440
"What was the most unforgettable memory you had with your ex-boyfriend?"

149
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,900
I've already said this before;

150
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,910
ex-boyfriends are in the past. I don't understand why I have to answer these questions.

151
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,170
Miss Cho...

152
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,700
If two strangers want to be a perfect match, what do you think is the most important thing?

153
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,960
Education, experience, or financial abilities?

154
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,160
All of them, right?

155
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,010
All three are important, but the most important is having the same values.

156
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,990
A member once said that the most unforgettable memory

157
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,080
was when she accidentally farted in the elevator.

158
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,820
She felt so embarrassed that she wanted to disappear from the face of the earth.

159
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,200
Unexpectedly, her boyfriend at the time took the initiative to apologize to everyone, saying that he was the one who farted.

160
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,810
So in comparison to other conditions, that member cares more about

161
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,910
being protected.

162
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,100
So Miss Cho, what did your ex-boyfriend do that you couldn't stand most?

163
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,990
He relied on me for a living, yet he still cheated.

164
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,150
What about him were you attracted to most?

165
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,190
His personality was great. When I yelled at him, he didn't talk back.

166
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,810
So in comparison to education and experience, you care more about someone who'll accept you.

167
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:26,720
In comparison to financial abilities, you care more about someone who's loyal, right?

168
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,420
Loyal? That's the most fundamental, isn't it?

169
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,850
That may not be.

170
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,270
Some members view financial abilities as more important than loyalty.

171
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,860
Okay.

172
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,920
Even though there's a lot of questions, I still ask that you answer them honestly.

173
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,050
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

174
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,820
Voodoo

175
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,020
You normally hate taking jobs for music video shoots,

176
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,520
yet you actually volunteered today.

177
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,190
Could it be because it is Stella's MV (music video)?

178
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,000
Obviously.

179
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,250
Do you know how lucky I am to be able to stand in close proximity to my wife and do her hair?

180
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,810
I'm going to say this now, the Nation's Wife goes to me,

181
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,790
and the Nation's Mistress is all yours.

182
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,260
Her name is Hsueh Er, not Mistress.

183
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,340
She's just someone who acts (TV roles) as the mistress often, that's all.

184
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,270
You can say it like that,

185
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,780
but I heard that her personality is really bad.

186
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,370
Who did you hear that from?

187
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,150
She just looks like a bad woman.

188
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,890
Wrong.

189
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,130
You stay away from Stella.

190
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,600
Today, Hsuan Yu is responsible for Stella.

191
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,700
- Why?
- "Why?"

192
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,800
I hired you to work, not to chase after celebrities.

193
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,820
Bring out your professionalism. Don't embarrass Voodoo.

194
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,770
You two are not allowed to switch secretly.

195
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,900
I will check.

196
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,340
Finally.

197
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,410
Okay, let me take a look.

198
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:00,080
From your keyword analysis, you require that your partner has financial abilities and independence.

199
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,220
We will arrange dates for you with these two in mind.

200
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,080
During the matching, we may not find someone to completely fit the criteria

201
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,220
so we will forgo some traits according to the circumstances.

202
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,170
For example, older than forty, successful career, handsome,

203
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,060
effectively gets things done, funny, gentle, filial, and not against flash marriages.

204
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,620
You will probably only find those traits in a romance novel about a domineering boss or a scam.

205
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,120
I understand. Let's go according to your plans.

206
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,930
If you don't have any other questions, let's sign the contract.

207
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,430
Cho Nai Hui

208
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,580
D*mn, it's the mistress.

209
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,340
Hello, please sit here.

210
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,960
I'm going to straighten your hair first.

211
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,350
Then I will add some hairpieces to your bangs to add volume to it.

212
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,990
Okay, please take care of me then.

213
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,450
Okay.

214
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,910
Here. Here.

215
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,980
Stella is here!

216
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,350
She is here. My national wife, the goddess, Stella.

217
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,670
Good morning.

218
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,230
Excuse me. I'm going to explain everything to you. In order to complement today's outfit,

219
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,160
- we—
- Just do it first. There's not much time.

220
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,570
Okay.

221
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,860
Here, Stella.

222
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,590
Here.

223
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,100
- I don't want apples. I want dates.
- Okay.

224
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,190
How long has it been since she washed her hair?

225
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,790
It is fine.

226
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,180
Hey, what are you feeling about for?

227
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,220
Why aren't you doing anything? Does your family control time? Do you think we have a lot of time?

228
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,200
We only have thirty minutes before the shoot. If you don't get her hairstyle done by then,

229
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,370
are you going to take responsibility for it? No, I mean can you afford to take responsibility for it?

230
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,970
Speed up!

231
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,880
Okay. I'm sorry. I will do it as fast as I can.

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,220
Is this comfortable?

233
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,820
Is there anything else that needs to be altered?

234
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,610
Is this all right?

235
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,740
- If you need any alterations, I can—
- Enough.

236
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,760
Hello? Chien Chang Ching.

237
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,450
You asked us to give your salon a chance, right?

238
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,580
I gave you guys a chance

239
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,430
and let you guys make some money.

240
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,130
Are you messing with me?

241
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:32,160
What kind of rotten hairstylist did you find? His skills are horrible, and he is slow.

242
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,330
We only have thirty minutes until the shoot.

243
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,360
Hurry up and send a replacement. Someone whose skills are on par with yours, all right?

244
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,020
Keep in mind to not let those "stray cats and dogs" (nobodies) that you keep at your salon

245
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,760
come here to ruin my Stella's hair, okay?

246
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,820
Voodoo

247
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,660
It is so late. Are you still waiting for me?

248
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,100
Hey. You are... Chiao An Na's friend.

249
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,510
That... Not-destined Sister-in-law.

250
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,480
Did Hsuan Yu not stay today?

251
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:30,190
Today, Hsuan Yu... wasn't in the best state so he left.

252
00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:00,040
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

253
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,570
Are you asleep? Do you want to eat a midnight snack?

254
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,690
Do you want to walk around in Twatutia?

255
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,790
I heard there will be fireworks.

256
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,120
Wang Hsuan Yu! Hey!

257
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,630
Wang Hsuan Yu! Hey!

258
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,970
D*mn it.

259
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,190
Here we go.

260
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,060
Are you a delinquent child from the village?

261
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,390
Throwing rocks and breaking my window in the middle of the night.

262
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,480
Did I unknowingly do something to offend you?

263
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,780
I'm sorry.

264
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,620
I was afraid of waking Hsuan Yang and Sister-in-law up so I used this method to get your attention.

265
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,380
I just accidentally...

266
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,050
It's a good thing they weren't angry.

267
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,190
You could have called me.

268
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,870
Well, you have to pick up.

269
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,520
You really... did... call... many times.

270
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,590
Do you have urgent matters concerning me?

271
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,470
Didn't you bump into the corner... that day?

272
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,030
I want to see if you are better.

273
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,360
I-I'm fine.

274
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,090
Okay. Then do you want to eat a midnight snack?

275
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,820
Okay. Let me think about what there is to get.

276
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,130
What do you want to eat?

277
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,630
What kind of midnight snack is this?

278
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,060
Even if there's no chicken cutlet or pearl milk tea, we should at least have some popcorn chicken, right?

279
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,770
Once you pass thirty, how could your metabolism possibly break those things down?

280
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:52,390
Don't worry, veggie sticks taste quite good if you really savor them.

281
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:08,170
This clearly tastes like... a punishment you get for losing a game of truth or dare.

282
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,530
No, really, did I unknowingly make you angry?

283
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,600
Just eat. Why so much nonsense?

284
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,640
Haven't you ever heard that vegetables are humans' best friends?

285
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,630
Isn't that supposed to be dogs?

286
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,710
Do you know when tomatoes are fruit and when they are vegetables?

287
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,000
When it's stir-fried, it's a vegetable, and

288
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,640
- when it's eaten raw, it's a fruit.
- Wrong!

289
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,230
According to biology, tomatoes are fruit. The U.S. government,

290
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:54,570
in order to get more tax money, taxed it as a vegetable.

291
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,020
Do you know what is a relative to carrots?

292
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,080
- Daikon.
- Wrong! It is this!

293
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,590
Daikon is Brassicales (4 petals). Carrot is Apiaceae (5 petals).

294
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,100
Their flowers have five petals.

295
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,860
You came to see me because you have something to talk to me about, right?

296
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,930
There's no way you came to see me in the middle of the night just to eat carrots.

297
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,730
Do you know what's the difference between growing up and maturing?

298
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:47,000
Growing up is understanding things you didn't know before.

299
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,100
Maturing is understanding things but pretending not to.

300
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,480
Did you go to the salon?

301
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,240
I didn't mean to keep it in.

302
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:09,240
I just think that it's a little embarrassing.

303
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,310
A little... shameful.

304
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,420
What is there to be embarrassed or ashamed about?

305
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,200
Don't you remember that I told you never to think that way?

306
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,360
There will be a day when they regret it.

307
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,840
Looking back now, is that true?

308
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,820
Little Piggy, you are the best.

309
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,220
No one can say you're not good enough. Yourself included.

310
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,090
Understand?

311
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,190
Can I ask you a favor?

312
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,760
Go ahead.

313
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,790
Next time you come with midnight snacks, can you bring chicken cutlets and pearl milk tea?

314
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,390
Please don't bring veggie sticks.

315
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,210
Do you know...

316
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,900
what was the first vegetable to go to space?

317
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,150
Carrots!

318
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:42,240
Why carrots? I'm not a rabbit.

319
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,860
Lab 33 Restaurant and Bar

320
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,800
Miss Cho, please sit.

321
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,850
Are you going to a meeting later?

322
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,510
I have a meeting in the evening so I hope that things will be efficient and quick.

323
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,880
Why have you changed your clothing style today?

324
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,960
Because...

325
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,850
Because planners are supposed to accentuate members,

326
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,680
not to outshine them.

327
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,010
I think this is quite nice.

328
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,790
Here, Miss Cho. This the first person for your arranged date.

329
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,500
The first person is a partner in a well-known accounting firm.
[Tu Ming Chien. Pairing Index: 93%]

330
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,130
He specializes in tax planning.

331
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,740
My life has always gone according to plan.

332
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,930
I got my accounting license at age 28.

333
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,730
I became a partner of my firm at age 35.

334
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,720
I reached financial freedom at age 40.

335
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,160
I first established my career before I start a family.

336
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,760
I will turn 42 years old this year so I'm not that young anymore.

337
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,620
I wish to get married within half a year.

338
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,380
I also wish to get married soon.

339
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,570
This is my health report.
 Personal Health Report

340
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:25,120
I hope you can provide a health report from this past year, Miss Cho.

341
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,930
This is the CEO of a technology factory.

342
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,640
He's a golden bachelor.

343
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,440
However, he also has high expectations.

344
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,130
Before this, I've heard of

345
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,060
Miss Cho's management over a financial technology merger.

346
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,590
It's an honor to meet you in person today.

347
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,130
- In the finance industry–
- Speaking of which,

348
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,720
I'm reminded of when I led Anpec

349
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,730
in changing course to developing chips.

350
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,120
Everyone doubted me but I stood my ground against majority opinion...

351
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,970
The third person is a very well-known research and development engineer.

352
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,350
He started his own business when he was still in school.

353
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,490
He has created a lot of very popular apps.

354
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:24,050
So... you aren't born in 1968?

355
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,490
Are you 68 years old?

356
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,830
Voodoo

357
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,480
We haven't even investigated the situation yet.

358
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,460
Yes. Please calm down first. Don't be mad.

359
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,790
It may not be our Hsuan Yu who leaked the news.

360
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,520
Startline news on Stella, the nation's wife, known to be gentle and kind, "Thinks she's important and has poor personal hygiene!"

361
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,120
Stella is deemed "the nation's wife" for her sweet, pretty girl image. Staff at the MV shoot yesterday said she was very rude, uncaring, and her oily hair produced smoke as it touched the curling iron.

362
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,450
All right, I will take care of that.

363
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,850
Please give me some time.

364
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,780
They clearly don't have proof of who leaked it.

365
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,850
Why are they asking our boss to turn someone over?

366
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,740
I was the one who clearly offended Stella that day.

367
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,550
It's reasonable for them to suspect me.

368
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,090
I know it wasn't you.

369
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,600
- Hsuan Yu.
- Yes?

370
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,420
Come here.

371
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,600
It's okay.

372
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,780
I'm sorry.

373
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,860
Why are you sorry?

374
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,220
I know it wasn't you.

375
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,690
Maybe it was me.

376
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,540
You?

377
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,190
You don't even have FB. Do you even know how to leak news online?

378
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,450
Do you even know where to submit posts for the breaking news page?

379
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,440
But speaking of it, since you were at the scene,

380
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,140
do you know who would leak the news?

381
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,450
I'm not sure.

382
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,210
Forget it, forget it.

383
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,510
It doesn't matter who did it.

384
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:38,160
What matters is this must be resolved before the end of the day.

385
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,820
Otherwise, things will end up badly for us.

386
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:48,150
Hsuan Yu, even though I know it wasn't you,

387
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,660
for the sake of Voodoo,

388
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,780
someone has to apologize to Stella.

389
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,450
I'm counting on you.

390
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,990
It's okay. It's not the first time anyway.

391
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:34,420
I'm sorry. I was the one who did it.

392
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,390
I know.

393
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,590
I was just trying to stand up for you.

394
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,290
I never thought it would do the opposite and make things worse for you.

395
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,230
One must take responsibility for one's actions. I will go and apologize.

396
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,660
It's okay! Does it really matter who apologizes?

397
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,630
Besides, no matter how the celebrities act in private,

398
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,520
protecting their privacy is a part of our work ethics.

399
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,490
Besides, it was my fault to begin with.

400
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,190
Apologizing isn't wrong.

401
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,690
It really isn't fair. Why can Stella ask us to respect work ethics,

402
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,960
when she doesn't do it herself?

403
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,490
Washing your hair the night before is

404
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,320
the basic respect you can give to hairstylists.

405
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,030
Also, her image is one of a kind angel.

406
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,800
Isn't this basically a scam?

407
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,580
How is she the nation's wife?

408
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,420
It's all a lie!

409
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,490
See? That's why Chang Ching didn't let you do her hair.

410
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,420
You have to remember that we're hairstylists, not fans.

411
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,740
Just don't get emotional, okay?

412
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,650
Since that day I am her anti-fan. It's just that

413
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,480
you were the one who was clearly wronged.

414
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,550
Yet the one who's yelled at and forced to apologize is also you.

415
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,010
That's so unfair.

416
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,320
It's okay! I'm fine.

417
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,460
Because...

418
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,230
I'm a mature adult now.

419
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,890
What does that mean?

420
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,010
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

421
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,740
This is a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis I made for the first round of arranged dates.

422
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,230
According to the current analysis, the first candidate's biggest strength

423
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,820
is his urgency to get married.

424
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,910
And our work has high degrees of similarity.

425
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,820
This is my health report for this year.

426
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:45,140
Miss Cho, all three of them have refused the next arranged date.

427
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,430
Why?

428
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,030
The first one, Mr. Tu, feels that

429
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,550
you are really good at your job,

430
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,190
but he thinks that you should slow your pace.

431
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,870
That would make you more cordial

432
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,350
and approachable, as if there is no distance in-between.

433
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,390
Then the second candidate, Mr. Huang,

434
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,540
thinks...

435
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,190
Let me see for myself.

436
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,590
"Miss Cho seems to have a lot of pressure from work."

437
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,990
"I feel that her eggs may not be very healthy."

438
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,960
"Miss Cho's conversation topics over a meal"

439
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,980
"are like a seminar. They cause indigestion."

440
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,020
"Miss Cho's appearance is too old-fashioned."

441
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,300
" She seems like a teacher, supervisor, or director."

442
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,980
"She doesn't make me feel like we're on a date."

443
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,650
Do I appear old-fashioned?

444
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,930
I'm already trying so hard to cooperate with them!

445
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,620
What kind of comments are those?

446
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,720
Help me find a new match.

447
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,530
I know these comments are difficult to receive.

448
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,190
However, when they gave me this feedback,

449
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,870
they all mentioned a viewpoint that is similar to your ex-boyfriend's.

450
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,250
That you appear too strong, and it gives them too much pressure.

451
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:14,990
- If you don't make a slight change to that—
- I've said this before!

452
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,940
The current me does not want

453
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,950
and does not need to change herself for anyone else,

454
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,030
or live as others expect!

455
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,320
I didn't think...

456
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,060
You guys disappointed me so quickly.

457
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,900
Could it be that you all can't even find

458
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,070
one person willing to cooperate with me?

459
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,950
♫ Always be with you ♫

460
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,960
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

461
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,570
You guys disappointed me so quickly.

462
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,480
Could it be that you all can't even find

463
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,700
one person willing to cooperate with me?

464
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,090
To be honest, according to our analysis,

465
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,170
those willing to compromise don't have as good qualifications as yours.

466
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,800
But if they think you are worth striving for

467
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,990
depends on whether you, yourself, are willing to change a bit.

468
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,590
If there's a business partner you want to collaborate with,

469
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,130
but you aren't the partner he wants,

470
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,130
would you give up or would you try your best until the end?

471
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,930
I know what you said is reasonable,

472
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:41,390
but I still can't convince myself

473
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:45,150
to bow down to get on other people's good side.

474
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,440
I understand. Your values, personality,

475
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,460
emotional needs, all those internal traits can't be changed easily.

476
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,270
But if you want to reach your goal in three months,

477
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,810
can't we work on some external traits first?

478
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,140
For example, we can lower your intensity level a bit.

479
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,720
That way it wouldn't be bowing down to get on people's good side,

480
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,780
but raising our success rate, right?

481
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:25,130
Are you sure doing that would raise the success rate?

482
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,690
Of course. Please believe in my professionalism.

483
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,280
Voodoo

484
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,130
Welcome.

485
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,720
Sorry for asking this of you on such short notice.

486
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,170
It's okay.

487
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,490
- This must be Miss Cho.
- Yes.

488
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,820
Hello.

489
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,870
This is the hairstylist I told you about earlier.

490
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:53,530
I trust his professionalism very much and believe that he will definitely help you find a suitable hairstyle.

491
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,440
Miss Cho, please come this way.

492
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,460
Go on.

493
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,670
Hello. If you are waiting, you can sit in this area.

494
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,770
Would you like any snacks or drinks?

495
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,230
May I ask if you are the owner of Voodoo?

496
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:15,250
- I am.
- Hello, I am Yan Fei.

497
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,350
I am the person in charge of Love Is Science Marriage Agency.

498
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:22,590
I want Voodoo to handle the hairstyles for all of our clients.

499
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:26,300
May I ask where Miss Yan heard of us?

500
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,970
I heard before that hairstylist Number 29 is great.

501
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,820
His hairstyles are easy to manage and feel great.

502
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,630
You are very correct.

503
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,940
Our Number 29 is very outstanding.

504
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,710
Every customer who enters becomes a regular.

505
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:42,280
Let's not stand as we chat. Come into my office and we can chat over coffee.

506
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,970
- Okay.
- Please come this way.

507
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,750
Boss, when did we say that we were going to change hair salons?

508
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,730
Just now.

509
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,660
Here. Please be careful. It's hot.

510
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,730
Miss Cho.

511
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,990
I understand that change can make people feel uneasy.

512
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:26,240
But change is also an opportunity for you to start anew.

513
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,630
Are you willing to let me accompany you as you start anew?

514
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,950
I leave it all up to you.

515
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,080
Then I'll wrap a towel around you first.

516
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:51,200
Hello, Sweetie.

517
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,710
Of course, I miss you. I think about you every second of the day.

518
00:43:54,710 --> 00:44:00,130
Even now, as I was doing a customer's hair, I slipped away to call you.

519
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,330
Okay, okay. The customer is asking for me. I have to go.

520
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,480
Okay, okay. I know. Bye bye, bye bye.

521
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,700
Bye bye.

522
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,730
- Hey, you're that—
- No.

523
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:45,980
- A**hole.
- A**hole? Who is?

524
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,290
Are you talking about that call just now?

525
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:58,260
Women. They all need some white lies.

526
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,000
We're both men. You understand.

527
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,400
I don't.

528
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:11,260
I like... men.

529
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:44,940
♫ Always be with you ♫

530
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,790
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

531
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:03,000
I like... men.

532
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:42,080
Help me throw this away. You're blocking the trash can.

533
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,000
How do you feel about it?

534
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,620
I'm k-kind of not used to it.

535
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,360
This hairstyle is really easy to manage.

536
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,720
- Just—
- Wait! Let me make a note on my phone.

537
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,640
There's no need. I'll just teach you.

538
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,790
Just like this. Twirl, twirl, twirl.

539
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,390
After you twirl it, grab it a little and it'll be fluffed.

540
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,260
Do you want to give it a try?

541
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,020
Grab a section.

542
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,190
- Then twirl it.
- In the opposite direction.

543
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,720
The o-opposite direction.

544
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,000
- Like this.
- Yes, yes, yes.

545
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,530
Wow! If you were a reserved beauty when you walked in,

546
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:49,130
then sitting here now is a heart-moving,

547
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,190
hot girl.

548
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,470
This hairstyle suits you very well.

549
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,930
What do you think? Not bad, right?

550
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:14,080
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

551
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,020
Just follow my instructions and practice in front of a mirror. You will get the hang of it really quickly.

552
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,360
If you have any questions, you can always come back to see me.

553
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,250
Okay.

554
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,690
How is it going with Stella? Did you resolve the issue?

555
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:47,010
We're meeting at her agency tonight.

556
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,810
And then? How will you resolve it?

557
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,650
- Obviously, like always.
- "Like always"?

558
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,400
"I'm really sorry. I'm sorry."

559
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,870
"I promise there won't be a next time." Like that.

560
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,340
What rotten strategy is that?

561
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,930
It doesn't matter if it's rotten. As long as it works, it's a good one.

562
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:14,090
It's just as you said. Maturing is when you know something but pretend not to.

563
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:19,080
I think... I've probably matured.

564
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,730
Attack him!

565
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,790
I knew it was you. My judgment was indeed correct.

566
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,730
You're worse than I expected.

567
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,890
He leaked the news right when he got off work.

568
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:05,730
Manipulating public opinion. Media framing. He is amazing. Are you from the Central Weather Bureau?

569
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:10,980
He sure knows how to media frame! Boss Chien, if his hairstyling skills were as good as his

570
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,060
skill in plotting against people, then he wouldn't be here today.

571
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,430
I've already figured out his second career path. No need to stay in your salon.

572
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:22,490
He should join a campaign team as an editor to help others in their election.

573
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,590
He should be a social Kong Ming (famous strategist) or Lü Bu (famous military general).

574
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:29,280
Make use of his talent! Staying at your salon is a waste of talent!

575
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,860
Brother Jason, he has already apologized.

576
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,630
Aren't we here to discuss how to resolve this issue?

577
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,970
Is this the attitude you should have when admitting your wrongs?

578
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,630
Boss Chien, this guy,

579
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:44,840
this b*stard went online to randomly spread gossip and slander today.

580
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,590
Do you know how much this affects Stella's image if he keeps it up?

581
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:53,750
If she lost a sponsorship, could you afford to compensate that?

582
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:58,970
If you can, I'll let him do whatever he wants. He can spread all the nasty rumors he wants.

583
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:03,270
I understand. We all understand. Hurry and apologize.

584
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,130
Go on.

585
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:13,000
Miss Stella, I'm really sorry.

586
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,970
I promise there won't be a next time.

587
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:32,250
We're really sorry, Miss Stella.

588
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,980
Brother Jason.

589
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,360
Okay, okay!

590
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,570
It's not like we are unreasonable.

591
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,720
To be honest, we don't care about the apology.

592
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,690
The most important part is this.

593
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:53,390
You need to post this three times. You can't change a single word.

594
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,130
Post this on the gossip forum,

595
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:58,200
his personal Facebook and Voodoo's

596
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,770
Official Fan Page.

597
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,700
All the news leaked online about Stella

598
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,130
are all made up by me, Wang Hsuan Yu.

599
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:12,600
I'm thankful for Miss Stella's forgiveness and mercy for not investigating this further.

600
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,430
This has made me feel very ashamed.

601
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:18,750
Miss Stella is exactly how people describe her, beautiful and kind.

602
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:22,750
She's like an angel among us humans. I will sincerely reflect on my own actions.

603
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,640
I will also cheer for Miss Stella from now on.

604
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,100
What do you think? It's quite well written, right?

605
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,330
Post it in a while. Then I'll check it before you may leave.

606
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:37,680
If you don't post it, you can't go.

607
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,750
Statement Draft

608
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,350
President Yan's daughter is here.

609
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,550
Right now? Bring her in.

610
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,410
Don't play anymore. The advertising company is here.

611
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,540
Clean up! Clean up!

612
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,290
Reception Room

613
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,740
Hello, I'm Stella.

614
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,420
You must be the daughter of Beauty Queen's President.

615
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,920
Why did you suddenly come? You didn't even tell us. We could have picked you up.

616
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,240
Excuse me. Excuse me.

617
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,880
We have some outsiders here.

618
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,380
In a bit, after we settle some trivial matters—

619
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:43,710
Wang Hsuan Yu, why are you here?

620
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,520
Do you two know each other?

621
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,690
Voodoo's Hairstylist Number 29. Who doesn't know him?

622
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,790
My hair was done by him.

623
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:55,830
He has great skills, a nice personality, and he's handsome.

624
00:53:55,830 --> 00:54:00,090
Ever since I've met him, I can't stand any other hairstylist.

625
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:05,420
Hsuan Yu, Boss Chien, why are you guys here?

626
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,650
- This is what happened—
- It's like this!

627
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,150
It's because our Stella needs a long-term

628
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,780
talented hairstylist.

629
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:18,180
So we especially invited this well-known...

630
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,140
Number twenty-nine hairstylist.

631
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,790
Number twenty-nine hairstylist to come here

632
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,750
to sign a long-term contract.

633
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,700
That's right. To sign a contract.

634
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,570
- Contract!
- Yes.

635
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,130
That's right, the contract.

636
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,070
Wow. That is great!

637
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,590
But would that mean I won't be able to get an appointment with Hsuan Yu in the future?

638
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:45,830
No, no! Of course not.

639
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,000
Miss Yan is our VVVIP (Very, Very, Very Important Person).

640
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,560
If you need anything, I'm at your beck and call.

641
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,660
That's right, you come first. Stella can wait.

642
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,250
How could I?

643
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,410
You can use him first. You first.

644
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,510
Miss Yan.

645
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,850
Thank you. You must let me treat you to a meal next time to thank you for this.

646
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,890
No problem.

647
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:27,150
I'll leave first then.

648
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,450
You're a very good actor!

649
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:45,700
No, I'm not! I was scared to death.

650
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,550
But...

651
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:54,080
The daughter of Beauty Queen's President... What is that?

652
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:59,060
I almost forgot the most important thing.

653
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,920
Give me a second.

654
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,130
Hello, Mom.

655
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,790
Okay. Okay. I know.

656
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:14,060
Okay. I'll promise there will be no car accidents next time.

657
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,510
I will definitely finish my dinner.

658
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:21,100
What? You want to see the victim?

659
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,780
Why do you want to see him? He's busy.

660
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,190
Busy is busy. Why are you asking what kind of busy he is?

661
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:30,590
Okay. Okay. Love you, love you!

662
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:33,950
Okay. Bye bye, bye bye! Bye!

663
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:38,990
That's what that was.

664
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,980
I've known you for such a long time, yet I didn't know you had such a prominent background.

665
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:49,120
Prominent, as if. That's my mom, not me.

666
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,700
Then I need to thank Mama Yan.

667
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:58,420
You can say that. One must deal with shameless people in shameless ways.

668
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,210
Why did you come?

669
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:06,910
Didn't you say that you're... very mature?

670
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:10,190
Yes, yes, yes. I'm a hypocrite (literally: slapping one's face).

671
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:14,460
I'm super immature. Is that okay?

672
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:20,220
Thank you for being immature. I like the immature you.

673
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,940
♫ Always be with you ♫

674
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:29,360
♫ Always be with you ♫

675
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:41,840
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

676
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:47,930
I've known you for such a long time, yet I didn't know you had such a prominent background.

677
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:52,100
Prominent, as if. That's my mom, not me.

678
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,750
Then I need to thank Mama Yan.

679
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:01,460
You can say that. One must deal with shameless people in shameless ways.

680
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,600
Why did you come?

681
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,260
Didn't you say that you're... very mature?

682
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,900
Yes, yes, yes.

683
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,520
I'm a hypocrite (literally: slapping one's face).

684
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,740
I'm super immature. Is that okay?

685
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:23,300
Thank you for being immature. I like the immature you.

686
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,340
You're slowly turning bad.

687
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,510
You even dare to flirt with an older sister.

688
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,870
You learned this from your brother, didn't you?

689
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:55,110
Since we're already so immature today,

690
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:59,110
then let's have chicken cutlet and pearl milk tea later for a midnight snack.

691
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,550
That's a good idea, is it?

692
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:01,730
My treat.

693
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,540
You're so evil.

694
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:07,050
Fine, don't eat it.

695
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,510
I never said I'm not eating!

696
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:12,180
All right. What do you want to eat then?

697
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,890
Which restaurant do you want to eat at?

698
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:16,370
It's the one that I just mentioned.

699
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:37,250
So you are that Mr. Busy.

700
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:14,280
Mom, what are you doing?

701
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,360
Weren't you guys in a rush to have chicken cutlet and pearl milk tea?

702
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,440
It's fine, my treat. Okay?

703
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,920
Go on. Enjoy.

704
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,200
Okay.

705
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:39,570
Mom, why did you want to see us this late at night?

706
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:44,440
What is it? Didn't you promise to have dinner with me?

707
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,360
You haven't even sat for three minutes yet. Are you already in a rush to leave?

708
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,980
Or did Chiao An Na get into a car accident again?

709
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:01,860
I did say I'll have dinner, but I didn't say now.

710
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,990
If not now, at this moment,

711
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:08,910
I really don't know until when you're going to postpone this meal.

712
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,830
Who are you? What is your name?

713
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,740
Who's in your family? What's your occupation?

714
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,970
How did you meet my Yan Fei?

715
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:31,000
Why are you asking so much? How old do you think I am?

716
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,010
Hey. This is the first time my daughter asks me for a favor

717
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:35,720
because of someone else.

718
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,560
I think I have the right to know who this person is, don't you think so?

719
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,370
He's a... friend.

720
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,490
Friend?

721
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:49,220
Did you come asking me for a favor for just a friend?

722
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,950
Do I look that gullible?

723
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,960
You–

724
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:00,430
Hello, my name is Wang Hsuan Yu.

725
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:02,690
I'm really thankful to you.

726
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:06,200
Actually, I should be the one who takes the initiative to visit you

727
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,910
so I can officially thank you.

728
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:10,960
It's disrespectful of me.

729
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:14,320
Not bad.

730
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,390
Very polite.

731
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:19,780
So you two...

732
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:23,890
What's the relationship between you two?
♫ Always be with you ♫

733
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:35,710
♫ Always be with you ♫

734
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:47,080
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

735
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,720
Did you come asking me for a favor for just a friend?

736
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,420
Do I look that gullible?

737
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,620
You–

738
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:02,040
Hello, my name is Wang Hsuan Yu.

739
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,140
I'm really thankful to you.

740
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,790
Actually, I should be the one who takes the initiative to visit you

741
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:10,360
so I can officially thank you.

742
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,560
It's disrespectful of me.

743
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,800
Not bad.

744
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,770
Very polite.

745
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:21,220
So you two...

746
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,830
What's the relationship between you two? How long have you two been dating?

747
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,020
Mom!

748
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,870
I'm married!

749
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,420
Married!

750
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,270
Married.

751
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,250
So you two really are just friends.

752
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,740
Just friends!

753
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,070
Okay. Jessica.

754
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:53,500
- Have the driver take them home.
- Yes, Madam.

755
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:16,080
Sorry, did my mom scare you?

756
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:28,640
It's okay. Mama Yan is very unique.

757
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,790
She's the type of person who always does things unconventionally.

758
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:41,290
In any case, don't believe anything she says.

759
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:43,380
No matter what it is.

760
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,190
Got it.

761
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,770
You've worked hard today.

762
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:54,650
Good night.

763
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,150
Oh, you! Drink that pearl milk tea.

764
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:21,280
Drinking pearl milk tea like everyone else. Why?

765
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,490
You shouldn't be drinking that if you don't have the metabolism.

766
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,910
In any case, don't believe anything she says.

767
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,950
No matter what it is.

768
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:42,570
This is the first time my daughter asks me for a favor because of someone else.

769
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:46,370
I think I have the right to know who this person is, don't you think so?

770
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:50,810
So you two...

771
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:53,370
What's the relationship between you two? How long have you two been dating?

772
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,610
Mom!

773
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:57,430
I'm married!

774
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,100
Married!

775
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,770
Married.

776
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:05,030
Is there really

777
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:09,240
a mom who forgets her daughter is married?

778
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:25,800
Piggy's Love Diary

779
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,470
Hey, Wang Hsuan Yu, why are you so fat?

780
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,210
Isn't your brother really handsome? Look at you.

781
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:35,410
That's right. Your family picked you up from the landfill, didn't they?

782
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:37,560
You're not Wang Hsuan Yu. You're a little ugly fatty.

783
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,650
He's so fat, he should be "big ugly fatty."

784
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:42,950
Big ugly fatty! Big ugly fatty!

785
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,310
Big ugly fatty

786
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:50,090
Hey! Who said Hsuan Yu was picked up?

787
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,650
Also, who said that our Hsuan Yu

788
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:54,100
is a big ugly fatty?

789
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,930
You think he has no one to stand up to you, right?

790
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,180
Who are you?

791
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,050
I'm his—

792
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,800
Why do you care who I am?

793
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,920
He... is my person.

794
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:12,510
- Didn't Wang Hsuan Yu only have an older brother?
- That's right. He only has an older brother.

795
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,140
Wipe your face.

796
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,630
If you bully him, you are bullying me.

797
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:21,770
See how I...

798
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,430
Cowards!

799
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,630
Look. They are just a bunch of cowards.

800
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:40,060
Cowards are still better than a big ugly fatty.

801
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,650
Do you know what cowards will become in the future?

802
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:47,500
They will become useless people!

803
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:52,690
Do you know what big ugly fatties will become in the future?

804
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,580
They will explode.

805
01:07:56,510 --> 01:08:00,530
Haven't you heard that fat people are potential stocks? (The "gu (stock)" in "qianligu" is a homophone of the word "drum.")

806
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:03,650
What kind of drum is that? Can I hit it?

807
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:07,190
Gosh. Little Piggy.

808
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,920
Listen. You are the best.

809
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,440
No one can say you aren't good enough. Not even you, understand?

810
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,930
I promise you will become tall and handsome.

811
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:25,160
They will all regret it. Believe me.

812
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:29,180
- Let's go.
- Maybe it was that moment

813
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:33,060
when I started to believe that I could become tall and handsome.

814
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,400
I'll strike back in style.

815
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,910
Preview: I noticed you were walking weirdly.

816
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,500
It's probably because your shoe is scraping your foot.

817
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,890
Whether I take my wedding ring off or not, I'm well aware of the truth.

818
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:48,330
Whether I need another relationship, it's my decision.

819
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:51,560
At the very least, I can't lie to Hsuan Yu anymore.

820
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,790
- Refund! Refund!
- You'll all get your refund!

821
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:57,540
We've always been open and honest. We've never had fake members.

822
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,180
It's impossible that there's a chance of a scam.

823
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,840
She took my money then disappeared.

824
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,440
That was my life savings!

825
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,870
Female Boss Yan

826
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,420
had acid thrown on her.

827
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:11,990
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

828
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:15,820
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
