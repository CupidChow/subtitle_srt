1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,070
I only know how to farm.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,730
I'm not good enough for you. Please don't waste any more time on me.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,780
I can still buy stocks in the U.S.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,950
So then why can't I go to Yunlin?

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,830
Did you just make up an excuse because you don't want another date with me?

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,050
- It really is not like—
- Oh! Oh, no!

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,090
If you don't think it is a waste of time...

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,780
I feel like I've been stuck in the same place for the past few years.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,410
I always think I'm prepared,

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,430
but I fail every time.

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,020
But as someone who often gets her hair washed...

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,670
Being gentle and attentive are your specialties.

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,540
Your clients keep coming back to you

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,230
because they feel that they are taken care of by you,

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,730
and they will bring a very warm feeling home with them. Myself included.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,470
- Surprise!
 - Baby!

17
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,860
None of you can leave!

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,090
Hsuan Yu had a childhood sweetheart.

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,260
That was all in the past.

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,910
"Liked for many years?"

21
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,190
What bad nickname? I want to know.

22
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,080
Little Piggy!

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,570
♫ Can't you see? ♫

24
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,820
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,500
♫ I've written your name ♫

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,160
♫ Fated to be together for life ♫

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,470
♫ We've both been hurt a few times ♫

28
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,420
♫ And now we've grown ♫

29
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,190
♫ Living in this city ♫

30
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,180
♫ It's so easy to get lost ♫

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,530
♫ So blessed to be in love with each other ♫

32
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,880
♫ We've written the same address ♫

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,140
♫ Our story ♫

00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,850
♫ Is just beginning ♫

36

♫ We'll be holding hands for the rest of our lives ♫

47
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,900
Love Is Science?

48
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,330
She fell asleep so fast.

49
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,790
She's usually like this when she drinks a lot.

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,310
She talks a lot, but she falls asleep in a few seconds.

51
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,410
She doesn't behave too badly when she's drunk.

52
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,020
It is getting late.

53
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,020
I should go.

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,180
That's it for today.

55
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,020
Oh my goodness!

56
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,920
It has been so many years. I'm such an idiot.

57
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,930
What is it?

58
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,080
You walk really fast.

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,970
It is because I'm tired.

60
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,880
I wanted to get home faster.

61
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,140
If you have something to say, just tell me next time.

62
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,060
Let's talk next time.

63
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,880
Are you planning to never see me again?

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,080
Why do you ask that?

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,860
- Because it is awkward.
- Awkward?

66
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,250
It is not awkward. That was a long time ago.

67
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,080
Why would it be awkward?

68
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,640
Then look into my eyes and tell me.

69
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,520
Fine!

70
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,360
I will admit that I was a little shocked.

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,730
Back then, you were just a boy.

72
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,400
What do you mean "boy"? I was almost in high school back then.

73
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,440
Also, there were guys and girls in my class who were dating already. How is that weird?

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,820
I am not trying to disregard how you felt.

75
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,400
When I met you,

76
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,180
you were only ten years old so I always viewed you

77
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,640
as that boy who loved to eat ice cream.

78
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,420
I stopped being a child a long time ago.

79
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,910
I apologize.

80
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,500
When did you write that letter? Why didn't you give it to me?

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,970
I wrote it on the day of your college graduation.

82
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,530
I didn't give it to you...

83
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,460
- Because of this.
- This?

84
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,770
Was it then? I'm sorry.

85
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,400
Why are you sorry?

86
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,350
I don't know...

87
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,410
You were probably hurting a lot in that situation.

88
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,390
How would you know?

89
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,360
You're right, but I just feel very sorry.

90
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,500
You're my little brother whom I cherish a lot.

91
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,050
I don't want anyone to hurt you.

92
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,330
Even if I hurt you, I wouldn't tolerate it.

93
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,150
I remember,

94
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,520
at every difficult moment in my life,

95
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,800
you were by my side,

96
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,860
including when both of my parents suddenly passed away.

97
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,300
I really didn't think I would meet you again.

98
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,620
When we accidentally met in Kaohsiung, I was stunned.

99
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,180
I almost thought I got the wrong person.

100
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,200
Look.

101
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,390
This picture is so ugly. Let me delete it.

102
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,080
No. Don't!

103
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,640
If I didn't take this picture,

104
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,090
I would have thought it was all a dream when I woke up.

105
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,710
Thank you.

106
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,960
What are you thanking me for?

107
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,870
I just think that someone who remembered me for so long

108
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,340
deserves a "thank you."

109
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,120
Hurry and go home. I'm going to call a taxi now.

110
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,200
Can you promise me one thing?

111
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,640
What?

112
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,490
When we see each other again, it will be like how it was before.

113
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,950
We won't feel awkward.

114
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,090
Okay?

115
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,380
Yes, sure.

116
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,010
You better not be saying "yes" to me, then disappear for months.

117
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,340
I'm not that type of person.

118
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,400
Pinky promise.

119
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you a child? Do you still make pinky promises?

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,120
Let me correct that. I am wrong here.

121
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,730
Adults can also make pinky promises.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,100
Pinky promise.

123
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,790
Han Korean Restaurant

124
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:44,460
Tai Ou Wen. Today is such a happy day, right? Don't you feel happy?

125
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,640
Careful! There is a tree.

126
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,490
I'm so happy! Let's go for another round! Let's go!

127
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,740
Not likely!

128
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,840
Liu Sheng Ying!

129
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,330
Can you please not drink, like you haven't had alcohol in years, every time you come out to drink?

130
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,940
You keep going for more and more rounds.

131
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,770
Are you not tired? Go home. Wash up and go to bed.

132
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,140
I'm just happy.

133
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,030
Are you happy? I'm not happy.

134
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,870
Are you not happy?

135
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,680
Don't be unhappy. Let me imitate a sloth for you.

136
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,910
No.

137
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,710
I will imitate them for you.

138
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,930
Look at me.

139
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,580
Enough.

140
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,160
Both of you, make sure she gets home safely.

141
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,140
Don't let her drink anymore and don't let her come out to scare people.

142
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,940
It's money! Let's take this NT$1000 ($36 U.S.) and go for another round of drinks!

143
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,190
Okay?

144
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,090
Go!

145
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,010
Stop hitting him! His feelings for me are sincere!

146
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,570
Our Big Brother (head of a gang) said whoever dares to touch his little sister

147
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,720
must be injured and unable to walk for a couple of days, if we don't break your legs.

148
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,830
Wait a minute. There must be a misunderstanding.

149
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,140
That girl and I just happened to pass by each other.

150
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,470
I accidentally bumped into her, that is all.

151
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,160
That is not what you said earlier.

152
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,330
You said that you saw my presence at first glance.

153
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,090
You also said that we are practically soulmates, and we should go to your house to chat all night long.

154
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,290
Chat? Do you want to chat?

155
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,330
- Are you happily chatting?
- Help me!

156
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,550
- Someone is dying here!
- Stop hitting him!

157
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,890
Ou... Ou... Ou wen.

158
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,840
Don't move!

159
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,240
- What are you looking at? Scram!
- Ou.

160
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,060
Please!

161
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,760
Enough! Stop hitting him.

162
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,460
- Flirting?
- Stop!

163
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,320
Don't hit the face anymore.

164
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,560
Trying to be handsome? Will you still flirt around?

165
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,920
What the heck is this?

166
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,680
Who is kicking who now?

167
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,010
Are you trying to run after hitting someone?

168
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,020
Hurry up. Let's go.

169
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,070
Hurry up.

170
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,470
I was joking. I still love you the most.

171
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,500
You're not dead yet, right?

172
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,240
So you walked away to call the cops?

173
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,220
Stupid.

174
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,450
Police Department

175
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,490
It's already daytime.

176
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,920
So? You didn't get the girl and even got beaten up.

177
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,950
Do you feel depressed?

178
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,840
Not getting the girl is just a small setback.

179
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,330
I can also take a few punches, but...

180
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,450
It is the "but" that makes life so depressing.

181
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,660
Even a gay guy like you fights manlier than me.

182
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,670
That's the biggest shock in life. I'm questioning life right now.

183
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,100
Who said I can't be manly just because I'm gay?

184
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,390
Who taught you that?

185
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,820
What ancient stereotype is that?

186
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,080
How dare you glare at me?

187
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,580
Is this the attitude you give to your savior?

188
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,850
So...

189
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,940
Besides looking up to me,

190
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,900
didn't you forget to say something to me?

191
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,300
Thanks...

192
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,070
Thanks...

193
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm Mark Lee. When I say thanks, I'm extra quiet.

194
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,010
Only ants can hear me.

195
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,290
Thank you.

196
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,540
It is nothing.

197
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,510
Is it good?

198
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,560
Why is Older Brother gone for so long?

199
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,370
- Chin Lan, you're awake.
- Good morning, Sister-in-law.

200
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,350
Why didn't you sleep a little longer?

201
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,820
To my fellow audience, Mr. Wang has just safely

202
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,120
sent his daughter, Jia Jia, to her kindergarten class. Please give him a round of applause.

203
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,260
You're awake so early today.

204
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,820
Go sleep a little longer.

205
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,220
Brother, it is not that early.

206
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,180
It's already 9 a.m. I'm sorry.

207
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,010
The toothbrush and towel are new. Go get ready, and come have breakfast.

208
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,140
Just leave the toothbrush and towel in your room from now on.

209
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,320
Chin Lan, you can stay over whenever you want.

210
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,650
- Isn't that right, Hubby?
- Yes.

211
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,890
Why doesn't Chin Lan just move in? Then we will have more people during meals, and it will be more fun.

212
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,910
Don't be like that. This only happened because she drank too much last night.

213
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,290
You'll make her feel uncomfortable.

214
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,880
Did I make it really awkward last night?

215
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,850
What happened?

216
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,380
Nothing. Go get ready.

217
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,230
You'll be late.

218
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,710
Okay.

219
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,420
I will brush my teeth then.

220
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,090
What?

221
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,070
Sorry. I was really drunk yesterday. I didn't do it on purpose.

222
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:16,920
Although it is very unlikely that you'll see your first love again...

223
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,450
- To be honest—
- Not to mention, Yan Fei saw me drunk.

224
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,680
Oh my gosh, it's so embarrassing, and I kept mentioning the love letter that you were unable to give.

225
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,290
- Sorry.
- It is okay.

226
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,610
Let's not bring up what happened yesterday.

227
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,590
Forget everything.

228
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,890
Okay. I will try to forget.

229
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,120
Are you free tonight? I want to go see a movie.

230
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,600
We close around 9 p.m.

231
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,300
We can go at 10 p.m.

232
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,230
No problem. As long as you aren't angry at me.

233
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,420
Showing PDA so early in the morning, I need sunglasses! (PDA in Mandarin means "bright flashes.")

234
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,710
That's right, we want to make you guys blind.

235
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,930
Okay, okay. There's a meeting soon. Don't be late.

236
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,530
I forgot that I had a meeting.

237
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,360
- Then go. Go, quickly.
- I'm leaving.

238
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,480
Go.

239
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,920
See you tonight.

240
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,390
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

241
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,030
Jason, may I ask what's the issue this time?

242
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,710
I've noticed that Julie may not be the one for me.

243
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,910
Weren't the previous three dates very good?

244
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,840
You even told me you were so happy to meet your fated love.

245
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,810
- Those three dates were great.
- But...

246
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,030
But on the fourth date, I discovered that she never read any Jin Yong novels (martial arts stories).

247
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,890
She has never read any of it. How can that be?

248
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,910
That's not right.

249
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,840
A woman who has never read Jin Yong novels is definitely incompatible with me.

250
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,860
Jason, you can't find such a perfect life partner.

251
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,480
If her flaw is not having read Jin Yong novels,

252
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,130
you can fix this flaw. You can read them with her.

253
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,390
I tried, but she said she is not interested. She said there are too many words!

254
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,180
She doesn't read!

255
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,940
Let me make a correction. It's not that Julie doesn't read books.

256
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,030
From my understanding, she prefers novels.

257
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,020
She also likes poems. She may just be less interested in Jin Yong novels.

258
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,240
She must have watched the TV series of these Jin Yong novels, right?

259
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,390
She did watch the TV drama.

260
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,060
Exactly. So it is not like she doesn't know anything at all.

261
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,790
No. I still can't accept it.

262
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,650
Jin Yong novels are a classic. I can't accept someone who hasn't read the original novels and only watched the TV series.

263
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,530
Please forgive me for my stubbornness.

264
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,440
If my partner has never read the novels before, we will never be able to have a happy married life.

265
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,110
Sorry for the inconvenience. Please help me find another suitable partner.

266
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,880
Thank you.

267
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,100
Another example of a person who lost interest as time goes by.

268
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,560
These people are so strange.

269
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,690
They always enjoy the dates in the beginning.

270
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,700
Then eventually, when they find a tiny difference in their personality or interests,

271
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,030
they suddenly lose interest completely.

272
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,280
Hello? There is no 100% perfect girl in the world.

273
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,180
He is blinded by the novels.

274
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,860
For two people to be together, they need to accept and adjust for one another.

275
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,700
No one is a 100% match for someone.

276
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,910
In comparison, Wu You Fu is an angel.

277
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,950
He is like a rare treasure in this world.

278
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,610
He didn't mention any requests, and he is delighted to accommodate others.

279
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,810
I can fully understand why Sheng Ying is cheering for him to succeed.

280
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:27,360
Oh, are Mr. Wu and Miss Cho getting ready for their first date?

281
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,750
Yes. Sheng Ying is preparing them both for the first date.

282
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,450
Dating alone?

283
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,060
Without the planners?

284
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,870
Yes. The planner only accompanies you on the first arranged date.

285
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,520
Afterward, that will solely depend on you guys.

286
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,610
I-I think I will definitely mess it up.

287
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,540
Honestly, I also think you will mess it up.

288
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,400
What is the difference between these three sets of clothes?

289
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,380
The styles are like Chiang Ching Kuo (Taiwan former president), Song Chu Yu (politician), and Guo Tai Ming (billionaire businessman).

290
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,200
But this is comfortable to wear.

291
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,370
Wrong! You must dress for the dating occasion.

292
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,250
Don't choose what you like or what is comfortable.

293
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,620
Okay.

294
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,010
Miss Cho... actually during the last election,

295
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,770
I voted for the one who wore–

296
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,480
Stop!

297
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,390
It is strictly forbidden to talk about politics and religion on one's first date.

298
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,510
It can turn your date into a disaster.

299
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,300
We can't talk about that... Then would we talk about the weather?

300
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,260
That is not bad. I see some talent in you.

301
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,180
Just talk about the weather.

302
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,290
Really?

303
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,200
You can easily bring the surrounding environment into your conversation.

304
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,520
Weather is one example of this.

305
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,170
Oh, that is a good idea. Then during the date, I can–

306
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,820
During a date, never look at your phone.

307
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,700
No matter how shy you are, you must look at her.

308
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,710
Here, practice by looking at me.

309
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,270
Another important point, who is paying for the meal?

310
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,710
I'm paying, of course.

311
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,530
I knew you would think like this.

312
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,850
But if Miss Cho insists on splitting the bill,

313
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,850
please don't fight to pay. Please respect her.

314
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,340
- But I think this is—
- There is no "but."

315
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,370
Of course, you want to show her that you're willing to pay for the meal.

316
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,750
But if the woman insists on splitting the bill, yet you still rush to pay for her meal,

317
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,250
then that means you don't respect her.

318
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,460
The last point is also the most important point.

319
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,630
And that is... to forget everything I just said.

320
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,520
Rules are dead, but people are alive.

321
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,890
I believe these dating rules will not be a problem for you at all.

322
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,160
But about paying for the meal, I want to know what you think.

323
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,720
"Splitting the bill" team or "having the man pay for it all" team.

324
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,480
I'm fine with either.

325
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,360
Okay. The truth is, there is no correct answer.

326
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,070
The best answer is that both of you have to agree on it.

327
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,580
For example, when Mr. Wu went on the arranged date last time with Mimi... she was not...

328
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,170
How dare you compare her with me! Are you joking?

329
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,720
I brought up Mimi as an example because I'm afraid you will over-correct yourself.

330
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,150
Then how will I know

331
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,160
whether the other person wants to split the bill or pay for it?

332
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,930
In fact, there is a very simple way.

333
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,630
When you're ordering, pull out your wallet

334
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,120
and observe the man's reaction.

335
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,160
But if the other person insists on paying, then please don't argue with him.

336
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,240
You can pay for the next meal or give him a gift in return.

337
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,560
At this time, there is no point in arguing for equal paying rights.

338
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,590
Fighting to pay the bill is another peculiar tradition unique to Asia.

339
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,200
Honestly, I don't quite understand that tradition.

340
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,390
There's also another rule for women during dates.

341
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,620
What is it?

342
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,890
Do you like playing video games?

343
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,150
Men and women were born with different tendencies.

344
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,910
Before the dates, women tend to look forward to the date.

345
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,720
They dream about many small details, allowing them to get really excited.

346
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,480
But men are different.

347
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,760
They start warming up only when they meet the women.

348
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,850
They will slowly enter the situation.

349
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,020
The difference in emotions between the man and the woman will be big.

350
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,680
So the woman will usually feel that the man's reaction is worse than what she expected.

351
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,180
"Why is he so cold to me?"

352
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:26,720
"Is it because he is not interested in me?"

353
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,360
You seem to understand really well how women feel and think.

354
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,220
I always advise our female members

355
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,660
to work on irrelevant tasks an hour before the date to distract themselves.

356
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,000
Playing video games, reading books, and watching dramas

357
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,490
are all acceptable.

358
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,550
If you need to do your makeup or pick an outfit,

359
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,500
please be sure to get yourself ready an hour before the date.

360
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,180
Leave one hour of buffer time for you to

361
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,280
relax your mood and calm down.

362
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,830
Financial Report Analysis

363
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,240
Sorry! Sorry!

364
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,810
I became too engrossed in reading the financial report analysis.

365
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,910
I'm fifteen minutes late.

366
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,080
No problem.

367
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,430
Usually, I'm punctual.

368
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:48,220
I never waste others' lives or mine.

369
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,050
I really apologize for being late.

370
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,580
Don't worry. It really is fine. Take a breath first.

371
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,290
Do it with me. Breathe in.

372
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,910
Slowly breathe out. Breathe in again.

373
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,570
Are you feeling better now?

374
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,110
I think dating isn't like going to work.

375
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,800
Being late isn't a big deal.

376
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,300
Plus, no one will take off points.

377
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,270
At least you didn't bail on me.

378
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,110
- I am definitely not one of those—
- I was joking.

379
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,550
I know you're not that type of person.

380
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:44,390
Then today, let us two relax a little, okay?

381
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,790
Then where will we go now?

382
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,540
Wait for me.

383
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,310
Today we will walk a lot.

384
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,640
You will have to wear these shoes to relax.

385
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,680
I bought them at the small store at the front.

386
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,720
If it doesn't fit, we can switch it to a different size later.

387
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,360
Thank you.

388
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,150
Be careful.

389
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,110
Are you okay?

390
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:05,760
Today is a weekday so... so there aren't many people. It feels more comfortable walking around.

391
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,250
Why did you choose this place?

392
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,940
No special reason.

393
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,040
Usually, you're at your office.

394
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,480
You have few opportunities to go out and walk.

395
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,150
But I live in a place near the mountains.

396
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,780
There aren't many lakes or water there

397
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,000
so I wanted to come out and enjoy the breeze.

398
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,250
You don't mind, do you?

399
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,440
Of course, I don't mind.

400
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,450
I really don't come out and walk much.

401
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,680
I think this place is great.

402
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,760
Good.

403
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,660
Why don't we go on the ferryboat later?

404
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:55,690
Okay! Let's be tourists today!

405
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,960
Get on.

406
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,530
Do I really need to get on?

407
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,830
Do you not want to?

408
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,630
Hi.

409
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,000
What are you thinking?

410
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,750
Nothing much.

411
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,760
It is just that I saw a lot of people

412
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,290
coming out to play with their families.

413
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,250
Happiness seems to be very simple.

414
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,170
How is it? Is the date going well?
You are special.

415
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,090
No news must be good news, right?

416
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,450
Even my own dates don't make me this anxious.

417
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,000
My stomach hurts.

418
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,170
Please, please, let this become a success, please.

419
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,110
You will feel better if you take this (stomach medicine).

420
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,240
When did you start treating me so well?

421
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,570
- Don't you want it?
- Hey.

422
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,850
You can't take back something you give away.

423
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,180
Everyone gather around.

424
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,310
Come here.

425
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,290
Dear Big Boss (Bodhisattva), You Fu truly is a good person.

426
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,350
Please, bless him and help his date go well.

427
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,570
Dear Big Boss, please.

428
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,210
Have a sip of water.

429
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,590
My first time riding a bike

430
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:53,300
was after I graduated from university.

431
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,890
My first boyfriend was an engineer.

432
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,270
Sometimes if I was late for my morning class,

433
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:08,440
he would ride his bike just to come wait for me at my dorm.

434
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,010
He gave me a ride to my class, across the big campus.

435
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,970
All my friends were envious of me.

436
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,940
They said my boyfriend was so considerate.

437
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,600
But in the end,

438
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,830
he also used his bike

439
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,330
to give rides to other girls.

440
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,490
What am I saying?

441
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,020
I'm sorry.

442
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,240
I shouldn't be talking about my first boyfriend.

443
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,150
It's okay.

444
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,020
It helps me to understand you better.

445
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,790
And we are not young anymore. Talking about memories is normal.

446
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,750
I didn't mean that you are old.

447
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,940
I meant that—

448
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,850
I know, I know. Don't worry.

449
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,150
What about you? Did you date before?

450
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,580
What was she like?

451
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,140
She was my high school classmate.

452
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,460
After graduation, she went to work in Taichung.

453
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:35,620
After I got out of the army, she returned to Yunling to open a hair salon.

454
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,380
We got closer.

455
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,710
But after a few years, she wanted to study more.

456
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,040
So she left Yunling.

457
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,830
Then couldn't you leave Yunling with her?

458
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:59,420
I couldn't leave my parents or their land.

459
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,610
She said that, after a few years in Taichung, she would come back.

460
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,960
But over the years,

461
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,240
we slowly lost contact.

462
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,070
And we didn't even get to break up in any official way.

463
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,140
Recently,

464
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:25,640
I heard she was married and gave birth to two children.

465
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:30,350
And that's a good thing.

466
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,220
One ex-boyfriend is also married with children.

467
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,350
I hear he is doing very well at the Hsinchu Technology Park.

468
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,140
I've never been to Yunling. Where is your home?

469
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,030
We have a very simple place in the countryside.

470
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,060
There is farmland everywhere.

471
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,030
Is it known for anything special?

472
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,090
Yes.

473
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:21,390
We are most famous for being boring.

474
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,150
I didn't think you would make a joke.

475
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,340
I'm not joking.

476
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,920
I saw your draft and it looks exactly like what our magazine is targeting.

477
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,700
Especially the part about the folks complaining cause they can't find a boyfriend or girlfriend.

478
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,850
You hit the nail right on the head.

479
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,790
Most people complain about not finding a suitable partner.

480
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,220
But very few people actually ask themselves

481
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,780
how much work they're willing to put into dating.

482
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,170
And some parents' views are very strange.

483
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,030
They didn't allow their children to date when they were in school,

484
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,550
yet they pressure them to get married right away when they are older.

485
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,300
Isn't that illogical?

486
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,460
It's as scary as having to take a test without practicing with mock tests beforehand.

487
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,630
I like what you are saying.

488
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,120
So nothing is free in this world.

489
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,860
A suitable partner is not going to fall from the sky, and land in front of you if you just sit at home all day complaining.

490
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,610
If you have time to complain, why not use that time to take action?

491
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,770
You're right.

492
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,720
Okay, I'm going to proofread this draft, then hand it over to the editor.

493
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,970
If you have any questions, just ask me.

494
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,640
Thank you.

495
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,030
There's something I'd like to apologize for.

496
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,740
What is it?

497
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,260
A few days ago, I got drunk and said some strange things.

498
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,570
Did I scare you?

499
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,930
No, I'm fine. You are cute when you are drunk.

500
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,420
But when I'm drunk, I start spilling Hsuan Yu's secrets. He must hate me for doing that.

501
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,100
So do you really not know who the person in the love letter is?

502
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:25,110
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

503
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,670
♫ Always be with you ♫

504
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,090
♫ We'll support each other from now on. I promise... ♫

505
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,400
Okay, I'm going to proofread this draft, then hand it over to the editor.

506
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,360
- If you have any questions, just ask me.
- Thank you.

507
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,680
There's something I'd like to apologize for.

508
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,330
What is it?

509
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,830
A few days ago, I got drunk and said some strange things.

510
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,090
Did I scare you?

511
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,550
No, I'm fine. You are cute when you are drunk.

512
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:23,070
But when I'm drunk, I start spilling Hsuan Yu's secrets. He must hate me for doing that.

513
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,420
So do you really not know who the person in the love letter is?

514
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,490
What did Hsuan Yu say?

515
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,150
He would never tell.

516
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,600
Exactly.

517
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,160
If he won't even tell you, how would I know?

518
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,270
It's Hsuan Yu.

519
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,070
Are you busy tonight?

520
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,340
I'm free.

521
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,900
That's great!

522
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,980
Hsuan Yu said that the noodle restaurant is trying out new dishes tonight.

523
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,850
Do you want to come?

524
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,860
I don't think I can help much.

525
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,670
I don't know anything about side dishes.

526
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,080
Please. If you don't know anything about it but still like it,

527
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,060
then it's a success. And the two of us and Big Brother and Sister-in-law are an even four.

528
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,160
It's often two against two. We can't decide.

529
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,920
Please?

530
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,570
Hello?

531
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,650
Yan Fei? You're not busy tonight, are you?

532
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,780
That's great. Come to the restaurant to try the new side dishes.

533
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,530
Okay, see you there. Bye bye!

534
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,780
If you have any questions, you can ask me.
[Voodoo]

535
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,410
Bye bye.

536
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,730
Watch the steps.

537
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:57,120
Welcome. Please come this way.

538
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,840
I just checked. Your scalp is the sensitive type.

539
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,550
Does it usually get dry and itchy?

540
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,110
A little.

541
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,900
I'll use this shampoo on you.

542
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,840
It contains probiotics and peptides from Korea,

543
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,140
which help regulate the oil balance of your skin.

544
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,550
It also improves the health of your scalp. Your scalp will feel much more comfortable after washing.

545
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,040
It's like washing your hair, while also maintaining it in a good, healthy condition.

546
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,350
You can try it later.

547
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,560
Okay. Thank you. Can I see it?

548
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
Of course.

549
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,940
The ingredients are all natural and organic.

550
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,070
This one also contains vitamins,

551
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,140
which can help reduce the dryness and itchiness on your scalp.

552
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,320
Each one we use in the salon has been specifically selected.

553
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,210
- If you have something similar at home, you can use that first.
- Okay.

554
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,610
Thank you.

555
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,640
Miss Chang. Would you like tea or coffee?

556
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,870
I'll have hot tea, please. Thank you.

557
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,520
Okay.

558
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:03,740
What about you? You want coffee, right? Would you like sugar or cream?

559
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,100
Black coffee. Thank you.

560
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,810
Okay.

561
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:26,320
You scared me! Don't you make any noise when you walk?

562
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,460
Who are you?

563
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,190
Why are you in Mark's body?

564
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,450
Leave his body!

565
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,220
What is this?

566
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,760
Didn't someone say he's going to show Ou Wen who is boss?

567
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,200
Why...

568
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,150
are you suddenly so good to him?

569
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,240
Who said that? That's so immature.

570
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,510
Look at how great things are now. We are all in a long-term collaborative relationship.

571
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,980
Being friends is better than how things were before.

572
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,690
Right?

573
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,160
Oh.

574
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,150
Okay, take your time.

575
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,630
What are you doing?

576
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,330
Don't move.

577
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,880
What do you think?

578
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,770
This way, your hair will be stylish.

579
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,120
When you work, your hair won't keep falling into your face.

580
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,060
It's not bad.

581
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,920
I... I need to make a phone call.

582
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,980
He doesn't even say thank you. How rude!

583
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,340
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

584
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,890
Yan Fei is here.

585
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,340
Okay, we can start the taste testing!

586
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,610
In a moment, we will have three different side dishes.

587
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,210
Try them and tell me your opinions.

588
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:15,330
And Jia Jia can write down the results.

589
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,700
Here is the first dish.

590
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,490
Eat up.

591
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,430
All right.

592
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,750
Please vote.

593
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,780
Three versus two.

594
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,840
In that case, I will keep this dish.

595
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,350
Good thing Yan Fei is here. Otherwise, it would be two versus two again.

596
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,750
This one?

597
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,240
Sister Yan Fei.

598
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,620
This is the second dish.

599
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,760
Please vote.

600
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,840
Okay, this is very clear. Two versus three.

601
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,580
This dish is eliminated.

602
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,200
Okay, this is the last dish. Preserved egg and tofu, paired with cucumber, and pickled cabbage.

603
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,900
Try it.

604
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,910
Only the two of you? Okay.

605
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,430
It is very clear. This dish is... not good.

606
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,030
Wait! Can I appeal that decision?

607
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,550
I think the preserved egg and tofu, paired with pickled cabbage, and cucumber

608
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,640
are very creative. It's refreshing and healthy.

609
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,590
And it is very good for women who are watching their weight, and want more vegetables.

610
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,210
Why are you eliminating it?

611
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,890
What you say makes a lot of sense.

612
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,920
- Right? Try selling it. You never know. It may be a big hit.
- Oh?

613
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,030
But preserved egg and tofu are nothing special.

614
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:57,780
Pairing it with cucumber and pickled cabbage overpowers the flavor.

615
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,760
I agree with Chin Lan.

616
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,290
What are you saying?

617
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,190
Hsuan Yu, why did you vote for this dish?

618
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,670
Brother, every dish you chose

619
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,800
was the exact same as Yan Fei. Are you voting the same way, too?

620
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,340
Of course not. I think this dish

621
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,230
has a large portion size and is rich in flavor. It's worth the value.

622
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,420
When customers see the increased portion but same price, they will surely order this dish.

623
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,260
"Large portion size and is rich in flavor."

624
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,330
No wonder Yan Fei calls you Little Piggy.

625
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:34,250
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

626
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:40,300
♫ Fantasize about a romantic love ♫

627
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,530
♫ Always be with you ♫

628
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:55,450
♫ We'll support each other from now on. I promise... ♫

629
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,010
I think the preserved egg and tofu, paired with pickled cabbage, and cucumber

630
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,080
are very creative. It's refreshing and healthy.

631
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,960
And it is very good for women who are watching their weight, and want more vegetables.

632
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,660
Why are you eliminating it?

633
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,210
What you say makes a lot of sense.

634
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:15,580
- Right? Try selling it. You never know. It may be a big hit.
- Oh?

635
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,510
But preserved egg and tofu are nothing special.

636
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,850
Pairing it with cucumber, and pickled cabbage

637
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,310
overpowers the flavor.

638
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:28,240
I agree with Chin Lan.

639
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,760
What are you saying?

640
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,580
Hsuan Yu, why did you vote for this dish?

641
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,490
Brother, every dish you chose

642
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,260
was the exact same as Yan Fei. Are you voting the same way, too?

643
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,770
Of course not. I think this dish

644
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,820
has a large portion size and is rich in flavor.

645
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,740
It's worth the value. When customers see the increased portion but same price,

646
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,950
they will surely order this dish.

647
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,620
"Large portion size and is rich in flavor."

648
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,340
No wonder Yan Fei calls you Little Piggy.

649
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,180
Really? Did I call him that? Why don't I remember?

650
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,260
You did! Did you forget? Remember when you two took the wrong suitcase,

651
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,490
and you saw him in our family picture,

652
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:16,230
you said, "Wang Hsuan Yu, you are my Little Piggy!"

653
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,860
You forgot.

654
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,280
Is that the case?

655
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,680
Today's weather is very nice.

656
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,360
It's quite windy.

657
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,890
Here.

658
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,020
Thank you. Thank you.

659
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:13,030
Miss Cho, do you know what kind of tree that is?

660
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,480
It's a Plumeria Rubra.

661
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,580
They are very common.

662
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,210
Yes, that's correct.

663
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,430
That one is also very common.

664
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:32,860
What is it called?

665
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,070
That one?

666
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,950
Let me look it up.

667
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,920
When we're talking, I shouldn't use my phone.

668
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,740
Don't be nervous. I'm just joking.

669
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,630
If you want to know whether your first date is a success,

670
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:58,530
then before the date ends, see if you can get Miss Cho's

671
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,500
contact information.

672
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,670
Miss Cho.

673
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,150
Can I ask...

674
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,430
Can I ask...

675
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,680
What is it?

676
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,240
It's nothing. What did you think of tonight's dinner?

677
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,500
It was very good. I will come back again.

678
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,590
Oh, really? Th-That's great.

679
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:32,370
- Miss Cho...
- Yes?

680
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,330
Can I add you as a friend on LINE?

681
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:41,900
I'm not forcing you so don't feel any pressure.

682
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,440
You just took me to dinner so that

683
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,390
you can get my LINE?

684
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,140
O-Of course not.

685
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,760
Or is it because you want me to treat you back so you want my LINE?

686
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,580
No, of course not.

687
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,850
If you don't want to, it's really okay.

688
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,830
Why do you give up so easily?

689
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:06,140
It seems like you don't want to keep in contact with me.

690
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:11,090
That... that... I... actually...

691
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,260
Actually...

692
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,020
Actually, even if you didn't ask for my LINE,

693
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,180
I would have asked for yours.

694
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,760
It's very inconvenient when I don't know how to contact you. Like when I was late earlier,

695
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,560
and I couldn't contact you. I was totally stressed out.

696
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:44,130
Miss Cho, have you always been mischievous?

697
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,510
Mischievous?

698
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:58,430
I'm sorry.

699
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,720
Not telling you that my love letter was for Yan Fei

700
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,920
is my fault.

701
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,740
But that was a long time ago.

702
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,690
And Yan Fei is already married.

703
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,180
I never thought I'd see her again.

704
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,200
Don't worry about it too much.

705
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,570
You're right.

706
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,410
It was truly a long time ago.

707
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,170
But why didn't you just tell me directly?

708
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,970
I asked you only a few days ago.

709
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,850
I was going to tell you, but you cut me off.

710
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:38,430
Later, I thought about it and didn't think I needed to bring it up.

711
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,060
It was such a long time ago.

712
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:48,160
And if you hadn't gotten drunk and exposed it, Yan Fei wouldn't have known.

713
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:57,420
So Yan Fei knows because I said it while I was drunk?

714
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,520
- Yes.
- What did she say?

715
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,870
What did she say? She was just very surprised.

716
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,800
Why do you ask?

717
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,770
No reason.

718
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,300
Hsuan Yu.

719
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,760
Because it happened so long ago,

720
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,450
let's not fight anymore.

721
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,940
After all, I'm the one who is with you now.

722
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,360
♫ Always be with you ♫

723
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,370
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

724
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,770
They wouldn't be fighting now, would they?

725
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:15,420
No, they wouldn't. I'm already a married woman. I'm very safe.

726
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,240
Of course.

727
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:31,390
Hello, Mom? How are you?

728
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:34,260
My precious daughter, quickly look at Yung Tai's Facebook page.

729
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,760
I stopped following him a long time ago.

730
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,520
Seriously. Yung Tai's Royal Hotel Group

731
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,910
plans to open a hotel chain in Taiwan.

732
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,910
That means he might be coming back to Taiwan!

733
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,950
Seriously?

734
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,550
Yes.

735
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,110
We found Yan Fei's college friend.

736
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,000
We got a picture of her wedding dress.

737
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,070
And we finally figured out who her husband is.

738
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,450
Her husband is very famous.

739
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,290
His name is Huo Yung Tai.

740
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,810
He's Royal Hotel's

741
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:13,630
first Chinese director in the business development department.

742
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,610
She married very well.

743
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:19,390
But don't you think it's strange?
The more we share, the more we have.

744
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:23,510
She married so well. Why is she so low-key about it?

745
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,240
Why doesn't she talk about it?

746
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,500
This would be a great advertisement for her!

747
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,960
Exactly! Not only does Yan Fei not bring it up, but my daughter

748
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,170
looked up Huo Yung Tai's Facebook account.

749
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:37,550
Yan Fei has never showed up.
Experience is the teacher of all things.

750
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,760
Why are they so low profile?

751
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,940
Why are they so low profile?

752
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,450
Something is definitely wrong!

753
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,650
Chin Lan, try this.

754
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,730
It's a new recipe.

755
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,750
It's very flavorful!

756
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,950
That's excellent! Yes!

757
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,540
Very good.

758
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,620
I want Hsuan Yu to try it.

759
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,140
Okay. Give him some to try.

760
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,170
Hsuan Yu—

761
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:20,490
Sorry, sorry.

762
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:21,520
Brother! That's a dirty towel!

763
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,590
I'm so sorry.

764
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,490
It's okay.

765
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,450
You'll catch a cold. Go upstairs and change clothes first.

766
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,730
When I'm done here, I'll take you home.

767
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,190
Okay.

768
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,760
All right, go quickly.

769
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,930
Hurry. I'm sorry.

770
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,740
Sorry.

771
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,330
You did! Did you forget? Remember when you two took the wrong suitcase,

772
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,600
and you saw him in our family picture,

773
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:02,710
you said, "Wang Hsuan Yu, you are my Little Piggy!"

774
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,730
Wang Hsuan Yu's birthday?

775
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,480
One, zero, one...

776
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,820
One, zero, one.

777
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,350
No.

778
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,870
My birthday: one, one, one.

779
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,380
No.

780
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,550
Our dating anniversary?
Nine, one, six.

781
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,920
Cell phone number.

782
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,580
Five hundred.

783
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,100
No.

784
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:07,080
Hsuan Yu is Number Twenty-nine Hairstylist...

785
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,400
Zero, two, nine.

786
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,090
What could it be?

787
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:25,120
What am I doing?

788
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,870
Wasting my time.

789
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:01,970
Three, two, nine.

793
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,770
Did she go home already?

794
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,270
Hello?

795
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:04,240
Hello. Why did you suddenly leave?

796
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,430
I'm tired. I wanted to go home to rest.

797
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,830
It's too late. It's not safe for you to go by yourself.

798
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:12,670
Where are you? I'll come find you.

799
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:14,490
I'm almost home. I'll talk to you later.

800
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,200
Hello?

801
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,790
What's taking so long?
[On Uber app]

802
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:45,020
Some people say that one's password represents the most important thing to that person.

803
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:51,500
So Hsuan Yu's most important thing is...

804
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:01,650
Brother, every dish you chose was the exact same as Yan Fei. No wonder she calls you "Little Piggy."

805
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,800
That girl gave him a really bad nickname.

806
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,770
Little Piggy!

807
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:14,090
Really? Did I call him that?

808
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,210
Why are you two talking so quietly?

809
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,900
Are you hiding secrets from me?

810
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,270
So do you really not know who the person in the love letter is?

811
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:26,870
What did Hsuan Yu say?

812
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:28,630
He would never tell.

813
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:34,510
Exactly. If he won't even tell you, then how would I know?

814
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,820
You liar!

815
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,840
Why were you trying to get information from me?

816
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,620
What else are you guys hiding from me?

817
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,990
♫ I understood that you're acting smart behind my back ♫

818
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,220
How come I didn't know the two of you are working together?

819
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:05,600
It just happened. I'm helping her clients do their hair.

820
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,540
Is it Mark?

821
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:10,490
No, it's Yan Fei. She just came in for a shampoo.

822
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:13,100
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

823
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,660
Quick, let's eat!

824
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,530
Yan Fei

Piggy's Love Diary

826
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,970
Hey, Yan Fei, Bai Bai.

827
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:53,680
Did you know Wang Hsuan Yang is dropping out of school?

828
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:58,920
Why? He's so smart. He already got into college. Why is he quitting?

829
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,890
Do you not know? I heard his parents died in an accident.

830
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,890
When did this happen?

831
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,740
A few days ago.

832
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,150
Little Piggy, did you eat?

833
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:19,350
Do you want some bread? Here, have some.

834
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:26,330
I have cookies too.

835
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:33,430
And I also have these. These are all your favorites.

836
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:35,820
I also bought this.

837
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:46,800
Why?

838
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:33,140
What are you doing?

839
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:37,680
You don't want to eat it so I have to help you eat it.

840
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,890
What do you mean "help me eat it"?

841
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:44,190
I know you don't want to do anything right now.

842
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,090
I also felt that way after my dad died.

843
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:54,360
But don't be scared. You have me. I can help you.

844
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:58,560
If you don't want to talk, I can say it for you.

845
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:03,620
If you don't want to go to the funeral, I'll go for you.

846
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:07,230
If you don't want to write, I'll write for you.

847
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:12,650
If you don't want to go to school, I'll help you talk to the teacher.

848
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:15,780
Whatever you want to do, I'll help you.

849
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:21,460
No matter for how long, I'll help you until you feel better.

850
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,910
Are you crying for me too?

851
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,260
You're still so young.

852
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:39,780
Yet you lost both of your parents already. How did this even happen?

853
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:15,590
For some reason, your wedding photo with Huo Yung Tai is trending on internet right now.

854
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:19,820
- What?
- You run a marriage agency, yet you concealed that you are divorced. Does this not count as fraud?

855
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:22,500
We do our best for all of our members–

856
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,150
Why aren't you telling me the truth? It's not that you used to like her.

857
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:29,960
You actually still like her right now.

858
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,480
Then what do you want me to do?

859
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,490
Don't keep in contact with Yan Fei anymore.

860
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:37,410
I can sue you all for assault. Then we'll see you all in court!

861
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:41,850
- Sue us! Come sue us!
- Fine, I will!

862
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:45,410
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

863
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:49,200
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
