1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,590
Your suitcase, your sports shirt, your phone password,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,830
all have 29 in it. All of these important things have to do with Yan Fei. How am I supposed to trust you?

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,560
She's already married. I don't know what you're worrying about.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,280
Then what if she wasn't married?

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,620
Miss Yan Fei, are you Huo Yung Tai's ex-wife?

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,090
You pretended you were in a happy marriage. Isn't this considered fraud?

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,000
Are you even men? How shameless!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,240
Just stay in my room for the next few days.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,350
Thank you for always appearing when I need you the most,

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,260
making me feel that I'm not all alone, even though I'm by myself.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,550
Wang Hsuan Yu, enough!

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,800
Stop being in contact with Yan Fei.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,190
I can't do that. She's in a bad state right now.

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,560
I can't just leave her alone and not care–

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,350
It is not that you used to like her.

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,700
You still like her even now!

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,670
Which eye of yours sees that he likes me?

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,840
Both of my eyes see that he likes you.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,700
You're overthinking it.

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,200
Everyone now knows that you're single.

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,300
I am really saying goodbye to you this time.

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,050
I think you're acting strange.

23
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,510
Could it be... you still like Yan Fei?

Love Is Science

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,170
This month's latest fashion magazine

49
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,180
came here with me on the plane.

50
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,090
Oh my goodness! You know me so well!

51
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,360
This was the Paris fashion show that I really wanted to watch.

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,910
Senior, how long are you staying here this time?

53
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,470
One week. I will be leaving next week.

54
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,490
That fast?

55
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:00,390
I recently read a couple of interviews you wrote. You've improved a lot!

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,950
You didn't ask to meet up for afternoon tea only to tell me that, right?

57
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,910
I specifically wanted to ask you...

58
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,280
Do you want to go to Milan, Italy?

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,150
Our company wants to find another editor who is also familiar with the Asian market.

60
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,480
The first person I thought of was you! How about it? Are you interested?

61
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,010
Voodoo

62
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,510
The latest news: Royal Hotel's CEO, Huo Yung Tai,
[Love Is Science Marriage Agency]

63
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,010
who is the ex-husband of Yan Fei, the CEO of a marriage agency
[Latest: Divorce confirmed. Huo Yung Tai gives public statment]

64
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,450
that was recently involved in a scandal about scamming members,

65
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,400
has just published an official statement online.

66
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,870
He and Miss Yan Fei had agreed to divorce in a peaceful state.

67
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,440
"In a peaceful state."

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,730
Miss Yan Fei and I have agreed to divorce in a peaceful state.

69
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,250
She is still a very important person in my life.

70
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,860
We have chosen not to publicly announce our divorce,

71
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,130
because we do not want our personal life to affect our professional life.

72
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,850
He's such a "good" person.

73
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,550
Now he decides to make such a useless statement to support his ex-wife.

74
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,500
He's really a publicity genius! He's the pride of Taiwan!

75
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,920
He's probably tired of being asked about me.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,550
Does he not have a public relations team that can speak for him?

77
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,660
He stayed silent when the news broke. Does he choose to be vocal as all starts to quiet down?

78
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,930
He's best at joining a fight at the end.

79
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,710
There's a reason he is successful.

80
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,580
Why are we wasting our time talking about him?

81
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,900
The main point is that this matter is now almost resolved.

82
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,260
The damage was also not as big as we expected.

83
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm very satisfied with this result.

84
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,290
Really?

85
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,960
Very good!

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,190
I guess it's fine with me too, since I'm taking furlough without pay at my job.

87
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,220
I'll just be sitting here to see who dares to come make trouble.

88
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,750
- Are you taking furlough without pay?
- Yes.

89
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,150
You better tell me the truth.

90
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,990
Did you get romantically involved with a married pilot and your work found out?

91
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,440
What? Am I such an immoral woman in your heart?

92
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,230
I know I have a big appetite, but I still know how to avoid bad luck.

93
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,800
Let me tell you something. Married men

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,660
are the scariest yet wimpiest (weak) creatures in the world.

95
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,850
Actually, there was a married pilot who was sexually harassing me.

96
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,950
You don't have to worry about it!

97
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,090
I have already collected all the evidence and reported it to the company.

98
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,890
The company said they would take care of it so I'm taking a short break now.

99
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,720
I'm going to take a short break.

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,140
Boss! There's a Miss Chang here to see you.

101
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,640
Chin Lan!

102
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,650
Do you have time now to grab a cup of coffee?

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,620
I'm so sorry that news of my personal life affected your magazine company.

104
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,050
Did your personal life only impact our magazine company?

105
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,830
I've been really wanting to ask you this.

106
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,890
Why did you not tell me

107
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,990
you're Hsuan Yu's first love?

108
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,960
Because... I thought it was all in the past.

109
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,270
I didn't want you to overthink things.

110
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,170
You didn't want me to overthink things?

111
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,640
Then why did you stay over at Hsuan Yu's house the day of the incident?

112
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,510
You clearly knew he had a girlfriend so why did you not avoid it?

113
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,710
Why do you continue to test my limits again and again?

114
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,010
It is my fault that I didn't think it through.

115
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,930
I'm sorry for causing the misunderstanding.

116
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,600
If you're actually sorry, then don't be in touch with Hsuan Yu anymore.

117
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,380
Can't you do that?

118
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,700
I can do it. I'll distance myself from him.

119
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,620
I won't contact him myself, and I won't see him.

120
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,270
What you said is right. Hsuan Yu has a girlfriend so I should carefully avoid suspicion.

121
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,440
This will be my last time trusting you.

122
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,370
I hope our conversation today will stay between us.

123
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,210
Of course.

124
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,960
Oh! Also...

125
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,230
Hsuan Yu has already promised me he will move with me to Milan for work.

126
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,380
Milan?

127
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,400
We probably won't return for a long time.

128
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,680
If Hsuan Yu comes to find you...

129
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,460
I can allow you to meet him one last time to say your goodbyes.

130
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,140
Voodoo

131
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,350
She was completely fine yesterday.

132
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,880
Why can't I reach her today? She's not even reading or replying to my messages.

133
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,060
Or... or is it because my cell phone is broken?

134
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,610
Hi!

135
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,790
I brought over the client's information.

136
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,980
Okay. Why don't you wait for me in the VIP room? I'll grab some things and be right there.

137
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,920
Okay.

138
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,720
Hi!

139
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,610
Hey! Come here.

140
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,560
Is my forehead a little dark (sign of a ghost or bad luck)?

141
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,860
Or...

142
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,260
Is there something following me from behind?

143
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,390
I'm a hairstylist.

144
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,500
I'm not the "Tiger God" (spiritual medium). I can't see them.

145
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,130
What exactly did I do wrong?

146
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,560
Why do I feel like the whole world is rejecting me?

147
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,440
Even you are ignoring me.

148
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,200
I don't understand this. As long as we're making money, we're fine.

149
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,970
Are you busy? When do you get off work today? Baby, whenever I think of yesterday, I get so excited.

150
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,400
I didn't know he was such an innocent baby.

151
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,730
I've only been in one meeting,

152
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,620
and I already have dozens of missed calls from him,

153
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,520
and these messages make me lose interest.

154
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,250
Mark Lee

155
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,320
Text messages from Mark Lee:

156
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,080
Hi, Baby! I see you've read my messages.

157
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,450
I'm so happy.

158
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,110
I knew you wouldn't ignore me.

159
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,610
Baby! Are you free tonight?

160
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,860
Last night, I was awake all night.

161
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,760
I kept thinking of you.

162
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,850
Baby!

163
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,180
I know a great and exciting place–

164
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,690
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,830
From today forward, I will be busy every single day.

166
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,550
Mr. Sticky Gum. Accident!
Block

167
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,970
Thank you. Bye bye. Please don't contact me again.

168
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
What's wrong?

169
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,690
Didn't you meet with Miss Chang

170
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,840
to discuss the featured article in Garter?

171
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,470
If only it were that simple.

172
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Wait!

173
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,750
Did you do anything wrong? Why else would she suddenly lash out at you?

174
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,810
I know! Why don't you steal Wang Hsuan Yu from her for real?

175
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,190
Since Chang Chin Lan thinks you're a spider demon (folklore demoness eats men),

176
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,560
you should just gobble up Wang Hsuan Yu to fulfill her wish.

177
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,510
Why would I gobble him up?

178
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,810
You're really the trouble-making type.

179
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,150
Stop messing with me. I'm really troubled by this.

180
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,800
Fine. I'll stop messing with you, but you must answer me.

181
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,090
Do you really, really,

182
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,900
really not like Wang Hsuan Yu?

183
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,110
Of course, I like him! Hey!

184
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,360
But it is not the type of "like" you're thinking of.

185
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,660
He's just a younger brother whom I really like.

186
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,910
Liar! Why are you saying he's a "younger brother" again?

187
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,460
Does your mom even want a son? I understand your mom better than you do.

188
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,750
She only wants a son-in-law, not a son.

189
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,250
Stop randomly bringing my mom into this mess.

190
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,690
Liking Hsuan Yu as a younger brother has nothing to do with my mom.

191
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,980
Even though I'm your best friend,

192
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,740
I must say that

193
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,820
I really admire Chang Chin Lan.

194
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,420
At least she is brave enough to confess her love, pursue him, and come yell at the mistress.

195
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,410
No matter what the results will be, I respect her a lot. She's not like a turtle I know.

196
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,490
What are you talking about? Who is the mistress?

197
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,800
I didn't say you were the mistress.

198
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,960
Okay, tell me.

199
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,530
If Wang Hsuan Yu was single,

200
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,650
what would you think of him?

201
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,290
What do you mean? He's... he's just like that.

202
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,140
What does "just like that" even mean?

203
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,180
Do you even see him as a man?

204
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,920
Of course, he's a man!

205
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,630
Okay! Since you see him as a man, have you ever thought of sleeping with him?

206
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,380
No! No! No! I've never! No, no way!

207
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,520
Stop being so nervous! Come here. Relax!

208
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,880
- What are you doing?
- Relax!

209
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,830
- Close your eyes.
- What?

210
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,560
Close your eyes!

211
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,080
Start fantasizing now.

212
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,530
You and Wang Hsuan Yu,

213
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,770
a single man and woman in a room alone...

214
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,070
Suddenly, he can't help it

215
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,290
and throws you down.

216
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,470
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

217
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,100
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Don't stop!

218
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,900
How can you let me have such an evil imagination?

219
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,830
It is too scary! I can't! I can't!

220
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,450
I... I... I feel like

221
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,160
I'm a bad older sister who is abducting a minor.

222
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,230
It can't happen! Never!

223
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,650
I think you're quite happy though.

224
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,660
Okay, okay.

225
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,730
But what if Wang Hsuan Yu

226
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,420
really does go to Milan?

227
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,270
Would you really not care?

228
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,160
Do you not care? Do you not care?

229
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,750
Care or not care. She doesn't know. Maybe she doesn't care.

230
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,120
Voodoo

231
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,350
Her hair is dry, but her scalp is oily.

232
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,360
I would recommend that she use this brand's shampoo for oily hair.

233
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,630
It even contains calendula (marigold) extract,

234
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,660
which can improve the skin's oily condition and prevent acne formation.

235
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,660
For her hair, she can also use the conditioner

236
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,150
and hair oil.

237
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,430
I've used this brand's shampoo before.

238
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,100
It is really good. It has a citrus fragrance, which smells very relaxing.

239
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,350
It doesn't have those strong chemical fragrances.

240
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,330
If she doesn't want to cut her hair short,

241
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,290
then maybe we can perm her hair to give her those natural waves so it won't look too flat.

242
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,210
Your coffee.

243
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,470
I will try to discuss it with her again.

244
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,810
She doesn't seem to like perming her hair.

245
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,360
I believe that with your superior looks and excellent eloquence,

246
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,620
you will definitely be able to persuade her.

247
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,340
If she doesn't want to perm her hair,

248
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,580
can you just use hair rollers instead?

249
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,990
But it will be easier to take care of permed hair.

250
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,550
Or is there a way to give more volume with a layered cut?

251
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,450
Do I need to give you two some alone time?

252
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,320
- Yes!
- No!

253
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,330
I'm going to grab two magazines.

254
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,390
Will two minutes be enough?

255
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,070
Five minutes.

256
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,800
What do you want?

257
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,430
That's what I want to ask you!

258
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,950
Why are you treating me like air?

259
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,210
You can be homophobic. Why can't I be hetero-phobic?

260
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay! I'm sorry!

261
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,650
I will admit my attitude toward you, in the beginning, was not very polite, but...

262
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,350
I've changed! Look at how friendly I am with you now.

263
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,380
Stop! Don't touch me!

264
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,940
Hi, Boss Chiao. What's wrong?

265
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,470
Okay. Okay.

266
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,060
I will return to the office for the meeting soon.

267
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,720
Bye bye.

268
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,820
Is that your boss, Miss Chiao An Na?

269
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,190
Her cell phone isn't broken, is it?

270
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,840
That's her cell phone number! D*mn it!

271
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,320
I only have her LINE. I don't have her cell phone number.

272
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,000
Can you please tell me her cell phone number?

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,980
Please!

274
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,850
I must ask Boss Chiao first if she wants that.

275
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,020
You definitely can't ask her.

276
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,250
Why?

277
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,290
Because...

278
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,250
- Basically...
- Basically, you got dumped.

279
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,210
But you're trying so hard to cling to her.

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,660
That's not true! My feelings toward Chiao An Na are like...

281
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,750
Isn't it just that you like her?

282
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,840
Yes.

283
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,790
How can anyone not be charmed by her?

284
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,960
Give me her cell phone number. Please! Please!

285
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,190
- The five minutes are up. Stop disrupting my work.
- Please! Just tell me.

286
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,430
- Stop disrupting my work! Go mop the floors!
- Please!

287
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,410
Why are you ignoring me?

288
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,020
I have work. I need to leave now.

289
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,500
Don't I have the right not to greet you?

290
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,120
Is Chiao An Na at the office?

291
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,590
Boss Chiao is a shareholder. She usually isn't, and she doesn't need to be in the office.

292
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,190
Then you must at least know when she goes to the office.

293
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,440
Boss Chiao doesn't reveal her schedule to us.

294
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,410
You can at least ask her.

295
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,560
If you want to find her, do it yourself! Do I need to tell you our office's address?

296
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,760
I still have work to do. I'm leaving!

297
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,730
Hey! Where are you going?

298
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,870
I'm going to a place where you're not.

299
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,710
Do you know what Chiao An Na likes and dislikes?

300
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,390
I'm not her boyfriend. I'm not obligated to know that.

301
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,540
Then does she have a boyfriend? Wait, no.

302
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,230
I should ask how many boyfriends she has. This way I can know–

303
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,290
Excuse me, Mister. Do you not have to work?

304
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,120
I'm a top hair stylist. Everyone wants to schedule an appointment with me.

305
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,220
Right? What does she like?

306
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,740
You're just very...

307
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,260
I'm not!

308
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,500
Aren't we just having a meal at home?

309
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,850
Why are you dressed like you're at your daughter's wedding?

310
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,680
That's right. This is the armor I wore at your wedding to Yung Tai.

311
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,760
It has been twelve years.

312
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,730
Why did my body not change at all?

313
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,950
It is still so... beautiful.

314
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,710
Yung Tai is the same,

315
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,360
still so sentimental and righteous.

316
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,950
What does that mean?

317
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,070
Baby, isn't your company in trouble?

318
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,100
I'm really worried about you.

319
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,810
So I messaged Yung Tai.

320
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,310
I asked him to speak out on your behalf.

321
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,080
Did you hear his statement? He was totally defending you!

322
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,460
- A man like him—
- Why did you reach out to him?

323
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:36,350
I... I just wanted to give him a chance to show off.

324
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,030
It is none of his business.

325
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,730
Tell me! What does this have to do with him?

326
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,920
Even if my company goes bankrupt or I get hit by a side-view mirror, tire,

327
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,570
steering wheel, or get struck to death,

328
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,720
I still don't need his help!

329
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,750
I spent nine years proving

330
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,300
that I can live well without him!

331
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,740
But you! You ruined everything with one text!

332
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,480
Perhaps he still thinks he's my savior.

333
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,660
You... Would you be able to live without me?

334
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,280
At least you know he still cares about you.

335
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,600
I don't need him to care about me!

336
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,880
My gosh!

337
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,980
I was backstabbed by my own biological mother! What is this mess? What is this awful mess?

338
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,350
Hello? Chiao An Na. Did you get into another car accident?

339
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:51,800
Okay, no problem. I will ask Yan Fei to see you right away. Yes, okay, okay.

340
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,930
Chiao An Na got into a car accident. It is serious.

341
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,310
Hurry and go see her.

342
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,320
Hurry! Go see her!

343
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,120
All right, it is the same place. You know it. Here is your bag.

344
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,060
Take your phone.

345
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,890
Hurry, hurry.

346
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,350
What the heck.

347
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,220
You clearly want Yung Tai to know

348
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,080
you're a phoenix now.

349
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,820
Why are you so angry? You clearly still care.

350
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,690
Still care... That means there is still hope.

351
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:40,300
That's right! There's no way that I will be defeated this easily.

352
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,710
For my daughter's happiness,

353
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,970
I must work hard!

354
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,610
When Yan Fei saw your public statement, she almost cried because she was so moved.

355
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,120
I know she sounds tough,

356
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,520
but she really does need you.

357
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,930
Sent message to Yung Tai.

358
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,680
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

359
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,840
That cat then fell down by itself and landed in its own pee.

360
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,020
That's a sound that only Jia Jia would make.

361
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,290
- "Meow. Meow."
- So funny.

362
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,490
Chin Lan, why are you here?

363
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,860
- What?
- You deserve it! Chin Lan already told us.

364
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,930
You really went overboard this time.

365
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,620
Are you staring at her? You shouldn't be scared of her telling on you when you're the one who's at fault!

366
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,090
How dare you treat our Chin Lan like that?

367
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,850
I didn't do anything wrong.

368
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,850
When you have a girlfriend, you have to keep your distance from other women.

369
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,790
Also, didn't you argue with Chin Lan over another woman?

370
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,980
It wasn't only an argument. You even gave her the silent treatment.

371
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,540
I didn't get into an argument with Chin Lan.

372
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,360
Actually, the other person is Hsuan Yu's very important client.

373
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:32,120
It's not Hsuan Yu's fault. I was too narrow-minded.

374
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,140
Let me tell you. You have to be mindful of keeping your distance from female clients.

375
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,970
Although customers always come first,

376
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,840
you still have to put your girlfriend first. Do you understand?

377
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,090
Your brother and I both think

378
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,190
you should sincerely apologize to Chin Lan.

379
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,540
Hurry!

380
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,760
I'm sorry.

381
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,730
Let's not be angry at each other anymore, okay?

382
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,100
Why are you still standing there?

383
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,600
Okay. Let's all sit down to eat now. I will go grab another bowl.

384
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,760
Why did you lie to my brother and sister-in-law?

385
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,190
Then should I have said you cheated on me?

386
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,090
I didn't.

387
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,330
Then do you dare tell your brother and sister-in-law

388
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,360
that the female client is Yan Fei?

389
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,830
I waited two days for your call.

390
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,730
I thought you were still angry at me so I–

391
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,190
So you thought I broke up with you?

392
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,430
- Of course not!
- Then why didn't you call me?

393
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,550
Why am I always the one initiating things?

394
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,590
How much effort have you put into this relationship?

395
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Our relationship started

396
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,290
because I decided to set aside my self-esteem to pursue you.

397
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,700
I really cherish our relationship.

398
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,000
I treated your family as my own family.

399
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,200
I treated your friend as my best friend.

400
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:45,660
Although I feel I'm being treated unfairly, I still set aside my pride to come to you.

401
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,290
Even though I forced the apology from you,

402
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,030
I still think it is okay.

403
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:06,740
This feeling of being wronged is nothing compared to losing you.

404
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,390
I'm sorry. It is my fault.

405
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:53,140
From now on, I will put your needs first.

406
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,860
I promise.

407
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,500
Really?

408
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,930
Yes.

409
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,240
Then can you move with me to Milan?

410
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,830
Milan?

411
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,890
There's a good work opportunity there for me. I want to try it.

412
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,100
You can also use this time to study and practice more.

413
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,090
You kept failing the official hair stylist exam, right?

414
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,990
But I don't know if I can adapt well in Milan.

415
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,880
All learning starts from scratch.

416
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,230
If you don't take the first step, you'll never know how much potential you have.

417
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,170
What if I don't have the potential?

418
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,460
At least you won't have any regrets.

419
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,570
I believe in you... and us.

420
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,930
Think about it.

421
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,850
If you can get certification from a hairstylist school in Milan,

422
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,170
many people would want you as their hairstylist.

423
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,970
You might even be able to open your own salon. Isn't that great?

424
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,520
Didn't you just say you would put my needs first?

425
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,670
Do you know which perfume brand Chiao An Na likes? You can tell from smelling it, right?

426
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,770
What does Chiao An Na like to eat?

427
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,970
Or does she like to drink red wine?

428
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:15,870
If we could just have a fated meeting,

429
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,530
then it would be so romantic.

430
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,780
Do you want to wipe off your sweat?

431
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,810
You're tired! Let me help you do some stretching.

432
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,160
Don't touch me!

433
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,030
You're finally talking to me. Yes.

434
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,720
Does Chiao An Na come to the gym? If she does, I can take her... Hey!

435
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,880
Let me go fill your water for you.

436
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,660
Isn't this as heavy as me?

437
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,600
No.

438
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,870
Really?

439
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,000
It's really light.

440
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,550
Is it?

441
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,770
Benson.

442
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,440
Why are you here?

443
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,870
FIB Gym

444
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,960
Didn't you go to England to study abroad?

445
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,900
When did you come back?

446
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,960
I'm already standing in front of you. What's the point of asking that?

447
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,440
Everyone's an adult here. If you wanted to break up with me, why lie about studying abroad?

448
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,340
I said that back then because I didn't want to hurt you.

449
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,800
Also, it won't be awkward for either of us. But I didn't think you...

450
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,890
Hold on, hold on! Why are you staring at me like that?

451
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:59,050
Were you actually awaiting my return this entire time?

452
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,050
How can he be so naive?

453
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,860
Look at him.

454
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,700
So it's really true? Do you love me that much?

455
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,200
So if I didn't come here with my baby to exercise,

456
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,280
you would have had to wait until you died.

457
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,730
Honey!

458
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,270
Drink your water.

459
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,670
Who are they?

460
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,330
Is he the one who you mentioned to me before?

461
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,810
The ex whom you were finally able to dump?

462
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,160
Don't worry. You have me now.

463
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,940
Is this for real? Hold on. Why is your friend so cute?

464
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,170
Laugh all you want.

465
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:57,320
Let me tell you. I can see right away that you're straight.

466
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,690
You're as straight as a flagpole.

467
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,450
Let me tell you another thing for free.

468
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,160
Ou Wen hates it when others call him "Honey."

469
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,720
He doesn't even understand the situation. Stop embarrassing him. Why don't you leave, Little Boy?

470
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,200
- You can tell right away it's all fake.
- He's so pitiable.

471
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,980
They're so funny.

472
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,550
Did he really kiss him?

473
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,630
Don't lose to him.

474
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,750
Come with me if you dare.

475
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,330
Do you dare?

476
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,200
Baby, wait for me!

477
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,370
Don't go.

478
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,920
It will be fine. Don't you know who I am?

479
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,140
He used to be on the weightlifting national team.

480
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,330
It's very simple.

481
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,920
Let's compete in barbell squats.

482
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,740
Baby! You got this! Yes, Baby, yes!

483
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,100
You can't lose to him! Hurry! Hurry!

484
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,140
Baby! You got this! Keep going!

485
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,320
Focus! Focus! Focus! F-O-C-U-S! Focus, okay, Baby?

486
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,480
It's enough! Just admit you lost right now. It's already impressive enough that you held out until now.

487
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,700
Shut up! Don't look down on me.

488
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,710
Mark! You got this!

489
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,330
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

490
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,060
Keep going!

491
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,960
Keep going! Keep going!

492
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,640
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

493
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,720
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

494
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,670
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

495
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,720
- Baby! You can do it! Keep going!
- Oh, pain!

496
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,300
You crazy psycho! You wasted my time! Why are you trying so hard?

497
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,760
Baby! There are lots of psychos out there. Don't argue with them!

498
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,970
Here, drink some water. Let's go!

499
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,500
You're quite good, Young Man! Good job!

500
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,240
I won, right?

501
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,270
- I won, right?
- Yes!

502
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,690
You won.

503
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,630
My goodness. I'm so sore. My legs aren't even my legs anymore.

504
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,730
But... did you get to see your ex's face?

505
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:42,650
It was hilarious! Was he on the national weightlifting team?

506
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,380
It hurts!

507
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,420
I told you to give up earlier, but you insisted on continuing.

508
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,090
Now you have trouble even walking. Why were you so insistent?

509
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,950
- Did you want Chiao An Na's cell phone number that badly?
- Hey!

510
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,000
I didn't do this just because I wanted her number.

511
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,150
I didn't want you to be embarrassed in front of that b*stard.

512
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,660
I even kissed you and used my strength. My effort should be appreciated, if not my achievements.

513
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,570
Can't you tell that I truly wanted to help you?

514
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,930
There's nothing wrong with someone being better looking than you, Hanawa. (He looks like "Hanawa" in the manga "Chibi Maruko-chan.")

515
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,610
Who are you talking to?

516
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,800
Whoever responds is the one that I'm talking to. Hanawa.

517
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,210
Do you remember now? Back then, you yelled at me though I was helping you.

518
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,800
Hey! He was our company's client.
FIB Gym

519
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,330
He pays for my meals and my salary. He's my master.

520
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:38,750
You scolding him basically meant you cut off my salary. I didn't hit you so that means I love you.

521
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,250
What?

522
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,140
That was... just an example.

523
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,120
Aren't there a lot of those slang phrases used online?

524
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,980
Anyway... I didn't mean anything else by that. Don't worry.

525
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,540
No! There's definitely more meaning to that statement.

526
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,970
Or else why is your heart beating so fast?

527
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,680
No, it's not!

528
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,140
♫ Always be with you ♫

529
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:30,690
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile...  ♫

530
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,120
No!

531
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,190
There's definitely more meaning to that statement.

532
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,560
Or else why is your heart beating so fast?

533
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,440
No, it's not!

534
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,920
There's nothing wrong with that. It's normal for your heart to beat faster for someone as handsome as me.

535
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,060
Want me to kick you down the stairs so you can crawl back up one step at a time?

536
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,910
Please, don't!

537
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:06,170
I sacrificed so much for you. Are you willing to leave me behind?

538
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,190
Let's go.

539
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,310
Careful, it hurts!

540
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,960
My legs are so sore.

541
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,360
Who told you to keep competing?

542
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:28,630
We've arrived. My house is here.

543
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:33,740
I'm... going up now. Thanks!

544
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,860
Wait...

545
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,930
About Chiao An Na's phone number...

546
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,910
What about it?

547
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,420
I haven't asked for her permission yet so I can't give it to you.

548
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,150
I knew that already.

549
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:50,180
But... next week we're having a meal together.

550
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,240
You can pretend to pass by coincidentally.

551
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,480
Really?

552
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,890
Yes! Thank you!

553
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,350
I know you're handsome and nice too!

554
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,670
Thank you!

555

556
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,620
Time Line Magazine: Huo Yung Tai

557
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,950
Isn't your company in trouble?

558
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,630
I'm really worried about you. So I messaged Yung Tai.

559
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,100
I asked him to speak out on your behalf.

560
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,820
Did you hear his statement?

561
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,920
He was totally defending you!

562
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,450
I bet you didn't expect to still be cleaning up my mess after we divorced for so many years.

563
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,890
- Get out!
- Now, now!

564
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,330
I'm sorry! I didn't do it on purpose. Please don't be mad at me.

565
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,820
Fine. Then tell me,

566
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,020
how do I tell my boss that the reason I left the planning meeting was because my wife didn't know how to park her car?

567
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,590
You knew that this presentation was very important to me.

568
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:25,580
That person today was very scary.

569
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,500
My mind went completely blank.

570
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,530
I didn't know what to do. I also didn't know who to call. So I just...

571
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:35,930
This time is because the person was scary. Last time was because the cockroach in the kitchen could fly.

572
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,460
The time before that was because you forgot our house address.

573
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,960
Fei Fei. Don't you think you should start trying to be more independent?

574
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,900
I listened to you so I started to learn how to drive.

575
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,970
I know it's hard for you to work and take care of me at the same time.

576
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,170
That's why I'm really trying. I'm trying so hard!

577
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,520
Haven't you noticed that I already took out our trash?

578
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:09,660
I washed all our dishes. I cut up all the fruit in the fridge already.

579
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,030
I'm really, really trying my best. I worked very hard.

580
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:24,690
Okay. Fine. I give up.

581
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,320
It's because I married a little princess.

582
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,710
From now on, I'll take care of all these things. Okay?

583
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,090
I know it's because you love me the most.

584
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,470
You...

585
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,230
If you didn't have me, would you be able to survive?

586
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,330
I wouldn't be able to survive! I would die.

587
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,630
I wouldn't be able to survive without you.

588
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:58,370
Oh my goodness! That's the one thing I regret saying the most!

589
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,410
Bella, Time Line Magazine, Belle

590
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:08,000
Huo Yung Tai! Nine years, I've left you for nine years!

591
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,410
Did I die yet? No, I didn't!

592
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,130
Without you, I'm still living a very exciting, good life!

"I will always do my best!"

595
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,020
I'm so angry!

596
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,000
Ever since I met Little Piggy,

597
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,490
I haven't needed to take my headache medicine.

598
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,440
Little Piggy

599
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:19,400
I can do it. I'll distance myself from him.

600
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,640
I won't contact him myself, and I won't see him.

601
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,980
Then can you move with me to Milan?

602
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,920
You just said you would put my needs first.

603

Yan Fei

604
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,770
Just tell Chin Lan you will no longer be in contact with her. She won't know if that's true.

605
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:25,470
- I don't want to lie.
- Then you need to be completely devoted to your girlfriend.

606
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:29,240
Delete all the contact info of other women, including Yan Fei.

That's such good news! When are you leaving?

Don't be like me, who stayed here in this tiny area.

Do you understand?

622
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:05,590
Is it so bad to stay?

623
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,600
I think... there's nothing wrong with staying either.

624
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,630
Also, you've established a stable number of clients already.

625
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:15,150
All your family and friends are here. So it's okay if you stay, too.

Also, Rui Rui is almost due. Wouldn't it be great if you stayed to help out?

00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,740
I didn't have much choices back then.

630
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,000
So I had to give up on my dreams and education.

631
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,030
If you don't go, you will definitely regret it! Don't leave any regrets in life!

632
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,820
If he goes, will he not have any regrets?

633
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,810
That's not what I meant!

634
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,890
Hsuan Yu. Do you really want to go?

635
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:49,980
I don't know. I never thought of going abroad to study.

636
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,160
But what Chin Lan said is also right. This is a good opportunity.

637
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,130
There doesn't seem to be any reason not to go.

638
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,330
I think you should separate your feelings toward Chin Lan from going abroad.

639
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,860
Think it over carefully. It's your life.

640
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,990
If you really don't want to go, your brother and I

641
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:10,960
will support you no matter what. Right?

642
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,890
Yes, that's right. But I still hope you really do go.

643
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,780
Why are you laughing?

644
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,780
This is the sign of a hero!

645
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,830
Here.

646
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,090
Did you compete with a national team weightlifter doing barbell squats?

647
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,440
I think you're crazy.

648
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,890
You're right! Even I think I'm crazy.

649
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:13,470
But I have no regrets! At least there is one less regret in Ou Wen's life now.

650
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,330
I didn't have much choices back then. So I had to give up on my dreams and education.

651
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,790
If you don't go, you will definitely regret it! Don't leave any regrets in life!

652
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,540
What if I don't have the potential?

653
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,950
At least you won't have any regrets.

654
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,720
Wait. What's that face?

655
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,720
What face?

656
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,300
It's the face where something big is about to happen.

657
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,870
Wang Hsuan Hu, what are you planning to do?

658
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,670
Chin Lan is going to Milan.

659
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:47,880
I decided to go with her.

660
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,350
Mi... Milan? That's so out of the blue.

661
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:56,780
I'm going to tell Brother Chang Ching about my decision. Also, I'll ask for the rest of the day off.

662
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:01,620
Wait, wait.

663
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,550
Let me ask for time off first! My situation needs it more than you.

664
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,910
Move the product a bit lower, and lift your head a bit.

665
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,620
Help her adjust her hair and clothing.

666
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:30,700
That's it! It's good. Next set.

667
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,650
Do you have time later?

668
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,830
I want you to accompany me...

669
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,130
to buy a suitcase.

670
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,970
♫ Always be with you ♫

671
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:30,330
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile...  ♫

672
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,560
Look at this one.

673
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,290
- It's a carry-on.
- Yes.

674
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,820
Look at this one!

675
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,870
- How about this one?
- This one also suits you.

676
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,030
That one?

677
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,220
The size is nice.

678
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,250
It's light, and the wheels are smooth.

679
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,720
Okay, then that is the one.

680
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:02,150
I'll set my password to be... 1-0-1.

681
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,710
You can set it to be 1-1-1.

682
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,360
Isn't it too easy to be hacked?

683
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:13,100
So what? If worse comes to worst, I'll lose some underwear.

684
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,820
The wheels...

685
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,740
What's next?

686
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:28,530
Wait a second. We still need to get our visa.

687
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,750
Do you have a passport?

688
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,600
I'll get it.

689
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,960
Please mail this package for me.

690
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,450
And this is the address.

691
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,650
Everyone, good morning.

692
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,950
Good morning.

693
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,890
Hi, Boss. Today is my turn to meet with you for the employee review.

694
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,690
What do you want for lunch?

695
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,730
I know a French restaurant...

696
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,140
There's a girl in that restaurant who is really pretty.

697
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,770
Did you save a male server for yourself?

698
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,380
Yes, he's cute and has big eyes,

699
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,230
but he likely has a girlfriend.

700
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,820
Boss Qiao.

701
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,800
Oh my, isn't our meeting next week?

702
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,380
Right.

703
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:17,060
Actually, someone wants me to ask for your phone number.

704
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,040
Is it fine for me to give it out?

705
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,570
- Is he good looking?
- Of course!

706
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:26,120
Then don't ask me next time. Give it to him directly.

707
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,780
But... who is that guy?

708
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,410
It's Voodoo's—

709
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,470
Oh, no, you can't give it to Mark.

710
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,030
Why not?

711
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,290
I think I made a mistake.

712
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,910
I thought he's a playboy.

713
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,160
Who knew he'd be so devoted?

714
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:46,260
That type of man is a big no for me. I have no time for that.

715
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,760
Besides his love life,

716
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,500
I think Mark is actually...

717
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,810
very enthusiastic and... easygoing.

718
00:55:56,810 --> 00:56:00,760
I can feel that he really wants to become friends with you.

719
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,800
Are you close to him?

720
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,410
A little.

721
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,440
Then you should trust me

722
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,470
instead of trusting your feelings.

723
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:12,480
We are impossible.

724
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:19,100
But... things are not absolute.

725
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:24,060
Being devoted isn't a bad thing. You can

726
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,140
think of him as a simple person.

727
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,630
- Tai Ou Wen.
- Yes?

728
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:34,660
Does Mark have dirt (secret info) on you?

729
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,720
No way!

730
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,420
I am impeccable.

731
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:48,740
You better be! I thought you guys don't get along.

732
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,360
So why are you suddenly saying nice things about him?

733
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,300
I'm just casually asking.

734
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,350
All right. I understand. I'll never give your number to him.

735
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,700
I'd better get going.

736
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,400
It smells fishy.

737
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,730
With sounds?
Let's Play

738
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,170
I think girls will like this.

739
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,430
And this. Do you think Jia Jia will like it?

740
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,480
She will like it if you buy it for her.

741
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,140
This is a great choice for a Christmas gift.
Just like home

742
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,760
This one.

743
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,410
Jia Jia is so lucky to have you as her uncle.

744
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:55,040
I think the gifts for the next three years' Christmas, Children's Day and birthdays

745
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,840
are all taken care of.

746
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:03,250
When she was born, my brother and his wife had a street stand selling things.

747
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:06,590
I couldn't let my sister-in-law carry Jia Jia on her back to go to work

748
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:10,850
so I've been babysitting her since young.

749
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:15,580
I knew you were a good guy.

750
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:19,020
Have you bought all your gifts?

751
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,280
Let me see.

752
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,960
There are still Rui Rui's onesie (bodysuit), San Ma's gift, my brother and his wife's gift...

753
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,660
Baby,

754
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,680
you can shop online.

755
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,750
Gifts are supposed to be personally hand wrapped with handwritten notes. That will show sincerity.

756
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:44,530
Your gift list is longer than your to-do list.

757
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:52,510
I hope these gifts can take my place in keeping them company.

758
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:01,960
That's okay. Let's keep shopping.

759
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,940
Hurry, we still need to shop for Brother Chang Ching and Mark.

760
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:13,080
Get this for Mark. It's healthy.

761
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,470
Do people in Milan speak English?

762
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,690
Italian.

763
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:21,180
I think this one...

764
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,220
Don't worry.

765
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,110
My company registered me in a language school. I also registered for you.

766
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:32,560
That's their website.

767
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:39,300
I hope after three months, I can...

768
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,500
learn how to buy soy sauce.

769
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,680
There's always a solution.

770
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,610
I didn't expect my solution is that close to me.

771
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,650
Fare lo shampoo (do the shampoo)

772
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,760
e le trecce (and the braids)

773
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,670
acconciatura (for the hairstyle).

774
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,980
Can you speak Italian?

775
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,800
A cup of "espresso" (an expresso coffee).

776
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,150
How do you know Italian? I thought you went to school in America.

777
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,900
Teach me.

778
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:27,540
I have a masterpiece movie that I've treasured since college.

779
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,730
What is that?

780
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:33,530
It's called the Italian Riding Whore (adult film, name sounds like "Italian Miracle").

781
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:38,320
I have watched it since college. The content is so practical.

782
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:43,220
It is about a woman designer in Italy,

783
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:47,650
and how she rode all her clients.

784
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:53,390
Fare lo shampoo (do the shampoo)

785
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,090
e le trecce (and the braids).

786
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,960
So this is where it's at.

787
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,320
A.N.C.H

788
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,490

"Fever reducer."

Cold medicine.
[Tylenol]

792
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:31,980
Thanks to this birthday present you gave me back then,

793
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,350
I was able to survive in the U.S.A.

794
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,900
Let's go together.

795
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,920
There has been something I've kept in my heart a long time now. Ever since our first meeting, when you ruined my ice cream, I lost my heart. If possible, I want to stay by your side every day.

796
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,490
In all these years that passed, I have always liked you very, very much. I hope you are willing to be my girlfriend. From the Little Piggy who's been quietly liking you.

797

801

803

♫ Do you really understand what it means to be the one and only? ♫

Piggy's Love Diary

809
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:48,270
Hurry! Hurry!

810
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:55,180
Hey! What are you boys doing?

811
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,600
Go! Go!

812
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,520
B*stards! Who taught you to steal things?

813
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,430
Don't let me catch you two! Or else I'll report to your school!

814
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:19,270
♫  The quietest thing isn't the deep sea ♫
♫ It's the street where I met you ♫

815
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:23,590
Hey!

816
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,040
Don't touch it!

817
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,600
Do you really think you can do a good job?

818
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,910
I think it looks a little ugly.

819
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:33,300
Are you sure you don't want to buy one?

820
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:38,680
I have no choice. I already spent all my money on the gift.

821
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:45,030
Isn't your brother working already?

822
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:47,140
My brother works really hard.

823
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:50,830
The soles of his shoes are all worn out, yet he won't buy a new pair.

824
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:53,080
I don't want to ask him for money.

825
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,080
Does this look okay?

826
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,920
If you don't have money to buy flowers,

827
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,050
then why don't you just give the gift only?

828
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:07,980
I've heard that girls love it when they receive flowers.

829
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,520
She will probably really like it too.

830
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,430

♫ Even if I have nothing, I'll still be able to see you ♫

01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:25,370
♫ Please forgive a fool who has lost control because of his love ♫

835
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,470
Happy birthday!

836
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:40,050
The flower is a bit ugly...

837
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:50,030
This is the best birthday present I've ever received.

838
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:55,800
Today is Sunday. I thought no one remembered my birthday.

839
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,470
My mom has to work so she couldn't come home.

840
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:03,850
I thought the entire world had forgotten my birthday.

841
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:07,290
How is that possible? It's so easy to remember 03/29.

842
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:09,480
I will never forget it.

843
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,390
- Really?
- Really.

844
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:14,280
My ATM card password is 0-3-2-9.

845
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,850
How can you just randomly tell someone your ATM card password?

846
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:26,220
Don't worry! I already withdrew all my money from my account to buy your birthday present.

847
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:27,920
What is it?

848
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,490
You told me before that the vocabulary in your college textbooks is hard to understand.

849
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:38,850
I think this present will be very useful to you.

850
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:45,330
Silly!

851
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:47,420
I don't need anything.

852
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,180
I just need someone to accompany me on my birthday.

853
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:54,990
Growing up, my mom has always been busy working.

854
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:58,530
Birthdays, holidays, college exams, and even when I'm sick,

855
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:01,430
I've always been alone. I never had anyone next to me during those days.

856
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:05,000
I really hate being alone.

857
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,300
Thank you, Little Piggy.

858
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,250
Thank you for letting me know that I'm not alone.

859
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,320
What do you want to eat? The meal is on me!

860
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,330
- I want to eat cake.
- Cake?

861
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:26,230
You want to eat cake, right? Let's go then!

862
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,440
- That's when I suddenly understood...
- How much did you spend on this?

863
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,260
why she always paid for my meals.

864
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,750
It wasn't because her family is rich and she has nowhere else to spend the money on.

865
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,790
It's because she didn't want to be alone.

866
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:42,320
I heard from Mark that Hsuan Yu is leaving for Milan tomorrow.

867
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,940
I have no more regrets from my youth.

868
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,800
Then do you know what you have to face next?

869
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,480
Your ex.

870
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,830
If you're not mentally prepared yet,

871
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,090
then you will easily fall for him again.

872
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:57,660
Sheng Ying? My goodness, it's Liu Sheng Ying!

873
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,940
You haven't changed at all!

874
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,930
- Your favorite vitamin.
- You like him, right?

875
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,660
He likes women though.

876
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:08,040
I will never make the same mistake twice.

877
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,100
Hello, Fei Fei.

878
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,930
Long time no see.

879
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,690
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

880
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:19,430
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
