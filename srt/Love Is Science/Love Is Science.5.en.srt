1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,960
Oh my gosh, what day and age is this? Why can't a woman express her opinions on a date?

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,370
It is sexist.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,510
Then just tell me how many houses you own.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,610
Asking someone's net worth on the first meeting,

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,830
have you considered if you are actually worth it?

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,320
I noticed that you were walking a little strangely.
[Care Leaves Band-aids]

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,860
He is Wu You Fu, forty-two years old.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,240
Little Piggy?

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,600
You came at just the right time.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,730
After you became my stylist, I don't take that many headache pills anymore.

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,430
I will wait for you.

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,960
It is really late. A girl shouldn't go home alone.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,200
Where is Mimi? Or we will all die together!

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,320
In his anger, he poured an unknown liquid toward the owner, Ms. Yan.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,750
It was obvious that it was Yan Fei.

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,230
Hey, what are you doing?

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,600
Did you pass by?

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,510
The truth is I came to see if I would be able to meet you.

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,890
How many times did he "coincidentally" pass by my house?

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,030
At least, I can't keep lying to Hsuan Yu.

Ju Yueh Noodle...

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,270
It's delicious.

46
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,330
Yan Fei, what brings you here?

47
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,340
I have something to tell Hsuan Yu.

48
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,360
What's wrong?

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,140
You came just at the right time.

50
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,610
Hsuan Yu's girlfriend just came back from her business trip in Europe. We're welcoming her back.

51
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,830
Come join us for dinner.

52
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,220
Chin Lan, you came at the right time. Let me introduce you two.

53
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,170
She's my high school friend, Yan Fei.

54
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,930
This is Chin Lan, Hsuan Yu's girlfriend.

55
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,000
Hi, nice to meet you.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,670
Hello.

57
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,830
Didn't you just say you had something to tell me? What is it?

58
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,500
Just some work stuff, the details of our collaboration.

59
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,120
When did you two start working together? Why don't I know about this?

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,790
It happened recently.

61
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,840
I'm going to style the hair of clients from Yan Fei's company.

62
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,340
Company...

63
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,460
I'm an international matchmaker. It's similar to a marriage middleman.

64
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,620
An international matchmaker? That sounds awesome.

65
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,400
"Love Is Science"?

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,550
Scientific dating?

67
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,750
You can say it like that. We are an internationally based matchmaking service.

68
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,160
We help our members from all over the world interact with each other.

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,110
We truly bring people who are thousands of miles apart together for marriage.

70
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,920
That's great.

71
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,260
I am... an editor of a women's magazine, Garter.

72
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,000
Our magazine's target audience is women between 25 and 45.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,030
You should know that, besides work, women in this age range

74
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,580
care about love and marriage the most.

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,820
We have the same target audience as your Love Is Science.

76
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,280
Can I have an interview with you when you have time?

77
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,340
You're being so abrupt. You might scare her away.

78
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,490
Sorry, I'm a workaholic.

79
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,270
It's okay. You can come to my company, and we can talk over coffee.

80
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,280
Really? I'm being serious.

81
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,230
Enough, don't just keep talking about work. The food is getting cold.

82
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,540
Sit, sit. Let's eat.

83
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,420
You. Go get the chopsticks.

84
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,440
You, go get a bowl of noodles.

85
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,630
Please sit.

86
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,630
Let me introduce my daughter,

87
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,860
Jia Jia.

88
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,170
Jia Jia, say hi to Sister Yan Fei.

89
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,470
She's so pretty, right?

90
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,620
Hello, Jia Jia.

91
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,180
I know how much you like to eat marinated eggs and tofu.

92
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,270
Here. There's also bean curd.

93
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,750
Thank you, Sister in law.

94
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,940
You always treat me so well.

95
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,710
You're welcome.

96
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,790
This is really delicious.

97
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,330
Thank you.

98
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,790
The braised dishes are our specialties. Do you want to pack some later for your husband?

99
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,990
That's right. We have a lot of braised dishes. If you take some home, you don't need to cook.

100
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,140
Her husband is in the U.S.

101
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,970
Is he there... for a business trip?

102
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,300
No, he lives in America. He's not there for a business trip.

103
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,430
He lives in America. You live in Taiwan.

104
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,400
Is it really a good idea to be separated in two countries?

105
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,920
A lot of people nowadays have dual-income families.

106
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,010
This kind of situation is very common.

107
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,270
Not to mention, aren't you the same, going on business trips every other day?

108
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,890
It's not the same. We're in a situation where a little absence makes our hearts grow fonder.

109
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,310
Besides, I miss you a lot during every business trip I go on.

110
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,260
But being on such a long business trip and not seeing each other,

111
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,540
don't you miss your husband?

112
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,530
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,620
But with your husband in the U.S.,

114
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,220
would you two want to have kids?

115
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,170
I'll help you get it.

116
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,090
Hsuan Yang, were you born in the year of the chicken?

117
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,280
Why are you so nosy?

118
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,770
No... I-I...

119
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,560
I suddenly remember that I have a meeting tomorrow, and I'm not prepared yet.

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,370
I'm going home to prepare for it.

121
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,130
You guys can carry on with your dinner.

122
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,790
Don't worry. Eat.

123
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,990
- You guys go ahead.
- Stay and eat a bit more.

124
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,820
Eat a bit more.

125
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,750
Yan Fei! Yan Fei.

126
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,040
- Be careful.
- I finally caught up to you.

127
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,660
I noticed you didn't eat anything so I packed up some for you.

128
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,320
Did you really come out to just give me this?

129
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,880
I can tell it was a little awkward for you earlier.

130
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,440
Wang Hsuan Yang, that idiot.

131
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,200
Doesn't he know that having children is a taboo topic for married couples?

132
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,010
On his behalf, I apologize.

133
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,490
It's fine, fine.

134
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,880
I really do have a meeting tomorrow morning.

135
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,460
That's good to hear.

136
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,640
Also, since you're living alone, it must be difficult to cook three meals a day.

137
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,370
You can always come to our noodle shop to eat. We also have a secret menu.

138
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,760
If you want someone to talk to, I'm always here.

139
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,420
Your wedding ring

140
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,140
is like a chastity belt,

141
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,910
tying you and your heart into a knot.

142
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,550
You came just at the right time.

143
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,970
Hsuan Yu's girlfriend just came back from her business trip in Europe. We're welcoming her back.

144
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,180
Come join us for dinner.

145
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,170
Besides, I miss you a lot during every business trip I go on.

146
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,290
I am so embarrassed.

147
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,010
Yan Fei, what were you thinking?

148
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,770
Diamonds are indeed women's best friend.

149
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,270
If I didn't have you, I wouldn't even have something to shield my embarrassment.

150
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,630
I won't take you off that easily ever again.

151
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,050
Never again.

152
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,850
Go in.

153
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,280
I've been gone on a business trip for so long.

154
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,800
Don't you want to hug me?

155
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,440
Okay.

156
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,320
Not even a kiss?

157
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,910
- On the streets?
- So what?

158
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,720
Stop fooling around. You know I don't—

159
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,320
I know you don't like public display of affection.

160
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,110
Can't your old-fashioned ways compromise a bit?

161
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,310
I was gone for several days on a business trip.

162
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,220
Wang Hsuan Yang, you are truly blessed with delicious food.

163
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,680
But being on such a long business trip and not seeing each other,

164
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,460
don't you miss your husband?

165
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,750
Terry Huo

166
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,280
Hubby.

167
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,290
- Hubby.
- Yes?

168
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,330
I want to eat roasted corn.

169
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,440
Hubby.

170
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,280
What's wrong?

171
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,540
I want to eat roasted corn.

172
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,140
- Roasted corn?
- Yes.

173
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,500
- Right now?
- Yes.

174
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,390
Where can we find roasted corn at this hour in the U.S.?

175
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,900
I really want to eat Taiwanese street food.

176
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,410
♫ Every sentence spoken is not spoken lightly ♫

177
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,580
Let me think of something.

178
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,790
♫  Can always see clearly  ♫

179
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,350
♫  At the critical moment  ♫

180
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,260
♫ Your hesitancy ♫

181
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,370
♫ Coupled with my drifting about ♫

182
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:03,040
♫ In death, there comes a clarity ♫

183
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,010
♫ I understood that you're acting smart behind my back ♫

184
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,390
How is it?

185
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,780
- Try it.
- Okay.

186
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,280
Do you think it tastes like it?

187
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,660
Doesn't matter if it tastes like it. From now on, in my heart, roasted corn will taste like this.

188
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,020
Okay. Let's continue to eat then.

189
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:08,080
♫ It only feels crowded because there are too many people ♫

190
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:15,150
♫ You don't have to confirm ♫

191
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,630
What are you thinking about?

192
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,210
This person has nothing to do with you anymore.

193
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,740
- Thank you.
- No problem.

194
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,840
Hey, You Fu.

195
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,430
Was the blind date from last time successful?

196
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,980
What? Unsuccessful again? Haven't you gone on several dates already?

197
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,290
Didn't you give them money? Is that marriage agency a scam?

198
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,710
The girl was great, but we're not suited for each other.

199
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,930
You Fu!

200
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,390
Hey, Papa Fu!

201
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,410
You Fu, that... what is it again?

202
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,830
That science place called.

203
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,920
They said a girl wants to go on a date with you!

204
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,010
You're in luck.

205
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,900
Papa Fu, let me tell you, at this rate,

206
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,550
you're going to hold your grandchild in no time.

207
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,140
Not bad, you.

208
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,980
Stop poking me.

209
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,190
Hello, Mr. Wu. It's great that you called back.

210
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,460
I have something I want to confirm with you as soon as possible.

211
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,180
Do you have time this week for a date?

212
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,910
Miss Liu, didn't we agree to not affect my farming?

213
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,710
So we're only arranging one date a month.

214
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,430
It's different this time. The female member actively asked for the date.

215
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,050
What? F-Female member?

216
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,770
Do you remember that female member you bumped into at the restaurant,

217
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,950
Miss Cho?

218
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:41,050
But being late by three hours is making your own time seem worthless.

219
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,950
At the same time, you are wasting other people's lives. Asking someone's net worth on the first meeting,

220
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,110
have you considered if you are actually worth it?

221
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,810
What?

222
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,150
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

223
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,420
Has she seen my personal information yet?

224
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,130
Of course. My colleague, who's in charge of that member, and I have both confirmed this.

225
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,720
Believe me, I will not let what happened last time happen again.

226
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,050
Okay then.

227
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,300
Please tell me the location and time of the date later.

228
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,260
Okay. I'll contact you later. Bye bye.

229
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,850
Thank you.

230
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,440
What are you guys doing?

231
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,160
Nothing.

232
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,840
We're worried about you.

233
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,090
How was the phone call with that lady?

234
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,650
I heard from Miss Liu that this member

235
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,130
is really pretty, has a good education,

236
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,930
- and has a good job. When are you two getting married?
- Wh-What?

237
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,530
Let me tell you, after getting married, move back here to Yunlin. After you two give birth,

238
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,200
- we'll help you take care of the child.
- Hey!

239
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,780
Why are you giving them so much pressure? He hasn't even met her yet.

240
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,440
When you guys meet, remember to bring our tomatoes.

241
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,780
This will be our first official meeting. Nothing is set yet.

242
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,710
Yes, but this is the first time a girl has actively asked to go on a date with you.

243
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,610
What do you mean by "nothing is set"? It's basically set in stone already!

244
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,050
That's right! A few days ago, on our roof,

245
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,230
magpies (good fortune omen) were here to make nests.

246
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,230
Sure enough, a happy event is here. This is an extremely joyous event!

247
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,130
Maybe she just made a mistake.

248
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,220
M-Made a mistake?

249
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,260
Th-Th-Then just take advantage of the mistake.

250
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,720
This is a marriage that is sent right to our doorstep. Don't let it get away that easily.

251
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,280
That's right. You must hold onto

252
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,010
a partner with such good conditions, understand?

253
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,430
Okay.

254
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,250
The arranged date was not bad.
- Okay.

255
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,160
So I will have them meet again.

256
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,610
Boss, you have a guest.
- Yes?

257
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,330
Guest? Who?

258
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,400
I've never seen her before. She's not a customer either. She said her last name is Chang.

259
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,080
Chang?

260
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,470
- Okay, let her in.
- Okay.

261
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,850
I'll go make some adjustments then.

262
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,010
Okay, we'll talk later.

263
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,260
Hello!

264
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,690
I was passing by so I decided to come for a visit.

265
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,310
Do you have time for some afternoon tea?

266
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,430
I happen to be in the area for an interview.

267
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,020
So I bought some sweets. I wanted to test my luck and see if you were here.

268
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,520
I hope you'll like it.

269
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,890
You're too courteous. I heard this shop's sweets are hard to buy.

270
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,050
Here, have some tea.

271
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,270
I know the boss so I got a little special treatment.

272
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,460
Afternoons are perfect for replenishing our sugar levels.

273
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,380
You said... you wanted to interview me.

274
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,460
What questions did you have?

275
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,660
This is our magazine, Garter.

276
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,520
The target audience is white-collar women between the ages of 25 and 45.

277
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,730
Besides beauty, makeup, and fashion items, we have a female column.

278
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,880
Women in this age group would be more interested in—

279
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,490
Work, love, and marriage.

280
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,450
Yes!

281
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,110
To be honest, we've interviewed many relationship experts,

282
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,570
but the content they give us are just:

283
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,600
women should love themselves.

284
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,310
Women should be financially independent,

285
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,480
or how to determine who is an a**hole. It's the kind of cliche content often discussed online.

286
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,190
But these theorists

287
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,860
do not help marriages at all. They are also not very popular among readers.

288
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,630
So I've compiled some questions

289
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,830
where I hope realists, like yourself, can provide some insight.

290
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,460
Okay, ask away.

291
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,160
- That's great. I'm going to record this.
- Okay.

292
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,600
Women, who enter the workforce after age 25,

293
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,640
have social circles that are virtually already set.

294
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,790
Are they only left with the option of an office romance?

295
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,210
First of all, if an office romance fails,

296
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,660
it would be too troublesome and affect work too much.

297
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,120
So I recommend wine-tasting gatherings and church events

298
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,030
as means for one to meet someone of the opposite sex who has similar interests.

299
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,190
How can introverts in singles mixers

300
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,240
have a higher success rate?

301
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,400
To be frank, I don't recommend singles mixers.

302
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,710
I suggest a warm-up period when two people of the opposite sex meet to get to know each other and date.

303
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,870
However, singles mixers get rid of that whole process.

304
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,880
At a singles mixer event, you'll get a bunch of strangers' contact information.

305
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,500
That's right.

306
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,880
Unless your physical attributes and social skills stick out a lot,

307
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,300
you'll be no different from a generic brand of saltine crackers in a market.

308
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,100
Saltine crackers?
- Yes.

309
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,640
How will you compete with chips, chocolates, or imported snacks?

310
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,950
Your comparison is very cute.

311
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,880
There's a lot of dating apps. They are—

312
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,700
They also lead to a lot of traps.

313
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,130
Let's leave out extreme examples such as money scams and one night stands.

314
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,840
There's a lot of people online who are very eloquent.

315
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,280
But when you interact with them in real life, they actually lack social skills.

316
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,500
- Just like those indifferent tech people.
- Exactly.

317
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,320
So, in comparison, there is no more control over the character of a partner

318
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,500
than introduced by your mom, aunt, or co-worker.

319
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,080
But... people nowadays lean toward having the freedom to choose their own partner.

320
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,610
They think that blind dates, to look for a marriage partner, are very outdated.

321
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,430
But if you are looking for a marriage partner,

322
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,550
blind dates are more dependable.

323
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,950
Okay... Your thinking is very unique.

324
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,950
I want to recommend that our chief editor

325
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,520
invite you to have a column in our magazine,

326
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,480
to share your thoughts and recommendations.

327
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,710
That's no problem.

328
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,120
I also hope to continue to share more cases and experience with everyone.

329
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,400
I hope to be able to help people.

330
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,800
Sorry to interrupt.

331
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,680
Boss, I need your help.

332
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,560
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

333
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,800
Really! This is the last bottle.

334
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,910
You already put two bottles of stuff on me.

335
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,040
We didn't do all these things for my previous dates.

336
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,240
Why do I need to change and have makeup this time?

337
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,380
Wow, Mr. Wu. I haven't seen you in a few days and you've become so handsome.

338
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,790
No, it's just that the clothes are nice.

339
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,370
I heard what you said just now.

340
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,320
Do not misunderstand. We are not trying to put makeup on you. We are just doing some skincare.

341
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,440
Whether it's skincare or makeup,

342
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,270
I'm a man.

343
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,530
I don't think men need these things.

344
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,650
This has nothing to do with your gender.

345
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,410
It's not only women who need to do skincare. Men should too.

346
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,330
Here. Let me help you add a bit more to the corners of your eyes.

347
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,020
It's one of the places that get hit by the sun the most.

348
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,540
Okay. But this is the last bottle, right?

349
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,460
It is the last bottle of skincare.

350
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,810
You still need to put on sunscreen.

351
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,260
Mr. Wu, don't think about it in such a complicated matter.

352
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,220
In actuality, your attention to clothing

353
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,750
is your show of respect for the other person.

354
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,940
It means this date is of great importance to you.

355
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,730
I believe Miss Cho will surely feel your sincerity.

356
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,380
Okay, okay. Bring it on. Come on.

357
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,640
This sunscreen has a moisturizing function.

358
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,910
Don't worry, it's all very natural.

359
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,180
Take a look. It's really natural, right?

360
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,260
- Let me fix your eyebrows.
- No, no!

361
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,300
It's just a small fix.

362
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,580
Really.

363
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,540
Even if I mess up, give it two weeks and it's good as new.

364
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,390
I don't need it. I'm good now.

365
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,790
Okay. Okay. No need, no need.

366
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,630
Baby steps. Let's not scare Mr. Wu.

367
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,700
You guys continue. I'll go back to work.

368
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,900
You... relax.

369
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,270
Let us put some lip balm on, all right? Just a little.

370
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,250
I know a lot of makeup brands

371
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,690
that offer free makeup and skincare lessons.

372
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,960
If your customers need it, would you be interested in working together?

373
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,180
I've looked at Miss Cho's personal information.

374
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,060
She's the vice president of a bank.

375
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,060
Her education is great, and her income is super high.

376
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,210
She's also very beautiful.

377
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,130
An exceptional woman like her should have really high standards.

378
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,780
Why would she want a date with me?

379
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,700
Mr. Wu, your conditions are not bad, either.

380
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,440
Besides, among all the dates Miss Cho has had, I think

381
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,130
you're the best.

382
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,560
You're a good man and very kind at heart.

383
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,740
So think of it as "good people have good fortune."

384
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,980
Today, you...

385
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,020
You are really pretty today.

386
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,340
You don't look so bad yourself.

387
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,450
Thank you.

388
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,430
Do y-y-you want to eat anything?

389
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,680
I'll take a look myself.

390
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,090
Why aren't they talking?

391
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,520
They even avoid eye contact. Will this work out?

392
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:45,150
I bet you that they can successfully get married.

393
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,030
Are you sure?

394
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,490
But... they seem very awkward with each other.

395
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,730
Here. Thank you.

396
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,710
Thank you for your business.

397
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,910
Do you want to go "hunting" with me tonight?

398
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,450
Yes!

399
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,860
No. Chin Lan is back.

400
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,950
Whipped (completely submissive to his girlfriend).

401
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,630
Don't forget the hairstylist test.

402
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,740
I know. Things like hairstylist tests are very Buddhist-like. (It is what it is.)

403
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,830
Nothing will change because of a night out.

404
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,560
"Do not insist" and "do not be stubborn" (Buddhist teachings). Do not mess up the cut and do not burn the hair.

405
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,950
If there are no expectations, then no harm from disappointments.

406
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:38,200
Once fate has arrived, I'll naturally be a hairstylist.

407
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,010
- Welcome.
- Hi, I'm looking for hairstylist number 8.

408
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,140
All right.

409
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,660
Tzu Ling! Customer.

410
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,190
- Hi, long time no see.
- Hi, long time no see.

411
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,870
- Are you here for a touch up?
- Yes.

412
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,550
Are you hiding from Ou Wen? You're scared of him.

413
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,610
I'm not scared of him. Which one of your eyes sees me being scared of him?

414
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,800
Both my eyes see that you are scared of him.

415
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,640
Bullsh*t, why would I be scared of him?

416
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,090
I-I don't know, which is why I asked.

417
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm not scared of him, and I don't need to be scared of him.

418
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,760
Just wait. Next time he comes, I'll show him who's boss.

419
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,530
Wait. Just you wait.

420
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,770
Wait for it.

421
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,430
If you were to choose

422
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,970
to help manage an asset account for either a customer with NT$500,000 or a customer with NT$500 million

423
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,660
and the processing fee is 1% for either one,

424
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,600
how would you choose?

425
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,530
- NT$500 million?
- That's right.

426
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,810
Most people would pick the customer with NT$500 million.

427
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:52,010
All my co-workers would fight for the big customers.

428
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,550
But I think that

429
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,220
those with smaller savings

430
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,030
are the ones who truly need the financial management to turn their lives around.

431
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,260
You are very correct.

432
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,050
I've done statistics before.

433
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,990
The working-class people who invest less than $3 million

434
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,770
make up about 76% of the population.

435
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,340
That's about NT$23 trillion.

436
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,220
I think that is truly worth a bit of risk.

437
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,240
Back then, I would set multiple alarms

438
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,150
to wake up in the middle of the night just to watch the American CNN, Europe's BBC,

439
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,040
as well as Japan and Korea's news.

440
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,080
I remember helping a couple that had a food stand in the night market

441
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,490
make money for their child's education fund.

442
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,420
Helping a lonely man make the money he needed to live in a retirement home.

443
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,950
I can never forget those clients'

444
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:48,860
sincere smiles and the warmth of their hands when I shook them.

445
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,100
Thank you.

446
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,120
Oh, no! I've been talking for so long.

447
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,540
I feel... I believe... I-I-I...

448
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,630
Do you feel like you're under a lot of pressure?

449
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,060
No need to say it.

450
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,820
You must be thinking that I've been bragging this whole time.

451
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,130
I didn't think you were bragging.

452
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,530
I think... you are really kind.

453
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,200
You're also very serious.

454
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,750
I really like listening to you talk.

455
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,200
But I think...

456
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,530
you shouldn't care too much about what other people say.

457
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,380
More importantly, don't feel sorry about your own achievements.

458
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,480
I feel that you are where you are today

459
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,820
because you put a lot of effort into it.

460
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,480
You've worked hard.

461
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,970
I heard the desserts here are not bad.

462
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,690
Let me see what we can order.

463
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,570
I agree with you. They will definitely succeed.

464
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,890
Right?

465
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,420
Yes...

466
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,200
I'm really happy today. We originally said that it would be a two-hour date,

467
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,470
but we ended up talking for an additional hour. That didn't delay your schedule, did it?

468
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,360
It didn't.

469
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,270
Then let's go somewhere next time.

470
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:20,330
Thank you for the invitation,

471
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,690
but you don't have to go on another date with me.

472
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:30,080
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫
♫ Fantasize... ♫

473
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,270
♫ Always be with you ♫

474
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,070
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

475
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,130
Then let's go somewhere next time.

476
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:52,120
Thank you for the invitation,

477
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,960
but you don't have to go on another date with me.

478
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,080
I know you asked for a date with me

479
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,060
because of Miss Mimi's words from last time.

480
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,050
What? I...

481
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,690
Wait a second! Mr. Wu.

482
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,100
Did I do something wrong?

483
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,900
- If you think I'm coming on too strong, then—
- Definitely not.

484
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,170
Miss Cho is definitely the best date I've had.

485
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:29,830
You are beautiful, exceptional, and independent.

486
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:34,090
It is me. I don't want to get in your way.

487
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:39,080
I only know how to farm. I don't know how to do anything else.

488
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,300
Besides, I still have my parents to take care of at home.

489
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:49,550
It is impossible for us to have a future together. I'm not good enough for you.

490
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:55,250
So... please don't waste any more time on me.

491
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:02,190
Please help Miss Cho find a good partner.

492
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,560
Miss Cho, please.

493
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,870
Stay safe.

494
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,270
Since Miss Cho actively asked you out and you two like each other,

495
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,430
why don't you give each other a chance?

496
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,540
Love Is Science's data-based matches are the most accurate.

497
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,100
What was the match score for Miss Cho and me?

498
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:09,070
Mr. Wu, if you think Miss Cho is not bad,

499
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,570
you two can give it a try.

500
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:17,940
Whether it is based on statistics or on reality,

501
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,100
I think we aren't suited for each other.

502
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,220
Every time You Fu goes to Taipei,

503
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,480
he always comes back that same night.

504
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,530
It is dinner time, and he is still not back. It must be a success!

505
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,820
Why are you back so early?

506
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,360
Early? It is quite late right now.

507
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,830
Why were you in such a rush to come back for dinner? Since you don't go to Taipei often,

508
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,490
you should have watched a movie or something.

509
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,210
I-I... That...

510
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,940
Miss Cho and I will not see each other again.

511
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,730
What?

512
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,870
It is okay. The next one will be even better. Am I right?

513
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,460
That's right. Miss Cho missed out.

514
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,070
Don't take it to heart. You must not give up on yourself.

515
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,780
I'm fine. Don't worry.

516
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,080
We are having pork spareribs, your favorite.

517
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,220
I already ate on the bus. I'm going to shower.

518
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,790
Okay.

519
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,670
Driven by the sharp rise in Amazon's stock price,

520
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,570
Wall Street's Nasdaq index

521
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:23,620
has surpassed 9000 points for the first time on the 26. It is the tenth consecutive red day.

522
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,960
I'm not good enough for you.

523
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,760
So... please don't waste any more time on me.

524
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,180
It is impossible for us to have a future together.

525
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,330
He clearly is not wrong.

526
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,440
Why am I still sad about it then?

527
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,010
Forget it.

528
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,350
Successful transaction

529
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,750
Voodoo

530
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,280
I originally came to get my hair washed anyway.

531
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,720
I'm a customer. There's no shame, and I have nothing to hide.

532
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,230
If I stopped coming to get my hair washed, then wouldn't I seem more guilty of something?

533
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,970
Hi!

534
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,990
Why are you alone? Where's Mark?

535
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,030
He went home already.

536
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,190
You... are you here to wash your hair?

537
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,610
I feel so blessed.

538
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,260
Are you all prepared for the hairstylist test?

539
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,280
I don't know.

540
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,290
I always think I'm prepared,

541
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,340
but I fail every time.

542
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,390
Every time? How many times did you take the test?

543
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,910
- Three times.
- Three times?

544
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,500
Little Piggy, what's wrong with your salon? You're so great, yet you failed. What?

545
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,960
How high are the salon's standards?

546
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,390
I learned all the skills I need in college,

547
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:53,660
but I don't know what to do after that.

548
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,290
I feel like I've been stuck in the same place for the past few years.

549
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:03,810
Our boss says I have everything except a personal style.

550
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,730
It is like the difference between a craftsman and an artist.

551
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,590
A craftsman has all the skills he needs,

552
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:16,280
but he can only become an artist if he has his own personal style.

553
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,530
Then... do my hair in a bit.

554
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,210
Do your hair?

555
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,350
Let me understand

556
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,590
what is a hairstyle without a personal style.

557
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,650
What do you think? Isn't it very mediocre?

558
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:44,320
These hairstyles... all look basically alike.

559
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:55,790
Come, have a seat.

560
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,300
But as someone who often gets her hair washed,

561
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,700
you are terrific.

562
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,320
When you were doing my hair, I can tell that

563
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,980
you'll straighten out each section of hair several times.

564
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,040
So my hair is not frizzy at all.

565
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,720
When you blow-dry hair, you pay special attention to the temperature.

566
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,580
You consistently use cool air when needed to soothe the scalp.

567
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:32,500
When you comb hair, you are extra gentle so you don't pull on my hair.

568
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,810
When you wash my hair,

569
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:39,560
you not only massage my temple area but also in between my brows.

570
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,520
You do it until my mouth relaxes and smiles

571
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,760
so I especially like having you wash my hair.

572
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,600
Your boss is wrong.

573
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,320
Being gentle and attentive are your specialties.

574
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,690
Although they are not something you can see easily,

575
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,180
they are your specialties.

576
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,440
Other hairstylists do not have such gentleness and attentiveness.

577
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:07,980
Your clients keep coming back to you because they feel that they are taken care of by you,

578
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,340
and they will bring a very warm feeling home with them.

579
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,990
Myself included.

580
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,400
Hello?

581
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,960
I'm off work now. Do you want to go eat together?

582
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,790
I need to go home, too.

583
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:45,250
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫
♫ Fantasize... ♫

584
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,330
♫ Always be with you ♫

585
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,350

586
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,620
Hello?

587
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,920
I'm off work now. Do you want to go eat together?

588
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,570
I need to go home, too.

589
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,730
Is that Mark? Does he want to join us?

590
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,270
No, it is Yan Fei. She just came in for a hair wash.

591
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:26,170
That's great! Ask her whether she wants to join us.

592
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:29,760
I really can't. I still have work to do at home.

593
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,190
She can't. I will wait for you here at the salon then.

594
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:37,780
Thank Chin Lan for me. She introduced me to a makeup brand to work with.

595
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,200
I'm going now. Bye bye. Bye bye.

596
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,490
Make Up For Ever

597
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:48,500
Those plans...

598
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,210
- Are you members of Love Is Science? This way.
- Okay.

599
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,850
Okay. You can look forward to it.

600
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,790
Here, here.

601
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,230
This is John, the representative of Get Your Beauty.

602
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,560
This is the international matchmaker, Yan Fei.

603
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,910
Nice to meet you. I'm Yan Fei. Thank you for providing such great lessons to our members.

604
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:11,270
Allowing consumers to directly try out our products is very beneficial to our brand.

605
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,770
- If you have any questions, just ask John. He will do his best to help.
- Okay.

606
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,040
Thank you.

607
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,830
Please come in.

608
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,870
- Miss Cho.
- Miss Cho.

609
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,070
I will take you to your seat.

610
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,260
- Okay.
- Come with me.

611
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,140
Here, have a seat.

612
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:45,500
We have another date arranged this weekend for you. He's an executive at a securities firm.

613
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,920
- He graduated from the same university as you.
- Okay.

614
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,650
These are products that you will be using for today's class. You can familiarize yourself with them for now.

615
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:56,300
If you don't understand, that's fine. In a bit, the lecturer will talk about them.

616
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,050
Please have a seat.

617
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,380
Hi. What a coincidence.

618
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:27,460
dPi X The Celebrity Experience Club
The Science of Complementary Colors

619
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,500
Did you do it on purpose?

620
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:35,790
Since it is rare for us to be in agreement, I don't want to give up this time.

621
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,880
Okay. We will see if the statistics are right,

622
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,350
or if we have better judgment this time.

623
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:45,420
First, you need to know

624
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,030
that when it comes to skincare, water is first then oils.

625
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,210
One must go from small molecules to big molecules.

626
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,790
Let's first pick up our toner.

627
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,300
In front of you, there should be cotton pads. Take one

628
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,560
and wet it.

629
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,590
After that, squeeze it a bit.

630
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,210
Then swipe it across the left and right sides

631
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,910
of your face. Just swipe it across your face gently.

632
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,550
- If you have a question, you can raise your hand and ask.
- Thank you.

633
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,540
That's not how you do it. Give it to me.

634
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,900
Close your eyes.

635
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:58,020
Are you in a bad mood? Are you angry?

636
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,270
Are you angry at me?

637
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:05,730
Yes.

638
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,320
What did I do to make you angry?

639
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,230
Close your eyes.

640
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:19,420
Did I do something wrong?

641
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,310
You said you were very happy to see me.

642
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:40,670
You said I was the best date you had.

643
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,620
- That I am beautiful, exceptional, and independent.
- Yes.

644
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,340
You said...

645
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:55,740
that because of the distance between Taipei and Yunlin

646
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:59,400
- it is impossible for us to work out.
- Yes.

647
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,090
Even though I'm in Taiwan, I can still buy stocks in the U.S.

648
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,320
So then why can't I go to Yunlin?

649
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,170
Did you just make up an excuse because you don't want another date with me?

650
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,940
- It really is not like—
- Oh! Oh, no! S-S-sorry.

651
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:23,840
♫ Always be with you ♫

652
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:35,370
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile...  ♫

653
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:39,270
Did you just make up an excuse because you don't want another date with me?

654
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:43,890
- It really is not like—
- Oh! Oh, no! No! S-S-sorry.

655
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,550
I'm so sorry. S-So...

656
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:52,060
- S-So..
- It is okay.

657
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,320
This... this should grow back in t-two weeks.

658
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,250
I usually wear a bamboo hat so no one will notice.

659
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,330
I'm s-sorry. I...

660
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,150
It's okay. And...

661
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:14,490
In regards to arranging a date, it really isn't like what you said.

662
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,080
That afternoon... I-I was truly very happy.

663
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:25,010
I haven't been that happy in many years.

664
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:28,880
When you asked me whether I had other things to do,

665
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,860
I actually didn't want to leave.

666
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,990
R-Really?

667
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:43,300
Well, you didn't talk. Isn't that because you didn't want to talk to me?

668
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,480
N-No!

669
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,500
It's because your voice is beautiful.

670
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:58,280
I was thinking... I'm truly a blessed person

671
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,210
to be able to be your arranged date.

672
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,680
But you have such great conditions.

673
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,490
I feel like it would be such a pity for you to be with me.

674
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:13,870
When you asked me on another date,

675
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,670
I really wanted to say yes.

676
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,260
Then let's do it!

677
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,560
W-We're just dating. I didn't say I want to get married to you.

678
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,590
Why are you thinking so much?

679
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:32,570
H-How about we continue to go on arranged dates with others?

680
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:35,110
Would that be okay?

681
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:40,640
If you don't think it's a waste of time.

682
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,910
Boss,

683
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:56,900
I know they have a very low match score, and that I'm a little carried away with emotion,

684
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:02,590
but can't you tell that they are very happy together?

685
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,740
M-My eyebrow is gone.

686
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:15,010
For a relationship, is the journey more important

687
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:17,530
or is the ending more important?

688
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,020
If the ending is more important,

689
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:25,130
Cho Nai Hui shouldn't date Wu You Fu at all.

690
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,680
If the journey is more important,

691
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,970
then why am I considered a failure

692
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,580
after getting a divorce?

693
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,900
Ready. Your time has started.

694
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,740
Everyone, our event today was very successful.

695
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,500
Cheers to everyone. You've all worked hard.

696
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:26,510
Cheers! We all worked hard!

697
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:32,630
Did you see Miss Cho and Mr. Wu's expressions when they were leaving?

698
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:38,300
Right now, I'm like an old mother who has married off her daughter

699
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,100
and has witnessed her son bring home a wife.

700
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,010
I'm so happy!

701
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,950
Come on, come on! Everyone, cheers to Mr.Wu!

702
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,400
Let's celebrate Mr. Wu finally finding a good match!

703
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,820
Cheers! Cheers! Come on, come on! Cheers!

704
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,670
I don't have any more in my glass. Give it to me.

705
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,510
Keep a close eye on Sheng Ying. Did you forget how scary she was the last time she got drunk?

706
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,800
I think this is so worth celebrating!

707
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,010
- Sheng Ying.
- What?

708
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,080
Don't drink so much.

709
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,890
What do you mean drink less? Today is a day worth celebrating so why would we drink less?

710
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:21,370
Don't cheer with her. Don't do it.

711
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,350
Happy collaboration!

712
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,810
It's all thanks to you, the middle-woman.

713
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:29,880
It's nothing. I want to thank you for agreeing to write a column for our magazine.

714
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,170
You really are a relationship expert.

715
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:34,920
You're exaggerating.

716
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,570
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

717
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:42,470
Eat up, eat up.

718
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,990
Okay.

719
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,560
By the way,

720
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,830
I heard from Hsuan Yu that you are his non-destined sister-in-law.

721
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,210
What about you? How did you meet Hsuan Yu?

722
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:59,980
- We met during a magazine shoot.
- Oh?

723
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:04,100
When I first met him, I thought that he was unique.

724
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,540
He doesn't use IG (Instagram) or FB (Facebook).

725
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:10,240
He also brings his eco-friendly water bottle and handkerchief.

726
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,800
I was thinking that he's just like my dad.

727
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,400
I've always wanted to marry a man who is gentle like my dad.

728
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,710
So when I first met Hsuan Yu,

729
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,660
I felt that he's the one.

730
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:29,020
So I crazily pursued him.

731
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:34,430
You have good taste. Hsuan Yu is a really, really good person.

732
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:38,940
Even though he's not like those handsome guys who sparkle,

733
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:43,780
he's very thoughtful, and he is the type to take care of you secretly.

734
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:48,070
I spent a tremendous amount of effort to get with him.

735
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:54,540
I'm jealous of you for clearly knowing what you want

736
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,680
and for courageously going after your dreams.

737
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:03,640
There are some things that you can't go back to after you've missed them.

738
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,890
Voodoo

739
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:31,360
Score 76%, unqualified.

744

What's going on?

745
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:14,760
Why are you two together? Why did you drink so much?

746
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,670
We're celebrating our

747
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,480
collaboration's success!

748
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:24,030
So we wanted to share the joy with you!

749
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,280
I've delivered her to you.

750
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,210
I'm going to leave now. Bye bye.

751
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:33,160
No!

752
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,940
- You can't, you can't!
- Hey, hey, be careful.

753
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,030
- None of you can leave!
- Okay, okay.

754
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,890
Let's go for a second round of drinking!

755
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,880
Here, be careful.

756
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,650
Thank you.

757
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:47,230
Weren't we supposed to go for another round of drinking?

758
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:49,820
Let us go fly!

759
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:53,590
Where do you want to fly to?

760
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:57,600
- You're drunk. You'll be an inconvenience outside.
- F-F-Fly!

761
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,180
Going home is fine too...

762
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:05,200
It's more comfortable to lie down on a bed.

763
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,120
- Comfortable! Comfortable!
- Hey, hey.

764
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,590
Lower your voice!

765
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,320
Jia Jia is asleep. Don't wake her up.

766
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,920
Okay, okay. Be quiet and go to sleep.

767
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,390
Hey.

768
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:21,790
The hairstylist test was today, right?

769
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,150
Did you pass?

770
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:39,070
Why are you two talking so quietly?

771
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:43,670
Are you hiding secrets from me?

772
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:46,700
What secrets could I possibly be hiding from you? Hurry and go to sleep.

773
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:52,730
You really do have

774
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:55,450
a huge secret you won't tell me.

775
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:58,380
Why don't you tell me?

776
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,020
What?

777
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:06,430
You might know.

778
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:08,390
Know what?

779
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:11,730
Hsuan Yu had

780
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,500
a childhood sweetheart.

781
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,060
A childhood sweetheart?

782
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:21,070
Wow, Wang Hsuan Yu, are you keeping secrets from me, too?

783
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,840
Chin Lan is drunk. Don't listen to her.

784
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,870
- Hurry and go to sleep. Go to sleep.
- I'm not.

785
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:28,580
I'm not speaking nonsense. Before, I saw

786
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:32,360
a little box. Inside there is a love letter.

787
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,730
- A love letter?
- Yes.

788
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:38,640
But for some reason, he didn't give it to her.

789
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,370
Really?

790
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,460
It's all in the past, all the past.

791
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:47,090
He won't tell me anything. Do you know who it is?

792
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:51,510
Who is it? Let me think about it for you.

793
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,350
It's nothing. Go to sleep! Hurry! Go to sleep!

794
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:58,200
- I don't want to!
- Is it... the convenience store's daughter?

795
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,760
The girl who sat next to you in your tutoring class!

796
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,120
Who is she? Who is she? Who is she?

797
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,180
Look, he's speechless.

798
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,660
Let me help you. Find his yearbook.

799
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,630
- Yearbook!
- Let me look for it! Where could it be?

800
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:18,110
Bring it out.
- I don't have it.

801
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:21,320
Let me help you find it.
- Don't look. I don't have it.

802
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,190
Hey! Hey!

803
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:26,430
Stop messing around. She's already married!

804
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:34,370
You even know that she's married.
Change. We change.

805
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:38,420
Look. It seems that he follows (keep tabs on) her.

806
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:41,810
Let me tell you. Stand up straight!

807
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:45,370
Focus. Focus.

808
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,620
What were the keywords of the love letter?

809
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:52,220
Keywords. Think. Keywords.

810
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,850
"Liked for many years."

811
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,500
"Liked for many years"?
- Yes.

812
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,110
"Liked for many years"?

813
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,970
Then... she must be from the same class.

814
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:05,260
Or she lived near him. Did she live near him?

815
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,870
I think...
- Did she live near him?

816
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:10,730
The first meeting... Ice cream!

817
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:13,510
Ice cream?

818
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:16,380
On the ice cream was written,

819
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,440
"My heart."

820
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,590
"My heart"?

821
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:23,970
- Let her talk.
- That's right!

822
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:27,010
That girl gave him a really bad nickname.

823
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,880
What bad nickname? I want to know.

824
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,650
I want to know.

825
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:33,010
You're overreacting!

826
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,950
Little Piggy!

827
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:44,420
Oh, yes, it's Little Piggy.

828
01:05:54,990 --> 01:06:02,720
Piggy's love diary

829
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,830
Hurry. Hurry.

830
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,270
Fighting, you can do it.

831
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:27,390
- Thank you.
- This is a gift for you.

832
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:29,330
- Thank you.
- It's very cute.

833
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:32,130
- Thank you.
- It's super cute.

834
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:35,570
It's so cute, thank you.

835
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,330
Little Piggy!

836
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:39,820
Excuse me. Excuse me.

837
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,160
You came.

838
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,320
I have something for you.

839
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,650
I'll come back later.

840
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,000
Let's go.

841
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,210
Please sit.

842
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,680
♫ Can't you see? ♫

843
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,830
Happy graduation.

844
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,210
Hurry and open it.

845
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,530
Wow. This...

846
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,620
Let me help you.

847
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,230
Congratulations on your graduation, Little Piggy.

848
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,100
In the fall,

849
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,520
you'll be a high school student.

850
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:32,340
What do you think? Cool, right?

851
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,440
It's really cool.

852
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:39,700
♫ I hope my insanity hasn't scared you (scared you) ♫

853

[For You]
♫ Please forgive a fool who has lost control because of his love ♫

854
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:52,490
Actually, I have something to tell you.

855
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:57,040
No one else knows. You're the first to know.

856
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,050
I'm getting married.

857
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:14,590
Originally, I wanted to ask you to be my flower boy... or groomsman.

858
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,580
But we're having our wedding in the U.S.A.

859
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:24,060
How long are you going there for?

860
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:28,440
My fiancé is being transferred to his company headquarters in U.S.A. so I don't think I'll return after that.

861
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:31,310
What's wrong?

862
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:36,040
You seem sad. Aren't you happy for me?

863
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,920
I'm happy.

864
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,350
Of course, I'm happy.

865
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,660
I-It's just so unexpected.

866
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:47,740
Let me tell you. We're planning to go to Disneyland for our honeymoon.

867
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:50,420
And we're going to go to New York to see the Statue of Liberty

868
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,500
and Broadway! Little Piggy...

869
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,620
What's crueler than being friend-zoned

870
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:59,030
is getting a marriage invitation from the girl you like before you even confess to her.

871
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,260
My first love

872
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:05,920
ended quietly just like that. It ended before anything even began.

873
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:15,200
So many precious memories in our youth we can't just throw away,

874
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:19,420
just like treasured collectable trading cards,

875
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,710
and the love letter that didn't get delivered.

876
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:02,590
I decided to hide this secret and other parts of my youth that I can't seem to throw away

877
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:06,390
for forever and ever.

878
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:10,320
Until that day...

879
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,230
For you?

880
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:33,640
"I've kept this in my heart for a very long time now."

881
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,560
"Ever since our first meeting,"

882
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,360
"when you knocked my ice cream over,"

883
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,420
"I felt that my heart..." Oh my.

884
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,020
What age (generation) is it now? Are you still writing like this?

885
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,760
- Give it back.
- "I've actually liked you for a long time now and want to ask you to be my girlfriend."

886
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,260
"Love you, Little Piggy."

887
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,540
You're the pig.

888
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:59,750
I feel that you wrote it very sincerely.

889
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:04,190
Did Little Piggy succeed in his confession?

890
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,720
No.

891
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:08,660
Did your confession fail?

892
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:14,950
It's more like I failed even before confessing.

893
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:17,710
Why are you so pitiable?

894
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:20,160
Your heart was broken at such a young age.

895
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,330
Are you still sad over it?

896
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:25,220
It happened when I was young. Why would I still be sad over it?

897
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:28,620
It's fine. She has bad judgment.

898
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:32,070
Because of that, you were able to meet me and be so happy together.

899
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:33,700
Am I right?
- Yes.

900
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,530
Preview: Enough! Enough! Stop fighting!

901
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,400
Besides admiration, is there something you are forgetting to say to me?

902
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,220
Hurry and take a look at Yung Tai's FB.

903
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,790
He's coming back to Taiwan.

904
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:55,450
So do you really not know who the person in the love letter is?

905
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:58,730
Didn't you recognize him from the pictures on our wall when you came over because you two took the wrong suitcase?

906
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,460
You're my Little Piggy.

907
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:06,630
Why didn't you just tell me directly?

908
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,460
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

909
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:14,260
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
