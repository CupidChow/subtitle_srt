00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,530
♫ It's so easy to get lost ♫

Love Is Science?

24
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,740
If you want to be invincible, you need friends.

25
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,620
Just like how Van Gogh couldn't be without Gauguin.

26
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,930
And how Iron Man needs the Avengers.

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,100
As for me... let me introduce you to my best friend.

28
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,330
High heels are different from any other shoes.

29
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,320
It forces me to walk with my head up and chest out.

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,450
It makes me stand perfectly straight.

31
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,430
It lets me stand taller and see farther.

32
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,120
It leads me down a wide, flat road made of pride.

33
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,310
As long as I wear high heels,

34
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,120
I feel like there's nothing I can't do.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,540
Nothing is impossible.

36
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,380
Hello? I've left my house. Where are you guys?

37
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,700
Sheng Ying went to buy your coffee. Once she gets back, we will leave.

38
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,180
Have you finished revising the proposal?

39
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,790
Hello, Boss!

40
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,570
Do you know when you sent me your revision notes?

41
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,050
At 3 a.m., three o'clock in the morning.

42
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,030
It was 2:30 a.m. Are you done revising it?

43
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,280
Yes. When have I not?

44
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,230
There seems to be a situation at the intersection ahead. That's all for now. I'll see you later.

45
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,040
B*tch, do you not know how to drive?

46
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,550
How did you even get your license?

47
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,580
How long are you going to take to reverse in?

48
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,170
Do you know how to park?

49
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,290
Hurry up!

50
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,130
I'm in a—

51
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,660
Get out. Get out of the car.

52
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,220
Thank you. Thank you. I don't know how much longer I would have been stuck here if not for you.

53
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,420
Use the time for crying to practice driving. You can't expect someone to jump and help you every time.

54
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,000
Fighting.

55
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,130
Get out. Get out.

56
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,610
- Get out!
- Now, now!

57
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,650
Get off, now!

58
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,310
I'm begging you. Come save me.

59
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,190
Sheng Ying, what is it?

60
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,030
Boss, we're already here. We will wait for you in the lobby.
[Nangang Station]

61
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,960
I will park my car first.

62
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,150
Southbound platform

63
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,400
Baby, don't be afraid. We will get there in a blink of an eye with the high-speed rail.

64
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
We will leave in a bit. All right?

65
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,040
Wang Hsuan Yu, can you not act like this in public?

66
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,610
Do you think that this behavior is normal?

67
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,590
Wanda is different. She has been there for me through many difficult situations.

68
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,550
That's right, Baby Hsuan Yu. When you are asleep, Wanda will cover you with a blanket.

69
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,180
When you're old and have a stroke, she will help you push the wheelchair you're in.

70
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,940
You are really heartless.

71
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,900
Normal people won't have feelings toward a mannequin head, all right?

72
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,980
Who said so? Wanda is the first "head" of my life.

73
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,190
No matter how many I have in the future, she's irreplaceable in my heart.

74
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,750
Originally, I thought you had an artist's personality so you're naturally romantic.

75
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,500
- I am.
- No, you aren't.

76
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,270
Your situation is actually very simple.

77
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,560
How simple?

78
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,340
Simply mental.

79
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,070
How are you any different than those hoarders?

80
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,990
- We're leaving.
- Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

81
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,150
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go.

82
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,300
Boss, be careful. It is hot.

83
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,010
Thank you.

84
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,410
Boss, please take a look.

85
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,640
There are no problems with the proposal. You've worked hard.

86
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,140
It wasn't hard, but can you not wake me up at 3 a.m.?

87
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,880
Are you too tired? Do you want a vacation?

88
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,120
- Can I?
- Of course.

89
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,960
Since you have no desire to work, you can go on an indefinite vacation without pay. Take as much time off as you want.

90
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,600
How is that?

91
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,890
Isn't it just 3 a.m.? When have I ever not picked up?

92
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,800
Boss, wait a second.

93
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,440
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

94
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,290
Come on.

95
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,630
How long are you going to stay in Kaohsiung this time?

96
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,680
I only have a seminar scheduled. I will be back after one night.

97
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,510
I will pick you up then.

98
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,960
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

99
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,240
"I will pick you up then."

100
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,300
This "thigh hugging" (riding coattails or sucking up) is really outstanding.

101
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,500
You're clearly the one who's "thigh hugging."

102
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,980
Don't think I don't know.

103
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,310
You, Liu Sheng Ying, are the 87th generational descendant of Liu Xia Hui (aka Zhan Huo, known for his eminent virtue).

104
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,900
Do you think I can't tell?

105
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,580
You just want to hug Yan Fei's thigh, physically hug.

106
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,820
- I-I...
- I'm right, aren't I?

107
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,530
Wh-What are you looking at?

108
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,780
It's closed now.

109
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,230
Thank you.

110
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,750
Let me interrupt. He likes men.

111
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,750
Fair warning, she likes women.

112
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,490
You even dare to flirt with the boss.

113
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,830
Have you ever considered the consequences?

114
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,240
Can you imagine what our boss is like when dating?

115
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,940
She will probably ask the person to list his conditions.

116
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,310
- Then she'll use the computer to analyze it.
- Then she will use big data to create the pairing.

117
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,450
They must also sign an agreement first.

118
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,480
Then there will be a thorough investigation into the past eighteen generations.

119
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,880
That's right. List your conditions.

120
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,310
What you want and what you don't want.
Marriage requires formulas to succeed.

121
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,940
Clearly listing your goals is the most effective way.
What you need most are scientific pairing rules.

122
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,570
Have you all ever wondered why the marriage rate is getting lower and lower,

123
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,330
while the divorce rate is getting higher and higher?

124
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,790
It's because love and marriage cannot be equated to each other.

125
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:26,780
Love is overly vain, but marriage requires hard work to maintain.

126
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,330
- Does everyone want to get married?
- Yes.

127
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,940
Those who want to get married must be clear about one point.

128
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,460
The partner you seek now is not someone who makes your heart flutter,

129
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,620
but your most suitable life partner.

130
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,770
Wouldn't that be too elitist?

131
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,320
Not at all. Marriage is like starting a business, and you need to manage it continuously.

132
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,940
When you start a business, wouldn't you consider your partner's

133
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,470
background and qualifications?

134
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,100
That seems to make sense.

135
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,940
However, marriage then seems to become a transaction.

136
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,180
Would we really be happy that way?

137
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,420
Of course. I am the best example.
Presenter: Yan Fei.

138
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,180
If everyone wants a happily ever after like me,

139
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,990
then you should clearly list your conditions,

140
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,310
what the other person has and what you are missing.

141
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,260
What everyone wants may not be what you need.

142
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,430
Want and need, what does all that mean?

143
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,740
Leave that question to us, Love Is Science.

144
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,260
Because we can perfectly separate your wants and needs,

145
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:27,080
we are the first in the industry to have as high of a success rate as 80% in matchmaking.

146
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,130
Oh, 80%.

147
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,870
Please speak.

148
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,770
Well, I want a Korean Oppa. Gong Yoo, Hyun Bin, or Park Seo Joon is fine.

149
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,190
Can you help me match with one?

150
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,640
Korean Oppa, is that correct?

151
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,070
Okay. No problem. Everyone, let's think about it together.

152
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,120
Close your eyes, and let's imagine it together.

153
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,240
Hyun Bin is on Jeju Island's beach.

154
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,770
His eight-pack is showing and he is smiling with dimples.

155
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,370
If we were to put you into this scene now,

156
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,190
where do you think is the most appropriate place for you to appear?

157
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,800
It's okay. It's not completely impossible.

158
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,670
In reality, there are two choices. First, you can change the scene.

159
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,280
Second, think of a way to become the person suited for this scene.

160
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,490
That is what makes Love Is Science

161
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,920
different from other marriage agencies.

162
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,020
Besides being a middleman, Love Is Science

163
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,720
also includes image consultants, fitness consultants,

164
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,480
nutrition consultants, and even medical aesthetic consultants in the beginning stages.

165
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,030
After being matched, we also have dating consultants,

166
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,000
financial consultants and marriage consultants.

167
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,660
We're a one-stop service for when you meet your partner to when you walk into your wedding hall.

168
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,560
Stop wasting your precious time.

169
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,640
Let Love Is Science use its database to find the most suited life partner for you.

170
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,910
Let's create the happiness that belongs solely to you.

171
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,770
Thank you, everyone.

172
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,800
Tell your friends about us!

173
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,870
- Thank you, thank you!
- We are going to leave first.

174
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,620
Thank you, thank you! Hey, Pretty Lady!

175
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,080
Destined One Marriage Agency, come take a look.

176
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,360
It's free for all female members. Take this, take this.

177
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,450
We're not like Love Is Science which requires a membership fee of NT$88,000.

178
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,530
It's free! Remember to call us!

179
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,270
Remember to call us! Thanks!

180
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,730
Give me one too.

181
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,800
Oh! Is this Boss Yan?

182
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,330
Do you have the need?
Destined One Marriage Club: Tan Chun Chiao

183
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,130
Didn't you say that your marriage is happy and perfect?

184
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,680
That's right. I indeed don't need it,

185
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,000
but I think some of our clients would need it. After all, you know that our company

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,970
is a bit picky.

187
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,820
Boss Yan, that's where Love Is Science is wrong.

188
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,860
- Everyone has the right to pursue happiness.
- Yes, that's right.

189
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,420
Happiness is free, but the path to happiness is very expensive.

190
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,890
How else would you have so many rings on your hands, Sister?

191
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,390
Those with upfront prices aren't scary. But scary

192
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:28,130
are things that are said to be free. After all, free things are the most expensive.

193
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,890
Isn't that right?

194
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,600
See you next time.

195
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,560
You're so pretty, and your hair is beautiful. How will other people live (comparing themselves to you)?

196
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,780
Do you have IG (Instagram)? Follow me.

197
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,390
I don't have IG.

198
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,650
What about Facebook (FB)?

199
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,010
Okay, okay. I'll follow your fan page.

200
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,740
Hsuan Yu really doesn't have IG or FB.

201
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,160
He even only installed LINE just for work.

202
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,800
Otherwise, he would still be using a dumb phone now.

203
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,390
Besides making calls, I usually don't use it.

204
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,400
The wind is too strong. It'll mess up their hairstyle.

205
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,860
What should we do then?

206
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,210
I'll discuss it with the director.

207
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,200
Director, excuse me. We created the look indoors,

208
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,180
but since the wind is too strong, I think we need to make some adjustments.

209
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,960
Otherwise, the results will be different from expectations.

210
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,710
The hairstyle was decided after we all discussed it.

211
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,060
If you make changes now, then wouldn't we have decided it for no reason?

212
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,110
It's because—

213
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,910
Those two...

214
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:26,120
Okay. I'll just spray more hairspray.

215
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,920
Don't spray too much so we can still make changes.

216
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,350
Can't you see how strong the wind is?

217
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,540
Action!

218
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,500
Cut!

219
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,790
This hairstyle won't work! What the heck are you doing?

220
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,710
Go, go! Go change the hairstyle.

221
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,960
We've already sprayed half a can of hairspray. The hair is already in a clump.

222
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,060
Comb it out, comb it out.

223
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,620
D*mn! How long is it going to take to comb out?

224
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,080
Hair Crew, I'm only giving you ten minutes!

225
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,770
Okay.

226
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,890
Fighting.

227
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,750
Thank you. Thanks.

228
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,420
Wanda, let me tell you.

229
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,070
Halfway through the shoot, the winds got super strong—

230
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,740
Let's see how I'm going to deal with you little demon (alluring woman).

231
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,630
Come! Come here!

232
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,980
Hey, I'm ticklish!

233
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,090
- No!
- Come, come, come!

234
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,050
Don't do that! No. No!

235
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,500
Be quiet. I can hear you from next door.

236
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,860
Quiet... We disturbed the neighbor.

237
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,870
Oh! Oh!

238
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,100
I'll teach you a lesson if you keep running.

239
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,110
Hey! Who teaches a lesson on the first day?

240
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,560
There's a lesson tonight. Come on! Come on!

241
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,710
Kaohsiung Main Public Library

242
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:46,640
Shuiyuan Lamb and Seafood: Welcome

243
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Lamb hot pot is right in front of me,

244
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,000
yet how am I supposed to eat it by myself?

245
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,690
He is alone as well. Should I just ask him?

246
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,130
- Hey...
- Okay!

247
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,860
What?

248
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,220
You're asking if I want to share a lamb hot pot, right?

249
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,260
That's right.

250
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,480
Okay.

251
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,390
Boss, table for two!

252
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,630
Thank you.

253
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,830
Thank you, thank you.

254
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,060
Excuse me, please give me another pair of chopsticks and a spoon.

255
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,740
Thank you.

256
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,430
Do you have a friend who's coming?

257
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:18,390
Serving utensils, I'm worried you don't like commensality (sharing).

258
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,230
Sorry for the inconvenience.

259
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,860
Thanks.

260
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,980
- When did you become so polite?
- What?

261
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,850
What I meant was... that you seem distant.

262
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,390
You want to say that I have a long face, right?

263
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,420
No, no, no. I...

264
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,020
Why are you so nervous?

265
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,600
Ever since I was young, everyone said I have a long face.

266
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,930
Don't worry. I just look mean, but I'm a nice person.

267
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,760
Who says that about one's self?

268
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,700
It's boiling. Here, let me help you.

269
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,420
I-I can do it myself. I can do it myself.

270
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,460
It's fine, it's fine.

271
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,410
Thank you.

272
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,240
- Here.
- Thank you. Thank you.

273
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,160
- You should eat too.
- Okay.

274
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,360
Sorry.

275
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,140
Let me help you.

276
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,520
- No need! No need!
- It's fine.

277
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,980
Can you really use just one hairpin to put up all my hair?

278
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,940
I am a hairstylist.

279
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,390
Also, not everyone knows this trick.

280
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,060
I believe you... because I don't know how to do it.

281
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,110
Eat.

282
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,150
Thank you.

283
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,680
I'm so full.

284
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,840
Are you full from just that? I was going to ask you to go for another round.

285
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,160
I can't anymore. I'm already filled up to here.

286
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,290
Thank you for eating dinner with me today.

287
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,070
I've always wanted to eat here at this famous lamb hot pot place.

288
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,660
I've finally fulfilled my wish and am very satisfied today.

289
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,190
Then can you fulfill a wish of mine?

290
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,990
What wish?

291
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,170
Take a commemorative photo with me. Smile.

292
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,730
It looks nice. I will send it to you.

293
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,060
If we get the chance to meet again, send it to me then.

294
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,040
- That's not what I meant—
- Bye-bye.

295
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,090
If we're fated...

296
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,650
You really don't remember me, do you?

Hello?

300
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,590
Don't worry. I was the one who suddenly changed the time.

301
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,860
If I can't book a ticket, I can just sit in a non-reserved (unassigned) seat.

302
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,000
Please take your ticket.

303
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,450
Excuse me. Thank you.

304
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,570
So what do you want to eat?

305
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,210
Oh, oh, how about hot pot?

306
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,830
Do you like hot pot?

307
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,190
Let's eat... beef hot pot. What do you think?

308
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,830
Okay.

309
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,360
Okay, okay. Shall I pick you up after work?

310
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,210
- You can have my seat.
- It's okay.

311
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,500
Don't worry. I'll get off soon. Please, sit down.

312
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,060
I'll treat you to hot pot.

317
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,520
Please grab your ticket.

318
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,380
Let me carry your baggage.

319
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,380
How could I possibly let my extraordinary boss roll such a heavy suitcase?

320
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,230
What brings you here? Where is Sheng Ying?

321
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,910
Something came up so she cannot come right now.

322
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,690
Are you going to tell me or not?

323
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,300
A customer came to the company to protest.

324
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,410
Where's the car? Let's go to the company first.

325
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,460
You're the only one in my heart.

326
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,810
That's right.

327
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,400
How could I possibly do without you?

328
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,090
The person you matched me with
[Love Is Science Marriage Agency]

329
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,510
is not whom I wanted. This is a scam!
[Love Is Science]

330
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,390
I want a refund!

331
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,220
Mr. Chao, you may have forgotten the conditions you've listed before,

332
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,900
but that's all right. We have the records.

333
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,820
You can take a look.

334
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,370
You said you like someone innocent, obedient,

335
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,490
naturally beautiful, a dutiful wife and loving mother.

336
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,080
It's best if she was single since birth, with no boyfriend before.

337
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,090
The people we've arranged for you were all teachers, accountants, or nurses.

338
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,730
Every single person has a good education, good temperament,

339
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,720
and a simple background.

340
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,470
I don't understand how we're a scam.

341
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,620
That teacher was too old.

342
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,280
The accountant was too boring!

343
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,490
And that nurse was always working overtime so I couldn't even see her!

344
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,230
If this isn't a scam, then what is it?

345
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,730
Or is there something wrong with your computers?

346
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,760
The data cannot be wrong.

347
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,870
Moreover, these matches

348
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,710
have 100% compatibility with you.

349
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,290
So would you like to try again?

350
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,860
These pairing conditions are wrong!

351
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,060
No matter how much I try, it's useless. I don't care anymore!

352
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,140
My mom said she wants to hold a grandchild soon.

353
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,270
You have to think of a way for me to create one!

354
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,510
Mr. Chao.

355
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,870
Mr. Chao, long time no see.

356
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,420
Perfect timing.

357
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,290
Some time ago, I became a member after listening to your advice.

358
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,610
Look, I haven't had a single partner!

359
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,770
Don't be angry. I'll take care of it. You can go work.

360
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,810
Ou Wen, make a latte for Mr. Chao and double the milk.

361
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,010
Okay.

362
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,780
Double the milk? Do you still remember that?

363
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,400
Of course, I remember. Every member is very important to us.

364
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,280
The coffee will be here very soon. Please wait a moment for me.

365
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,870
Give me the pairing information for Chairman Hsu.

366
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,940
Chairman Hsu?
- Yes.

367
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:48,340
- This is Chairman Hsu's, not Mr. Chao's.
- I know.

368
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,450
Here.

369
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:54,240
Take a look to see if there's anyone here you think is suitable.

370
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,700
I like all of them. These are the ones I wanted all along!

371
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,670
If you'd let me match with them earlier,

372
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,480
I wouldn't have wasted so much time.

373
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,020
Mr. Chao, please enjoy your coffee.

374
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,840
I completely understand your needs.

375
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,500
Don't worry. We will continue to arrange suitable candidates for you.

376
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,290
However, whether the pairing is a success or not depends on the work put in by both of you.

377
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,640
Hard work. Of course, of course. I'll continue to work hard.

378
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,860
I'll leave it all up to you then!

379
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,570
No problem.

380
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,500
Thank you.

381
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,520
- I'll see you next time.
- No problem. I'll leave it up to you.

382
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,150
Take care.

383
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,810
The members he liked just now all got so much facial work, their moms can't even recognize them.

384
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,350
He told me about liking natural beauties who are the dutiful wife and loving mother types.

385
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,020
What is there to be upset about?

386
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,690
The way men look at women has always been different from how women look at women.

387
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,850
But this is the first time I've met someone as outrageous as him.

388
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:10,070
Most men think that pretty is natural and ugly isn't.

389
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,030
They can't tell the difference between a bare face, light makeup, and full makeup at all.

390
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,020
Forget it. I can't understand men.

391
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,440
Me neither.

392
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,280
Okay. Remember to make a memo on Mr. Chao's file.

393
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,390
Remember to contact my Kaohsiung seminar's new members.
- Okay.

394
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,270
My baggage is still in the car so I'll be going home first.

395
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,430
- Yes, Boss.
- Yes, Boss.

396
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,620
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

397
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,220
What? Can't you understand men?

398
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,170
I can't.

399
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,370
I'm the one who truly can't understand them.

400
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,470
Hey! I'm trying to comfort you.

401
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,990
- Hi.
- Hi, you're back.

402
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,900
- Did you miss me?
- A little bit.

403
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,090
- Hi, you're back.
- Hi.

404
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,190
Welcome back!

405
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:15,020
You came back at the perfect time. Quickly put your stuff away and take care of your clients.

406
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,060
Otherwise, our Voodoo Salon will become a wet (fresh food) market.

407
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,470
Do you still want customers?

408
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,590
What kind of attitude is that?

409
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,030
- Oh, please!
- That's right.

410
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,050
What is it? I took a picture, so what?

411
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,340
Sorry for making you wait so long.

412
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,890
Hsuan Yu, we waited for you for so long! You're finally here.

413
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,260
Let me take you ladies to the VIP room. It's more comfortable there.

414
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,200
Don't forget your belongings.

415
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,350
Hsuan Yu, I've missed you.

416
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,030
Hey, the lady at the counter told me that there are new products.

417
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,570
- Let's go take a look after we're done.
- Okay.

418
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,000
Voodoo

419
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,390
I'm going to put towels on you all.

420
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,920
- You have too many limited edition items.
- There's a special offer.

421
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,690
- Getting money from you is just too easy.
- That's not true.

422
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,160
This designer is really different.

423
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,640
You should hurry and switch...

424
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,380
- Hey, Hsuan Yu. Long time no see.
- Hi. Long time no see.

425
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,300
- You look well.
- Thanks.

426
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,770
Would you like to get a touch-up today?

427
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,580
Yes, yes, yes. You have to make me look nice,

428
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,980
because our Mrs. Liu will be getting a daughter-in-law.

429
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,580
Oh, really? I'm so happy for you.

430
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:19,200
Then you should be able to give us great hairstyles.

431
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,440
No problem. Leave it up to me. I won't make you look bad.

432
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,780
Hsuan Hsuan, come, come. Help me take a look. What does this sticker mean? I don't understand.

433
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,460
"Mei pu" (crying)? I don't know.

434
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,290
Show me. I know a lot about these things.

435
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,020
What does it mean? Why is it saying "mei pu"?

436
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,040
It's a sheep that is sad. The sheep makes the "mei" sound.

437
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,720
- It can also sound like "mou."
- I assure you the youth's trends are an enigma. Accept it.

438
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,640
- Don't worry about it.
- Don't think about it.

439
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,130
My friend, you're a strong person to take on three people yourself.

440
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,480
Are you okay?

441
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,280
I'm great. The older sisters totally adore me.

442
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,370
What's the point of adoring you?

443
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,390
Don't you know that the boss wants to change the store to be more high-class,

444
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,960
and that he thinks the older sisters are very low?

445
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,260
I know, but they all treat me very well.

446
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,200
Don't forget when we were rookies, constantly being yelled at,

447
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,950
they supported us and had our backs.

448
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:23,740
The Three Mother Army Group, they really are your auntie fans.

449
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,390
You don't leave them, and they don't abandon you.

450
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,610
That's right.

451
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,870
That's right.

452
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,750
Older Sister Hsu, here's your rooibos tea.

453
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,850
- Thanks.
- It's nothing.

454
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,560
That's right.

455
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,910
That's right.

456
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,900
Older Sister Liu, here's your Jin Xuan tea.

457
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,800
- I'll call you back.
- Hsuan Hsuan, you're great!

458
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,580
- Cappuccino!
- With oat milk?

459
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,570
- Yes.
- Okay.

460
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,570
You are so sweet.

461
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:05,130
I brought gifts for you all from my business trip to Kaohsiung.

462
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,100
What is it?

463
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,220
Wait a moment.

464
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,930
He is all grown up now.

465
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,960
Did you buy it for your girlfriend?

466
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,300
I know the time has changed. I am very fashionable.

467
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,800
That's not mine!

468
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,530
This...

469
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,920
Oh, Hsuan Hsuan.

470
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,610
Oh, this

471
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,220
color...

472
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,470
I wonder if she's hot or not.

473
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,790
♫ Always be with you ♫

474
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:20,200
♫ We'll support each other from now on. I promise... ♫

475
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,650
He is all grown up now.

476
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,530
Did you buy it for your girlfriend?

477
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:43,990
I know the time has changed. I am very fashionable.

478
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:48,700
That's not mine! This...

479
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,040
Oh, Hsuan Hsuan. Oh, this

480
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,970
color...

481
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,670
I wonder if she's hot or not.

482
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,160
It's 329.

483
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,300
Also, 329...

484
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,610
The suitcases and passcodes are the same.

485
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,790
What are the odds?

486
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:53,340
I'm sorry. If possible, I don't want to go through your owner's things either.

487
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,580
Sorry, sorry.

488
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,860
Oh my.

489
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:52,630
This... this looks a bit familiar.

490
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,600
Where exactly is my baggage?

491
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,050
"Takao Cake, Master Fang" (names of local products in Kaohsiung).

492
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,310
Fresh Green Fruits and Vegetable Co., Ltd. Delivery Invoice. Shipping Address: Mr. Wang, No. 326, Sec. 1, Huandong Road, Zhongshan District, Taipei City

493
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,940
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

494
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,530
I'm sorry.

495
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,700
Sorry for what?

496
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,930
Bro! Come back! Let me explain!

497
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:47,220
Bro, you misunderstood. It is not what you think.

498
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,020
It's okay. You don't have to explain. Let me calm down with a cup of water.

499
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,000
Why do you need to calm down? It's really not what you think.

500
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,800
- Believe me.
- You really don't have to explain.

501
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,820
I'm just a little surprised. I completely respect your choice.

502
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,970
I didn't choose anything. No, Bro, this—

503
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,660
I understand.

504
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,830
Do you?

505
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,410
Some people... are naturally born with...

506
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,160
transvestism.

507
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,330
But that's a genetic issue! There's nothing wrong with you!

508
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:17,270
Just happily be yourself.

509
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,580
But I want you to know one thing.

510
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,570
I will always love you, my younger brother.

511
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,500
Younger sister works as well. Either "brother" or "sister" is fine.

512
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:33,490
Bro, thank you. I know that you really love me,

513
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:38,250
but I'm really not what you... think.

514
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:45,880
Why did you suffer by yourself? Why didn't you tell me?

515
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,790
These past 27 years

516
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,150
must have been difficult for you, right?

517
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,250
No matter how difficult, not like right now.

518
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:58,720
How exactly do I explain it so you'll believe me?

519
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,650
Did someone get the wrong suitcase?

520
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,390
Sister-in-law?

521
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,500
Is it you?

522
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,940
Did you lose anything?

523
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,900
No.

524
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,580
I'm really sorry. I also don't know why I just coincidentally

525
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,430
happened to get your suitcase.

526
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,020
What a coincidence that you got my suitcase.

527
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,490
What a coincidence that you were able to open my lock.

528
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:43,640
What a coincidence that you just happened to find my undergarments.

529
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,730
- Just the bras.
- Oh.

530
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,800
Is there a difference?

531
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,370
No! Miss, it's like this.

532
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,440
It's because I opened the door and saw him holding your...

533
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,380
intimate clothing. Then he rushed out

534
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,400
to explain to me so he came running out with those things.

535
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,950
Forget it. I also went through your luggage to find this place.

536
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,240
Consider us even.

537
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,260
It's okay as long as we switched back.

538
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,170
Wait a second, Miss. I'm sorry.

539
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:20,130
- Have we met before?
- Wow.

540
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,690
You two brothers even use the same phrase to hit on someone.

541
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,850
No, no, no! I really... I really think I know you from somewhere.

542
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,460
You are my high school classmate!

543
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,840
I am your high school teacher!
- No—

544
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,860
Your wife is present, yet you're hitting on a girl? Am I fake?

545
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,640
- I'm not... No, Wife, don't hit me.
- You're not what?

546
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,260
- Wait!
- You're so embarrassing!

547
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,920
What?

548
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,040
We made a deal.

549
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:53,480
Sorry, it's inconvenient for me. Save it.

550
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,820
- Listen to me. Let me explain.
- I don't want to.

551
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:00,220
Wait a second, let me walk you out. I'm sorry you had to make a trip here.

552
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,570
Oh, I remember now! I remember now!

553
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:10,280
You're... Yan Fei, right?

554
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,580
What? You're Wang Hsuan Yang!

555
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:17,820
Wang Hsuan Yang, is it... really you?

556
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,090
I was a cheerleader for this game! I cheered for you!

557
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,520
Do you see, Wife? I wasn't spouting nonsense. She really is my high school classmate.

558
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,280
Hubby, you were really handsome back in high school.

559
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,670
You're Wang Hsuan Yu, oh!

560
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,900
You are Little Piggy!

561
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,300
♫ Always be with you ♫

562
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,310
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

563
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:12,960
Oh, I remember now! I remember now!

564
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,750
You're... Yan Fei, right?

565
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,920
What? You're Wang Hsuan Yang!

566
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,370
Wang Hsuan Yang, is it... really you?

567
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:29,460
I was a cheerleader for this game! I cheered for you!

568
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,060
Do you see, Wife? I wasn't spouting nonsense. She really is my high school classmate.

569
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,820
Hubby, you were really handsome back in high school.

570
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,150
You're Wang Hsuan Yu, oh!

571
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,370
You are Little Piggy!

572
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,100
Everybody says fat people are full of potential.

573
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,140
You are the ultimate fighter in the potential department!

574
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,280
I didn't recognize you at all!

575
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:57,350
I never thought you would remember. You used to always call me Little Piggy.

576
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:00,340
Of course, I remember.

577
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:05,000
Little Piggy, I missed you so much.

578
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:18,080
Thank you for taking me home. Turns out we really are fated.

579
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,350
No wonder, that day when I was looking through your luggage,

580
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,520
I found that a sweater seemed really familiar.

581
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,560
It was the one you wore when we shared the lamb hot pot.

582
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,930
What's wrong?

583
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:38,020
So can we exchange phone numbers now?

584
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,690
Silly, of course. Give it to me.

585
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,640
When did you recognize me?

586
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,960
I recognized you at the entrance of the lamb hot pot store.

587
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,390
Why didn't you say so then?

588
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,910
I wanted to see if you could recognize me or not.

589
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:17,320
Oh, please. Your brother went from that to this.

590
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,020
Then you went from that to this.

591
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,320
You two basically just switched heads.

592
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,480
You can't blame me for not recognizing you after all these years, right?

593
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,520
It's been twelve years.

594
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:35,050
It's not "all these years." It's twelve years.

595
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:42,520
Don't talk about numbers with me. The years are like a knife.

596
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:49,820
The years only affected my brother. You're still the same, unscathed.

597
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,850
You didn't change at all. You're still so...

598
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,460
pretty.

599
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:03,300
How come you still have such a sweet mouth?

600
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,810
Oh, right. You're a hairstylist, correct?

601
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,720
Do you have a business card?

602
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,420
Voodoo Hair Salon, Stylist Wang Hsuan Yu

603
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,020
Wang Hsuan Yu... Wow.

604
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,240
Come by when you have time.

605
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,020
I will.

606
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:43,050
Pinky promise.

607
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,750
Give it to me.

608
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:01,650
Didn't you marry and move to the U.S.? Why are you back all of a sudden?

609
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,400
Because of work. I started a company in Taiwan.

610
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,620
Unexpectedly I got busier and busier so I had less time to go back to the U.S.

611
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:13,000
Thank you for taking me home.

612
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,800
My pleasure.

613
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,510
I suddenly thought of something very strange.

614
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:28,260
What?

615
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,650
Why is your suitcase's passcode the same as mine?

616
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,940
Mine is my birthday.

617
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:38,750
March 29...

618
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,700
is my goddess' (dream girl) birthday.

619
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,260
- Goddess?
- Yes.

620
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,190
Who is it?

621
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:50,820
Kim Tae Hee.

622
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,910
Kim Tae Hee?

623
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,410
I didn't think you would follow Korean stars.

624
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:04,070
Everyone born on March 29 is a goddess.

625
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:12,250
You sure know how to speak. Bye bye!

626
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:22,220
After 12 years, 5 months, and 3 days,

627
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,280
I met my goddess again.

628
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,090
I once thought that we would never meet again.

629
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:45,050
Wang Hsuan Yu...

630
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:50,420
Does he not have FB? Why can't I find him?

631
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:57,160
They all say that only old people use FB. Is that true?

632
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,540
Wang Hsuan Yang.

633
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:13,060
Wang Hsuan Yang, you seem to be living well.

634
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,830
Your wife is quite cute.

635
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,330
Wang Hsuan Yang. Wishing myself a happy birthday.

636
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:28,720
So this is what a happy marriage looks like.

637
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,810
He's so chubby, yet he's smiling so happily.

638
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:54,390
I didn't think I had such bad taste in men when I was young.

639
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,530
Yan Fei, oh, Yan Fei.

640
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:03,290
Congratulations, you have one more thing to add to your dark past.

641
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:04,830
Cheers.

♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

644
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,960
You must've been frightened today, right?

645
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,130
I never thought you and Yan Fei would meet this way.

646
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:23,030
I also never thought that she would be back from the U.S.

647
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:43,210
Didn't you marry and move to the U.S.? Why are you back all of a sudden?

648
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:44,980
Because of work.

649
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:48,260
I started a company in Taiwan. Unexpectedly, I got busier and busier

650
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,150
so I had less time to go back to the U.S.

651
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,260
Am I thinking too much?

652
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:08,760
Yan Fei seems... a bit different from before.

653
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,950
How is she different?

654
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:24,340
So much time has passed and people change.

655
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,630
All done.

656
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,060
This... Did she see this?

657
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:21,230
Wang Hsuan Yu, can't you be more presentable in front of your goddess?

658
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,800
This...

659
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:45,150
Is it you?

660
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:54,240
Clearly it was my bra that was in public so why was he more embarrassed than I was?

661
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:59,130
Fortunately, it was Little Piggy who took my suitcase.

662
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:15,310
Wang Hsuan Yu, today I was really happy...

663
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,830
Today I was really happy to see you again! Good night, Little Piggy.

664
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:57,990
I was also really happy to see you today! Good night, Kim Tae Hee.

665
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:50,490
Preview: You were doing well in the U.S. so why did you come back?

666
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:53,260
- I...
- You've already been divorced for so long.

667
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,840
- I still can't forget Yung Tai.
- Yung Tai and his French girlfriend broke up.

668
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,500
- I'm not a player. I'm–
- Hey!

669
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,440
- Don't get any ideas about my Little Piggy.
- You have met so many men who are suitable for marriage,

670
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,980
yet none have made your heart flutter.

671
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,440
There's such a great young hunk in front of you, yet you don't do anything!

672
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,840
If my goddess appears in front of me one day...

673
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:26,870
Piggy's Love Diary

674
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:51,300
I wonder if Wang Hsuan Yang is here or not.

675
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,490
What are you looking at?

676
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:08,560
My ice cream! My ice cream!

677
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:13,050
- My ice cream!
- Who's outside?

678
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:15,760
My ice crea—

679
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,240
You got it all over your face, Little Piggy.

680
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,170
So your name is Wang Hsuan Yu? How are you related to Wang Hsuan Yang?

681
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:48,270
I'm my older brother's younger brother.

682
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,600
What else do you want to eat?

683
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,070
- Can I choose anything?
- Yes, anything you want.

684
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:03,300
I'll buy it all for you, okay?

685
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:13,810
♫ Can't you see? I've fallen in love with you ♫

686
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:17,350
♫ Like a panicky amateur player ♫

687
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:20,210
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

688
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:23,930
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
