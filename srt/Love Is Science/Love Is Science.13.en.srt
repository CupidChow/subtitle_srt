1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,370
Did you find real love that quickly?

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,570
Are you in that much of a rush? That's why...

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,600
Fortunately, Nai Hui broke up with you.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,150
People like you don't deserve her at all.

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,680
Miss Cho Nai Hui, I am willing to entrust my everything to you. Will you marry me?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,760
I was just helping you put up a show. Just a replacement...

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,620
We are each other's Ponzi scheme.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,320
Until the last moment, we are unwilling to believe in this ending.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,980
Have you gone crazy? Don't you like women?

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,520
I do like women, but I also like you.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,930
Can I pick you up in the morning?

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,590
To have breakfast?

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,550
To go on a date, not between an older sister and a younger brother.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,680
It's the type between a man and woman.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,370
I never considered separating from you.

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,500
You don't love me! You only love yourself–

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
I love you! I have always loved you.

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,220
♫ Happy birthday to you

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,220
Happy birthday, Sheng Ying. I'm sorry.

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,830
I don't accept your apology.

21
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,450
Congratulations on successfully ruining my birthday.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,040
Always Be With You

44
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,220
Love Is Science?

45
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,240
Liu Sheng Ying, what is wrong?

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,760
Miss Lo honestly didn't mean to make it difficult for you today. She truly wanted to apologize.

47
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,730
Why do I have to accept her apology?

48
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,760
What gives the perpetrator the right to ask the victim to forget?

49
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,820
Do you know what she did to me?

50
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,730
She...

51
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
was my first love.

52
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,190
After struggling to muster up my courage,

53
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,100
I wrote her a love letter.

54
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,980
Were you looking for me?

55
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,880
This is for you.

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,290
What is it?

57
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,300
Take a look.

58
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,250
So mysterious.

59
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,790
Yun Hsi, thank you for transferring schools and for becoming my classmate.

60
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,630
Thanks to you, my hard work studying has a meaning.

61
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,500
Every day, what I look forward to the most

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,700
is lying in bed at night, chatting with you.

63
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,690
Every time I see you cry,

64
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,390
I want to hug you and comfort you.

65
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,060
I like you.

66
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,800
More than just like.

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,790
Will you be my girlfriend?

68
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,030
What exactly do you want to do?

69
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,430
We should be asking what you want to do.

70
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,060
That the well-behaved and studious Liu Sheng Ying

71
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,690
would write such a disgusting thing.

72
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,970
Listen up. "Every day, what I look forward to the most"

73
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,490
"is lying in bed at night, chatting with you."

74
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,100
- Give it back!
- "Every time you cry,"

75
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,460
"I want to hold you."

76
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,160
Liu Sheng Ying, aren't you too perverted?

77
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,890
If I were Lo Yun Hsi, I would be scared to death

78
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,410
to be liked by a pervert.

79
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,840
It is fine if you want to mess with me, but don't hurt Yun Hsi!

80
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,260
Of course, I wouldn't hurt Yun Hsi.

81
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,490
We are actually helping Yun Hsi teach you a lesson.

82
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,900
Yun Hsi, why did you come? Hurry and leave!

83
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,490
Come, come. Don't be scared.

84
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,200
Everyone is here to help get you justice.

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,470
Okay, Luo Yun Hsi.

86
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,890
Today, everyone is here to be your witness.

87
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,960
Loudly tell her if you like her or not.

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,710
What do you feel when Liu Sheng Ying holds you?

89
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,940
I feel very disgusted.

90
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,560
What? I couldn't hear you.

91
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,560
I feel very disgusted.

92
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,830
You need to be louder! You need to make sure Liu Sheng Ying hears.

93
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,400
I feel very disgusted and dirty!

94
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,730
Then dirty things need to be washed clean.

95
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,500
Hold out your hands.

96
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,860
Hold it well.

97
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,330
Wash her clean.

98
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,960
Hurry!

99
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,630
Wash her clean! Wash her clean! Wash her clean!

100
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,630
Wash her clean! Wash her clean! Wash her clean!

101
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,290
Hey, you did very well.

102
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,930
Did you all see that?

103
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:50,280
I thought my nightmare would end there,

104
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,180
but who would have thought

105
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,520
that they would take my love letter for her

106
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,950
and post it on the bulletin board as well as print copies to pass out?

107
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:10,210
With Lo Yun Hsi's pitiful tears added on top,

108
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,950
my high school life was utterly destroyed just like that.

109
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,690
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,460
It is all right. I feel much better after talking about it.

111
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,200
Hand her case over to me. I will take care of it.

112
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,620
Also, don't forgive her.

113
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,690
Don't wrong yourself by showing her a pleasant face.

114
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,450
Thank you.

115
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,550
No need.

116
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,350
Wait a minute.

117
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,500
I suddenly remembered. What is going on between you and Mark?

118
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,520
You two aren't really together, are you?

119
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,010
You didn't actually fall for that guy who looks like a peacock but acts like a racehorse, did you?

120
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,760
I'm not sure.

121
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,130
Tai Ou Wen, wake up!

122
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,490
If his head is clouded, that is fine, but why are you getting feverish, too?

123
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,650
Us falling for straight men and straight girls

124
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,020
will only result in a bad ending.

125
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,030
Look at me. Do you want to repeat my mistake?

126
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,360
A date, not between an older sister and a younger brother.

127
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,050
The type between a man and a woman,

128
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,020
an official date.

129
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,980
Sister-in-law, does this look all right?

130
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,090
Uncle looks so handsome!

131
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,010
You're dressed so handsomely. Are you going on a date with Yan Fei?

132
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,180
Yes. How do I look?

133
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,720
You look great. Very handsome.

134
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,570
You do still lose to your older brother by a bit.

135
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,400
Oh, right!

136
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,260
These are the fortune cookies I made at school. Do you want to pick one?

137
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,090
Sure.

138
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,100
Great fortune

139
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,250
This is the best one!

140
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,070
It looks like your date will go very smoothly today.

141
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,340
Do you want to pick one for your friend, too?

142
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,150
Okay.

143
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,870
I will help you wrap it up.

144
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,930
- Here.
- Thank you.

145
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,490
Uncle's friend will surely like such a great gift.

146
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,490
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

147
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,080
Thank you, Jia Jia. Thank you, Sister-in-law.

148
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,940
Let's go!

149
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,610
♫ The quietest thing isn't the deep sea ♫

150
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,820
♫ It's the street where I met you ♫

151
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,880
Boy, be careful when playing with water! You got water on me!

152
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,010
♫ It's my heartbeat that broke through the sky ♫

153
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,720
♫ That day, I flipped through all the books ♫

154
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,280
♫ I love you yet still can't say why ♫

155
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,110
♫ The straight line belongs to men, the curved one to god (Antoni Gaudi) ♫

156
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,370
Hello, what can I get for you?

157
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,080
I want two caramel cold brews with heavy cream.

158
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,380
That will be NT$125 ($4.50 US).

159
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,730
We have "a buy one, get one free" promotion today.

160
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,370
Oh, okay.
Caramel cold brew with heavy cream, buy one get one free

161
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,940
Please wait.

168
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,830
Rose Garden Cafe is having its grand opening. Here is a rose for you.

169
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,120
- Thank you.
- No problem.

170
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,110
This pair.

171
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,340
Let me take a look.

172
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,550
Let me see. Not this pair.

173
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,560
This is your first date in nine years.

174
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,420
I won't allow you to go without some tricks.

175
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,870
- Down.
- Hey!

176
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,220
He is here.

177
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,510
How do I look? Am I okay?

178
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,360
Okay.

179
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,530
This is for you.

180
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,760
Also, this.

181
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,770
So flashy, so flashy!

182
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,340
Okay, you guys get going. Okay?

183
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,580
Wait, wait. Let me tell you two.

184
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,780
You are not allowed to come home tonight. Understood?

185
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,370
What nonsense are you saying? This is only our first date.

186
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,360
It is because it is the first date that you have to test run it.

187
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,540
If it works well, then there may be a second date.

188
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,320
This is the fortune cookie Jia Jia wanted to give to you.

189
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,790
Oh, a fortune cookie. What did you get?

190
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,400
Big sun, great fortune. What about you?

191
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,560
What? Terrible fortune? Why did I get a terrible fortune?

192
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,580
H-How can that one be yours?

193
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,590
Look at your size, does it look like you have a big chest (bad fortune and chest sound similar)?

194
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,370
I'm Big Chest. This one is mine.

195
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,150
You two, stop standing around here.

196
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,350
Aren't you guys supposed to go on a date?

197
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,910
- Go, go, go!
- Wait.

198
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,590
For you.

199
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,650
Up!

200
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,850
Let's go, come on.

201
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,150
I think I need to go to the hospital for a checkup.

202

End of Time
Daniel King

203
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,880
Do you still remember that I like Daniel King?

204
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,690
Of course. I remember you standing in line trying to get his album and getting heatstroke. You needed gua-sha for three days (a technique in traditional Chinese medicine).

205
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,590
That is hard to forget, right?

206
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,530
I will go redeem the gift now.

207
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,070
What gift?

208
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,760
It is a secret.

209
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,270
Then I will go to the restroom first.

210
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,190
- You go and redeem the gift, and we will meet back here later, okay?
- Okay.

211
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,000
I really do have terrible fortune.

212
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,890
Could I get any more unlucky?

213
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,560
Hi, I would like to redeem the limited edition signed album.

214
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,450
You're so lucky! The artist has personally come to the exhibit.

215
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,450
All patrons can get Daniel King's autograph just by waiting in line. There is no lottery.

216
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,450
Today really is my lucky day.

217
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,540
Thank you.

218
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,260
What is the gift? Could you tell me what it is now?

219
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,020
End of Time

220
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,390
Look at what this is.

221
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,470
A limited edition signed album. Do you like it?

222
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,000
Yes.

223
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,550
Also, let me tell you, we are super lucky. Daniel King happens to be here at the exhibit.

224
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,950
Later, we can wait in line and get his autograph.

225
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,670
Are you happy?

226
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,730
Can you walk?

227
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,680
What are you doing?

228
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,230
What are you doing? Who is this woman?

229
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,940
We don't know each other.

230
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,550
Mom, here is the ice.

231
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,260
Thank you.

232
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,690
Hsin Hsin, eat your fries.

233
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,120
Is it good?

234
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,370
I saw that she twisted her ankle and helped her out. Is that not okay?

235
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,230
Then why didn't you say so?

236
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,120
Did you give me a chance to say anything?

237
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,950
Is it very painful?

238
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,280
I'm not in pain.

239
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,540
The ones in pain are the thousands of Taiwanese ladies who see my handsome face being marred.

240
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,230
Their hearts are in pain–

241
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,350
What thousands of Taiwanese ladies whose hearts are in pain?

242
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,470
Mark Lee, you have a far reach.

243
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,520
Handsome men love beautiful ladies, and beautiful ladies love handsome men. That is natural, isn't it?

244
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,140
Then what about Ou Wen and me?

245
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,060
I forgot to say, "besides you two." Is it fun to pick apart my words?

246
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,110
Then is playing around with Ou Wen fun?

247
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,860
When did I play around with Ou Wen?

248
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,820
Then right now, do you love handsome men or beautiful ladies?

249
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,310
I...

250
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,600
I like Ou Wen.

251
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,250
So are you already prepared

252
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,360
to give up all the world's hot chicks for Ou Wen?

253
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,810
I don't know.

254
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,490
Ou Wen is very faithful.

255
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,760
He even had a bit of a one-track mind.

256
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,400
Didn't you go abroad to England to study? When did you return?

257
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,420
Do you actually love me that much?

258
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,880
If I didn't come here to exercise with my baby,

259
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,090
would you have waited until death?

260
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,510
I know that.

261
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,260
He isn't a big playboy like you.

262
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,820
One minute you're chasing Chiao An Na, and the next, you're climbing into Ou Wen's bed.

263
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,120
What do you treat Ou Wen as?

264
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,770
The place you should put ice on is here.

265
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,560
As well as...

266
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,680
there.

267
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,690
If you upset Ou Wen, I won't let you go.

268
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,630
Do you hear me?

269
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,480
FIB Fitness Club

270
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,010
Hey. I'm fine. Continue.

271
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,760
Your face...

272
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,650
I accidentally hit something. Stupid, right?

273
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,630
Are you all right?

274
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,460
I'm fine. Focus.

275
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,840
Otherwise, when you fall and become a panda, it'll be very funny.

276
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,940
Think carefully if you're ready to confront this world because of Ou Wen.

277
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,760
If you're not ready, then go far away from him and stop bothering him.

278
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,950
My legs are no longer my legs.

279
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,970
What is going on with you today?

280
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,890
I have thought it through.

281
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,730
I will ask my friends to go skateboarding next week.

282
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,140
Do you want to go together?

283
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,560
I don't know how to skateboard.

284
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,000
That is fine.

285
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,570
I want to introduce you to my friends.

286
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,750
What kind of introduction?

287
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,410
Introducing a boyfriend, that kind of introduction.

288
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,700
Friend?

289
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,030
It is "boyfriend."

290
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,340
A friend that is a boy?

291
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,380
It is "boyfriend."

292
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,410
Stop joking around, Mark Lee.

293
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,770
Who is joking, Tai Ou Wen?

294
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,180
Do you want to go? One word.

295
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,270
Why are your hands so cold?

296
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,040
Are you so nervous about finally meeting Daniel King?

297
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,140
Yes, I'm so nervous I can barely speak.

298
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,500
Why don't you get it signed for me?

299
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,270
No, don't be nervous.

300
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,530
Body language is the easiest way to communicate feelings.

301
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,580
You only need to hand over your album and make a heart with your hand.

302
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,460
You will definitely be able to communicate your feelings to him.

303
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:59,640
B-But my stomach suddenly hurts a lot.

304
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,120
My stomach hurts a lot. I'm going to the restroom.

305
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,700
You.

306
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,690
- Are you okay? Should I call...?
- No, no!

307
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,600
Sorry, my friend is too nervous so...

308
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,070
She is too nervous. That is why she couldn't say anything and coughed.

309
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,870
Yan Fei has been your loyal fan for a while now.

310
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,520
She has seen all your exhibitions in Taiwan.

311
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,910
She is just too nervous because she can finally get your autograph.

312
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,600
She has been your fan for many years,

313
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,270
and today, she is very excited to get your signature.

314
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,550
D.K.

315
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,940
It is my honor.

316
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,740
Thank you.

317
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,980
Wait a second. Can we get a photo?

318
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,800
- No, no.
- It is okay.

319
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,520
Sure, of course.

320
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,410
Thank you! Hurry, hurry!

321
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,690
Come on, together.

322
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,020
Thank you.

323
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,700
Three, two, one.

324
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,960
Thank you.

325
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,570
Nice to meet you again.

326
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,520
Thank you so much.

327
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,330
- Let's go eat.
- Thank you.

328
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,150
That is interesting.

329
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,290
I saw your rival today.

330
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,110
You should be worried.

331
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,670
Oh? Who is she going with?

332
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,710
A young guy, quite tall.

333
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,970
What a wonderful night @Yan Fei

334
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,480
I'm home.

335
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,390
Then I will get going.

336
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,900
How can I leave if you won't let go of my hand?

337
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,990
Clearly, it is you holding onto my hand.

338
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,390
Fei! Are you here?

339
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,810
Get up, get up!

340
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,080
Get up, get up! Quickly, quick!

341
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,490
Fei!

342
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,910
What is wrong?

343
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,230
It is good you're still here.

344
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,970
What?

345
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,540
This is all your fault!

346
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,930
What happened?

347
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,020
Your terrible fortune...

348
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,710
really is a terrible fortune.

349
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,320
What?

350
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,840
Are you pregnant?

351
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:54,730
But don't you have premature ovarian failure, thus having difficulty with getting pregnant?

352
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,530
Yes.

353
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,170
A medical miracle has happened.

354
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,590
We should go buy lottery tickets.

355
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,260
Of course. Of course, we have to buy some.

356
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,400
How can we pass up this opportunity to win the lottery?

357
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,860
So what do you plan on doing now?

358
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,360
I don't know.

359
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,260
I have always treated life as a game.

360
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,820
I can't imagine

361
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,660
being responsible for another person.

362
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,480
What about the baby's father? Does he know?

363
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:50,890
This is my own problem. Mark doesn't need to know.

364
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,920
Mark?

365
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,420
I haven't even decided

366
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,070
if I should have this child or not.

367
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,180
This might be

368
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,830
the only opportunity you get in this lifetime.

369
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,960
But...

370
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,800
if you plan on giving it up,

371
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,710
I will go with you to the hospital for the procedure

372
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,410
and take care of you until you recover.

373
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:40,180
However, on the other hand, if you decide to have the baby,

374
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,640
I will be your strongest supporter.

375
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,690
I'm just waiting for you to say the word.

376
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,210
Okay.

377
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,270
Let me think about it some more.

378
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,160
You have to help me keep it a secret from Hsuan Yu.

379
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,160
No problem.

380
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,240
It'll be okay.

381
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,460
Get back safely.

382
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,500
Oh, right. About Chiao An Na's situation, you heard it, right?

383
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,070
On Mark's end... Don't let the secret out.

384
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,830
I'm going inside now.

385
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,640
Then when can we tell Mark?

386
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,690
Why do we have to tell him?

387
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,780
How can we not?

388
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,560
If Chiao An Na doesn't want to keep this child,

389
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,650
is there a need for Mark to know?

390
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,320
He is the child's father, after all.

391
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,950
He isn't even An Na's boyfriend, much less her husband.

392
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:12,530
Letting him interfere would only make things more complicated.

393
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,940
The situation happened because of him so he needs to take responsibility.

394
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,280
Also, Mark is my good friend. I don't want to hide anything from him.

395
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,350
Sometimes you don't tell the other person to protect them,

396
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,880
not wanting them to be upset.

397
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:37,920
This is Chiao An Na's life. We should respect her wishes, right?

398
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:48,560
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

399
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,550
Sister-in-law.
- Yes?

400
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,450
Here,

401
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,750
give it to me. Sit down.

402
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,010
Thank you.

403
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,710
Careful.

404
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,150
You're washing so many things.

405
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,100
It is for a whole family.

406
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,580
Where is my brother?

407
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,950
He went to get something from a vendor.

408
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,030
Has he not come back yet?

409
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,680
No.

410
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,670
Sister-in-law.

411
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,990
Having a child... Is it something a woman can decide by herself?

412
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,140
What is wrong?

413
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,930
Nothing. I just always see you

414
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:56,040
opening the shop, taking care of Jia Jia, and cleaning up by yourself. It seems very exhausting.

415
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,770
What can I do? We need to make money.

416
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,500
Oh, right, did your date go well today? Why are you back so early?

417
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,700
I have to work tomorrow so I came back earlier.

418
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,870
Thank you, I was very happy today.

419
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,260
As long as you are happy.

420
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,790
I'm going to bed now. You should go to sleep early, too.

421
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,570
Good night.

422
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,060
Good night.

423
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,230
Take it as your sister-in-law being nosy. They're already divorced, yet he posts a picture like this.

424
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,370
It is obviously on purpose.

425
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:22,220
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

426
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:30,080
♫ Fantasize about a romantic love. While lonely... ♫

427
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,710
♫ Always be with you ♫

428
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:45,170
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile...  ♫

429
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:58,060
Take it as your sister-in-law being nosy. They're already divorced, yet he posts a picture like this.

430
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,940
It is obviously on purpose.

431
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,450
Huo Yung Tai! You're too despicable!

432
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,270
What is wrong?

433
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,860
He posted the picture from our dinner with Daniel on Facebook.

434
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,060
He also tagged me without asking!

435
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,780
Look!

436
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,590
This is so rude.

437
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,300
This won't do. I have to call him and yell at him to delete it.

438
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,600
Why are you going to yell at him?

439
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,790
For tagging you? You really are in the picture, though.

440
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,390
No, it's not like that...

441
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,190
The person you should be comforting now is Wang Hsuan Yu.

442
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,250
Relax, he doesn't have Facebook, and I have already told him about me having dinner with Huo Yung Tai.

443
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,570
Who is talking about the dinner?

444
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,120
I'm talking about the Daniel situation.

445
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,130
Does Hsuan Yu know that it was thanks to Huo Yung Tai that you could collect the three-color series?

446
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,650
And that you have already met Daniel?

447
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,510
That is not important, right?

448
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,980
Not important?

449
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,890
Listen to what you're saying now. You sound guilty.

450
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,000
Think about it yourself.

451
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,440
Are you going to call Huo Yung Tai or Wang Hsuan Yu first?

452
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,940
Also, let me tell you, we are super lucky. Daniel King happens to be here at the exhibit.

453
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,250
Later, we can wait in line and get his autograph.

454
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,090
Are you happy?

455
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,600
Why are your hands so cold?

456
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,450
Are you so nervous about finally meeting Daniel King?

457
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,270
I'm so nervous I can barely speak.

458
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,820
Why don't you get it signed for me?

459
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,230
- You get it for me.
- No.

460
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,770
My stomach hurts so much. I'm going to the bathroom.

461
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,010
You.

462
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,170
- Are you okay?
- Can we get a photo?

463
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,490
Come on, together.

464
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,940
What?

465
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,430
Three, two, one.

466
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,720
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

467
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,470
The weather is lovely today

468
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:07,700
so... maybe we can go on a picnic.

469
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,280
So annoying.

470
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,910
Didn't we say before we would go picnicking?

471
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,820
Why are you here?

472
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,370
The weather is lovely today.

473
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,740
Didn't we say to go on a picnic earlier?

474
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,650
Do you have time?

475
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,260
The albums from before were all signed beforehand.

476
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,240
Being able to see Daniel himself yesterday,

477
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,210
we were super lucky.

478
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,040
Don't you think so?

479
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,160
Didn't you two have dinner together before?

480
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,820
You know about it.

481
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

482
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,080
I didn't want to ruin the mood.

483
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,300
Those two meetings have different meanings.

484
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,240
Their weight is also different.

485
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,010
How are they different?

486
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,420
Huo Yung Tai can easily

487
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,930
arrange for you guys to meet and have dinner,

488
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,960
but I have to try hard and wait in line to get tickets

489
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,430
to get a signature.

490
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,980
We even have to squeeze together in line

491
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,890
like regular people.

492
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,570
Is that it?

493
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,920
What is wrong with waiting in line?

494
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,850
Because of that, the signature is extra special.

495
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,970
Then why did you want to hide when we were waiting in line?

496
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:53,110
Why did you pretend you hadn't met Daniel before?

497
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,240
I know you care about Huo Yung Tai.

498
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,840
I wanted to protect you.

499
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,520
Sometimes you don't tell the other person

500
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,480
to protect them,

501
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,720
not wanted them to be upset.

502
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,460
You're too self-righteous.

503
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,150
You always make decisions by yourself.

504
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,600
But it is not like that between people.

505
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,670
Just like with Mark. You decided by yourself not to let Mark know, but

506
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,880
that is not fair to him.

507
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,760
What does this have to do with Mark?

508
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,680
Please, can you not be so stubborn?

509
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,350
No wonder our compatibility is only twenty-nine percent.

510
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,050
Did you put us in the system to be scored？

511
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,150
I was just curious.

512
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,150
What about Huo Yung Tai?

513
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,820
Did you put him in the system, too?

514
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,170
His score is very high, right?

515
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,180
That is a system bug.

516
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,630
There must be something wrong.

517
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,250
I have to go back to help out Sister-in-law.

518
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,330
All because of Huo Yung Tai.

519
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,350
I'm looking for Huo Yung Tai.

520
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,150
- Do you have an appointment?
- I don't.

521
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,790
- Sorry, then you have to call–
- I don't want to call him myself.

522
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,340
Call him down for me.

523
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,210
Are you looking for me?

524
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,170
Why are you standing so close to me?

525
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,540
Why did you suddenly stop?

526
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,410
Then why did you post the picture from that day?

527
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,440
Can I not post it? Why not?

528
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,560
Did you ask for my permission to tag me?

529
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,910
Also, I have portrait rights.

530
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,160
You should at least ask, right?

531
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,800
Okay, then I will delete it now.

532
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,040
What is the point in deleting it now?

533
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,000
Everyone has already seen it, even those who shouldn't have.

534
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,700
Is that Wang Hsuan Yu angry?

535
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,480
Nonsense.

536
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,330
You did it on purpose.

537
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:49,570
Yes, I just want him to back off quietly

538
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,480
because you and I are very aware

539
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,010
that the most suitable to be together now

540
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,580
are the two of us.

541
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,920
You–

542
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,760
♫ Always be with you ♫

543
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:25,480
♫ We'll support each other from now on. I promise... ♫

544
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,600
Did you ask for my permission to tag me?

545
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,970
Also, I have portrait rights.

546
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:31,170
You should at least ask, right?

547
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,810
Okay, then I will delete it now.

548
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,100
What is the point in deleting it now?

549
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,010
Everyone already saw it, even those who shouldn't have.

550
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,760
Is that Wang Hsuan Yu angry?

551
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,600
Nonsense.

552
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,400
You did it on purpose.

553
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,660
Yes. I just want him to back off quietly

554
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,550
because you and I are very aware

555
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,160
that the most suitable to be together now

556
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,650
are the two of us.

557
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:07,950
You–

558
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,830
Huo Yung Tai and Yan Fei - 98%

559
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,930
Huo Yung Tai, what are you doing?

560
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,660
Stop fighting it.

561
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,850
You and Wang Hsuan Yu aren't fit for each other at all.

562
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,330
It is impossible for you two to have an outcome.

563
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,890
What allows you to say that?

564
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,410
Do you know him? Do you understand him?

565
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,600
Can't you see?

566
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,170
The history of our failure

567
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,160
is repeating itself with you and Wang Hsuan Yu.

568
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,270
You try hard to become the best in your industry,

569
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,870
yet he only thinks about you.

570
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,350
The differences between you two will only get more prominent.

571
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,060
In the end,

572
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,360
you two will be like us.

573
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,390
Isn't that right?

574
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,840
Are you back from your picnic with Yan Fei?

575
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,850
Why do you look like that?

576
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,110
No reason.

577
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,940
What is wrong? Sit down.

578
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,670
Sh-Should I take you to the hospital?

579
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,160
It's fine, it's fine.

580
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,320
There is still half a month until the due date. Don't worry.

581
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,150
Are you really okay? Or do you want me to call my brother?

582
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,620
Don't call your brother!

583
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,970
He is the best at worrying.

584
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,810
Besides, Rui Rui is in my stomach

585
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,470
so even if there was anything wrong, there is nothing he can do.

586
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,090
It's fine.

587
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,130
Mommy!

588
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,620
- Jia Jia!
- Jia Jia, slow down.

589
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:49,360
Daddy and I bought you little devil's food cake.

590
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,250
Really?

591
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,460
Did Rui Rui behave while I was gone?

592
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,070
Rui Rui is very good. Just like Jia Jia.

593
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,370
I'm going to get ready for work.

594
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,390
H-Hsuan Yu.

595
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:08,370
This... This is your favorite pineapple bread.

596
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,690
Eat it while it's hot.

597
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,370
Thank you, Brother.

598
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,490
What are you thanking him for? No need to be so polite to family.

599
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:19,500
No need to thank him.

600
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,510
Rui Rui! Rui Rui!

601
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,360
When are you coming out?

602
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,220
Rui Rui, quickly come out to eat cake.

603
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,850
Can your little brother eat the cake?

604
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:38,010
No, he can only eat what you eat.

605
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:40,260
Let's help ourselves.

606
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,880
Besides, Mark is my good friend

607
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,230
so I don't want to have to hide anything from him.

608
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,130
This is Chiao An Na's life.

609
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,980
We should respect her wishes, right?

610
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,710
Oh my god!

611
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,010
Hey, Chiao An Na!

612
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,610
Look over here!

613
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,890
Look over here! Over here!

614
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,340
I'm over here!

615
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,010
Come here!

616
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,770
Mom Yan.

617
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,670
After rearranging everything, this place is not bad.

618
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,220
Thank you.

619
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,740
Why don't you rest for a bit?

620
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,270
Okay.

621
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:08,070
Are you okay?

622
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:11,960
Oh...

623
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,830
So messy.

624
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,240
Mom Yan.

625
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,470
- Chiao An Na, come here, sit down.
- Sorry about that.

626
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:44,290
Let me tell you.

627
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,340
When you feel nauseous, eat something sour.

628
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,280
You will feel better.

629
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,380
It will probably be much better after three months or so,

630
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,530
but it also depends on luck.

631
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:01,430
When I was pregnant with Yan Fei, I was throwing up until I gave birth.

632
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,300
Just now, in the trash can,

633
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,040
I saw your pregnancy test.

634
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:16,040
You're an adult. I'm not that old-fashioned.

635
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,290
Besides, in a couple of months,

636
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:21,560
your stomach is going to be as big as a balloon.

637
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,070
Would you be able to hide it then?

638
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:27,710
I haven't decided if I'm having it.

639
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:34,200
I... don't know if I should.

640
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,970
Are you afraid of something?

641
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,740
I just...

642
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,710
I just heard that... breastfeeding...

643
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,320
Breastfeeding causes your chest to sag.

644
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,910
Also, th-there are stretch marks.

645
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,470
They won't disappear even with the most expensive creams, right?

646
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,090
Then you have to help the child clean up its pee and poo.

647
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,660
Picking up that...

648
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:08,050
Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps!

649
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,270
Also, the most important thing is...

650
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:16,490
If... I decide to have it,

651
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,740
then does that mean

652
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,380
that for the rest of my life...

653
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,690
I have to give dating up?

654
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,760
Mom Yan!

655
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:35,530
Sorry, sorry. Don't misunderstand.

656
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,930
I was just thinking about myself from back then.

657
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:42,090
I was just like you, worrying about all these questions.

658
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,240
That is because the baby hasn't been born yet

659
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,180
so you can only think about yourself.

660
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,900
Once the baby is born,

661
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,620
everything you think is a problem now, won't be a problem anymore.

662
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,520
Why not?

663
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,140
After the baby is born,

664
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:02,710
how would you have time to think about your figure?

665
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:07,700
You will only think, "Has my baby eaten enough?"

666
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,170
When you have time, you will just want to go to bed.

667
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:15,130
As for the pee and poop,

668
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,980
you might not be able to imagine it now,

669
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,850
but let me tell you, I believe that you will be the type of person

670
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:25,850
to think that they are the world's luckiest woman

671
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:32,570
as soon as they see their baby's solid poop.

672
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,300
And as for the dating problem,

673
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,110
who said you can't date just because you are a single parent?

674
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:42,420
Am I not the one always putting people in the friend zone?

675
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,190
That is true.

676
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,880
It is just...

677
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,680
I have never seen what a good mom is like

678
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,310
so I'm actually a little worried if I could be a good mom.

679
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:11,050
Let me tell you. There is no consensus on how to be a good mom.

680
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:15,290
Every child's personality is also different. Every woman

681
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,040
learns how to be a good mom

682
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,640
after they have their child.

683
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,670
Your mother might have left you,

684
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:35,750
but that doesn't mean you are any worse than others. The most important thing now is,

685
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:40,050
do you want this child?

686
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:48,290
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

687
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,440
Boss.

688
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,740
Wasn't everything going well that day at Voodoo?

689
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,850
Why did you two suddenly break up?

690
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:05,760
Calm down first. Perhaps there is some sort of misunderstanding.

691
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,830
There is no misunderstanding.

692
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,850
We have definitely broken up.

693
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,740
It is okay.

694
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,320
Prepare some hot tea and pastries. Let's talk in my office.

695
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:43,320
Eat something, then we can talk.

696
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,480
Is there any problem between you and Mr. Wu?

697
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,540
The system was right

698
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,860
about the 33% compatibility.

699
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,020
We aren't compatible.

700
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,590
You Fu...

701
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:25,350
I mean... Mr. Wu.

702
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:29,620
Even though he isn't the most compatible person in the system,

703
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:33,550
haven't your interactions with each other all been happy?

704
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,410
I always thought that was what I wanted,

705
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:41,480
but... when he proposed to me,

706
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,760
I hesitated.

707
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,500
Is he... really the person that I want?

708
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,540
You said

709
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:02,290
people would be affected by their present emotions and environment,

710
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,670
producing an illusion.

711
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,820
We just...

712
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,560
Every date we had was very happy.

713
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,010
When we ate together, the food tasted especially delicious.

714
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:16,260
He is able to delicately find out

715
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,510
which parts of me aren't feeling well.

716
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,520
Is that enough?

717
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,760
I know marriage needs reasoning

718
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,090
to make sure that the other person's qualities and values

719
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:41,880
are suitable with yours.

720
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,480
It can't be decided emotionally,

721
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,550
right?

722
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,000
No.

723
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:05,510
♫ Turned out I was the only one playing the game ♫

724
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:10,220
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:14,160

727
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,290
You said

728
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:33,080
people would be affected by their present emotions and environment,

729
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,470
producing an illusion.

730
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:37,650
We just...

731
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,350
Every date we had was very happy.

732
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:43,820
When we ate together, the food tasted especially delicious.

733
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,070
He is able to delicately find out

734
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:49,350
which parts of me aren't feeling well.

735
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,220
Is that enough?

736
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,160
I know

737
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,590
marriage needs reasoning

738
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:08,940
to make sure that the other person's qualities and values

739
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,690
are suitable with yours.

740
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:15,160
It can't be decided emotionally,

741
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:18,460
right?

742
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,820
No.

743
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:36,990
The boss meant that we were wrong from the beginning.

744
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:39,760
We should have followed the system's suggestions

745
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,360
to make reasonable pairings for you.

746
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,930
No, that isn't right. The system has a bug.

747
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:48,990
It is just as you said. The system doesn't know who brightens your mood

748
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,790
and who makes you happy.

749
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:54,150
These factors are not accounted for.

750
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:59,340
Boss, the matchmaking system is our company's lifeline.

751
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,460
That is even more reason to fix a bug when found.

752
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:08,270
So what if it is 33%? There is one couple that scored even lower, 29%.

753
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,220
Twenty-nine percent?

754
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,220
So you can't give up.

755
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,710
No, neither of us can give up.

756
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:18,390
We can't lose to the system, okay?

757
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,860
Love Is Science

758
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:37,950
Why did I just say those things?

759
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,930
What is wrong?

760
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:52,380
That camping event...

761
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,420
We want to print a banner and need a name

762
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,850
so we prepared two choices for you to choose from.

763
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,320
Tell me.

764
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,090
Simple and rough, "Let's have a great time camping together."

765
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:10,230
With some auspicious moral, "Let's double our good times by camping."

766
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,700
I like... simple and rough.

767
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,430
Yes!

768
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:28,440
That is too much. Using me to make a bet.

769
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,470
We are just making work more fun.

770
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:36,730
We agreed the winner would go with you to see the site, and the loser would stay here and do data entry.

771
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:40,030
I'm going to get ready to go out.

772
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,280
Bye bye.

773
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,080
Boss, that...

774
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,030
Hello?

775
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:53,890
Fei, are you free later?

776
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:57,560
I'm going to check out the event site in a little while. What is it?

777
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,010
It is nothing. Have Sheng Ying come by the house later to go do something with me.

778
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,020
Sheng Ying, she...

779
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,330
Hello?

780
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:13,420
Sheng Ying is going with me to the site.

781
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:17,760
Chiao An Na needs to do something at home. Why don't you go?

782
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:20,600
Okay.

783
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,660
Voodoo

784
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,450
Welcome—

785
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:34,720
Are you here for some service today?

786
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,990
I'm here today to speak with Boss Chien

787
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:40,700
about Voodoo being a part of Royal Taipei.

788
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:45,970
Brother Chang Ching went to do a photoshoot. He should be back later.

789
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,170
Then if you have time,

790
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:54,930
please change my hairstyle to something a young lady would like.

791
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,750
I heard Yan Fei say that because I invited her and Daniel to dinner,

792
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,750
you were unhappy.

793
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,520
Did Yan Fei tell you that?

794
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,290
I only found out when she came to scold me

795
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:23,030
that you waited in line to buy Yan Fei tickets to the art exhibit.

796
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:31,420
- I'm done.
- Let me see.

797
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,840
Not bad. Thanks.

798
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:43,450
Brother Chang Ching is not back yet. You might have to wait a little longer.

799
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:47,750
Why don't we wait in his office? This way, please.

800
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,120
Oh, right. If Daniel comes to hold exhibits in Taiwan again,

801
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,950
I will arrange for him and Yan Fei to directly meet to talk

802
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:59,010
so you don't need to bother.

803
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,770
It is not a bother.

804
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:06,680
Helping Yan Fei with anything is never a bother.

805
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:11,620
This way, please.

806
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,890
♫ Always be with you ♫

807
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:44,890

♫ That day, I flipped through all the books ♫

816
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,290
I bought them.

817
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,360
This is our secret. You can't tell anyone.

818
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:49,130
♫ And perhaps my existence pertains to you ♫

819
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:52,630
♫ Can't you see? ♫

820
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:56,330
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

821
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:59,790
Yan Fei, we have something to ask you.

822
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:01,100
What is it?

823
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,610
You have to honestly tell us.

824
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:05,720
Tell us. Do you like Wang Hsuan Yang?

825
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,400
Tell us. Do you like Wang Hsuan Yang?

826
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,590
Of course not!

827
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:13,330
Little Piggy!

828
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:16,890
♫ It's just that the bargaining chip on the table is me ♫

829
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:19,110
- Why are you here?
- I want to go home.

830
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,360
- Are you hungry?
- A little.

831
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,230
Then let's go buy some fried chicken and pearl milk tea.

832
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,730
- Okay!
- Let's go.

833
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:32,290
You can't tell our secret after you eat the fried chicken.

834
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,570
Relax.

835
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:38,570
It is stashed in my stomach. I won't leak the secret.

836
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:40,370
That's great!

837
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:43,610
Then I give you all my secrets to guard.

838
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:53,970
I thought I would always be the one who knew you best, just like when we were young.

839
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:58,350
I don't know when it started,

840
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:01,720
but I am no longer the only guardian of your secrets.

841
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:05,920
♫ It's just that the bargaining chip on the table is me ♫

842
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,390
No, no. This is only a coincidence.

843
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:10,650
What are you two doing?

844
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:14,050
From now on, you and everything about you are all mine.

845
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:16,740
Mark is the child's father. The only thing I can do for him

846
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,950
is give him a path to choose.

847
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:22,260
He has the right to know about the child's existence.

848
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,170
I thought I was prepared this time.

849
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,440
Are you really all right?

850
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:29,180
If I really was hurt, what would you do?

851
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,990
- Actually, I...
- Go to the U.S. with me.

852
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:33,430
Don't you understand yet?

853
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:36,610
The current me doesn't need you.

854
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,300
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

855
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:44,070
It can't be seen nor be discovered.
