1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,330
Change can make people feel uneasy.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,030
But change is also an opportunity for you to start anew.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,610
- If you need any alterations, I can—
- Enough.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,520
What kind of rotten hairstylist did you find?

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,350
His skills are horrible. Are you messing with me?

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,210
I was just trying to stand up for you. I never thought it would do the opposite and make things worse for you.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,130
Growing up is understanding things you didn't know before.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,540
Maturing is when you know something but pretend not to.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,130
You must be the daughter of Beauty Queen's President.

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,540
Wang Hsuan Yu.

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,810
Number twenty-nine hairstylist is here to sign a long-term contract.

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,490
Do you want to see the victim? He's busy.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,340
So you are that Mr. Busy.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,460
What's the relationship between you two? How long have you two been dating?

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,280
Mom, I'm married.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,550
Our company's database shows

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,050
as long as there is a choice, the younger one will be picked.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,020
Especially over ones that have been divorced...

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,920
It doesn't matter whether she is divorced or not.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,920
At a certain moment, in someone's eyes,

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,790
you will be the one.

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,010
♫ I've written your name ♫

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,750
♫ Fated to be together for life ♫

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,070
♫ We've both been hurt a few times ♫

25
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,940
♫ And now we've grown ♫

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,700
♫ Living in this city ♫

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,870
♫ It's so easy to get lost ♫

28
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,080
♫ So blessed to be in love with each other ♫

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,450
♫ We've written the same address ♫

00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,740

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,400
♫ Is just beginning ♫

33

♫ Happy or sad, we'll face it all together from now on ♫

♫ We'll be holding hands for the rest of our lives ♫

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,290
Love Is Science?

45
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,820
Voodoo

46
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,270
How was it? You didn't explain it clearly on the phone.

47
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,500
How did you become the main hairstylist for that two-faced, manipulative Stella?

48
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,490
Don't be like this. Speak.

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,320
Welcome, Ms. Cho. You are very prompt.

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,360
I hate being late the most.

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,430
That would be wasting my and everyone else's life.

52
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,130
Is it that serious?

53
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,380
Please come in.

54
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,810
I'm going to the restroom first.

55
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,600
Then I will go prepare the VIP section.

56
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,840
Ms. Cho, I want to tell you that your new shoes aren't the only things which are shining today.

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,320
Your overall look is very detailed and beautiful.

58
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,360
You exude warmth but firmness, look dignified and creative.

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,700
Your arranged date will definitely be a success today!

60
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,670
- Don't think about making a move on other people's clients.
- Oh!

61
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,520
When did you arrive? Are you a ghost?

62
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,130
Wherever my clients are, that is where I am.

63
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,000
Is that strange?

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,330
What are you afraid of? Afraid I will eat you?

65
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,030
Even though I like guys, I still have my standards.

66
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,870
Just because you like women, does that mean you can declare your love to any girl you see?

67
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,130
Correct. Can't I?

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,790
Sheng Ying bought this lemon tart. She specifically said to save half for you.

69
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,760
It is your favorite, apples.

70
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,540
- I will clean up the kitchen first.
- Okay.

71
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,660
Did you eat everything?

72
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,020
Yes, wasn't this for me?

73
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,780
Didn't you even think of saving some for me?

74
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,890
Did you want some, too? Then why didn't you say so earlier?

75
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,900
You really have never considered my feelings!

76
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,030
What?

77
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,990
If you want some, you can just cut up more!

78
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,130
Is it that serious?

79
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,320
True. It is not that serious.

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,010
Sometimes, it is not a big deal,

81
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,990
but it will still make your heart hurt.

82
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,020
Whether they are a couple, a family, friends, or colleagues,

83
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,520
knowing that others think of you in their hearts

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,090
are the touching moments that everyone needs, right?

85
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,110
Sheng Ying, thank you for the lemon tart. It was delicious.

86
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,750
Yan Fei: Voice message 0.07 seconds

87
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,100
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu, for making you wait so long.

88
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,360
I'm going to make another call to make sure.

89
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,490
It is okay. Take your time. I can wait.

90
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,690
Hello, Cheng Hsin? Didn't I tell you to go to Mimi's house and bring her over here?

91
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,850
What do you mean she is not home? Don't give me these bad excuses.

92
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,540
Miss Mimi, did you forget that you have a date scheduled today?

93
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,810
Hello? I don't care what you do. Find Mimi!

94
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,110
Yes, hurry!

95
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,980
Sorry, Mr. Wu.

96
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,280
Something must have come up with your scheduled date today.

97
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,120
- So...
- It is okay. What I was trying to say is...

98
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,470
Would you like to have a seat and rest a bit? Maybe we can order another cup of coffee?

99
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,550
I already had three cups. If I drink anymore, then my heart will jump out!

100
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,090
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it...

101
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,680
- Please excuse me...
- I understand. I understand.

102
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,190
I'm sorry for not being considerate.

103
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,000
How about we order some herbal tea?

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,680
It can help calm you down.

105
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,520
I feel like your line of work is quite tough.

106
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,570
Please sit. Don't worry.

107
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,370
Thank you.

108
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,340
Take a look.

109
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,480
Maybe something happened to that lady on her way here?

110
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,550
Hello, Jian Hao. Go check the emergency rooms of all the major hospitals, and see if Chen Jie—

111
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,530
Not Chen Jie Mi. It is Chang Jie Mi.

112
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,630
That's right. That should be her name. Whatever, just see if there's anyone with the name Jie Mi.

113
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,290
- I think...
- That's right. Thank you.

114
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,550
Miss Cho, here you go.

115
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,280
"Taboo words you shouldn't use during dates."

116
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,240
"Never start a sentence with 'I think.' " What?

117
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,830
Right. Never do that.

118
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,010
- No, I believe that—
- No.

119
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,040
"I believe" is also one of the key taboo phrases.

120
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,800
It will give others the impression that you're domineering, and you're the only one who is right.

121
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,030
It will easily make others feel intimidated.

122
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,110
- But I—
- No. No "buts" either.

123
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,700
It would make others feel like you are refuting them.

124
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,560
Oh my gosh, what day and age is this? Why can't a woman express her opinions on a date?

125
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,270
It is sexist.

126
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,160
Excuse me? The one who shouldn't be calling others "sexists"

127
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,250
is you.

128
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,740
We aren't asking you not to express your opinions.

129
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,850
There are better phrases to use instead of these key taboo phrases.

130
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,960
For example, "perhaps" or "maybe it is because."

131
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,500
They all sound more open-ended in a dialogue than "I think" or "I believe."

132
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,990
It would give the other person a sense of equality.

133
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,440
It will build a more pleasing atmosphere

134
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,980
so your conversations can keep going.

135
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,120
- I understand.
- That's right.

136
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,190
Miss Cho, you are very smart indeed. You understand after one simple explanation.

137
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,160
"I understand," "I know," and "I agree" are the best responses during dates.

138
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,290
It gives the other person a sense of understanding,

139
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,320
and he will feel more empathetic toward you.

140
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,100
Yes, right.

141
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,620
So no matter what ridiculous crap they're saying, you need to pretentiously reply with,

142
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,420
"I understand." "I know."

143
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,370
Let me tell you—

144
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,960
What are you trying to do?

145
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,800
Dear, if you keep talking,

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,530
I'm going to use my sexy lips

147
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,650
to stop your big mouth.

148
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,990
Here.

149
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,450
Miss Cho, relax.

150
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,490
You look great today. Fighting.

151
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,400
Thank you.

152
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,340
- Hello, I am—
- I know. Wu You Fu.

153
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,030
It is just that it is such a shame.

154
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,320
Your parents wished for you to have luck and fortune ("You Fu" means "have luck"),

155
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,090
but your last name Wu negates everything ("Wu" sounds like "It doesn't exist").

156
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,440
It's okay. You can call each other by your first name. It gives a sense of closeness.

157
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,700
- Mr. Wu, this is—
- You can just call me Mimi.

158
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,360
Mimi.

159
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,490
Your coffee has already been ordered. You two can carry on with your chat.

160
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,770
I will be on the side. If you need anything, just call me.

161
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,670
It is already so late. Is it still not over?

162
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,320
Mimi just got here. She came late by three hours.

163
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,960
- Chen Hsin caught her in front of her house and brought her here.
- What?

164
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,290
Miss Cho, please come this way.

165
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,270
- We are here early. Let's just sit first.
- Okay.

166
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,410
Don't worry, the person you will be meeting is a college economics professor.

167
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,510
He will definitely understand that time is money. He won't be late.

168
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,640
Why don't we order first?

169
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,540
From the data, it says you're forty-two.

170
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,950
Isn't that a lie? You look...

171
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,990
No, no. The sun in the south is a little strong.

172
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,560
So it could be that my skin has gotten sun-damaged, making me look older.

173
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,460
But I've looked like this since I was twenty-two.

174
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,320
So is this what "in a rush to grow up" means? (One looks older than one's age, but may also be derogatory.)

175
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,710
Are you a farmer in Yunlin?

176
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,270
- Do you have your own land?
- Yes, yes.

177
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,570
How many acres? Forget it. It's not like I'll understand even if you tell me.

178
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,990
Just tell me how much it is worth.

179
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,090
To be honest, I've never calculated it.

180
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,880
Have you never calculated it?

181
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,470
Then... tell me how many houses you own. You could just count those at least.

182
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,710
Or are those "farmhouses"?

183
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,710
There are many different kinds of farmhouses.

184
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,040
Some are built like shacks and considered farmhouses.

185
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,750
There are also mansion farmhouses built by politicians.

186
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,000
Which kind do you own?

187
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,160
Miss Mimi! I'm sorry. You were slightly late today.

188
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,380
Mr. Wu still has to take care of some things

189
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,410
so he may need to leave first.

190
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,850
What is the meaning of this? I didn't want to come, and you dragged me here. Now that I'm here,

191
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,750
are you telling him to leave? Do you think I have a lot of free time?

192
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:05,190
Or is it because you accepted an old-fashioned, old farmer as your client?

193
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,200
No one wanted to go on a date with him so you guys had me fill the slot.

194
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,630
- Are you guys looking down on me?
- No.

195
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,450
Who said no one wants to go on a date with him?

196
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,370
If you want people to give you respect, you need to respect yourself first.

197
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,630
- Who are you?
- Miss Cho.

198
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,850
I don't need to tell you who I am.

199
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,290
But being late by three hours

200
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,510
is making your own time seem worthless.

201
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,530
At the same time, you are wasting other people's lives.

202
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,890
And asking someone's net worth on the first meeting,

203
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:50,030
have you considered if you are actually worth it?

204
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,570
You are all so mean! Did you set this up behind my back?

205
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,400
I didn't want to come to this date to start with.

206
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,260
Fine! Let's see how you will compensate me for this.

207
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,630
Brother Sheng.

208
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,830
Mr. Wu, I'm so sorry. I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

209
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,760
It is okay. It really is.

210
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,360
Miss Cho, your date is here. Let's go take our seats.

211
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,340
Mr. Wu, I'm really sorry about today.

212
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,090
If... if you keep apologizing, I will feel bad.

213
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,050
Let me tell you.

214
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,440
Let's forget about what happened today. It is fine.

215
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,260
You are a really great person. Don't worry.

216
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,560
I will definitely help you find a good partner next time.

217
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,500
I promise to give you someone with good character and who has class.

218
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,440
A good partner won't be interested in me.

219
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,430
Don't be discouraged.

220
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,730
I believe that you are a great partner.

221
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,230
Miss Liu, to be honest,

222
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,820
I joined your program to go on your arranged dates,

223
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,340
to have someone to show to my parents.

224
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,760
I never had any expectations

225
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,830
to find someone willing to go back to Yunlin with me and manage a farm.

226
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,800
Wow, someone willing to be with me... her whole life,

227
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,510
to be willing to care for that land until she's old... until the day she dies...

228
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,840
I'm doing all this just to give my parents hope.

229
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,870
So... I'm really sorry.

230
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,650
You guys are trying so hard for me.

231
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,910
Mr. Wu, if you keep trying, there's always hope.

232
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,400
Don't ever give up.

233
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,950
You are our member. We will try our best till the end.

234
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,310
Thank you.

235
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,930
You can go back to work. I will leave first.

236
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,630
Stay safe. If anything comes up, feel free to contact me.

237
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,760
Boss, something happened during the arranged date today.

238
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,560
Mimi is acting a little weird lately. Yes.

239
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,620
I will come back to the office to discuss this with you.

240
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,980
Family Mart

241
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,260
According to the principle of comparative interest,

242
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,180
you will find that no matter if it is the government or the individual,

243
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,760
everyone should find the best product. The investors—

244
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,770
Miss Cho. Miss Cho?

245
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,430
I think—

246
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,110
- I understand.
- Of course. We are in the same field so you definitely understand.

247
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,980
I did a lot of research,

248
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,290
regarding the effective benefits of certain functions.

249
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,240
I'm still not too sure of the comparative advantages of the bank.

250
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,340
What do you think?

251
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,250
I think—

252
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,470
the answer may be different depending on who is asking. Maybe...

253
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,510
- Maybe–
- Maybe it is because of the government's lack of efficiency.

254
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,510
They want to have development while maintaining the status quo.

255
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,170
According to "Keynesian economics" (government spending and lower taxes),

256
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,660
you can see that the function of the government is very important.

257
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,710
Otherwise, it will turn into a crooked financial advisor!

258
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,250
- I understand.
- Nowadays, Fama's hypothesis...

259
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,180
is saying that investors will never be able to beat the stock market.

260
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,660
I understand.

261
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,830
So you can see that the government

262
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,970
and the economy are closely intertwined.

263
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,130
As long as the economy is growing,

264
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,190
then the government will also continue to grow to its maximum potential.

265
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,030
So only following this method can you achieve the point where everyone can live well.

266
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,860
And everyone will have good employment opportunities.

267
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,000
Miss Cho, I'm happy to meet you today.

268
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,090
I had fun chatting with you. I believe we also have opportunities to work together.

269
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,240
- Thank you.
- Thank you. I'm happy to meet you, too.

270
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,910
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

271
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,790
Bye, Professor.

272
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,760
That was great. You did well today.

273
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,940
You've improved a lot.

274
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,950
Professor Lin isn't just a good-looking man.

275
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,580
Also, he got his Ph.D. from a prestigious Ivy League school in the United States.

276
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,070
You guys have similar interests. I think for your next date—

277
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,480
We will talk about it next time.

278
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,930
I just listened to a two-hour lecture from Professor Lin.

279
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,640
I only want to go home and lie down. Okay?

280
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,570
Okay.

281
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,540
- It is raining outside. I will get you a taxi.
- Okay.

282
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,990
This is...

283
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,810
I noticed that you were walking a little strangely.

284
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,300
It must have been your shoes rubbing against your heel.

285
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,520
Miss Cho, your taxi is here.

286
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,750
Okay, thank you.

287
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,610
- Well—
- He is Wu You Fu, forty-two years old.

288
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,010
He lives in Yunlin and is a farmer.

289
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,300
Both parents are still alive. Both of his younger sisters married a few years ago and moved to Taipei.

290
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,710
Now, only his parents and he live in their old home in Yunlin.

291
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,380
Why did you tell me that? I didn't ask.

292
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,540
Sorry, I talk too much.

293
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,660
So his matching criteria...

294
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,810
Did he also ask for people under twenty-five years old?

295
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,940
No, he didn't set any conditions so I particularly remember him.

296
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,950
- Then I...
- I'm sorry, Miss Cho.

297
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,630
You requested a master's degree or above. Mr. Wu doesn't match that.

298
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,700
Miss Cho, please get in the car. Go back and rest early.

299
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,090
- Bye.
- Bye.

300
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,820
Care-leaves Band Aids

301
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,330
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

302
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,690
- Is Jia Jia sleeping?
- Yes.

303
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,870
I have to read hundreds of stories just to put her to sleep.

304
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,550
Thank you for your hard work.

305
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,640
Hold on, Lady. What are you doing?

306
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,980
You are pregnant now. Don't do these things.

307
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,390
- It is not a big deal.
- Let me do it.

308
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm only pregnant, not sick.

309
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,320
You don't need to spoil me.

310
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,530
You're the pregnant one, not me. So let me do the work, and you can take a seat.

311
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,200
- Sit.
- Fine.

312
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,410
- What are you laughing about?
- I was just thinking...

313
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,990
If such a beautiful girl like Yan Fei liked you before,

314
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,850
that means my husband must have been very handsome before.

315
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,860
Of course. I was a big deal!

316
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,700
I was on the basketball team at that time.

317
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,460
When I did a jump shot, even if the ball didn't go in,

318
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,690
girls still went crazy for me and shouted my name, "Wang Hsuan Yang, Wang Hsuan Yang!"

319
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,090
It was no big deal when I didn't win, but when I did,

320
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,600
then I got so many drinks, towels, and gifts!

321
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,450
I remember once I even shared the gifts with my teammates.

322
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,780
But the one I dated was

323
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,700
the leader of the school's cheering team.

324
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,750
She was the campus belle, looked amazing.

325
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,850
Almost no girls dared to steal me from her.

326
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,110
I missed so many chances.

327
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,690
So you keep saying...

328
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,740
Okay, Honey.

329
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,560
I'm just joking.

330
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,490
No matter how pretty she was, she is not as pretty as you.

331
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,450
Sure.

332
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,840
Honey...

333
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,790
What?

334
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,460
Thank you.

335
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,850
What's wrong with you?

336
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,960
I'm just thinking...

337
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,970
When you first met me, it was the lowest point of my life.

338
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,980
My parents had an accident and passed away early.

339
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,260
So only Hsuan Yu and I were left in our family.

340
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:50,600
I had to make sure that my little brother wouldn't be hungry and get an education.

341
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,340
So I dropped out of school and went to work.

342
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,650
But back then, in the middle of the night,

343
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,610
when I was home alone, I would think...

344
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,560
"God,"

345
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,490
"why I am so unlucky?"

346
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,240
"I am the unluckiest person in the world."

347
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,950
It just happened that you met me during that time.

348
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,200
If you didn't encourage me,

349
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,650
I doubt if I would own this restaurant.

350
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,100
I wouldn't have a family and children.

351
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,220
Honey, sometimes I just think...

352
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,330
Do you feel like you missed out?

353
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,860
If you didn't meet me,

354
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,280
your life may have followed a different path.

355
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,570
You may have met some pretty, rich girls

356
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,190
or girls just like Yan Fei.

357
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,500
It sounds like I missed out, doesn't it?

358
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,040
But I don't have any regrets.

359
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,400
There may be many regrettable things, but I don't have any regrets.

360
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,210
Imaginary life sounds beautiful,

361
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,610
but to have the life we have right now...

362
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,150
It is a life we can hold on to.

363
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,080
That is truly real.

364
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,930
Yes. Something that we can hold with our hands

365
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,130
is what's real.

366
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,260
Let's not arrange any dates for Mimi. Let me talk with her first.

367
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,450
Got it. I am thinking the same.

368
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,560
You must be tired. Go home early and get some rest.

369
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,690
- Then what about you?
- No worries!

370
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,740
The Queen is letting you off early. You should just be grateful.

371
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,010
Yes, Ma'am. Thank you so much, My Queen. I'm taking my leave now.

372
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,940
You may go.

373
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,250
Mimi actually passed our profile review.

374
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,450
Love Is Science

375
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,630
How could this happen?

376
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,300
What's up? Are you coming back because you don't want to leave work?

377
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,730
Little Piggy?

378
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,520
You sound a bit disappointed.

379
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,660
I came to drop off the contract for my boss.

380
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,360
Someone was heading out so I let myself in.

381
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,950
Am I bothering you because it is getting late?

382
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,630
You came at just the right time.

383
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,120
Love Is Science

384
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,080
It is ready.

385
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,400
You're not charging me salon rates, are you?

386
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,270
I willingly offer my services. It is free.

387
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,180
It is really nice to have a stylist brother.

388
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,880
Bring it on.

389
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,080
So comfortable, I think...

390
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,820
I think my body and soul both relaxed.

391
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,720
You're exaggerating, aren't you?

392
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,700
Not at all.

393
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,170
After you became my stylist, I don't take many headache pills anymore.

394
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,340
I even forgot to refill my medicine.

395
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,540
I only noticed I'm out when I needed it earlier.

396
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,800
Luckily you came. Otherwise, I wouldn't even know where to get refills at this hour.

397
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,120
Looks like you take medication like you eat meals.

398
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,750
Don't take so many pills. It's hard for your body to process them.

399
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,360
- Head hurts... It hurts....

400
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,580
- Where?
- Here.

401
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,330
You probably get headaches because you're working too much.

402
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,150
Also, you don't exercise so your body is unhealthy.

403
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,670
What?

404
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,440
Don't judge me by my appearance.

405
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,330
I work out frequently.

406
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,170
Really?

407
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,690
I ride a bike on holidays.

408
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,380
How about you?

409
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,550
I just don't like riding a bike.

410
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,160
Then... Jogging?

411
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,810
My knees hurt.

412
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,780
- Go hiking?
- The sunshine is too strong.

413
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,190
Swimming?

414
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,960
Don't you know I hate washing my hair?

415
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,590
So what exactly do you do?

416
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,220
Fitness center, Pilates.

417
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,950
No need to go outdoors and suffer from the elements. Isn't that great?

418
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,750
Please. It doesn't count as exercising if you're indoors and don't get any sun.

419
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,830
Oh, please. How old are you?

420
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,420
Working out with equipment is the most effective method.

421
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,150
How could you be just as old-fashioned as my mom?

422
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,460
Wow, I think there are very few people

423
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,950
who can be as progressive as your mom.

424
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,790
That's true.

425
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:25,460
Let's find a day you can go with me for indoor workouts.

426
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,320
No need to be in the sun, but I guarantee you'll be sweating profusely. How is that?

427
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,950
I think you will like it.

428
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,880
Okay, but in exchange, you have to go biking with me just once.

429
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,740
That's fair. Sunlight also cures many illnesses.

430
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,820
We will see.

431
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,110
All right, thank you. I feel much better.

432
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,200
Very comfortable.

433
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,080
Okay, it is late now. Let me take you home.

434
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,830
No worries, I still have work to do. You go ahead.

435
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,670
I will wait for you.

436
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,590
It is really late. A girl shouldn't go home alone.

437
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,980
Girls shouldn't go home alone?

438
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,050
Sir, you are too young to have such old-fashioned thoughts.

439
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:18,220
I go home by myself every day.

440
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,230
Miss Cho.

441
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,700
So you asked to meet me here today because...

442
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,340
I want to add Wu You Fu to my list of arranged dating partners.

443
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,030
- But right now he's not—
- I know he doesn't meet my criteria.

444
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,750
But please make the arrangements for me.

445
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,300
Miss Cho, if you want to get married within three months,

446
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,640
you need to be efficient in your matches.

447
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,070
Based on our big data analysis,

448
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,720
your compatibility with Mr. Wu is very low.

449
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,630
Your overlap in interests is zero.

450
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,850
Of course, Mr. Wu is a great guy,

451
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,130
but... would you like to give this some more thought, please?

452
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,690
- I really suggest...
- I am full. I must get back to work.

453
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,330
I look forward to the date you will set up for me with Mr. Wu.

454
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,410
- Why? Where is Mimi?
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

455
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,400
- I want to see her right now! Or we will all die together!
- Mr. Lu!

456
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,830
Tell me now! Where is Mimi? Otherwise, we will all die!

457
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,690
Mr. Lu, calm down! We are looking for her right now.

458
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,170
Yes, she's probably on her way right now. Why don't you take a seat, have some water,

459
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,230
- and calm down?
- Don't lie to me anymore!

460
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,490
Stop lying to me! Tell me her house—

461
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,930
- Tell me! Please, tell me!
- Boss! Boss!

462
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,770
- Did you hide her? Tell me where she is now!
- Mr. Lu.

463
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,230
Tell me what happened, okay?

464
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:41,100
- Then I can help you.
- Mimi... Mimi... she...

465
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,930
What's wrong with Mimi?

466
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:47,530
She wanted to date me with the intent of marriage. But she's been hurt by other men before.

467
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,330
She's very insecure.

468
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:54,140
She wanted to buy a house and asked if I could pay for her down payment. I figured she was insecure so I...

469
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,270
So you paid for it?

470
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,830
Was the house under her name?

471
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:05,650
It was all of my life savings! She told me she didn't want my money.

472
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,750
She didn't want to rely on others so I thought she was kind.

473
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,780
- So because of this, you gave all of your savings to her?
- Yes!

474
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,630
After she got the money, she disappeared. I can't find her anywhere. Do you guys know where she is?

475
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,320
Tell me where she is! Was it you who hid her? Was it you?

476
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,300
- Tell her to come out now! Or we will all die together!
- Sir, please listen to me.

477
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,340
All of our clients go through a rigorous selection process. We don't have scammers.

478
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,370
So I think Mimi didn't trick you. She probably got your money

479
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,950
and feels bad about it.

480
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,400
She feels bad. Therefore she is probably thinking of a way to repay you right now!

481
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,040
Yes! Correct.

482
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,430
Once women fall in love, they're willing to give their all. But right now, you're the one giving your all.

483
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,950
So she feels bad. She just needs some time to calm down and think about the future of the relationship.

484
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,970
Right! That must be it. So stop assuming the worst.

485
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,540
We will help you find her, okay?

486
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,800
- Really?
- Really!

487
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,300
- Don't move!
- Don't do anything rash!

488
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,430
- Police!
- Don't come over here! Why did you lie to me? Why?

491
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,660
Once women fall in love, they're willing to give their all. But right now, you're the one giving your all.

492
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,290
So she feels bad. She just needs some time to calm down and think about the future of the relationship.

493
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,330
Right! That must be it. So stop assuming the worst.

494
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,910
We will help you find her, okay?

495
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,920
- Really?
- Really!

496
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,560
- Don't move!
- Don't do anything rash!

497
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,500
- Police!
- Don't come over! Why did you lie to me? Why?

498
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,370
- Don't come over! You lied to me! Why?
- Put down your weapon!

499
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:00,120
Why?

500
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:09,010
Love Is Science Marriage Agency's contract may be useless.

501
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,200
Boss, what do you mean by that?

502
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,970
The news just reported that a well-known marriage agency's

503
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,800
male client was allegedly scammed.

504
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,770
In his anger, he poured an unknown liquid towards the owner, Ms. Yan.

505
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,250
An unknown liquid? The owner, Ms. Yan?

506
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,010
The news blurred the video, but it was obvious that it was Yan Fei.

507
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:31,520
Hey, what are you doing? It's work time right now. Where are you going?

508
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,150
Indeed, you're acting strange.

509
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,350
- Hey, Hsuan Yu!
- We're here!

510
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,220
Hsuan Yu is so considerate.

511
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,130
He knew we were coming so he stood by the door to wait for us.

512
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,950
I'd like to have a black coffee today.

513
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,840
Hsuan Yu, hurry and bring our clients to the VIP room.

514
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,860
- Boss, I—
- Don't worry. This news report came out.

515
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,560
Yan Fei was only sprayed with water.
Famous marriage agency owner allegedly splashed with unknown liquid. Police: It's water. She's fine.

516
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,230
Sisters, please come inside.

517
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,900
Okay.

518
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,940
Who was it?

519
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,060
Who was the person who called the police and let them take our client away?

520
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,220
She is my subordinate, but I won't say who it is.

521
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,020
Because I don't think calling the police is wrong.

522
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,830
Boss, you know what the circumstances were like. Thankfully it was only bottled water.

523
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,370
What if it had been sulfuric acid?

524
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,240
- Then—
- Of course, the customer is always right.

525
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,180
But is everyone's safety less important than a hysterical client?

526
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,150
How would Boss think that workers' safety isn't important?

527
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,300
You saw for yourself. She blocked the water that Mr. Lu tried to pour on me.

528
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,730
If the bottle really would have contained sulfuric acid,

529
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,740
then Boss would have sacrificed herself for her workers.

530
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,990
Boss shouldn't be sacrificing herself in the first place. That's why I called the police!

531
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,460
But Boss was about to convince Mr. Lu.

532
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,560
If it hadn't been for the police rushing in, the situation could have been resolved peacefully.

533
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,530
But now we've got the police involved, and we're on the news.

534
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,390
Now everyone knows a male client of Love Is Science was scammed.

535
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,540
How can we solve this matter?

536
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,530
If the boss really wants to pinpoint the blame, then I will take responsibility for it.

537
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,910
But this situation could have been resolved in a much better way!

538
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,840
Boss blocking it for you isn't the best solution!

539
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,270
No matter if it's the boss or a worker, safety should be the most important—

540
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,640
Are you done talking?

541
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,090
Dealing with the consequences is the most important thing right now!

542
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,790
I've already asked our company's law department to assist Mr. Lu at the police station.

543
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:52,890
He didn't cause any actual harm so he should be out on bail soon.

544
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,330
What about Mimi's situation?

545
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:02,080
She still hasn't answered the calls. I will personally go out to find her.

546
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,580
How about the male clients she has been matched with?

547
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,800
I checked them all. She asked each of them for money.

548
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,320
From around ten thousand to several hundred thousand...

549
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,220
Mr. Lu gave the most, two million.

550
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,950
There's definitely a loophole somewhere for this to happen.

551
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,500
Our selection process is very complete.

552
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,290
If Mimi joined with the intent of scamming, there's no way for her to pass the selection process.

553
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,980
With such a rigorous selection process

554
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,280
and a rejection rate of 35%, she was still able to slip through.

555
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,590
We need to figure out how she slipped her way through.

556
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:40,490
If we don't fix this loophole, we might as well close our company.

557
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:09,010
Do you know what the difference is between growing up and maturing?

558
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,540
Growing up means knowing things you didn't know before.

559
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,750
Maturing is knowing something, yet pretending you don't.

560
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,090
Miss.

561
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,710
Oh, my goodness! Come here.

562
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,880
Spin around twice to let me see if anything happened to you!

563
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,190
I'm fine. Nothing is damaged.

564
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,590
Is this really the time for you to make jokes?

565
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,900
I just saw the news. I was so scared!

566
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,350
There are a lot of bad marriage agencies out there

567
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,640
that utilize pretty, young girls.

568
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,780
If the male client doesn't find an ideal marriage partner,
[Famous Marriage Agency Allegedly Scamming Clients]

569
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,820
they will use these pretty girls to hold onto the male clients.

570
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:32,190
It will give them hope and they can keep collecting high-priced membership fees!

571
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,630
How dare she say that! Her company is more likely to do that!

572
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,470
What's even worse,

573
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:41,250
these male and female clients already paid high fees!

574
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,960
Yet they use these pretty young things to scam them!

575
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,800
So unmarried men and women looking to join marriage agencies

576
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,070
should be extremely careful!

577
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,770
All right, all right. Don't be angry.

578
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:01,090
Your levels are different.

579
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,990
Here, have some lemon water.

580
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,710
Thank goodness it was just water today.

581
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,670
- What if one day—
- There won't be a next time.

582
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,120
Okay.

583
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,090
Okay, I will say no more.

584
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,120
Why are you displaying such a face?

585
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:29,390
Why is your complexion this bad? Your dark circles, your pores—

586
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,700
Come to Beauty Queen tomorrow. We're going to give you some treatment.

587
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,640
What if Yung Tai came back for you?

588
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,950
How many times do I have to tell you?

589
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,870
We're divorced!

590
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,730
If you want us to make up, you go make up with him.

591
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,650
What are you saying?

592
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,410
If you really are done with Yung Tai, then why?

593
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:53,130
Why is this ring still on your finger? Let me take it off for you.

594
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,850
I don't take it off because of work.

595
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,150
I don't understand at all.

596
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,950
Why do you need to wear a wedding ring at work?

597
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,910
Can't you be a matchmaker if you are single?

598
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,150
Your wedding ring is like a chastity belt,

599
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:14,720
tying you and your heart into a knot.

600
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,720
What if someone actually likes you but sees you wearing your wedding ring?

601
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,260
He would just keep his distance from you.

602
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,490
Mom, whether I take the ring off or not is my choice.

603
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,770
Whether I need another relationship or not, that's my decision.

604
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,890
I just came to show you I'm fine.

605
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,140
Hey!

606
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,640
Look at our daughter.

607
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,250
Her life isn't as good as mine.

608
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,980
I married you to have many years of happiness.

609
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:11,260
I really wish that she can think things through soon

610
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,410
so she will have no regrets.

611
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,590
This is unacceptable! Give us a refund!
Love Is Science Marriage Agency

612
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,000
Refund us, you scammers

613
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,030
You charged such a high fee, and it was all a scam!

614
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,190
That's right! You use young girls as a tactic.

615
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,620
How vile! Give us a refund!

616
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:37,200
Everyone, please calm down.

617
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,580
There's a lot of fake news going on. Please don't believe it.

618
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,480
Love is Science would never scam you guys.

619
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,180
I don't believe a word you say.

620
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,870
Just give us a refund!

621
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:50,770
Give us back our money! Give us back our money!

622
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,130
Okay, I will refund all of you.

625
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,090
Refund us, you scammers!

626
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,090
You charged such a high fee, and it was all a scam!

627
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:19,300
That's right! You use young girls as a tactic.

628
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,720
How vile! Give us a refund!

629
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,300
Everyone, please calm down.

630
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,710
There's a lot of fake news going on. Please don't believe it.

631
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,510
Love is Science would never scam you guys.

632
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,210
I don't believe a word you say.

633
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,950
Just give us a refund!

634
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,920
Give us back our money! Give us back our money!

635
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,190
Okay, I will refund all of you.

636
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:47,640
For the past eight years, Love is Science has been operating honestly.

637
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,490
We never had fake members or members who failed to get a match.

638
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:55,830
We will keep trying. For those who want to get married, I believe, and I dare to say that

639
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,080
this is your best choice!

640
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,240
Then what about yesterday?

641
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,670
We are still investigating what happened yesterday.

642
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,730
But we won't do what other companies do, allowing women to join for free.

643
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,150
Our membership approval process is a lot more strict.

644
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,650
So there's no possible way for a scam to happen.

645
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,650
You just talk the talk.

646
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,600
Mr. Chao, if you have your suspicions and refuse to believe us,

647
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,720
you can apply for a refund right now, and we will immediately give you a full refund.

648
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,390
But if you are still willing to trust your decision to join us,

649
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:34,100
then please give us a little more time. We will find the truth and give you an explanation.

650
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:46,170
Evergreen Foot Spa

651
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,230
Oh. Right.

652
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,920
I will now massage your shoulder and neck area.

653
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,880
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

654
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,360
You scared me.

655
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:27,280
I didn't lie to anyone. I took the money and used it as down payment for a house.

656
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,740
Then why didn't you pick up when Mr. Lu called?

657
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,220
He's so annoying!

658
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,700
After he gave me the money, he called me twenty times an hour.

659
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,160
Who could handle that? It's not normal.

660
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,270
You found him annoying. But you didn't think so when you were accepting his money.

661
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:48,660
Hey, he's the one who wanted to give me the NT$2,000,000 ($70,755 U.S.)

662
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,510
Since he wants to marry me, I don't think NT$2,000,000 as a bride price is bad.

663
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,680
Have you decided to marry Mr. Lu?

664
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,070
Not yet. He's not the best choice.

665
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:01,460
Then how can you take NT$2,000,000 as a bride price?

666
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,110
You received a whole lot of bride prices! How many people are you trying to marry?

667
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:09,820
Wait a minute. You guys are making it sound like it's my fault.

668
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:15,060
All these men are pursuing me. Is there something wrong with getting money from men who want to be with me?

669
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,620
- You should—
- That's how it's supposed to be.

670
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,320
They are all potential partners to me.

671
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,750
I will pick out the best of them all.

672
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,070
Besides, the chosen one eventually has to support my family, and help me pay back the other men anyway.

673
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,610
- There shouldn't be a problem there.
- Right.

674
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,180
Okay. I admit

675
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,610
I didn't contact them recently, because I wanted to test...

676
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,360
their sincerity.

677
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,740
How can she have such twisted values?

678
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,280
Hearing this makes my fists hard.

679
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,290
If she wasn't a woman, I would have punched her already!

680
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,220
Okay. I have no opinions on your view of money.

681
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,390
These things are consensual.

682
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:05,030
From the company's perspective, we can't judge your private matters.

683
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:09,270
But the emphasis is on "consensual."

684
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,840
You have a duty to clear things up with Mr. Lu and others.

685
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,550
- Clear things up?
- Yes, clear things up.

686
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,460
Love Is Science

687
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,790
How much longer do I have to wait?

688
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,350
They will be here soon.

689
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:39,340
Clear things up with them.

690
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:42,690
You guys...

691
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,940
I...

692
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,450
Mimi, I already talked it out with them.

693
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,260
I gave you the most money so you should marry me.

694
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,630
- That's not the point. Tell me how much you want—
- No!

695
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,710
- I have money. I can give it to you.
- No. Didn't we already agree on that?

696
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:00,430
- I brought my bank account book.
- I have money. We all have money.

697
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,130
- I already paid her down payment.
- Who says so?
- She already said yes to me.

698
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:06,380
Let me tell you today, even if she...

699
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,930
I assure you... Hey, don't interrupt me!

700
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:12,020
Don't listen to them.

701
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:16,500
Am I watching a live broadcast of "Strange Things of the World" (Japanese TV show)?

702
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,900
This is why I don't like men.

703
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,750
They ask for it.

704
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:26,840
If Mimi had said from the start that she wanted an ATM, it would have been a lot easier.

705
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,600
There are many men who would be proud to be an ATM.

706
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,560
What should we do now?

707
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,360
This is all we can do. Let them figure it out.

708
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,850
We can't keep Mimi as a member anymore.

709
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,680
Let's terminate the contract.

710
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,470
I'm tired. I'm going home to take a rest.

711
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,160
You guys finish things up here.

712
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,480
You have money for a house, yet you didn't give it to her. But let me tell you...

713
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,950
If you marry me, you don't need these guys.

714
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,190
I didn't use any of my money. I will give it all to her!

715
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,300
- I already paid two million.
- About the house, the next step will be...

716
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,240
This time it's really a heavy loss for our company.

717
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,170
With all the news going around and Miss Tan's interview,

718
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:09,100
our reputation has been severely damaged.

719
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,150
There's definitely going to be more problems later.

720
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,100
All the work I did in the first half of the year was wasted.

721
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,060
So what?

722
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:21,860
The company's image that we worked so hard to establish won't be destroyed just because of this issue.

723
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,960
Or do you get defeated this easily?

724
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,900
That's not the Yan Fei I know. The Yan Fei I know is amazing!

725
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,630
This has been the biggest problem that has happened to us since we opened.

726
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:37,240
Although I have to act very strong in front of Ou Wen and Sheng Ying,

727
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,400
I'm actually so sad that I don't even know what to say.

728
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,190
See? That's why I have been telling you to go on dates.

729
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,410
If you listened to me, you could have a boyfriend right now who can hug and comfort you.

730
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,640
I really do want a hug and a cuddle right now.

731
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,110
Joanna, when are you coming back? Can we go drinking again?

732
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,340
Have you finally realized how important I am now?

733
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,790
You miss me, right? But I have to stay in Europe for a few more days.

734
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,810
I want to go on dates first when I get back.

735
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,370
Okay?

736
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,550
Are you angry?

737
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,910
Fei?

738
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:20,010
Fei?

739
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,160
Little Piggy?

740
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,620
What are you doing here at this time?

741
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:45,870
I have the day off today. I came out for a walk and coincidentally passed by here.

742
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,900
You passed by? What type of "passing by" do you mean?

743
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:55,170
Is it normal people passing by or the "passing by" when I brought you midnight snacks?

744
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:02,510
Okay. The truth is I came to see if I would be able to meet you.

745
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:06,230
I wanted to see if you were okay or not.

746
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,770
Me? I will definitely feel better soon.

747
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,460
Or do you want to go grab coffee?

748
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:24,820
I would love to, but I have to go somewhere later.

749
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,360
Or how about...

750
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,130
you come along with me?

751
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:36,180
♫ Always be with you ♫

752
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,010
♫ Always be with you ♫

753
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,490
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

754
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,970
Hey, Hsiao Yu!

755
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,550
- You're here?
- Long time no see!

756
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:01,740
You came a bit late today.

757
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,710
Yes, I know. Why don't you take a seat over there and wait for me?

758
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,450
Come take a seat here.

759
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,000
Here we go!

760
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,820
Is this okay?

761
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,990
Today I'll give you a handsome haircut as usual.

762
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,390
When I started being an apprentice,

763
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:44,900
I got yelled at every day. Once I was putting the perm-setting solution on a customer's hair.

764
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:50,880
But her hair was too fragile. The hair where I had put the perm solution broke off.

765
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,110
I got yelled at very badly by my boss. I wanted to die.

766
00:55:56,110 --> 00:56:00,780
Afterward, I was even thrown out. At that time I felt as if the entire world

767
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,660
was like that customer's hair,

768
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,340
broken and collapsing.

769
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,760
What are you kids doing?

770
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:38,650
Sir, is it okay if I help you clean the hair where the gum was placed?

771
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,420
Okay.

772
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:58,030
Sir, since I already cut a part off, it won't look good with a hole there.

773
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,060
Why don't I give you a new hairstyle instead?

774
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:09,650
It will be free! But I'm still in training so I'll apologize ahead of time.

775
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,710
Are you satisfied?

776
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,990
Young man!

777
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,050
Thank you so much!

778
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:02,650
This weekend is my daughter's wedding.

779
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:09,480
My daughter didn't even invite me to attend her wedding.

780
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,890
The way that I look now, I don't have the courage to go see her.

781
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:21,190
But now that you've helped clean me up a bit,

782
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:27,780
I'll be able to watch her from afar, across the street from the wedding.

783
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,070
And I won't be told to leave the area.

784
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:34,460
Thank you!

785
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:38,160
After that time, I made an agreement with the community.

786
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,800
I help them cut their hair once every month because I want to help more people.

787
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,510
So handsome!

788
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,270
Don't you look handsome?

789
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,330
Okay, you're done!

790
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,160
Hsiao Bao, are you feeling happy today?

791
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,280
I'm feeling happy!

792
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,850
Thank you! Sorry for troubling you again today.

793
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:20,000
Don't be sorry! Next time I'll give you a better haircut.

794
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,340
Okay, thank you again! Bye bye.

795
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,280
Bye bye.

796
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,360
Ms. Chen is a single mother.

797
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:34,880
Before, she was the one who used to cut Hsiao Bao's hair.

798
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,660
However, once Hsiao Bao's classmates made fun of his haircut. They said it looked like a dog chewed it.

799
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,580
So Hsiao Bao wouldn't go to school.

800
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:45,720
But after I cut his hair, he was no longer sad.

801
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,370
- What else?
- There's also...

802
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:54,060
that one time when I cut a homeless person's hair.

803
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,930
After I gave him a haircut, he was able to get a decent interview and was eventually hired as an apartment lobby administrator.

804
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,070
So he didn't have to continue being homeless.

805
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:06,410
There's also the old lady who lives alone. I helped her get rid of her hair lice.

806
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:10,670
Look at you, Wang Hsuan Yu!

807
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,350
Very impressive!

808
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:16,970
Actually, I'm not that amazing.

809
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:22,960
After cutting for a while, I've realized that I'm not the one helping them. Instead, they are the ones helping me.

810
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,630
What do you mean?

811
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:33,600
Because of them, I realized that I'm not so useless after all.

812
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:39,870
As long as I'm still holding scissors, no matter how many times I've failed, I will be able to overcome it all.

813
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:43,540
As long as I don't give up, I can start all over again.

814
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,960
You, too.

815
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,430
♫ Always be with you ♫

816
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:08,360
♫ We'll support each other from now on ♫
♫ I promise, your smile... ♫

817
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,700
Look at you, Wang Hsuan Yu!

818
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,270
Very impressive!

819
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,550
Actually, I'm not that amazing.

820
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:23,960
After cutting for a while, I've realized that I'm not the one helping them. Instead, they are the ones helping me.

821
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,590
What do you mean?

822
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:34,620
Because of them, I realized that I'm not so useless after all.

823
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:40,940
As long as I'm still holding scissors, no matter how many times I've failed, I will be able to overcome it all.

824
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,620
As long as I don't give up, I can start all over again.

825
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,980
You, too.

826
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,240
Mr. Chen!

827
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,290
I was waiting so long for you.

828
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:05,090
He was the one I mentioned earlier, who got a job as an administrator after I gave him a haircut.

829
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:10,240
Although he has an income now, he still comes for his haircuts. He always insists on giving me NT$100 ($4 U.S.)

830
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,410
Come and sit here!

831
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:17,920
You can sit down.

832
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,440
How's work these days?

833
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,670
Work has been great. Thanks to you!

834
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,460
Then I shall give you a handsome cut again.

835
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:40,940
As long as I don't give up, I can start all over again.

836
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,820
Little Piggy.

837
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,380
Thank you!

838
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,170
Why are you thanking me?

839
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:59,780
I just suddenly wanted to thank you.

840
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,370
I see.

841
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,670
Where's your husband?

842
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:19,680
What I mean is... didn't he say anything yet when this big thing happened?

843
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:27,420
Nothing major happened to me though. I'm fine. What does he need to say to me?

844
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:31,410
Well, he did text me.

845
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,620
- Is that it?
- That's it.

846
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,690
What else?

847
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:40,630
Okay. I guess that's your way of getting along.

848
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:46,290
I've never been married so I likely don't know much. But as long as you're fine, then it's okay with me.

849
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:51,440
Don't worry! I'm really okay. Hurry and go home now.

850
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,540
All right.

851
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,160
Bye bye.

852
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:58,600
Bye bye.

853
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,940
No matter what happens, you must eat well every day.

854
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:49,620
The sky won't fall on you because you have many people who love you and will support you.

855
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,960
If you want someone to talk to, I'm always here.

856
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:10,160
If you want to eat noodles, come to my brother's restaurant. We can also grab a drink.

857
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:17,180
How many times did he "coincidentally" pass by my house?

858
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,600
As long as you don't give up,

859
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,830
you can start all over again.

860
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,860
Your wedding ring is like a chastity belt,

861
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:41,060
tying you and your heart into a knot.

862
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:46,050
What if someone actually likes you but sees you wearing your wedding ring?

863
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,500
He would just keep his distance from you.

864
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:07,040
[Ju Yueh Noodle...]

865
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,080
At least I can't keep lying to Hsuan Yu.

866
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:42,800
Yan Fei, what brings you here?

867
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,090
I have something to tell Hsuan Yu.

868
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:47,830
What's wrong?

869
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,590
You came just at the right time.

870
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:53,110
Hsuan Yu's girlfriend just came back from her business trip in Europe. We're welcoming her back.

871
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,500
Come join us for dinner.

872
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,570
Chin Lan, you came at the right time. Let me introduce you guys.

873
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:13,340
She is my high school friend, Yan Fei. This is Chin Lan, Hsuan Yu's girlfriend.

874
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,440
Hi, nice to meet you.

875
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,060
Hi.

876
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,450
Didn't you just say you had something to tell me? What is it?

877
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:32,400
Piggy's Love Diary

878
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:45,100
What is it about the cheerleading captain that's better than me?

879
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,620
She's just a little bit prettier than me. That's it.

880
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:51,010
No! You are much prettier than her!

881
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,450
Really?

882
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:56,570
Of course! My brother is definitely blind.

883
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:59,800
You're the prettiest in your entire school.

884
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:04,690
Why should I believe your words?

885
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:08,570
You're only ten years old. What do you even understand?

886
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,030
My teacher has taught us to never lie. I'm telling the truth!

887
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:27,360
Thank you anyway, Little Piggy.

888
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:36,730
Will you still come see me in the future?

889
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,810
I said the truth though.

890
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:48,030
Why don't you believe me?

891

910
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:07,120

01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,920

912

We won't be able to have a future together.

923
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:09,780
Are you giving me random excuses because you don't want to go on an arranged date with me?

924
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:13,440
My boss said that I have everything except for a personal style.

925
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,060
Your customers come back to you because they can feel you are taking good care of them,

926
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,120
including me.

927
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,040

Cheers!

01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:25,940
A love letter with a confession?

930
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:29,220
- Are there any keywords in the love letter?
- Oh—

01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,780
A certain kind of love can only be hidden in the dark.

933
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,500
It can't be seen nor be discovered.

♫ Finding excitement in an absurd relationship ♫

936
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:58,120
♫ My melancholy and my monochromatic world ♫

937
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:03,690
♫  Have become the most laughable accessories  ♫

938
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:09,310
♫ In the end, you're so far away ♫

939
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:15,010
♫ You became a pointless, transparent existence ♫

940
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:21,080
♫ I thought it was only because I came late ♫

941
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:28,960
♫ Turned out I was the only one playing the game ♫

♫ Fantasize about a romantic love ♫

944
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:46,750
♫ While lonely, thinking of someone ♫

945
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:52,020
♫ He will come and warm you up ♫

946
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:57,750
♫ I think what you sometime remembered ♫

947
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:03,450
♫ Is for "just in case" ♫

948
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:08,730
♫ To treat the hug you give me ♫

949
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:16,670
♫ As something to bring you warmth ♫
