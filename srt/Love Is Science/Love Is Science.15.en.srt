1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,510
If the person I like

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,230
is not quite the same as you've imagined...

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,630
No, she is exactly the same as we imagined.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,690
I want this child to safely come into the world.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,400
This might be my only chance

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,200
to have a child who belongs to the person I like.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,140
I'm pregnant. It is yours.

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,600
Mine?

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,330
Why didn't you come?

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,070
I wanted to make you feel at ease. I wanted you to see my seriousness.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,800
I'm already prepared to face the entire world. What about you?

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,100
It is not that I don't dare to face it.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,580
Between the two of us, you are the coward.

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,460
I don't like it when you go see Huo Yung Tai.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,540
I don't want him to know that I care.

16
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,410
I'm sorry. Don't be angry anymore, okay?

17
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,960
I think I forgot to say this earlier.

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,900
I also invited a mysterious guest of honor.

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,540
I know that I'm late by many years,

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,490
but as long as you give me a bit more time,

21
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,930
I can definitely try to understand you

22
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,180
and become your strongest support.

23
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,450
I already have the strongest support.

24
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,160
I wish you will have an even better future

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,670
without me.

26
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,350
The present me doesn't need you.

27
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,520
Goodbye, Huo Yung Tai.

28
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,470
Yan Fei, you treat Hsuan Yu so well.

29
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,540
Those who don't know might think...

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,480
you two are biological siblings.

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,070
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

55
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,190
Menu

56
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,590
Be careful.

57
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,270
Do all pregnant women scare people like this all the time?

58
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,390
That...

59
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,540
Is being pregnant always like this?

60
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,070
There are many stages in pregnancy.

61
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,600
Every stage feels different.

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,760
Then... what if it is the stage of just becoming pregnant?

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,240
Just becoming pregnant?

64
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,270
That is the most painful.

65
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,250
Poor appetite, no energy,

66
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,180
and gastroesophageal reflux.

67
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,160
If there is also morning sickness,

68
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,020
it is possible for one to want to die.

69
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,120
What is wrong?

70
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,250
These are the pains of a woman having a baby.

71
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,120
You men wouldn't understand.

72
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,440
Are you looking for Hsuan Yu? He is upstairs. Go up on your own.

73
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,970
Are you home yet?

74
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,060
I...

75
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,750
I'm sorry. Because my brother was there...

76
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,160
What are you doing?

77
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,810
Nothing much.

78
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,710
What is going on?

79
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,980
I went to see someone just now.

80
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,450
Who?

81
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,540
It is rare for your face to look so serious.

82
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,130
Chiao An Na.

83
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,370
Honey, did you forget your keys?

84
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,820
Goodbye, lovely caffeine.

85
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,700
If you want to say something, just say it.

86
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,110
Don't you know that a woman's youth doesn't wait for anyone?

87
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,340
I...

88
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,590
want to verify just a little bit.

89
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,990
Is he really mine?

90
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,750
I calculated it.

91
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,770
In the period of time when I hit the jackpot (got pregnant), you were my only partner.

92
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,490
Is that clear enough?

93
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,990
If there isn't anything else, you can go back.

94
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,590
I will take responsibility.

95
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,930
Wait! Wh-What are you doing? Don't bring that out!

96
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,440
I just told you that I'm pregnant.

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,820
I have no intentions of marrying you, though.

98
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,230
I was just a bit nervous

99
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,990
and wanted to wipe my sweat.

100
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,710
Besides, the person I like now is Ou Wen.

101
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,550
How could I marry you?

102
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,590
All right.

103
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,020
Then may I ask

104
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,530
how do you plan to take responsibility?

105
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,380
As a man,

106
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,660
I can't let a child be born without a father.

107
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,740
Also,

108
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,320
I will be responsible for expenses of childbirth.

109
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,420
Okay. Then...

110
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,290
Daddy.

111
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,010
Do you think you look like you're prepared?

112
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,010
If you are not ready, why boast?

113
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,190
Well, how am I supposed to prepare?

114
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,500
This is a very sudden matter to begin with.

115
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,040
If we had stayed together until now,

116
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,220
then I probably could accept it more easily,

117
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,940
but that's clearly not the case.

118
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,790
Are you misunderstanding something?

119
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,710
I only notified you that I'm pregnant.

120
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,340
I didn't ask you to take responsibility.

121
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,930
Do I not need to?

122
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,220
So I don't need to do anything, right?

123
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,520
The only thing that you can do is,

124
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,810
when the child is born in the future,

125
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,110
don't disturb him using your identity as his father.

126
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,290
Keeping your mouth shut will be your greatest contribution to him.

127
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,010
You should have said that earlier.

128
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,210
I already know about it so how can I

129
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,560
pretend that this never happened?

130
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,430
Or you should never have told me.

131
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,630
You only contributed a tiny little sperm.

132
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,160
If it hadn't been for Ou Wen wanting me to tell you,

133
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,220
why would I go looking for trouble?

134
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,580
Ou Wen?

135
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,220
Why did he do this?

136
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,310
Does he want to give up on me because of this child?

137
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,590
Is that why you came to find me at the skating park?

138
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,030
If he didn't love you, why would he do that?

139
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,860
Think it through yourself.

140
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,020
If I stay in the same space as you, I don't know how many more times I'll throw up.

141
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,110
Once you've thought it through, you can scram.

142
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,050
Do you know about it, too?

143
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,440
Hey.

144
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,670
If you already knew, why didn't you tell me?

145
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,020
Do you know how awkward it is for a girl to walk up to you

146
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,230
and say she's pregnant?

147
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,910
If I told you earlier, would anything have changed?

148
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,140
That's also true.

149
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,700
If I had known earlier, would anything have changed?

150
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,590
The situation would be the same, and nothing would change.

151
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,690
Besides, the person you like is Tai Ou Wen,

152
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,380
isn't that right?

153
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,680
You are indeed my bro.

154
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,540
In this world, only you care about how I feel!

155
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,480
Hey! Hey!

156
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,550
Enough, enough!

157
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,450
Hsaio Yu, come down for a moment, okay?

158
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,170
Help! Something has happened!

159
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,230
I really think I'm starting to swell from head to toe.

160
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,310
Look at these legs.

161
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,430
Can I still wear shorts to go out?

162
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,490
Nonsense. They are clearly still

163
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,450
beautiful legs that people want to secretly fondle.

164
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,720
Don't scare yourself.

165
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,670
Look.

166
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,330
- What?
- Do you feel hungry?

167
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,100
Don't they look like ten small sausages?

168
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,430
No, they're still the same

169
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,780
beautiful hands.

170
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,850
Really? I feel they are so fat. I don't like them.

171
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,320
Let me ask you something.

172
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,900
Do you think...

173
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,190
I am unattractive?

174
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,050
What nonsense are you saying?

175
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,790
Who said that?

176
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,730
Bring him here. I will take him to an eye doctor right away!

177
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,490
No, that is not it. Perhaps I'm overthinking.

178
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,510
What is wrong?

179
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,530
What happened?

180
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,010
Let me tell you. After camping that day, I took Hsuan Yu home.

181
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,990
Originally, all was fine, and we walked hand in hand to the door.

182
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,950
Then Wang Hsuan Yang suddenly appeared from behind.

183
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,300
Hsuan Yu dropped my hand immediately.

184
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,720
He dropped my hand the moment

185
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,070
he saw his brother.

186
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,610
How is that possible? He is Wang Hsuan Yu.

187
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,090
Exactly, it is Wang Hsuan Yu.

188
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,720
Come on.

189
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,740
Even the three-year-old child next door can tell that he likes you a lot.

190
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,340
You can suspect all the men in the world.

191
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,900
However, you don't need to suspect his sincerity toward you.

192
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,730
I'm sure he likes me.

193
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,820
But why did he drop my hand?

194
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,560
As a woman in the new modern era,

195
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,660
if you have questions, ask him directly.

196
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,760
There's nothing that you can't discuss face to face.

197
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,590
Are you going to call or not?

198
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,980
You better not go back to being the old, suffering Yan Fei

199
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,080
who stupidly internalized all her grievances.

200
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,750
Wang Hsuan Yu

201
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,990
He's calling.

202
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,490
He's very self-conscious. Not bad.

203
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,100
Should I answer?

204
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,180
Of course. Didn't you want to call him just now? Answer it.

205
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,760
Hello. Oh, what's the matter?

206
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,890
What?

207
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,850
- We're here.
- Thanks.

208
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,290
Hopefully, these are enough.

209
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,820
Good thing you two are here. My brother happened to slip and fall when my sister-in-law went into labor.

210
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,860
In a rush, I forgot to get the packed labor bag when I left.

211
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,580
It's okay. How is your sister-in-law? What is her situation right now?

212
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,660
Sister-in-law is in the labor room.

213
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,530
Older Brother has a hand fracture and is in surgery right now.

214
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,000
Jia Jia is by herself.

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,390
Why does it feel a little like a disaster?

216
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,760
Why did I get a fracture at this crucial moment? How will I run the noodle shop like this?

217
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,180
Also, we suddenly closed without posting a notice.

218
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,000
What if old customers come over?

219
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,650
The old customers don't like other noodle shops, either.

220
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,490
I have a lot of unused vacation days.

221
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,950
- But I have a full schedule tomorrow.
- I say, don't worry about it.

222
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,060
Just tell the doctor that I'm fine. Look...

223
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,790
It's fine. I can just use my left hand to cook the noodles.

224
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay? I'll just go back to open the shop.

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,910
The doctor must have had a reason to say what he said.

226
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,820
Just cooperate and rest for a few days.

227
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,770
I can't. We are not that kind of restaurant.

228
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,420
We can't close up when we want. Didn't you see your sister-in-law still working hard despite her big tummy?

229
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,990
How can I not work because of such a trivial matter today? No way.

230
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,130
- I'm going back.
- No.

231
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,830
- Don't make a fuss. Lie down. Do as the doctor said.
- I need to head back.

232
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,830
Stop. Let's stop arguing, okay?

233
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,030
I'll do it.

234
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,260
In Surgery

235
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,130
I really couldn't tell.

236
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,260
What?

237
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,850
Actually, you just may be a good mom.

238
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,300
Thank you.

239
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,250
Have you thought about whether you'll have a boy or a girl?

240
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,560
Having a boy or girl is great.

241
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,630
As long as I'm the one who gives birth,

242
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,700
the baby will definitely be adorable.

243
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,430
So narcissistic.

244
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,290
I'm acting normal.

245
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,140
This is me not being that. Usually, I'm really picky.

246
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,320
I picked you... who is not too ugly.

247
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,880
I'm so honored.

248
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,010
Mommy.

249
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,440
I suddenly think that having a daughter would be good.

250
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,900
She would definitely be as beautiful as I am.

251
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,350
She will have my large eyes that can mesmerize all the men.

252
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,610
Wait. I am against your last statement.

253
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,790
Be quiet.

254
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,200
Also, when she grows up, I can go shopping with her

255
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,720
and talk about fashion together.

256
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,820
At that time, people may even think we are sisters.

257
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,990
We are poised and intelligent.

258
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,480
When we are happy, we'll laugh together.

259
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,060
When we are sad, we'll cry together.

260
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,130
Days like that seem quite perfect.

261
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,660
Oh my gosh! Why is it so painful?

262
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,860
Haven't I given birth before?

263
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,530
Why is the second time more painful than the first time?

264
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,590
Oh my gosh!

265
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,410
Heavens, so painful! I don't want to give birth anymore!

266
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,530
Doctor, I don't want to give birth! I don't want to give birth! I can't stand it anymore!

267
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,900
- Oh my gosh!
- She said she is about to give birth.

268
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,160
- Nonsense. I'm not deaf.
- Oh! Oh!

269
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,500
I don't want to give birth anymore!

270
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,970
The scream sounds worse than death.

271
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,740
So painful!

272
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,500
Oh, right. I-Isn't there an injection that makes it painless?

273
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,460
- I want ten shots. Ten shots!
- Okay.

274
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,380
Whatever shot you want, you'll get it.

275
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,320
I think the baby is born.

276
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,590
I think the baby is born. I think the baby is born!

277
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,460
She gave birth! She gave birth!

278
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,880
- Mark, hurry up.
- Okay. I'm coming.

279
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,130
It's still really early now. I want to go back to sleep.

280
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,800
It's only half a day today. Remember to pick up Jia Jia from school at noon.

281
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,560
I got it. Look.

282
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,190
Alarms

283
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,860
Then I'll buy lunch for you two.

284
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,410
No need. That's too much trouble.

285
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,580
It's fine. That's settled then.

286
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,830
Jia Jia, wait for me! Hold hands.

287
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,520
Hold hands.

288
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,180
Your hand is so small.

289
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,940
- It's always been small.
- Really?

290
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,950
Wait for me.

291
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,970
- Wait for me!
- Hurry up!

292
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,440
This way, please.

293
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,780
It's ready. Take a look. Here. Good.

294
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,100
Thank you. This way, please. Remember your things.

295
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,050
For this camping activity's review reports, everyone has made good suggestions.

296
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,280
I hope that we'll have a Plan B for unexpected events in the future.

297
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,970
- No problem.
- No problem.

298
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,520
Next is about the changes to Love Is Science's future plans.

299
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,530
We will implement new rules everywhere.

300
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,120
Besides arranging dates for couples with pairing indices of above ninety points,

301
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,290
if the customers are willing to try,

302
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,540
we will also arrange dates for members whose pairing indices don't meet the requirement.

303
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,840
The reason that we have such a change is because we have discovered

304
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,540
the possibility of bugs in the system.

305
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,260
Can you focus during the meeting?

306
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,070
Boss, it's not that we don't want to focus,

307
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,400
but there is the constant fragrant scent of food.

308
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,410
This environment is really too difficult to hold a meeting.

309
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:27,300
Unusual times call unusual methods. Please endure it for a bit.

310
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,740
Yes.

311
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,410
Regarding what we just discussed, not excluding matches

312
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,890
whose pairing indices don't meet the requirement, is everyone clear about that?

313
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,120
Very clear. It's the Nai Hui You Fu clause, abbreviated as the Nai Fu clause.

314
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,330
Wait. Why is it called the Nai Fu clause?

315
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,490
Why not Fu Hui clause?

316
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,480
This benefactress, your concept of gender equality is very inaccurate.

317
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,230
The biased behavior to put the male name before the female name

318
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,080
must be corrected by our company.

319
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,440
You are the one who is inaccurate.

320
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,870
It doesn't have to do with the male or female. It's clearly because you are responsible for Nai Hui.

321
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,150
Enough, enough. The name of the clause isn't important.

322
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,730
We serve the people, not dead clauses.

323
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,410
- Understood.
- Understood.

324
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,920
Just like what I was saying,

325
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,400
some people can never find a suitable match among the high-scored prospects. Why is that?

326
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
It's because the system is dead.

327
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,760
- However, people are alive.
- That's right.

328
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,020
Previously, I thought that wants and needs should be separated.

329
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,340
That is true in reality.

330
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,150
However, in love, perhaps the wants may also be needs.

331
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,580
Think of it as giving each other a chance. We provide our customers

332
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,480
another direction as a choice.

333
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,780
Whether they want it or not depends on themselves.

334
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,150
Actually, I always thought that Mr. Liu and Miss Yang would be a good match.

335
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,560
It's just that their pairing index has been consistently low.

336
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,650
Now that we have a new clause, why not try to set up a date for them?

337
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,800
There's also Mr. Lin and Miss Chao,

338
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,480
as well as Mr. Chen and Miss Wu.

339
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,220
Then we're going to have a long list of arranged dates for new matches.

340
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,990
Let's try all of them then.

341
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,660
Good, let's get moving, everyone!

342
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,670
Excuse me, are you open?

343
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,500
Yes!

344
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,160
- Help me tidy up.
- Come inside, please.

345
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,710
Please come this way, Customers.

346
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,200
Let's sit here.

347
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,830
- We'll sit here.
- Come in, please.

348
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,570
Please wait a moment, and we'll take your orders.

349
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,970
Please sit. Please sit.

350
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,980
I want one bowl of beef noodles.

351
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,140
- Yes.
- Also, a plate of cold appetizers.

352
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,640
- An order of liver with meat.
- Wh-What?

353
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,530
Liver with meat.

354
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,260
If you told me before that our boss would do these things, I would have laughed at you.

355
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,370
But now I am thinking, am I in a parallel universe?

356
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,820
We can only say that love's power is truly great.

357
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,700
If you want to help, then start doing it. Otherwise, go back to the office to work.

358
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,810
Yes! Sheng Ying's team is going back to the office then.

359
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,520
- Ou Wen.
- Yes.

360
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,580
I will trouble you to take a bowl of noodles and braised dishes to Chiao An Na for lunch.

361
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,680
- Okay, Boss.
- Thanks.

362
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,130
A table for two? Welcome, this way, please.

363
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,520
We'll sit here.

364
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,250
Please wait a moment, and we'll take your orders.

365
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,160
Hello.

366
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,290
- Hello, are you okay?
- Don't worry.

367
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,300
I'm probably doing a better job than you.

368
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,640
Many customers suddenly showed up. I will go back to work.

369
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,830
Okay. Do your best!

370
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,980
You, too, do your best!

371
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,600
You're finally here. What did you buy?

372
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,970
I'm so hungry.

373
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,520
It's good that I bought a lot. The pregnant woman's capacity for eating is indeed surprising.

374
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,510
I'll give you a one-star review for the delivery. Bye bye.

375
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,890
Let's go, come inside!

376
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,250
What did you buy?

377
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,570
The noodles are for me.

378
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,960
You can eat the seafood porridge. There are also dumplings.

379
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,860
Jia Jia, let's hurry and finish the lunch.

380
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,210
Then we'll have the strength to be mean to Mark.

381
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,790
What kind of logic is that?

382
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,690
If you can do it, then you do it.

383
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,870
Jia Jia.

384
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,820
Look, this is an airplane.

385
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:25,720
It's going to fly into Jia Jia's mouth now.

386
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,730
I'm not a two-year-old anymore.

387
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,670
Jia Jia, I promise you that

388
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,980
as soon as we finish lunch, I'll take you to the hospital to see your mom.

389
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,360
Okay, I'll eat quickly then. Thank you, Auntie. Mark!

390
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,030
Okay, okay. Here, here.

391
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,360
It's good that you came. Otherwise, I would have dropped dead.

392
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,000
I finally know what I can do for you now.

393
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,030
I cannot endure the pain for you.

394
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,850
However, I can be your cheerleader on the field and constantly cheer for you.

395
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:21,130
As long as you are in the field, I won't be absent.

396
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,850
Thank you.

397
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,640
In these past two days, you've also let me think

398
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,630
it's not bad to have a dad to cherish the baby.

399
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:46,440
I think we can be his mom and dad.

400
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,380
It's just that we are not together, and we are not married.

401
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,710
It will be like "family partners."

402
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,210
I like that term.

403
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,740
We have finally reached a consensus.

404
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,160
I'm leaving now.

405
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,750
Wait.

406
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,280
How are things with Ou Wen lately?

407
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,170
I don't know what's happening lately.

408
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:27,540
Perhaps it's because of this child, but he's been difficult with me.

409
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,570
How could he possibly be difficult with you?

410
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,890
Compared to you and everyone else, he really cares about this child the most.

411
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,660
How could he be upset with you over this matter?

412
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,530
What do you mean?

413
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:45,570
Didn't you know that Ou Wen convinced me to keep the child because of you?

414
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,330
Hurry and pick up!

415
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,460
Ou Wen rushed into the operating room that day and carried me down.

416
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,710
He said the baby in my belly was from the person he liked.

417
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,530
He didn't care how much he would sacrifice. He only cared about how he could keep this child for you.

418
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,640
He was willing to be the child's father.

419
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,830
Don't you think it's funny? It's not his child, but he acts like he is the biological father.

420
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:22,080
Mark Lee, did you save the world in your past life?

421
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,350
That's why you could meet someone like Ou Wen who loves you so much.

422
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,660
Answer the phone!

423
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,100
Tai Ou Wen! Tai Ou Wen!

424
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,290
What are you doing? Are you here to collect a debt or to kill someone?

425
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,680
Tai Ou Wen, come out!

426
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,570
What are you trying to do?

427
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,610
I'm looking for Ou Wen. Tell him to come out.

428
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,920
Do you have any manners? He is not here.

429
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,130
I'm looking for Ou Wen.
 Love Is Science

430
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,280
He is not here!

431
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,090
Fine.

432
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,130
I'll wait for him.

433
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,640
Don't you believe that I'll call the police?

434
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Go ahead!

435
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,140
Scoundrel.

436
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,680
You don't need to be like this.

437
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,060
Aren't you and Chiao An Na doing quite well now?

438
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,450
Why did you come to see me?

439
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,940
What kind of plot twist is this?

440
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,630
What are you doing?

441
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,910
Are you trying to cheat?

442
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,210
What do you mean, cheat?

443
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,210
I only like you. How many times do you want me to say it?

444
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,520
Do you know what you are doing?

445
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,200
I want to kiss you.

446
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,130
Why? Why should I let you kiss me?

447
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,210
This way you won't overthink.

448
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,980
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

449
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,860
- I don't want to.
- Kiss! Kiss!

450
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,240
I want to.

451
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,830
There are a lot of people.

452
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,750
Yes!

453
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,430
If you let me see this self-conscious expression on your face again,

454
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:04,020
then I will french kiss you in front of everyone.

455
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,020
What are you doing?

456
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,250
I can't be with you on my next day off.

457
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,260
Why?

458
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,240
I'll inform my parents to prepare to become grandparents.

459
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,510
Are you always so impulsive?

460
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:40,120
I just started, and you are so scared. Then if I tell them I have a boyfriend,

461
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,580
won't you....

462
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,260
Isn't that a bad idea? You don't want to test how strong your parents' hearts are (heart attack).

463
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:53,490
What kind of parents are they? Are they more open-minded or traditional?

464
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:58,770
Your question is a dichotomy (contrast). Some parents who seem open-minded use love to interfere.

465
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:02,600
But the traditional, old-fashioned kind may actually be more tolerant.

466
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,130
It's still unnecessary to tell them everything at once.

467
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,350
What if they can't accept it?

468
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,220
They will ask many questions anyway. Instead of being bothersome, why not just explain everything clearly at once?

469
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,410
Otherwise, they'll keep annoying us every day.

470
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:21,560
The worst possible outcome is they will cut ties with me and kick me out of the household.

471
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,270
At that time, you'll be responsible for taking me in. Got it?

472
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,670
Can I say no?

473
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,680
No.

474
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,360
Why did you snatch what I should be doing?

475
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,130
That's something that I've always been doing, okay?

476
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,430
You are so heavy.

477
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,550
I'm just going to cling to you.

478
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,230
Piggyback me!

479
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,390
I'll run then.

480
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,600
- Let's go.
- Go.

481
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,140
Ju Yueh Noodle Shop

482
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,030
You are back.

483
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,840
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

484
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,470
Tired.

485
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,930
But I can still keep going.

486
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,390
Let me tell you.

487
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,790
I didn't make a single mistake today.

488
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,390
In addition, many customers told me that they would come back tomorrow to eat the noodles I cooked.

489
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,650
I even got a nickname today.

490
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,820
Noodle Shop Beauty.

491
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,400
How come you're not saying anything?

492
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,850
I shouldn't have let you come. You are not suited to live a hard life at all.

493
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,550
In my mind, there are many images of you.

494
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,080
However, this is not among the images.

495
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,450
What kind of person do you see me as? Come here.

496
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,120
Let me tell you.

497
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:24,100
In the past, I was a restaurant kitchen cleaner.

498
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:29,660
I was also in a hotel cleaning up vomit for the customers.

499
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,980
I've done other even more tiring jobs before.

500
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,970
In the past, when I divorced, I didn't want my mom to find out.

501
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,810
So in a day, I would do three jobs to support myself.

502
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:47,490
So I really am not what you think.

503
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,080
How come I never heard you talk about those things before?
Noodle

504
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,790
I treat the days from the past as a secret.

505
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,800
I put them inside my little box.

506
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,260
It's because I know God won't throw dice (gamble).

507
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,410
All things happen for a reason.

508
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,530
In the past, I was very unwilling to remember that time of my life.

509
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,040
But now, I can calmly mention it.

510
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,500
I think... I am very happy.

511
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,390
I can use my own strength to help you when you need it most.

512
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,440
I am very happy that you are willing to share the most difficult time in your life with me.

513
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,620
Now, I am a keeper of your little box of secrets.

514
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,510
Right now my whole body smells very bad.

515
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,050
You can't get close to me.

516
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,570
Here's the facial cleanser, shower gel, shampoo.

517
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,120
This is the hair conditioner.

518
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,590
The one we use at Voodoo. It's good so I bought a few bottles for myself, too.

519
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,500
You cooked noodles all day.

520
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,440
When the hair is heated under high heat for a long time, it will be very dry.

521
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,050
You can try this and heal the damaged hair.

522
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,830
I know this product, too. My coworkers said this brand was good.

523
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,940
When I help clients wash their hair, I definitely use it. The ingredients are very natural.

524
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,290
Moroccan oil can help maintain the moisture in the hair.

525
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,780
It is very effective in restoring damaged hair.

526
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,590
After you wash the hair, squeeze some and rub it into the hair.

527
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,330
Then rinse it off, and you will have finished all the steps. It's very simple.

528
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:22,480
You have an occupational habit. Now that you've talked about it, I want to try it right away.

529
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,990
This towel is for you. If you have any other questions,

530
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,890
I'll be by the door. Just ask me anytime.

531
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,510
- Hsuan Yu, are you there?
- Yes, what's wrong?

532
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,620
I want to tie my hair. Can you give me a hairband?

533
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,990
Wait a second.

534
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,930
Okay. I brought one.

535
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,560
♫ Can't you see? ♫

536
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,140
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

537
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,950
♫ Permit me to become a devoted pilgrim ♫

538
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,190

♫ We'll support each other from now on. I promise... ♫

542
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,520
- Hsuan Yu, are you there?
- Yes, what's wrong?

543
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,690
I want to tie my hair. Can you give me a hairband?

544
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,960
Wait a second.

545
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,030
Okay. I brought one.

546
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,390
♫ The fastest thing in the universe isn't light ♫

547
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,640
♫ It's the speed at which I fell in love with you ♫

♫ The most difficult thing to escape is not a black hole ♫

♫ The quietest thing isn't the deep sea ♫

551
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,730
♫ It's the street where I met you ♫

552
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,590
Yan Fei, what's wrong?

553
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,590
- Oh!
- Yan Fei! What's wrong?

554
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,690
I'm coming in!

555
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,000
What are you doing?

556
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,020
♫ I love you yet still can't say why ♫

557
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,520
♫ The straight line belongs to men, the curved one to god (Antoni Gaudi) ♫

558
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,190

♫ Can't you see? ♫

572
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,860
♫ I've fallen in love with you ♫

573
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,320

574
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,930
♫ It's just that the bargaining chip on the table is me ♫

575
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,470
Hurry and put it on.

576
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,920
What are you looking at me for? Turn around.

577
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,460
There's a piece missing.

578
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,100
Which one?

579
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,500
My little cutie.

580
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,660
That's not possible. I brought all of them earlier.

581
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,100
Wear this first. I'll go look for it again.

582
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:47,200
Little cutie. Little cutie.

583
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,060
Who's washing their clothes?

584
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,960
Hsiao Yu, what are you looking at?

585
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,540
- Older Brother.
- I'm washing clothes.

586
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,730
Didn't the doctor say you couldn't be discharged yet?

587
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,840
I know that you are very busy, and I really can't be at ease with all the stuff in the shop.

588
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,900
Besides, I really want to see Yan Fei cooking noodles.

589
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,160
So I asked the doctor to let me leave sooner.

590
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:20,170
I forgot to throw in the clothes I wore in the hospital.

591
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,260
- I'll go get it.
- Go on.

592
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,210
It's good that I remembered, or the clothes would stink.

593
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,300
Take your time. I'm going back to my room first.

594
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,040
Hsaio Yu,

595
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,580
now that we have another baby at home,

596
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,200
your brother's responsibilities have increased.

597
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,240
But I want you to know that other than my wife and children,

598
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,950
what I care most about are your career and future.

599
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:58,850
Your sister-in-law keeps saying that Hsuan Yu has grown up and isn't a child anymore,

600
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,770
but to me, you are always the little fat boy.

601
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:05,050
You're always my younger brother. Do you know?

602
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:11,490
The day I shouldered the burden of this family, I knew that

603
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,120
I can never let you go.

604
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,920
What's wrong with you? Are you feeling ill?

605
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,970
No, my back is a bit sore. Just stretching a bit.

606
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,960
- Should I give you a massage?
- No need.

607
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,730
You're already exhausted enough taking care of Sister-in-law, Jia Jia, and Rui Rui.

608
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,010
Don't worry about me.

609
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,050
You've really grown up. I don't need to worry about you.

610
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:39,970
Older Brother, I'm not a child anymore. Don't feel so pressured.

611
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:44,960
You should just take care of your hand. I'm going back to my room first.

612
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,730
Why is it leaking?

613
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,950
How is it? Have you found it?

614
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,030
- My older brother is back.
- What?

615
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,010
Then... where is my little cutie?

616
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,680
Here.

617
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,310
Thanks.

618
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,720
Do you want to hide here first and leave after my older brother falls asleep?

619
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,470
Well...

620
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:18,990
I don't know whether I'm overthinking or not.

621
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,960
What are you thinking about?

622
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,800
I want to know whether it is just a misunderstanding.

623
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,790
That day when we saw your older brother,

624
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,410
did you deliberately drop my hand?

625
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,200
Frankly, I know that I'm older than you.

626
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,170
I have also been divorced.

627
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,970
Your family probably will have a hard time accepting me.

628
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,070
Wait.

629
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,580
What are you talking about?

630
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,450
Since you didn't say anything, weren't you admitting it silently?

631
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,310
Of course not.

632
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:18,600
I was just thinking how to explain to you about my behavior from that day.

633
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,720
My true thoughts on the matter are that I want to find an opportunity

634
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,290
to formally introduce you to my family,

635
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:31,020
instead of having them find out about our relationship

636
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,760
in such a sloppy situation.

637
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,600
You are still that old-fashioned Wang Hsuan Yu.

638
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,680
"Old-fashioned?"

639
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,100
Do even you think I'm old-fashioned?

640
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,830
I...

641
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:54,110
Not old-fashioned. Lie down, lie down.

642
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:58,610
Not old-fashioned, very modern.

643
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:08,280
That's not being old-fashioned, but cherishing you.

644
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,420
♫ Always be with you ♫

645
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,990
♫ Always be with you ♫

646
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,990
♫ We'll support each other from now on. I promise... ♫

647
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,430
Voodoo

648
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,060
Good morning.

649
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,690
Help me buy breakfast.

650
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:58,080
Do you want to make a cup of coffee for me?

651
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,480
I can hardly lift up my hand.

652
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,960
Come. Everyone, come. I have an announcement.

653
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,860
Is it something good or bad?

654
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,540
Of course, it's something good.

655
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,160
I can finally tell everyone. That is, our Voodoo

656
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,840
is going to enter Royal Taipei.

657
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Is this real?

658
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,930
In the future, we will move to the beautiful building of Royal Taipei.

659
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:32,290
Our furnishings will be completely new. There will also be attractive decor.

660
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,620
Wonderful!

661
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,900
Pay attention. The key point is that we are taking the high-class route from now on.

662
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,870
All members will have to make appointments in advance.

663
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,780
How much do you charge now to cut hair?

664
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,330
- NT$800 (US$29).
- NT$800, right? In the future, when you give a haircut...

665
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,800
it will be NT$4,000 (US$144)!

666
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,410
The fee will be five times higher.

667
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:55,640
You will work fewer hours and get higher pay, and only serve the top-level customers.

668
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,590
I have finally

669
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,990
fulfilled the promise I made to everyone.

670
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,410
Boss, are you free?

671
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,750
I'd like to get your guidance.

672
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,060
Sure. Come inside and sit.

673
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,850
What is it?

674
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,510
It's just that

675
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,940
once we enter Royal Taipei,

676
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,370
does the price have to be so high?

677
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:35,200
Of course. Just like what I was saying,

678
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,560
not only will the wages be doubled, but the hours will also be shorter. It's all real.

679
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,080
Do you think you're dreaming?

680
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:48,070
Then, in the future, toward those loyal old customers,

681
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,890
will there be any special discounts?

682
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,160
Of course not.

683
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,240
We must be fair to everyone and not give any special treatments.

684
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,290
Also, to tell the truth,

685
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,400
in the future, we won't accept customers who cannot afford us.

686
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,210
That way we will elevate our stature.

687
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,310
Boss, I think what we are doing now is great.

688
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:13,030
We have our own stature and have plenty of familiar customers.

689
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:17,150
Can we not move into Royal Taipei?

690
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,220
Do you have a fever?

691
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,330
Moving into Royal Taipei

692
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,890
is our best opportunity.

693
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,590
If we miss it this time, we won't get another chance.

694
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,680
Be happier.

695
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,630
Yan Fei gave us this opportunity.

696
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:43,110
You should know to be grateful and cherish it well

697
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:48,190
so that we won't disappoint her for helping us. Okay? Go back to work.

698
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,760
Today is a very important day.

699
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,340
Let's all drink up and eat as much as we can.

700
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,410
- All right!
- Cheers!

701
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,710
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

702
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:17,390
They say your luck is particularly good before and after getting married and having a child.

703
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,290
This saying is really true.

704
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,340
Heaven knows that I have to support a child

705
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,660
so I got a raise.

706
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,830
Do you think moving into Royal Taipei is a good idea?

707
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:33,270
Of course. We'll become a famous hair salon.

708
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,810
There are also raised wages. Isn't that good?

709
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:41,030
But that way we won't be able to help cut Third Mom's hair.

710
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,970
That's something that we can't help.

711
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:49,370
It's a different clientele.

712
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,150
But why are you worried?

713
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:00,660
Your wage is getting tripled, yet you have a long face.

714
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,760
Here, drink up.

715
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,360
Either you celebrate the raise or use alcohol to numb your worries.

716
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,330
Drink.

717
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,770
Are you saying it's okay to not have those old customers?

718
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,220
What's not okay?

719
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:27,100
My goal is to elevate Voodoo to a hair salon that not just anyone can get into.

720
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,890
From now on, don't go to the park to cut hair for those homeless people.

721
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:37,400
All your future VVVIP customers will spend a lot of money on your services.

722
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,860
If they find out that their hairstylist is cutting hair for the homeless in the park

723
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,100
and it's all free, what will they think?

724
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:04,520
Brother Chang Ching, if we move into Royal Taipei, I might—

725
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,590
Everyone, everyone.

726
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,280
The most important VIP today has arrived.

727
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,010
Let's use a filled wine glass to welcome

728
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,430
the daughter of the Beauty Queen,

729
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:16,910
President Yan's daughter, Miss Yan Fei!

730
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,210
- Please.
- Thanks.

731
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:26,530
I was just a middleman. The person you should thank is your boss.

732
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,910
- Please sit.
- Thanks.

733
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,180
Here.

734
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,470
By the way, Hsuan Yu, what did you want to say to me just now?

735
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:46,170
Nothing. It's nothing important.

736
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,830
It's nothing important, right? Everyone, raise your glass

737
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,340
and thank President Yan.

738
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,880
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Do your best.

739
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,780
Thank you.

740
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,030
What's the matter?

741
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,600
Do you want to eat fried chicken?

742
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,420
Thanks. Thank you, Boss Chien.

743
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,980
- Be careful.
- I told you to drink,

744
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:28,320
but I didn't tell you to drink so much.

745
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,150
- So heavy.
- Let me see if there is any taxi. You hold onto him.

746
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,730
- Okay.
- Hold onto him. Hold on.

747
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:35,180
Step forward a little.

748
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:41,340
Are you happy or unhappy? You drank too much.

749
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,350
- So heavy.
- Here's one.

750
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:46,810
Get in.

751
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,770
- I'll get in first.
- Okay.

752
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,640
Your foot.

753
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,080
Are you okay?

754
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,670
You're almost home.

755
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,680
I'm sorry.

756
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

757
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

758
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,850
What exactly happened?

759
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,060
I'm sorry.

760
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,550
Hsiao Yu, are you up?

761
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,510
Older Brother.

762
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:08,160
I prepared some honey water for you to give you some relief.

763
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,420
There is also hangover soup downstairs.

764
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,590
Before you go to work, take a shower and drink the soup.

765
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,120
Thanks, Older Brother. I've caused you trouble.

766
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,250
It's fine. I heard Yan Fei say that

767
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,230
the hair salon was moving into Royal Taipei. Is that right?

768
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:26,420
It's an event that's worth celebrating, so it's normal to drink a few more cups than usual.

769
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,910
I was originally regretful that you couldn't leave the country.

770
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:32,350
Unexpectedly, there is such a good opportunity now.

771
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:35,250
It's really something. You're good.

772
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:42,640
You smell all over. Hurry, take a shower. Don't stink around your sister-in-law.

773
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:46,900
Older Brother.

774
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:52,510
I need to tell you something that's very important.

775
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,760
Do you want to resign?

776
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:07,570
♫ Turned out I was the only one playing the game ♫

777
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:13,360
♫ We don't have time to hesitate ♫

778
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,090
♫ Fantasize about a romantic love ♫

779
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,300
♫ Always be with you ♫

780
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:30,680
♫ We'll support each other from now on. I promise... ♫

781
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,710
Do you want to resign?

782
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,460
I'm sorry.

783
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,110
We're finally past the days we were looked down upon by others.

784
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:40,450
Yet you are leaving just like this?

785
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,530
Are you jumping to another salon?

786
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,230
What exactly are you thinking?

787
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,230
We have recommendations from Love Is Science,

788
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:05,530
support from the Beauty Queen Group, and fame from Royal Taipei.

789
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:10,370
Look around. What company has more prospects than Voodoo?

790
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,390
Forget it.

791
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:17,770
I'll just pretend I didn't hear your resignation. Hurry and reject the other side.

792
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:20,150
I'm not jumping to another place.

793
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:25,520
Sorry, Brother Chang Ching.

794
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,450
I actually like the current Voodoo better.

795
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:32,490
Royal Taipei isn't a place that I want to go to.

796
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:40,330
Is it because of what I said about the homeless and Third Mom last time?

797
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:56,210
Wang Hsuan Yu, do you know why you haven't passed the exam to be a hairstylist?

798
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:00,630
It's because you have no aspiration in life at all.

799
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:05,930
You don't want to be a bad person. You want this and that. You can't let go of anything.

800
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:12,450
Hsuan Yu, success means knowing how to make the right choice.

801
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:17,690
Whenever you make a choice, you have to pay a corresponding bargaining chip.

802
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:22,990
If you are unwilling to pay the bargaining chip, you won't have a chance to win.

803
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,590
If success means exchanging Third Mom as the bargaining chip

804
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:31,050
and the customers who stayed by me ever since I was a rookie,

805
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,460
then this game is a loss to me.

806
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:38,720
I don't need the customers' statuses or moving into Royal Taipei to prove myself.

807
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:47,230
Thank you, Brother Chang Ching, for taking care of me all these years.

808
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,100
But I'm sorry.

809
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:55,000
I don't want to become the kind of hairstylist that you want me to be.

810
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,150
Wang Hsuan Yu!

811
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:11,760
Do you really think you are that righteous?

812
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,020
Is it wrong for me to lead everyone into Royal Taipei?

813
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:19,930
Do you really think your customers will not leave you, just like how you won't abandon them?

814
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,560
I admit it.

815
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:31,920
You're innocent, kind, careful, focused, and I admire that about you.

816
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:36,770
But you are too idealistic. You don't consider reality at all.

817
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:39,090
What is the reality? Let me tell you.

818
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:43,800
When they meet a better, cheaper hairstylist, they will kick you away.

819
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,320
Hey, what's going on? Why is Brother Chang Ching so angry?

820
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,390
I'm resigning.

821
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:54,670
Are you crazy? You are resigning for the customers.

822
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:57,260
Say sorry. Hurry.

823
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,930
Thank you, everyone, for your care toward me.

824
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,500
I'm sorry.

825
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,360
Hey.

826
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,330
Hi, Mu Chi. How is it? Is everything going smoothly?

827
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:43,470
Boss, they say Hsuan Yu has resigned.

828
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:47,730
I'll let Mark talk to you.

829
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:50,930
Hsuan Yu told Brother Chang Ching this morning that he was resigning.

830
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,130
Didn't he tell you?

831
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:14,200
♫ Always be with you ♫

832
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,340
♫ We'll support each other from now on. I promise... ♫

833
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:32,900
Piggy's Love Diary

834
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,270
Little Piggy.

835
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,100
Let's take a look at what we'll eat today.

836
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,530
There is sushi and spaghetti.

837
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:54,430
There's also fried shrimp cakes. They look so delicious.

838
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,800
There is also roast duck.

839
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,910
Which do you want to eat? Which one is good?

840
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:01,640
Little Piggy, help me choose.

841
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,400
I don't want to eat. I want to go home.

842
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:11,330
What's wrong? Are you sick?

843
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,530
There's no fever.

844
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:22,450
Little Piggy! Little Piggy!

845
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:25,400
Little Piggy, wait for me!

846
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,170
Little Piggy, what exactly happened?

847
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:32,010
Did something happen?

848
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,290
Yan Fei! Yan Fei!

849
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:36,860
- Have you heard?
- What?

850
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:40,680
Wang Hsuan Yang has broken up with the cheerleading team's captain.

851
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,620
Really?

852
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:46,390
He still has a game this afternoon. Let's go cheer for him. Okay?

853
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,880
- You go.
- Why?

854
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,120
I already have plans for the afternoon.

855
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:00,200
Didn't we agree to go eat the delicious food from the magazine? Let's go.

856
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,790
Mark has a new girlfriend. It seems that he is very serious and wants to settle down.

857
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:15,130
No, no, no. We are not in the kind of relationship that you are thinking of.

858
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:19,870
Because of you, those turnips have been spread to dry in the sun earlier than we planned.

859
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,950
- Nai Hui!
- What I regret most is

860
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:24,940
- liking someone like you!
- I regret being good friends with you in the past!

861
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:28,200
Older Brother, Yan Fei is my girlfriend right now.

862
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,770
But Yan Fei is old. She has been divorced.

863
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:32,190
Yan Fei isn't suitable.

864
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:35,100
- You really haven't changed at all.
- I just want to be by myself for a bit.

865
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,590
Why don't you say anything?

866
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:39,080
I just need time to find a solution.

867
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:43,390
I'm working hard for our future. Why must you separate things between us so clearly?
[For Lease]

868
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:47,340
It's because what you want is not what I want.

869
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:50,130
Some love can only be hidden in darkness.

870
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:53,920
They can't be seen, nor discovered.
