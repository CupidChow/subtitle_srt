1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,640
I'm right here. Just hold on.

2
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,990
- Vitals?\N- Heart rate 220. Temperature's 106.

3
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,820
Will, where does it hurt?

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,400
All over.

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,200
She says he feels like he's burning.\NCheck for burns.

6
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,290
I don't see anything.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,750
- Where does it hurt the most, Will?\N- Everywhere! Everywhere!

8
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,390
Wait a sec. How big?

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,140
First it was like that.\NNow he's like this.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,800
I swear to God, man, it's just\Nsome little lizard, okay?

11
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,600
- It's not a lizard.\N- How do you know?

12
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,700
How do I know if it's not?

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,440
How do you know it's not just a lizard?

14
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,590
Because his face opened\Nup and he ate my cat.

15
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,390
I don't hear shit.

16
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,390
He's in there.

17
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,090
All right, listen, kid. I swear,

18
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,190
if this is some sort of Halloween prank,

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,500
- you're dead.\N- It's not.

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,900
- All right?\N- It's not a prank.

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,300
Get it out of my face.

22
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,250
You got a key for this thing?

23
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,800
Let me see that.

24
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,800
He must be further down there.

25
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,850
I'll stay up here in\Ncase he tries to escape.

26
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,520
Steve?

27
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,810
Steve, what's going on down there?

28
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,270
Get down here.

29
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,160
Oh, shit.

30
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,290
Oh, shit!

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,390
No way.

32
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,420
No way.

33
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,290
That thing, it... it\Ndid something to him.

34
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,790
Okay. And these now-memories,\Nas you call them,

35
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,540
how long has he been experiencing them?

36
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,990
I told you, since Thursday.\NSince I found him in the field.

37
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,590
And why wasn't he brought in?

38
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,290
I have been bringing him in,\Nand what have you done?

39
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,090
Nothing. Nothing!

40
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,140
These are new symptoms, Joyce.

41
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,580
No. No, he has been telling you

42
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,510
over and over that something's wrong,

43
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,040
and you said it was all in his head.

44
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,890
You said, "Be patient."\NThose were your words.

45
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,730
I understand that you're upset, okay?\NI get it.

46
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,460
I would be, too, if I\Nwere in your shoes.

47
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,930
But we are all in the same boat here,

48
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,190
- and I just need you to try...\N- Wait? Stay calm?

49
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,740
Trust you?

50
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,190
No, I want him transferred\Nto a real hospital.

51
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,690
Well, you know that's not possible.

52
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,340
He really will get the best\Ntreatment here, Mrs. Byers.

53
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,380
The very best.

54
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,410
And what are you treating\Nhim for, exactly?

55
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,830
Can anyone tell me\Nwhat's wrong with him?

56
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,090
Can a single person in this room

57
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,690
tell me what is wrong with my boy?

58
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,140
What is wrong with my boy?

59
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,540
You see why I have to stop the truth

60
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,810
from spreading, too.

61
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,030
Just the same as those weeds there.

62
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,940
By whatever means necessary.

63
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,730
Whoo-hoo!

64
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,560
- To taking down the man.\N- To taking down the man.

65
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,780
Commie bastards sure know how\Nto make a spirit. Am I right?

66
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,840
Oh, no, no, no. We... we can't.

67
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,640
Yeah, no. No, I've got to drive.

68
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,940
Drive? What, tonight?

69
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,940
Our parents...

70
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,160
Would be proud if they\Nknew what you were up to.

71
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,080
Just tell 'em you're at Tammy's\Nor Dawn's or whoever's,

72
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,210
and take my guest room.

73
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,930
- I mean, do... do you want to stay?\N- Well, it is pretty late.

74
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,260
Okay. Uh... Could I use the sofa?

75
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,590
Okay, I'm confused. What's going\Non here? A lovers' quarrel?

76
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,590
- No, no. I mean, we're just friends.\N- Friends.

77
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,690
You've told me a lot of shockers today,

78
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,610
but that, that is the first lie.

79
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,130
- It's not a lie.\N- No?

80
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,740
You're young, attractive.

81
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,880
You've got chemistry, history, plus

82
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,330
the real shit, shared trauma.

83
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,110
Trust issues, am I right?

84
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,430
Something to do with your dad.

85
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,680
- What? No, I mean, my dad's...\N- An asshole.

86
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,510
Hmm. It is a curse to see so clearly.

87
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,060
You, you're harder to read.

88
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,060
Probably, like everyone,

89
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,510
afraid of what would happen if you

90
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,960
accepted yourself for who you really are

91
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,110
and retreated back to the safety of...

92
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,710
- Name? Name?\N- Steve.

93
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,510
Oh. Steve. We like Steve.

94
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,160
Yes.

95
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,960
- But we don't love Steve.\N- What?

96
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,060
No, we... I mean, I do.

97
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,960
There it is, ladies and germs,\Nthe second lie of the evening.

98
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,760
So, how'd I do?

99
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,010
My goodness. You two are\Nadorable, aren't you?

100
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,710
Listen...

101
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,560
...there's a pull-out sofa\Nin my study if you want it.

102
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,490
But if I were you,

103
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,690
I'd cut the bullshit and\Nshare the damn bed.

104
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,340
Afraid.

105
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,390
Trust issues?

106
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,940
Trust issues.

107
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,940
Retreat?

108
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,590
I don't retreat.

109
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,090
Trust issues? I do not...

110
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,440
Oh. Hey.

111
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Hey.

112
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,490
I just, uh...

113
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,790
I... I just wanted to say that...

114
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,140
Oh, no, don't... I mean...\NHe's so drunk.

115
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,690
- Wasted.\N- Yeah.

116
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,640
I mean, what? He knows us\Nfor a couple of hours,

117
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,090
and he's got us all figured out?

118
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Exactly.

119
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,140
God. Okay, yeah. I feel... I'm\Nglad we feel the same way.

120
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,840
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

121
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,140
Uh...

122
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,740
So, uh, good night, I guess.

123
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,090
Yeah, um, good night.

124
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,690
Oh, He-Man, thank you\Nfor saving my life.

125
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,010
What strong muscles you have.

126
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,790
- I knew it.\N- Hey! They're in love!

127
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,590
No, actually, they're not.

128
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,440
They don't even exist\Non the same planet.

129
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,140
Aren't you too old to\Nbe playing with toys?

130
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,110
That... that's not the point.

131
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,710
The point is to stay out of my room.

132
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,760
Then tell your little nerdy\Nfriend to shut his mouth.

133
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,150
What are you talking about?

134
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,910
"Code red, Lucas. Code red. Code red."

135
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,580
Bunch of nerds.

136
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

137
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,710
Dustin!

138
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,960
This is Lucas. Do you copy? Dustin?

139
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,510
- Well, well, well, look who it is.\N- Sorry, man.

140
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,050
My stupid sister turned it off.

141
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,800
Well, when you were having sister\Nproblems, Dart grew again,

142
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,460
he escaped, and I'm pretty\Nsure he's a baby Demogorgon.

143
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,760
- Wait. What?\N- I'll explain later.

144
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,100
- Meet me and Steve at the old junkyard.\N- Steve?

145
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,010
And bring your binoculars\Nand wrist rocket.

146
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,310
Steve Harrington?

147
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,650
All right, let's go.

148
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,610
Just be there, stat. Over and out.

149
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,860
All right, cowboy, good news.

150
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,050
We're giving you the green light.

151
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,710
How you feeling?

152
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,160
Never better.

153
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,710
All right, well, got a present for ya.

154
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,850
- The hell is that?\N- Uh, something you should see.

155
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,610
Watch your step.

156
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:15,760
All living organisms develop\Ndefense mechanisms against attack.

157
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,560
They adapt. They find\Nsome way to survive.

158
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,950
Oh, my God.

159
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,950
It's pretty impressive, isn't it?

160
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,960
It's been spreading,

161
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,600
growing beneath us like some cancer.

162
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,960
Why aren't you burning it?

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
There's a complication.

164
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,180
They made me sign, like,\Na thousand documents.

165
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,950
I mean... we all had to. We had to.

166
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,810
I mean, I lost track at a certain point.

167
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,400
They're gonna make you do the same.\NI'm sure.

168
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,860
Yeah. Well, hey, whatever.

169
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,810
What kind of documents?

170
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,750
Uh, confidentiality,

171
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,760
and there were these\Nofficial forms saying,

172
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,310
like, nothing ever happened,

173
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,560
which is why...

174
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,210
Will got lost in the woods.

175
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Yeah.

176
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,760
Man, I always thought stuff like this

177
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,050
happened in movies and comic books.

178
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,600
Certainly not in Hawkins,

179
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,110
and certainly not to someone like you.

180
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,400
- Or you.\N- Yeah.

181
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,350
Bob Newby, superhero.

182
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,180
You cold?

183
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,530
Uh, just a little jitters, I guess.

184
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,980
Hey, don't you start worrying about me.

185
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,780
- Okay.\N- Okay? I'm fine.

186
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,030
I'm fine.

187
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,880
It's not like you didn't warn me.\N"This is not a normal family."

188
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,080
- Isn't that what you said?\N- Yeah.

189
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,280
You weren't kidding.

190
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,030
It kinda makes my idea\Nof moving to Maine

191
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,780
sound a little less crazy, right?

192
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,780
Oh, it... it's not crazy at all.

193
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,730
Mom?

194
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,430
Hey.

195
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,630
Is there a doctor? We need a doctor!

196
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,130
Sweetie, how you feeling? You okay?

197
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,630
Okay, they're on their way.

198
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,880
Hey.

199
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,810
- Who is that?\N- What?

200
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,060
- What?\N- It's me, big guy. It's Bob.

201
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,360
Are you a...

202
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,560
doctor?

203
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,010
No. No, it's just me. Just... just Bob.

204
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,460
So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out?

205
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,110
Uh, sorry?

206
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,810
The sofa.

207
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,710
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was good.

208
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,410
I bet.

209
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,260
Oops.

210
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,260
Mmm.

211
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Oh, yeah.

212
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,810
Yeah, we just, um...

213
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,760
We just had some fun girl time.

214
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,760
- Will you be back for dinner?\N- Mmm-hmm.

215
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,110
- Yeah, I'll be home real soon.\N- Say hey to Ally for me.

216
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,560
Okay. All right. I love\Nyou, too, Mom. Bye.

217
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,860
She said Mike's at your brother's house.

218
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,510
They just had a sleepover. So...

219
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,160
Oh, okay.

220
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,010
Do you wanna try again?

221
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,860
No. No, it's fine.

222
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,010
They're probably just at\Nthe matinée or something.

223
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,760
Yeah, I'm sure.

224
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,610
For your travels.

225
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,180
And to water it down.

226
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,430
Got it.

227
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,110
Thank you for everything.

228
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,310
Don't thank me yet. Just keep\Nyour eyes on the papers, hmm?

229
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,610
And if you need to reach me again...

230
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,230
don't.

231
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,130
Twenty-one.

232
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,180
Twenty-two.

233
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,310
- Max, are you getting that or what?\N- Okay!

234
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,230
Swear to God, Max!

235
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,470
What are you doing here?

236
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,780
- I have proof.\N- What?

237
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,670
Proof that what I told you was real.\NBut we have to hurry.

238
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,550
What kind of proof?

239
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,980
Who the hell were you talking to?

240
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,670
Mormons.

241
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,330
Mormons?

242
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,250
Talkative ones.

243
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Come on, hop on.

244
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,120
Hurry.

245
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,820
This better be good, stalker.

246
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,500
Do you know your name?

247
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,830
Will.

248
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,720
- Your full name?\N- William Byers.

249
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,000
Do you know... Do you know who I am?

250
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,220
A doctor.

251
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,270
Have we met before?

252
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,350
- I don't remember.\N- Hmm.

253
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,230
You don't remember me?

254
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,230
Okay.

255
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,120
How about, uh... How\Nabout this guy here?

256
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,180
Know who that is?

257
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,280
It's all right. Take your time.

258
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,120
That's my friend.

259
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,620
Mike.

260
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,750
What about me, kid? You remember me?

261
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,850
They tell me you helped\Nsave me last night.

262
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
You remember that?

263
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,270
Do you remember anything\Nabout last night?

264
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,830
About what happened?

265
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,370
I remember they hurt me.

266
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,820
You mean the doctors?

267
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,070
No. The soldiers.

268
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,370
The soldiers hurt you?

269
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,120
They shouldn't have done that.

270
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
It upset him.

271
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,780
You say, "Upset him." Is that him?

272
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,850
Okay. Okay, I wanna try something.

273
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,880
It's gonna seem a little odd at first,

274
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,700
but I think it's really gonna help\Nus understand what's going on.

275
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,350
Is that okay?

276
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,350
Okay.

277
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,900
Now, Will, I want you to just let\Nus know if you feel anything.

278
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,400
Okay?

279
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,550
- Do you feel anything?\N- Little sting.

280
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,150
It stings? Where?

281
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,400
My chest.

282
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,600
- Okay, son.\N- Sweetie...

283
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,150
- How about now?\N- It... it burns.

284
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,650
Ah!

285
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,150
- It burns.\N- Where?

286
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,500
Everywhere.

287
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,150
That's enough. That's enough!

288
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,130
Stop! You heard her! That's enough!

289
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,530
That's it! We're done!

290
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,380
Okay.

291
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,180
Sweetie... Sweetie. It's okay.

292
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,880
Our best guess right now\Nis it's some kind of virus

293
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,280
which is causing this\Nneurological disorder.

294
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,480
Now, when... when a typical virus\Nattaches itself to its host...

295
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,530
...it duplicates, right? It spreads,\Nessentially hijacking the host.

296
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,080
A virus is alive. It\Nhas an intelligence.

297
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,230
That's not... That's not unusual.

298
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,630
What is so unusual here,

299
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,430
this virus... the infected hosts\Nseem to be communicating.

300
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,980
It has some sort of a hive intelligence,

301
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,030
and it's connecting all the hosts.

302
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,680
The good news is a virus can be cured.

303
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,530
We... we're gonna continue to run tests.

304
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,680
We're gonna see what we find.

305
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,080
What happens when he\Ncan't remember anything?

306
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,480
When there's nothing else there?

307
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,180
What happens when my boy is gone?

308
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,880
All right, so let me get this straight.

309
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,280
You kept something you knew\Nwas probably dangerous

310
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,280
in order to impress a girl who...\Nwho you just met?

311
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,780
All right, that's grossly\Noversimplifying things.

312
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,480
I mean, why would a girl\Nlike some nasty slug anyway?

313
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,930
An interdimensional slug?\NBecause it's awesome.

314
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,480
Well, even if she thought it was cool,

315
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,030
which she didn't, I... I just...

316
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,330
I don't know. I just feel\Nlike you're trying too hard.

317
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,030
Well, not everyone can have\Nyour perfect hair, all right?

318
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,730
It's not about the hair, man.

319
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,830
The key with girls is just...\Njust acting like you don't care.

320
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,600
- Even if you do?\N- Yeah, exactly. It drives them nuts.

321
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,250
- Then what?\N- You just wait until, uh...

322
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,400
- until you feel it.\N- Feel what?

323
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,980
It's like before it's\Ngonna storm, you know?

324
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,780
You can't see it, but you can\Nfeel it, like this, uh...

325
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,350
electricity, you know?

326
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,030
Oh, like in the electromagnetic field

327
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,700
when the clouds in the atmosphere...

328
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,280
No, no, no, no, no. Like a...\NLike a sexual electricity.

329
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,380
Oh.

330
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,830
You feel that and then\Nyou make your move.

331
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,380
So that's when you kiss her?

332
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,130
- No, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Romeo.\N- Sorry.

333
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,000
Sure, okay, some girls,

334
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,330
yeah, they want you to be aggressive.

335
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,100
You know, strong, hot\Nand heavy, like a...

336
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,800
- I don't know, like a lion.\N- Mmm.

337
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,650
But others, you gotta be slow,

338
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,780
you gotta be stealthy, like a...

339
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,470
like a ninja.

340
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,020
What type is Nancy?

341
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,800
Nancy's different. She's\Ndifferent than the other girls.

342
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,590
Yeah, she seems pretty special, I guess.

343
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,290
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

344
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,790
But this girl's special, too, you know.

345
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,150
It's just, like, something about her.

346
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,500
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.\N- What?

347
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,640
You're not falling in love\Nwith this girl, are you?

348
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,050
Uh, no. No.

349
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,970
- Okay, good. Don't.\N- I won't.

350
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,740
She's only gonna break your heart,

351
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,900
and you're way too young for that shit.

352
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,520
Fabergé.

353
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
What?

354
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,540
It's Fabergé Organics.

355
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,500
Use the shampoo and conditioner,\Nand when your hair's damp...

356
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,870
It's not wet, okay?

357
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,540
- When it's damp...\N- Damp.

358
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,870
You do four puffs of the\NFarrah Fawcett spray.

359
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,890
- Farrah Fawcett spray?\N- Yeah, Farrah Fawcett.

360
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,050
You tell anyone I just told you\Nthat and your ass is grass.

361
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,090
You're dead, Henderson.\NDo you understand?

362
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,170
Yup.

363
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,390
Okay.

364
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,890
- Farrah Fawcett, really?\N- I mean, she's hot.

365
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,600
Yeah.

366
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,870
Hey, it's, uh...

367
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,420
It's me.

368
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,640
I know that I've been\Ngone too long, and, uh...

369
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,640
It's... I just, I want you to\Nknow that it's not about you

370
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,640
and it's not about our fight.

371
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,170
Okay?

372
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,770
Something came up, and I will...\NI will explain it all

373
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,170
when I see you.

374
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,700
I just... I want you to\Nknow that I'm not mad.

375
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,350
I'm just sorry.

376
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,190
About everything.

377
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,870
I...

378
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,840
I don't want you to get hurt at all.

379
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,420
And I don't wanna lose you.

380
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,100
Just make sure you heat\Nup some real food.

381
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,450
Not just Eggos.

382
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,950
And I want you to eat all the peas,

383
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,470
even if they're mushy and gross. And...

384
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,820
I will be home soon.

385
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,600
This is him last week.

386
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,620
And there are the hippocampal\Nabnormalities we had discussed.

387
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,400
Nothing out of line with what we've seen

388
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,540
from others suffering from\Npost-traumatic stress. But...

389
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,000
this is Will from last night.

390
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,200
And as you can see,

391
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:21,000
there are now abnormalities in\Nthe limbic and paralimbic areas.

392
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,090
And this...

393
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,050
is from an hour ago.

394
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,470
I don't hear any suggestions.

395
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,270
We have bigger problems than the boy.

396
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,720
- Do we?\N- We can't keep delaying the burn.

397
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,570
You're talking about putting...

398
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,170
putting a Band-Aid on this.

399
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,170
Right now, a Band-Aid\Nis the best option.

400
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,670
It's our only option.

401
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,470
And if it kills the boy?

402
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,070
Then quite frankly, Sam, it kills him.

403
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,520
Say that to me again.

404
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,120
The rate this is spreading,

405
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,020
he'll be lost by the end of the day.

406
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,070
What we do or don't do

407
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,470
won't change the outcome.

408
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,120
We have to start the burn.

409
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,470
Where you going?

410
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,220
I'm going to think.

411
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,670
What the hell is taking so long?

412
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,800
Hey... doctors take forever, always.

413
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,000
Just try and relax. Just be patient.

414
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,600
You know, I just...

415
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,750
Let me through. Let me through!

416
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,850
- You know we can't do that.\N- I need to talk to...

417
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,750
- He'll be with you shortly.\N- You said that an hour ago.

418
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,300
Will.

419
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,750
Will? Will?

420
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,900
What's wrong? Are you hurting again?

421
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,300
Uh...

422
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,650
I saw something.

423
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,150
In your now-memories?

424
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,350
The shadow monster.

425
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,400
I think I know how to stop him.

426
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,850
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this will do.

427
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,900
This will do just fine.

428
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Good call, dude.

429
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,850
I said medium-well!

430
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,050
Who's that?

431
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,920
You told her?

432
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,770
- So what?\N- "So what?"

433
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,070
- You wanted to tell her, too.\N- But I didn't, all right?

434
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,820
We agreed not to tell her\Nand to look for Dart.

435
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,450
Who you conveniently found.

436
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,050
Are you suggesting that I'm lying?

437
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,620
I'm saying you have a creepy\Nlittle bond with him.

438
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,970
Yeah, that was before he\Nturned into a Demogorgon.

439
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,950
- And you haven't heard from Mike?\N- No.

440
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,250
- Or Will?\N- No.

441
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,950
- Hopper?\N- No! No one is around.

442
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,250
Why do you think I'm\Nwith Steve Harrington?

443
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,070
- Something's...\N- Wrong. I agree.

444
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,800
Which is why we need as\Nmuch help as we can get.

445
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,550
She didn't believe me anyway.

446
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,370
You probably didn't tell it right.

447
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,600
That must be it.

448
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,670
So, we good?

449
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,900
Hey! Dickheads!

450
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,260
How come the only one helping\Nme out is this random girl?

451
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,070
We lose light in 40 minutes. Let's go.\NLet's go, I said!

452
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,570
- All right, asshole! God!\N- Okay! Stupid.

453
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,060
What...

454
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,670
What is all of this?

455
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,970
I don't know.

456
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,060
Mom?

457
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Will?

458
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,220
I don't shoot Polaroid.

459
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,860
- What?\N- It's not mine.

460
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,390
Someone else has been here.

461
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,520
Sam, this is ludicrous.

462
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,860
- Just give him a moment, okay?\N- We don't have time...

463
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,010
Hey, jackass,

464
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,510
why don't you do us all a\Nfavor and shut up, okay?

465
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,760
That's it.

466
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,890
That's what? What... what's there, Will?

467
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
I don't know.

468
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,160
I just know he doesn't\Nwant me to see there.

469
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,320
I think it's important.

470
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,220
Let's see if this kid's a\Nwizard or schizo, Doc.

471
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,670
First door on your right, gentlemen.

472
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,140
I'm guessing a ten.

473
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,090
Let's not overdo it now.

474
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,840
I read four.

475
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,940
Moving in.

476
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,120
So you really fought one\Nof these things before?

477
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,520
And you're, like, totally,\N100% sure it wasn't a bear?

478
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,670
Shit. Don't be an idiot. Okay?\NIt wasn't a bear.

479
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,970
Why are you even here if\Nyou don't believe us?

480
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,270
Just go home.

481
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,370
Geesh. Someone's cranky.\NPast your bedtime?

482
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,270
That's good. Just show\Nher you don't care.

483
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,270
I don't.

484
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,570
Why are you winking, Steve? Stop.

485
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,120
- It's kinda awesome.\N- Huh?

486
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,770
The fog, I mean.

487
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,870
Looks like the ocean.

488
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,270
- You miss it?\N- What?

489
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,770
The ocean. The waves? California?

490
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,620
Hawkins seems pretty lame, I bet.

491
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:50,020
No, no, no, it's not that. It's just...

492
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,120
My dad's still there. So...

493
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:01,220
- Why?\N- It's this legal term called "divorce."

494
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,820
See, when two married people\Ndon't love each other anymore...

495
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,870
Yeah.

496
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,170
My mom and my stepdad,

497
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:14,920
they wanted a fresh start away from him.

498
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,770
As if... As if he was the\Nproblem, which is total bull.

499
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,470
And things...

500
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,320
are just worse now.

501
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,940
My stepbrother's always been a dick,

502
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:33,640
but now he's just angry...\Nall the time and...

503
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,390
Well, he can't take it\Nout on my mom, so...

504
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,120
So he takes it out on you?

505
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,240
I don't even know why\NI'm telling you this.

506
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:54,490
It's just... I know that I can\Nbe a jerk like him sometimes,

507
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,040
and I do not want to be like him. Ever.

508
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,270
I guess I'm angry, too, and...

509
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,890
I'm sorry.

510
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,330
Jesus! What's wrong with me?

511
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:18,410
Hey. You're nothing like\Nyour brother, okay?

512
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,880
You're cool and different.\NAnd you're super smart.

513
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,130
And you're, like, totally tubular.

514
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,680
- Nobody actually says that, you know.\N- Well, I do now.

515
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,840
And it makes you seem really cool.

516
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,930
I like talking with you, Mad Max.

517
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,590
And I like talking with you, stalker.

518
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,440
- You see him?\N- No.

519
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,190
Lucas, what's going on?

520
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,330
Hold on!

521
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,460
I've got eyes! Ten o'clock! Ten o'clock!

522
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,130
There.

523
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,840
- What's he doing?\N- I don't know.

524
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,890
- Wait. You sure that's not a dog?\N- What?

525
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,140
He's not taking the bait. Why\Nis he not taking the bait?

526
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,310
Maybe he's not hungry?

527
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,230
Maybe he's sick of cow.

528
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,660
Steve? Steve, what are you doing?

529
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
Steve?

530
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,460
Just get ready.

531
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,860
Come on, buddy.

532
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,080
- What's he doing?\N- Expanding the menu.

533
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,940
Come on, buddy.

534
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,580
Come on, buddy.

535
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,830
Come on. Dinner time.

536
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,430
Human tastes better than cat, I promise.

537
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,680
He's insane.

538
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,630
He's awesome.

539
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,910
Steve, watch out!

540
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,160
A little busy here!

541
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,440
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!

542
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,210
Steve!

543
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,630
Steve! Abort! Abort!

544
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,230
- Steve, run!\N- Steve, hurry!

545
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,560
Steve, run!

546
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,010
Shit!

547
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,760
Are they rabid or something?

548
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,410
They can't get in! They can't!

549
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,510
Shit!

550
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:46,860
Is anyone there? Mike?\NWill? God! Anyone!

551
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,110
Shit!

552
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,310
We're at the old junkyard,\Nand we are going to die!

553
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,010
Out of the way!

554
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,260
Out of the way! You want some?\NCome get this!

555
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,940
Jeez.

556
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,240
What happened?

557
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:55,990
I don't know.

558
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,940
- Steve scared 'em off?\N- No.

559
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,540
No way.

560
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,390
They're going somewhere.

561
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,740
- Almost there, ladies.\N- Roger.

562
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,390
All right, stay frosty, boys.

563
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,740
- Wait. That's where I was.\N- What?

564
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,890
It's that damn graveyard.

565
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,990
Sir, there's nothing here.

566
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,840
Looks like your kid's full of shit, Doc.

567
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,490
Got some kind of fog moving in now.

568
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,740
I'm sorry.

569
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,290
What? What do you mean, sweetie?

570
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,790
He made me do it.

571
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,960
Who? Who made you do what?

572
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,960
I told you.

573
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,260
They upset him.

574
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,340
They shouldn't have done that.

575
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,340
They shouldn't have upset him.

576
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,290
The spy.

577
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,010
The spy!

578
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,110
We've got movement.

579
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,440
You've got company, fellas.

580
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,430
Whoa, whoa!

581
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,150
I need to get through! It's a trap!

582
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,660
It's a trap! I need to warn them.\NIt's a trap!

583
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,700
I can't see shit! Where are they?

584
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,100
Where are they?

585
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,300
They're right on you!

586
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,410
- Wait, what?\N- What was that?

587
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,510
Will, sweets, talk to me. You\Ngot to help me understand.

588
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,050
It's too late.

589
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,080
You should go now.

590
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,150
They're almost here.
