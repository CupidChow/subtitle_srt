1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,070
Nancy!

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,530
Come on, come on.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,220
Nancy!

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,410
Where are you?

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,560
Jonathan! Jonathan!

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,720
Jonathan!

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,140
Jonathan, I'm right here!

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,960
Nancy!

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,520
Nancy!

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,180
Jonathan, where are you?

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,890
Jonathan!

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,680
Jonathan!

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,890
Jonathan, I'm right... I'm right here!

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,810
Where are you?

15
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,520
- I'm right here!\N- Jonathan!

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,980
I'm right here! Nancy!

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,280
- Just follow my voice!\N- Jonathan!

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,630
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,950
Nancy!

20
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,920
Nancy?

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,500
Nancy.

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,630
Nancy! Follow my voice!

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,820
Nancy?

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,050
- Jonathan!\N- Nancy!

25
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,290
I got you.

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,620
I just don't understand\Nwhy we're coming out here.

27
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,410
She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.

28
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,810
That's... that's not it.

29
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,570
Oh, really? Because no girl\Nwould ever blow off King Steve.

30
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,320
She was acting weird. I\Nmean, something was wrong.

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
So what? Like, you're worried about her?

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,820
- What?\N- Aw, you are.

33
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,620
- Aw, Steve has a heart.\N- Would you just... Stop.

34
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,560
- Oh, Stevey's in love.\N- Would you just shut up?

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,710
- Who knew?\N- Shut up!

36
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,140
Jeez.

37
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,150
Damn. Sorry.

38
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,940
So this is it, huh? Princess' castle.

39
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,700
I'll just be a minute.

40
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,330
Look, we gotta go through this again.

41
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,920
- I told you everything that I saw.\N- Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

42
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,340
- Upstairs or downstairs?\N- Upstairs.

43
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,550
There was a laboratory.

44
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,460
It was where they must do experiments\Nor something, and then there was...

45
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,850
There was this kid's room.

46
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,600
- How do you know it was a kid's room?\N- More like a prison.

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,110
So why would you think\Nit was a kid's room, then?

48
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,570
Because, I told you,

49
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,200
the size of the bed,\Nthere was a drawing,

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
there was a stuffed animal...

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,240
You didn't say there was a drawing.

52
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,430
Yeah, there was a drawing\Nof a... an adult and a child.

53
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,410
- It said "Eleven" on it.\N- Was it good?

54
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,740
It was a kid's drawing,\NJoyce. It was stick figures.

55
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,520
Wasn't Will.

56
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,700
Earl...

57
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,560
The night that Benny died,

58
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,940
Earl said he saw some kid\Nwith a shaved head with Benny.

59
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,770
Now, I pressed him, he said\Nit might be Will, but maybe...

60
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,650
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

61
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,070
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

62
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,240
she claims to have\Nlost her daughter, Jane.

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,740
She sued Brenner, she\Nsued the government...

64
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,220
Now, the claims came to\Nnothing, but what if...

65
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,410
I mean, what if this\Nwhole time I've been...

66
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,180
I've been looking for Will...

67
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,230
I've been chasing after some other kid?

68
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,000
Nancy!

69
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,980
Better?

70
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,940
Yeah.

71
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,820
Is this okay? Uh, I\Nfound it in the closet.

72
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,430
I can go home. I just figured...

73
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,490
Yeah, no. I...

74
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,870
I don't wanna be alone.

75
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,000
- Do you?\N- No. Uh... no.

76
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,950
Can you just come up here?

77
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,540
Yeah.

78
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,390
- Do you want the lights off, or...\N- On.

79
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,890
Yeah.

80
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,110
You know, it...

81
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,940
it can't get us in here.

82
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,910
We don't know that.

83
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,420
Uh, yeah, it's Ives. Terry\NIves. That's with a "Y."

84
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,440
Yeah, I got a pen. Hang on.

85
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,400
Mmm-hmm.

86
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,050
Mmm-hmm.

87
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,300
Great, thanks. I really\Nappreciate this, Frank.

88
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,410
Say hi to the boys\Nfor me, too, would you?

89
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,440
Did you get it?

90
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,460
- I got it.\N- Okay.

91
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,440
Oh...

92
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,530
Hey.

93
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,030
Hey.

94
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,240
Couldn't sleep?

95
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,660
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

96
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,290
keep seeing that... thing.

97
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,800
Wherever I was, that place...

98
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,450
I think that it lives there.

99
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,390
It was feeding there.

100
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,510
Feeding on that deer.

101
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,960
That means that if...

102
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,480
if Will and Barbara...

103
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,570
Hey.

104
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,320
My mom said she talked to Will.

105
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,720
If he's alive, there's\Na chance Barbara is, too.

106
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,820
That means that she's trapped...

107
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,240
in that place.

108
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,980
We have to find it again.

109
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,040
You wanna go back out there?

110
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,920
Maybe we don't have to.

111
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,280
When I saw it, it was\Nfeeding on that deer.

112
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,490
- Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?\N- Right.

113
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,660
And it seems to hunt at night,\Nlike a... a lion or a coyote.

114
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,470
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

115
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,730
It's always alone, like...

116
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,840
like a bear.

117
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,260
And remember at Steve's,\Nwhen Barb cut herself?

118
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,930
- And then, last night, the deer...\N- Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

119
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,240
One sec.

120
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,680
Sharks can detect blood\Nin one part per million.

121
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,730
That's one drop of blood in a million,

122
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,060
and they can smell it\Nfrom a quarter mile away.

123
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,830
So you're saying it can detect blood?

124
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,920
It's just a theory.

125
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
We could test it.

126
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,130
But if it works...

127
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,010
At least we'll know it's coming.

128
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,790
Honey, are you up?

129
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,380
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

130
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,010
I, uh, made some blueberry pancakes.

131
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,770
I'll be down in a second.

132
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,310
Your mom doesn't knock?

133
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,830
- Hi. Scott Clarke?\N- Uh, yes.

134
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,950
The same Scott Clarke\Nwho teaches science and AV

135
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,420
- at Hawkins Middle?\N- The very same.

136
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,540
Oh, wonderful.

137
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,130
And we're making a newsletter,\Nwhich we'll send out monthly.

138
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,130
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

139
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,130
as well as how-to articles,\Nwhich the kids write themselves.

140
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,630
Oh, that's neat.

141
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,620
What we're really trying\Nto do here, Mr. Clarke...

142
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,010
Uh, please, call me Scott.

143
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,640
Scott.

144
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,640
What we're trying to do here, Scott, is\Nto connect kids from all over the state

145
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,730
and give them the\Nsupport and encouragement

146
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,810
to pursue careers in technology.

147
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,720
We feel these are the kinds of kids\Nthat are going to make Indiana proud.

148
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,240
I agree, yes. Completely.

149
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,320
So, you know any kids you\Nthink might wanna participate?

150
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,130
Oh, I have a few in mind.

151
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,590
I just... I can't believe\Nshe didn't come back.

152
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,670
- She's gotta be close.\N- She said it wasn't safe.

153
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,300
She just messed up the compasses\Nbecause she wanted to protect us.

154
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,550
- She didn't betray us.\N- Mike, calm down.

155
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,940
I shouldn't have yelled at her.\NI never should've done that.

156
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,560
- Mike, this isn't your fault.\N- Yeah, it's Lucas'.

157
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,780
It wasn't his fault, either.

158
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,940
- It wasn't his fault?\N- No.

159
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,730
So you're saying he\Nwasn't way out of line?

160
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,360
- Totally, but so were you!\N- What?

161
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,110
- And so was Eleven.\N- Oh, give me a break!

162
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,360
No, Mike, you give me a break!

163
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,910
All three of you were being\Na bunch of little assholes!

164
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,530
I was the only reasonable one.

165
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,280
But the bottom line\Nis... you pushed first.

166
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,250
And you know the rule.\NYou draw first blood...

167
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,080
No! No way! I'm not shaking his hand.

168
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,710
- You're shaking his hand!\N- No, I'm not.

169
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,840
This isn't a discussion.\NThis is the rule of law.

170
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,730
Obey or be banished from the\Nparty. Do you wanna be banished?

171
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,690
- No.\N- Good.

172
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,300
Where are we going?

173
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,680
Where do you think?\NWe're going to get Lucas.

174
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,700
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

175
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,390
Today is a very special day.

176
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,180
Do you know why?

177
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,940
Because today, we make history.

178
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,020
Today, we make contact.

179
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,680
Here you go.

180
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,830
Ah... yum.

181
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,250
Okay. Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

182
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,360
Where is Nancy? I thought\Nshe was coming down.

183
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,650
She is.

184
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,780
Uh, she was. I don't know.

185
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,240
Nancy, what's taking so long?

186
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,950
Nancy?

187
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,720
Nancy, come on.

188
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,900
Nan...

189
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,890
What do you want?

190
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,020
I drew first blood, so...

191
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,120
Okay, I'll shake.

192
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,020
On one condition.

193
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,150
We forget the weirdo and\Ngo straight to the gate.

194
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,650
- Then the deal's off.\N- Fine!

195
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,440
- Fine!\N- No, no, not fine!

196
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,840
Guys, seriously?

197
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,170
Do you even remember what\Nhappened on the Bloodstone Pass?

198
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,080
We couldn't agree on what path\Nto take, so we split up the party

199
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
and those trolls took us out one by one.

200
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,890
And it all went to shit.\NAnd we were all disabled!

201
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,840
So we stick together, no matter what!

202
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Yeah, I agree. But this is the\Nparty, right here in this room.

203
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,850
- El is one of us now.\N- Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

204
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,180
Never will be. She's\Na liar, a traitor...

205
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,060
She was just trying to keep us safe!

206
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,960
She didn't mean to hurt\Nyou. It was an accident!

207
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,980
An accident?

208
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,020
All right, accident or not...

209
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,150
- admit it, it was a little awesome.\N- Awesome?

210
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,150
Yeah, she threw you in\Nthe air with her mind!

211
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,950
I could have been killed!

212
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,820
Which is exactly why we\Nneed her. She's a weapon!

213
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,490
Do you seriously wanna fight the\NDemogorgon with your wrist rocket?

214
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,450
That's like R2-D2 going\Nto fight Darth Vader.

215
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,430
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

216
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,580
If you two wanna waste your time\Nlooking for a traitor, go ahead,

217
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,980
'cause I'm not spending my\Ntime on her anymore. No way!

218
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,440
I'm going to the gate.\NI'm gonna find Will.

219
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,210
It's okay, Eleven.

220
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,780
Don't be frightened.\NThese are all friends.

221
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,950
They're just here to watch.

222
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,810
Don't focus on them.

223
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,450
Stay in here, like before.

224
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,120
Yes, Papa.

225
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,570
Now, remember. Whatever\Nit is, it can't hurt you.

226
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,260
Not from here. So there's\Nnothing to be frightened of.

227
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,470
It's reaching out to you...

228
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,370
'cause it wants you.

229
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,080
Hmm?

230
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,390
It's calling you...

231
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,230
so don't turn away from it this time.

232
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,650
I want you to find it.

233
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,820
Understand?

234
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,820
Yes.

235
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,480
Are you lost?

236
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,280
Is your mom here?

237
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,950
Your dad?

238
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,910
Mouth breather.

239
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,050
- What should we do?\N- Uh...

240
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,510
Call the police.

241
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,540
Excuse me. Young lady! You\Nknow you have to pay for those!

242
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,330
Hey! Stop right...

243
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,840
Please.

244
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,000
You have to pay for those!

245
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,610
Stop right there! Thief! Thief!

246
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,200
Can I help you?

247
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,330
Hi, we're looking for Terry\NIves. Does she live here?

248
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,390
- Who's asking?\N- The Hawkins chief of police.

249
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,090
And you want to talk to my sister?

250
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,020
Well, if your sister's Terry\NIves, then, yeah, we do.

251
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,680
Okay, well, you can come in,

252
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,890
but if you want Terry\Nto tell you anything,

253
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,060
you're about five years too late.

254
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,540
Terry, you have some visitors.

255
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,150
Hello. My name's Joyce Byers.

256
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,280
Uh, this is Hopper. We\Ndrove over from Hawkins.

257
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,740
Um, you see, uh, my son...

258
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,080
he's been missing for almost a week now,

259
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,330
and, um, we were wondering\Nif we could talk to you

260
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,040
about your daughter, Jane?

261
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,140
If there's anything that you could\Ntell us about when she was taken...

262
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,940
What was your relationship\Nwith Dr. Brenner?

263
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,230
You guys keep in touch?

264
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,930
This is, uh... this is him.

265
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,470
This is Will.

266
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,310
Uh, you may have seen\Nhim on... on the news.

267
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,640
- Uh...\N- What's wrong with her?

268
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,460
I told you, you're wasting your time.

269
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,640
This is weird without Lucas.

270
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,620
- He should've shaken my hand.\N- He's just jealous.

271
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,670
What are you talking about?

272
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,300
Sometimes, your total\Nobliviousness just blows my mind.

273
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,160
He's your best friend, right?

274
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,240
- Yeah... I mean, I don't know.\N- It's fine. I get it.

275
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,020
I didn't get here\Nuntil the fourth grade.

276
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,830
He had the advantage\Nof living next door.

277
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,250
But none of that matters.

278
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,000
What matters is that\Nhe is your best friend.

279
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,570
And then this girl shows up and\Nstarts living in your basement,

280
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,630
and all you ever want to\Ndo is pay attention to her.

281
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,970
- That's not true.\N- Yes, it is. And you know it.

282
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,640
And he knows it. But no\None ever says anything

283
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,180
until you both start punching\Nand yelling at each other

284
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,730
like goblins with\Nintelligence scores of zero.

285
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,480
- Now everything's weird.\N- He's not my best friend.

286
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,230
- Yeah, right.\N- I mean, he is, but so are you.

287
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,730
- And so is Will.\N- Can't have more than one best friend.

288
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,530
- Says who?\N- Says logic.

289
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,220
Well, I call bull on your logic,\Nbecause you're my best friend, too.

290
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,240
Okay.

291
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,870
Whoa.

292
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,250
You don't think...

293
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,770
Uh... definitely.

294
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,930
Are you ready?

295
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,770
She was a part of some study in college.

296
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,230
- MK Ultra?\N- Yeah, that's the one.

297
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,070
Was, uh, started in the '50s.

298
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,570
By the time Terry got involved,

299
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,860
it was supposed to be ramping down,\Nbut the drugs just got crazier.

300
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,490
Messed her up good.

301
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,930
This was the CIA that ran this?

302
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,620
You and Terry would've gotten along.\N"The Man," with a big capital "M."

303
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,170
They'd pay... you know,

304
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,210
a couple hundred bucks\Nto people like my sister,

305
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,970
give 'em drugs,\Npsychedelics. LSD, mostly.

306
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,840
And then they'd strip her naked and\Nput her in these isolation tanks.

307
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,760
- Isolation tanks?\N- Yeah.

308
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,890
These big bathtubs, basically,

309
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,600
filled with salt water, so\Nyou can float around in there.

310
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,350
You lose any sense of, uh...

311
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,230
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

312
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,610
They wanted to expand the\Nboundaries of the mind.

313
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,070
Real hippie crap.

314
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,740
I... I mean, it's not like they were\Nforcing her to do any of this stuff.

315
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,080
The thing is, though, is that

316
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,240
she didn't know she was\Npregnant at the time.

317
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,850
Jane.

318
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,730
Do you have any pictures of her?

319
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,820
I don't think you guys understand.

320
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,110
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

321
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,310
She keeps all of this up.\NBeen doing it for 12 years.

322
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,400
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

323
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,280
like she's gonna come home someday.

324
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,840
Says she's special.\NBorn with "abilities."

325
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,720
Abilities?

326
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,370
You read any Stephen King?

327
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,010
You guys look scared, actually.

328
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,940
I mean, it's all make-believe.

329
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,840
What... what kind of abilities?

330
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,640
Telepathy, telekinesis...

331
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,540
You know, shit you\Ncan do with your mind.

332
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,560
That's why the big,\Nbad Man stole Jane away.

333
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,110
Papa!

334
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,190
Her baby's a weapon,\Noff fighting the commies.

335
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,450
You know, the doctors all\Nsay it's a coping mechanism.

336
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,240
You know, to deal with the guilt.

337
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,300
Do you think there is any chance\Nshe could be telling the truth?

338
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,660
About having had the kid.

339
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,540
There is no birth certificate,\Nnothing from the hospital.

340
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,710
Doctors and nurses all\Nconfirm that she miscarried.

341
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,980
Yeah, but that could've\Nbeen covered up. Right?

342
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,990
Like I said, you and Terry\Nwould've gotten along.

343
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,080
Oh, man.

344
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,850
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

345
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,720
What you kids doin' with all this?

346
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,160
Um...

347
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,020
- Monster hunting.\N- Huh.

348
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,420
"Monster hunting"?

349
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,800
You know, last week...

350
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,700
I was shopping for a new top\NI thought Steve might like.

351
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,620
It took me and Barb all weekend.

352
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,580
It seemed like life or death,\Nyou know? And... and now...

353
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,230
You're shopping for bear\Ntraps with Jonathan Byers.

354
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,270
Yeah.

355
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,770
What's the weirdest part?

356
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,110
Me or the bear trap?

357
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,340
You. It's definitely you.

358
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,700
Hey, Nance!

359
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,270
Can't wait to see your movie.

360
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,750
What the hell was that?

361
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,540
I don't know.

362
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,290
What?

363
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,490
What?

364
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,180
Hey! Where are you going?

365
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,510
Nancy, wait!

366
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,390
Nancy!

367
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,940
- I can't believe it.\N- These kids!

368
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,360
Jesus.

369
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,780
Wow.

370
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,060
Wait!

371
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,730
Tommy, you write like a three-year-old.

372
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,120
- Shut up!\N- I didn't know you could spell.

373
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,840
Aw, hey there, princess!

374
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,510
Uh-oh! She looks upset.

375
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,040
- Oh!\N- Damn!

376
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,460
What is wrong with you?

377
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,200
What's wrong with me?\NWhat's wrong with you?

378
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,460
I was worried about you.

379
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,970
I can't believe that I was\Nactually worried about you.

380
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,970
- What are you talking about?\N- I wouldn't lie if I were you.

381
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,220
You don't want to be known\Nas the lying slut now, do you?

382
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,530
Speak of the devil.

383
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,870
Hi.

384
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,700
You came by last night?

385
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,270
Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize?

386
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,110
Look, I don't know what you think\Nyou saw, but it wasn't like that.

387
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,570
What, you just let him\Ninto your room to... study?

388
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,240
Or for another pervy photo session?

389
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,100
- We were just...\N- You were just what?

390
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,790
Finish that sentence.

391
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,520
Finish the sentence.

392
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,030
Go to hell, Nancy.

393
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,220
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

394
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,840
You know what, Byers? I'm\Nactually kind of impressed.

395
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,990
I always took you for a\Nqueer, but I guess you're just

396
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,560
a little screw-up like your father.

397
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,310
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,\Nthat house is full of screw-ups.

398
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,890
You know, I guess I\Nshouldn't really be surprised.

399
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,190
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

400
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,440
- Jonathan, leave it.\N- I mean, your mom...

401
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,360
I'm not even surprised what\Nhappened to your brother.

402
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,480
Steve, shut up!

403
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,570
I'm sorry I have to\Nbe the one to tell you,

404
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,990
but the Byers, their family,\Nit's a disgrace to the entire...

405
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,990
Steve!

406
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,740
Oh!

407
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,430
Steve.

408
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,250
Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys!

409
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,510
- Get off of him, seriously!\N- Kick his ass, man!

410
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,610
Get off! Stop!

411
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,210
Get in there, he's\Ngoing to hurt himself!

412
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,070
Hey. Hey! Get out of here! Get\Nout of here! Get out of here!

413
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,470
Jonathan, stop! Stop!\NYou're going to hurt him!

414
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,520
Jonathan, stop!

415
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,730
- Cops!\N- Guys... Jonathan, get off of him!

416
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,980
- Stop it!\N- Cops! Come on!

417
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,980
- Stop it! Come on!\N- Cops!

418
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,230
- You have to stop!\N- Just go, Carol!

419
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,780
Stop it!

420
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,760
Hey, he's had enough, man!\NI said he's had enough!

421
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,320
- Kids! All right!\N- Stop it!

422
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,410
Oh! My nose!

423
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,280
Calm him down!

424
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,950
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

425
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,920
Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh. Come\Nhere, little guys! Come here!

426
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,580
- Get off!\N- I got this one!

427
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,610
Get back here! Get back\Nhere, you little punks!

428
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,640
Good gift for a college student...

429
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,860
Well, thank you for your\Ntime. We appreciate it.

430
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,160
Hmm, yeah, I'm sorry I\Ncouldn't be of more help.

431
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,210
- Good luck.\N- Thank you.

432
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,010
Hey...

433
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,640
What?

434
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,770
We're gonna find him.

435
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,980
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

436
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,840
We're close.

437
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,930
Twelve years? Twelve years\Nshe's been looking for her...

438
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,930
And then she shows up at\NBenny's five nights ago,

439
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,230
which means we've got a chance.

440
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,790
You know what I would give?

441
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,060
For a chance?

442
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,870
You know what I would give?

443
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,440
Hey, Chief, you there?

444
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,590
- Hey, Chief?\N- Yeah, go ahead.

445
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,450
Yeah, a fight broke out here and...

446
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,740
- Cal, I don't have time for this.\N- It's Jonathan Byers.

447
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,890
You haven't seen Joyce, have you?

448
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,680
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

449
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,890
You, yes. Him, no.

450
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,220
He assaulted a police officer.

451
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,690
Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

452
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,810
You and your boyfriend\Nhave big plans, do you?

453
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,100
He's not my boyfriend.

454
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,710
I think you better tell him that.

455
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,440
What?

456
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,300
Only love makes you\Nthat crazy, sweetheart.

457
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,210
And that damn stupid.

458
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,060
Found some ice.

459
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,600
Thanks.

460
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,700
Everything okay?

461
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,580
Yeah.

462
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,290
Everything's fine.

463
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,220
El!

464
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,140
Eleven!

465
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,480
- Eleven! El!\N- El!

466
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,340
Eleven!

467
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,650
Eleven!

468
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,520
- Hey, stop. Do you hear that?\N- What?

469
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,700
El!

470
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,740
El?

471
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,540
Hey, there, Frogface.

472
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,480
Toothless.

473
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,450
Shit! Run, Mike!

474
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,590
- What?\N- Run! Come on!

475
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,820
You're dead, Wheeler.

476
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,620
Move, Mike!

477
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,300
Mike, come on, run!

478
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,450
Cramp!

479
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,200
Just keep going!

480
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,470
Keep going!

481
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,060
Shit!

482
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,940
- Stay back!\N- Don't come any closer!

483
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,140
Nice throw, numbnuts.

484
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,140
Get off! Get off me!

485
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,100
Let him go! Let him go!

486
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,150
- Stay back, or I cut him!\N- What do you want?

487
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,440
I want to know how you did it!

488
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,890
How I did what?

489
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,270
I know you did something to me.

490
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,170
Some nerdy science\Nshit to make me do that.

491
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,500
You mean piss your pants?

492
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,160
Our friend has superpowers,

493
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,660
and she squeezed your\Ntiny bladder with her mind.

494
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,120
Shut up!

495
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,540
I think I should save Toothless\Nhere a trip to the dentist.

496
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,330
Help him lose the\Nrest of his baby teeth.

497
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,250
Let him go. Let him go!

498
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,540
I'll let him go, sure.

499
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,920
But first... it's your turn.

500
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,130
My turn for what?

501
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,860
Wet yourself.

502
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,680
- What?\N- Jump...

503
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,220
or Toothless here gets an\Nearly trip to the dentist.

504
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,660
Stop! No!

505
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,450
I'll cut him right now!

506
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,400
All right, just hold on! Hold on!

507
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,820
Mike, don't do it. I don't\Nneed my baby teeth, Mike!

508
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,780
Mike, seriously, don't!

509
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,550
Mike, don't do it!

510
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,470
Seriously, don't do it,\Nman! Seriously, don't!

511
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,450
Troy, I don't think\Nthis is a good idea, man.

512
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,890
Mike, don't!

513
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,600
Dentist's office opens in five...

514
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,120
Four! Three!

515
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,980
- Two!\N- Mike!

516
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,080
One!

517
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,830
Holy shit.

518
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

519
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,580
She broke my arm! My arm!

520
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,720
Go.

521
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,890
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

522
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:51,630
Go!

523
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,650
Yeah, that's right! You better run!

524
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,840
She's our friend and she's crazy!

525
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,300
You come back here and she'll kill you!

526
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,350
You hear me? She'll kill\Nyou, you sons of bitches!

527
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,490
She'll kill you, you hear me?

528
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,880
El, are you okay?

529
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,570
El?

530
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,390
Mike... I'm sorry.

531
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,950
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

532
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,410
The gate...

533
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,710
I opened it.

534
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm the monster.

535
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,870
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

536
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,540
You saved me.

537
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,510
Do you understand? You saved me.

538
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,060
I have eyes on 'em now.\NThey're heading home.
