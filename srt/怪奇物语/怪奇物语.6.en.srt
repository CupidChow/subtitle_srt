00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,680
The gate.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,820
I don't understand.\NYou've seen this before?

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,470
- Not exactly.\N- Then what, exactly?

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,830
- All you need to know is it's bad.\N- It's really bad.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,960
Like, end-of-the-human-race-as-we-know-it\Nkind of bad.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,400
And you know about this how?

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,280
Um, Steve? Where's your Russian friend?

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,900
Shit.

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,830
Halt! Halt!

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,450
Shit.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,330
- Go, go, go, go, go!\N- Shit.

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,420
Move! Let's move!

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,170
Go! Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,380
Go, go, go!

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,640
Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,140
Holy shit! Holy shit! Shit!\NHoly shit! Holy shit!

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,810
Holy shit!

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,900
- Guards! Go!\N- This way!

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,620
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!\N- Whoa!

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,610
- Come on! Go, go, go, go, go!\N- Come on!

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,360
- Shit!\N- This way!

22
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,410
- Come on, quick!\N- Hold the door!

23
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,120
Robin!

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,620
Shit!

25
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,040
- Help me, come on!\N- Here! Come on, let's go!

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,670
- Come on!\N- Go! Just get out of here!

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,760
Go, come on, now!

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
No! Just go get some help, okay?

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,050
What are you doing?!

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,590
Go!

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
I won't forget you!

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,930
Go!

33
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,530
He's here.

34
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,000
- Shit.\N- Nancy!

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,880
Run!

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Damn!

37
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,470
Hey!

38
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,140
Come on!

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,310
Hey!

40
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,100
Hey, hey, hey! Two at a time!

41
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,260
Oh, my God.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,810

43
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,320
No! Nancy!

44
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,400
Jonathan!

45
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,160
No, no! Nancy!

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,290
Stairs.

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Goddamn it!

48
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,290

49
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,430
- Go.\N- Nancy!

50
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,190
Are you okay? Are you okay?

51
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,910

Excuse me. Excuse me.

What... what are you doing?\NWhat's... what's this doing here?

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,930
- What?\N- Your stand.

63
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,350
It's right in the main thoroughfare.

64
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,690
Where do you want it, sir?

65
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,440
Over there with the rest\Nof the goddamn food stalls.

66
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,530
It isn't rocket science.

67
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,070
Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself?

68
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,080
My friends in state PD,

69
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,880
highway patrol,\Nthey're all on the lookout.

70
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,090
I got eyes everywhere.

71
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,630
The second he pops up...

72
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
I get a call.

73
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,090
A call?

74
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,560
Yes. A call.

75
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,850
I mean, what more do you people\Nwant me to do?

76
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,430
We want you to find him.

77
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,520
Let me explain something to you.

78
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,730
This man is a moron, okay?

79
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,940
He's driving around in\Na yellow convertible, for Christ's sakes.

80
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,530
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

81
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,200
I will find him.

82
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,700
And, when I do,

83
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,160
may I suggest\Nyou bring some backup with you this time?

84
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,870
- Backup.\N- Some comrades.

85
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,790
Since last time, he got the better of you.

86
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,050
Please...

87
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,180
I... I didn't mean that.

88
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,260
You... You don't need backup.

89
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,680
This man is your fault,

90
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,060
your problem.

91
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,480
You're lucky you still breathe.

92
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,850
Very lucky.

93
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Please.

94
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,780
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,650
I... I have a bad temper.

96
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,990
I'm going to therapy.

97
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,200
You have one day to find this man for me.

98
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,700
Nod if you understand.

99
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,400
Two Whoppers,

100
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,230
extra ketchup, large fry,

101
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,940
pack of Marlboro Reds,

102
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,640
and one extra-large...

103
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,610
Slurpee.

104
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,860
Burger King is nowhere near the 7-Eleven,\Nby the way.

105
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,240
Never said it was.

106
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,490
Let's try this again. Joyce.

107
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Alexei,

108
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,990
the generators,

109
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,660
what are they powering?

110
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,630
And tell him that we know\Nit is not the Starcourt Mall,

111
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,740
so he can stop selling us that crap.

112
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,790
Those generators you were\Nworking on, what are you powering?

113
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,180
We know it's not the mall.

114
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,890
This tastes like\Nshit strawberry.

115
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,840
- What'd he say?\N- He says,

116
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,090
"It's strawberry."

117
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,230
I'm sorry?

118
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,940
His... Slurpee.

119
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,340
He says it's strawberry.

120
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,890
So what?

121
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,080
Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean...

122
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,780
Well, they didn't have cherry.

123
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,580
They didn't have it.

124
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,740
And it doesn't matter,

125
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,740
because it all tastes the same, okay?

126
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,460
It is sugar on ice. You tell him that.

127
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
Tell him what?

128
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,040
You tell him that it all tastes\Nthe goddamn same!

129
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,430
It's all the same.

130
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,130
Sugar on ice. No difference.

131
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,980
Tell that stupid man\Nit is not the same in the slightest,

132
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,310
and I would like the cherry I requested.

133
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,980
He respectfully disagrees.

134
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,560
It's not the same at all,

135
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,390
and he would like...

136
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,810
cherry.

137
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,280
Oh, yeah? You tell him...\Nhe can forget it.

138
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,360
He says forget it. No cherry.

139
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,040
No cherry, no deal.

140
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,180
He says,

141
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,290
"No cherry...

142
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
no deal."

143
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
Yeah.

144
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Hm.

145
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,310
Mm.

146
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,830
Oh, shit!

147
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,930
No, Hop...

148
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

149
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,280
- I'm not gonna hurt him!\N- What are you doing?

150
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,530
Come on! Come on!

151
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,890
I'm just giving him an opportunity

152
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,580
to get his own damn...

153
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,690
cherry Slurpee!

154
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,040
Jim, that man is an enemy of the state.

155
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,630
Yeah, who's been jerking us around\Nfor a full day!

156
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,180
I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what?

157
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,180
He wants a helicopter to charter him\Nto his own private island.

158
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,280
I have dealt with assholes like this

159
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,060
my entire life.

160
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,680
Yesterday in the woods,\Nhe could've escaped,

161
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,810
but he didn't.

162
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,190
He stuck with us.

163
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,030
Why do you think that is?

164
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,780
It's because...

165
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,880
he's scared.

166
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,490
He's scared.

167
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,290
Not of us,

168
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,040
of them.

169
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,880
He's scared of\Nthat seven-foot-tall Russian freak

170
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,680
who could've killed him\Njust as easily as us.

171
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,390
Smirnoff knows

172
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,590
that if he runs back to his comrades\Nwithout a scratch on him,

173
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,440
they're gonna think that\Nhe spilled his guts.

174
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,690
So, whether he likes it or not, we...

175
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,340
are the best chance he's got.

176
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,610
Ooh!

177
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,330
I give him 30 seconds\Nbefore he comes knocking on that door,

178
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,740
right back into our arms,

179
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,330

So, when we set fire to the hub,

208
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,480
we drew the Demodogs away\Nso El could close the gate.

209
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,260
But now, for some insane reason,

210
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,350
the Russians appear to be trying\Nto reopen it,

211
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,060
which just destroys everything\Nwe risked our lives for.

212
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,280
By "we," you're including Lucas?

213
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,350
Yes, of course.

214
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,450
So, all that shit you told me,\NLucas was there?

215
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,450
- Yeah.\N- My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair?

216
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,530
Yes!

217
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,860
I don't believe you.

218
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Wait, so you believe everything about El\Nand the gate

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,480
and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer,

220
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,000
but you question\Nyour brother's involvement?

221
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,630
That's correct.

222
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,200
Makes total sense.

223
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
- Um, you need help with that?\N- No.

224
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,830
- Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so...\N- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

225
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,380
All right, so if we don't find a more\Nefficient method to stop these fans,

226
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,850
we're never gonna find help,\Nand your ice cream buddies are screwed.

227
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,630
Yeah, with that attitude, they are.\NJee-zus!

228
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,180
I'm just being realistic.

229
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,850
I mean, we've made it about\Npoint-three miles in nine hours.

230
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,100
Then we had to walk three hours\Ndown that tunnel,

231
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,900
so I'd estimate ten miles back\Nto the elevator,

232
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,980
which should take us approximately\Ntwelve-and-a-half days.

233
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,580
Did you just do all of that in your head?

234
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,780
I'm good with numbers.

235
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,130
Holy shit. You're a nerd.

236
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Come again?

237
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,000
You... are... a... nerd.

238
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,300
- Okay, you better take that back, nerd.\N- Can't put the truth back in the box.

239
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,210
- But it's not the truth.\N- Let's examine the facts, shall we?

240
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,050
Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently.

241
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,100
That was\Na pretty straightforward equation.

242
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,300
Fact number two:\Nyou're a political junkie.

243
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,900
Just because I don't agree\Nwith Communism as an ideology...

244
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,850
Fact number three:\Nyou love My Little Pony.

245
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,480
And what does My Little Pony\Nhave to do with this?

246
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,480
Ah, let's recall the ponies'\Nlatest adventure, shall we?

247
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,100
The evil centaur team and Tirek

248
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,530
turns Applejack into a dragon\Nat Midnight Castle,

249
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,130
and then Megan and the other ponies\Nhave to use Moochick's magic

250
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,510
to defeat his rainbow of darkness,

251
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,450
saving them from a lifetime\Nof enslavement.

252
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,110
All the pink in the world can't disguise\Nthe irrefutable fact

253
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,000
that centaurs and castles\Nand dragons and magic

254
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,700
are all standard nerd tropes.

255
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,080
Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy.

256
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,630
Ergo, you, Erica,

257
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,550
are a nerd.

258
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,800
And how do you know so much\Nabout My Little Pony?

259
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,680
Because I'm...

260
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,180
a nerd.

261
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,650
Let's go...

262
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
nerd.

263
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,100
You...

264
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,230
That one stung.

265
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,900
Who do you work for?

266
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,250
For the millionth time,\NI work at Scoops Ahoy!

267
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Scoops Ahoy.

268
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,130
What the hell?!

269
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,950
Look at my outfit!

270
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,410
Look at my outfit!

271
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,630
You think I just wear this?!\NThink I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform?

272
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,710
How did you get in?

273
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,380
I already told you.

274
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,800
I told you before.

275
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,230
My delivery didn't come,

276
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,060
and my friends and I, we thought that\Nit was left at the loading dock,

277
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,510
so we went in the room,\Nand then it turned into an elevator,

278
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,100
and then... and then we dropped and then,

279
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,550
next thing we know,\NI open my eyes,

280
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,450
and we're in this...

281
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,400
wonderful facility.

282
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,030
But I swear to God,

283
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,200
nobody knows about us,\Nnobody saw us.

284
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,750
You could just let us go, all right?

285
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,200
And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this,\Nokay?

286
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,830
Shit happens, life goes on.

287
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,830
And, uh... ice... ice cream.

288
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,300
Ice cream, okay?

289
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,060
You guys know what ice cream is.\NEverybody loves ice cream.

290
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream\Nor if that's considered gelato.

291
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,050
I don't know what's what,\Nbut whatever you guys want, seriously.

292
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,210
USS Butterscotch,\NI mean, you gotta try it.

293
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,550
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya!

294
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,060
I like this guy!

295
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,730
"USS... Butterscotch."

296
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,160
Who do you work for?

297
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,330
Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously...

298
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,430
Get your hands off me!

299
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,510
Hey...

300
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,850
Steve?

301
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,510
Steve? Steve?

302
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Steve?

303
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,980
What did you do to him? What did you do?

304
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,700
Put them in the chairs.

305
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,500
Don't touch me!

306
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,780
Steve...

307
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,500
Steve, wake up. Steve?

308
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,330
What did you do?!

309
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,550
Don't touch him.

310
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,210
Steve? Steve, can you hear me?

311
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,250
I think your friend\Nneed a doctor.

312
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
Good thing...

313
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,980
we have the very best.

314
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,830
You are going to regret that,\Nlittle bitch.

315
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,300
Bastards.

316
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,000
Let us outta here!

317
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,250
Bastards! Let us out! Let us out!

318
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,550
It can't be good for her\Nto be in there for this long.

319
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,900
Mike, you need to relax.

320
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,460
What if she gets brain damage\Nor something?

321
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,700
- Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing?\N- No, it's not. He made it up.

322
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,130
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.

323
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,780
- Oh, and you do?\N- No, I...

324
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,550
Yes, from The Hawkins Post.

325
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,710
I... I called a couple days ago about the...

326
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,830
Yes, yes, um...

327
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,210
I was just... following up\Nto see if anything else had gone missing,

328
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,010
or if... Okay.

329
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,760
Um, sorry to bother...

330
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,280
- Who's next?\N- There is no next.

331
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,600
Unless you want to start calling\Nrandom people's homes.

332
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,080
- It doesn't make sense.\N- What part of any of this makes sense?

333
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,310
There's a pattern, okay?\NA consistency to their behavior.

334
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,710
They've been feeding on these chemicals\Nsince this started,

335
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,630
and... and, what, they just stop,\Nout of the blue?

336
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,780
Maybe they have all the chemicals\Nthey need.

337
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,950
Maybe they've all turned into those...\Nthings.

338
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,530
But what about the source?

339
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,300
I mean, did the Mind Flayer\Njust suddenly stop infecting people?

340
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,460
And even if the flayed are monsters now,\Nwhy can't El find them?

341
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,550
Okay, can you guys settle an argument\Nfor us?

342
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,550
Who do you think should decide\NEl's limits?

343
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,960
Mike or Eleven?

344
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,050
The way that you frame that\Nis such bullshit.

345
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,710
It's not bullshit, Mike.\NThis is your whole problem.

346
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,180
And it's also precisely the reason why\Nshe dumped your ass.

347
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
El dumped you?

348
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,460
Yeah, because she is conspiring\Nagainst me.

349
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,430
She's corrupting her.

350
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,680
No, enlightening her.

351
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,310
The fact is, she's not yours.

352
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,910
She's her own person,\Nfully capable of making her own decisions.

353
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,760
She's risking her life for no reason.

354
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,700
For no reason?

355
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,150
Mike, the flayed are out there\Ndoing God knows what.

356
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,000
- Killing, flaying...\N- Transforming into monsters.

357
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,410
And El's not stupid.

358
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,610
She knows her abilities\Nbetter than any of us.

359
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,080
- Exactly, thank you.\N- And she is her own person.

360
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,550
- Exactly.\N- With her own free will.

361
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,710
Exactly.

362
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,750
El has saved the world twice,\Nand Mike still doesn't trust her.

363
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,100
You wanna talk about trust, really?\NAfter you made Eleven spy on us?

364
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,460
- Wait, what?\N- Oh, she didn't tell you this?

365
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,880
- No.\N- Your girlfriend used El's powers

366
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,350
- to spy on us.\N- No, no, no, I did not make her.

367
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,550
It was her idea.

368
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,600
And why are we even talking about this,\Nseriously?

369
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,810
Yeah, who cares?

370
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,710
- I care.\N- Yeah.

371
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,730
- I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.\N- We were just joking around.

372
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,700
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was\Ntaking a massive shit or something?

373
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,950
- You weren't.\N- But what if I was?

374
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,610
- Then gross!\N- Seriously, Mike?

375
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,530
I'm just trying to demonstrate\Nhow careless Max is with Eleven's powers.

376
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,910
In fact, how careless all of you are.

377
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,510
You're treating her like some kind\Nof machine when she's not a machine,

378
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,300
and I don't want her to die\Nlooking for the flayed

379
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,210
when they've obviously vanished\Noff the face of the Earth.

380
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,930
So can we please just come up\Nwith a new plan

381
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,860
because I love her\Nand I can't lose her again.

382
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,660
What's going on?

383
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,380
Nothing. Nothing.

384
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,760
Just a family discussion.

385
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,210
Oh.

386
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,560
I found him.

387
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,310
Found who?

388
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,810
He calls it the key,\Nand this key emits a great energy.

389
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,560
It requires much strength, power.

390
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,330
Those houses,\Nlike the one you found,

391
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,050
they're located near, uh, transformers.

392
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,000
They're stealing\Nfrom your town's power grid.

393
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,380
Why build this key here? Why are they not\Ndoing this in their own backyard?

394
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
What are they trying to do,\Nblow us to smithereens?

395
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,900
There were many of these, uh, keys before\Nin Russia,

396
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,060
but they turned out wrong.

397
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,310
They had to come to where the...\Nwhere the, uh...

398
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,730
Where the what?

399
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,350
- I don't understand what he's saying.\N- I thought you were fluent.

400
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,410
Oh, I'm sorry.

401
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,280
Are my free translation services\Nnot good enough for you?

402
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,330
Because you can just go ahead\Nand file your complaint

403
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,000
right up my ass!

404
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,000
What is Smirnoff doing?

405
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,910
He's showing me.

406
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,130
Oh, okay.

407
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,380
Uh, he says the straw,

408
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,850
they're using it to penetrate a hole

409
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,260
in... a box?

410
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,650
Okay, sorry, sorry.

411
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,730
The straw represents the key,\Nwhich emits a great energy.

412
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,400
They're using this energy...

413
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,610
to break through a barrier,

414
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,910
to open...

415
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,330
a doorway.

416
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,330
A doorway between worlds.

417
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,010
But it seems this key\Nwas only half the equation.

418
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,260
Location... Location was the other half.

419
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,560
Oh, what...

420
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,900
In Hawkins,\Nthis door had been opened once.

421
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,280
It was still...

422
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,610
healing.

423
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,910
Jesus Christ.

424
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,450
So, this door is open now?

425
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,750
He says it is...

426
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,710
opening.

427
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,850
- Where are you going?\N- To call our children.

428
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,350
Can we watch Looney Tunes now?

429
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,850
Nyet.

430
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,450
- Can I help you with something?\N- Whiskey.

431
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,860
- You have whiskey?\N- No, but I do have vodka.

432
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,350
Oh!

433
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,450
If there's a way to start this key,\Nthere's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah?

434
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,770
Turn it off?

435
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,030
- Right.\N- Right?

436
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,050
The key, is there a way to turn it off?

437
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,520
He says,\N"Of course he could turn it off. Could...

438
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,880
Edison not turn off a lamp,\Ncould Bell not hang up a phone?"

439
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,100
Cocky bastard. "But..."

440
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,520
But what?

441
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,800
But he is now...

442
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,650
"naked."

443
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,900
Sorry, "exposed." Compromised.

444
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,200
Hey, I will get you there.

445
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,230
I will get you to your key.

446
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,680
You wanna ask him what the hell's\Nso funny about that?

447
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,920
He says he likes your courage.

448
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
You remind him of a...

449
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,130
...fat Rambo.

450
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,720
But he says that even thin Rambo\Ncouldn't get there.

451
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,480
This key, it is in an underground fortress

452
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,900
designed by the greatest Russian minds,

453
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,870
guarded by their greatest warriors.

454
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,920
Breaking in is...

455
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
impossible.

456
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,170
Jackpot.

457
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,480
Oh-ho-ho!

458
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,570
Do you even know how to drive?

459
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,650
How hard can it be? Max did it.

460
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
- Aw, come on.\N- You seriously thought

461
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,630
- they'd just leave keys in there?\N- There's gotta be a spare.

462
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,050
- Hey, Dustin?\N- Yeah?

463
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,250
How big did you say that Demogorgon was?

464
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,220
Big. Nine feet or so. Why?

465
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
Found 'em.

466
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,200
Erica?

467
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,480
What the hell is that?!

468
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,770
A deadly weapon.

469
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Could be useful.

470
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,320
- For what?\N- What do you think?

471
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,570
Taking down Commies, saving your friends.

472
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,870
Thought you were more realistic than that,\Nnerd.

473
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,650
We don't even know where they are,

474
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,870
and even if we did,\Nthere are a million guards up there

475
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,750
with weapons way deadlier than that.

476
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,580
The best thing we can do for them\Nis to get out of here and find help.

477
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,670
Easy with that.

478
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,470
Our chance of surviving, and theirs,\Nrises substantially.

479
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,470
Just trust me on this. Please?

480
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,970
Help!

481
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,150
Help!

482
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,950
- Help!\N- Hey, would you stop yelling?

483
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,620
Steve! Oh, my God!

484
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,370
Steve...

485
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,870
Are... Are you okay?

486
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,200
My ears are ringing,\Nand I can't really breathe,

487
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,370
my eye feels\Nlike it's about to pop out of my skull,

488
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,050
but, you know, apart from that,\NI'm doing pretty good.

489
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,920
Well, the good news is that\Nthey're calling you a doctor.

490
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,300
Is this his place of work?

491
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,020
I love the vibe.

492
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,920
Charming.

493
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,430
Yeah, tell me about it. So, okay,

494
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,430
do you see that table over there\Nto your right? No, your other right.

495
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,820
- Oh.\N- Yeah, okay.

496
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,220
- And do you see those scissors?\N- Uh-huh.

497
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,230
Yeah, well, I think that if we move\Nat the same time, we could get over there,

498
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,920
and then maybe I could kick the table\Nand knock them into your lap.

499
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,420
- And I could cut the binds.\N- Yeah, and we could get out of here.

500
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,450
- Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that.\N- Yeah.

501
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,170
Those morons. They left scissors in here?

502
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,120
- Yeah, morons.\N- Total morons.

503
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,950
- Okay.\N- Okay, so,

504
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,870
on the count of three, we're gonna hop.

505
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,250
- Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha.\N- All right.

506
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,830
One, two, three.

507
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,000
- Okay, that worked.\N- Okay.

508
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,650
- All right. Uh, let's try again.\N- Right.

509
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,350
One, two, three.

510
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,000
- Holy shit, this is gonna work!\N- We're close. Ready?

511
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,220
Okay, one, two, three.

512
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,020
It's okay, it's okay.

513
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,730
Don't cry. Robin.

514
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,870
Are you laughing?

515
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
- Yeah.\N- Jesus!

516
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,150
I'm sorry!

517
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm so sorry. It's just...

518
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,830
I can't believe...

519
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,170
I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base

520
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,750
with Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

521
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,670
- It's just too trippy, man.\N- We're not gonna die.

522
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,220
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

523
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,550
Just... You gotta let me\Njust think for a second.

524
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,380
Do you remember, um,\NMrs. Click's sophomore history class?

525
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,770
What?

526
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,680
Mrs. Clickity-Clackity.

527
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,430
That's what us band dweebs called her.

528
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
It was first period,

529
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,570
Tuesdays and Thursdays,\Nso you were always late.

530
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,650
And you always had the same breakfast.

531
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,370
Bacon, egg, and cheese\Non a sesame bagel.

532
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,700
I sat behind you

533
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
two days a week for a year.

534
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,580
Mister Funny.

535
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,500
Mister Cool.

536
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,600
The King of Hawkins High himself.

537
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,100
Do you even remember me\Nfrom that class?

538
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,270
Of course you don't.

539
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,900
You were a real asshole, you know that?

540
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,400
Yeah, I know.

541
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,350
But it didn't even matter.

542
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,150
It didn't matter that you were an ass.

543
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,700
I was still...

544
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,730
obsessed with you.

545
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,900
Even though all of us losers\Npretend to be above it all,

546
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,370
we still just wanna be popular...

547
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
accepted,

548
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,530
normal.

549
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,330
If it makes you feel any better,\Nhaving those things isn't all that great.

550
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,920
Seriously.

551
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,920
It just baffles me.

552
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,350
Everything that people tell you\Nis important,

553
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,600
everything that people say\Nyou should care about, it's all just...

554
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,050
...bullshit.

555
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,600
But I guess you gotta mess up\Nto figure things out, right?

556
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,820
I hope so.

557
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,230
I feel like my whole life has been...

558
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,770
one big error.

559
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,120
Yep.

560
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,700
At least it can't get any more messed up\Nthan this.

561
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,250
You know, I wish I'd known you\Nin Click's class.

562
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,200
- Yeah?\N- Really, I do.

563
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,370
Maybe you could've helped me\Npass the class.

564
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,300
Maybe instead of being here,\NI'd be on my way to college right now.

565
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,920
And I would have no idea

566
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,380
that there were evil Russians\Nbeneath our feet,

567
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:17,520
and I would be happily slinging ice cream\Nwith some other schmuck.

568
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,520
Gotta say, though,

569
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,270
I liked being your schmuck.

570
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,900
It was fun while it lasted.

571
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
It was.

572
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,650
Where were you two going?

573
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,250
Try telling the truth this time, yes?

574
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:53,500
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov\Nless painful.

575
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,680
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on.

576
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,850
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!\NWhat is that thing?

577
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,470
It will help you talk.

578
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,270
Did you even clean that thing?!

579
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,750
What's he doing now?

580
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,680
And that's not normal, right?

581
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,100
Billy staying in his room\Non the Fourth of July?

582
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,520
No, that's not normal.

583
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,570
He wants us to find him.

584
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,070
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

585
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,680
If we go to Billy, then the rest\Nof the flayed know where we are.

586
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,900
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.

587
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,120
We won't be surprised.

588
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,200
We'll know that they're coming,\Nand we will kick their flayed butts.

589
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,030
You mean El will kick their butts.

590
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,500
Papa!

591
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,580
No.

592
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,050
Rainbow.\NThree to the right, four to the left.

593
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,270
Sunflower. Rainbow.

594
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,520
- It's too risky.\N- Yeah, and unnecessary.

595
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,770
Killing the flayed\Nwon't stop the Mind Flayer.

596
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,730
We have to find out where\Nit's spreading from.

597
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,770
We have to find the source.

598
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,930
Billy knows it.

599
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,480
Billy's been there.

600
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,030
To the source.

601
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,370
- Yeah, but...\N- It's a trap. I know.

602
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,920
We can't go to Billy,

603
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,980
but I think there's another way.

604
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,170
A way for me to see where he's been.

605
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,470
El, I know you think you have to do this,\Nbut you don't.

606
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,630
It's just,\Nyou've only done this before once.

607
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,270
And your mom, she loved you,

608
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,520
and wanted you to know what happened.

609
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,130
And Billy's mind is... is sick, diseased.

610
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,180
The Mind Flayer is in him.

611
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,900
He can't hurt me.

612
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,480
Not in there.

613
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,620
We don't know that.

614
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,730
Mike.

615
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,670
I need you to trust me.

616
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,420
Yeah.

617
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,000
Just... be careful.

618
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,520
Billy.

619
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,730
Can you hear me?

620
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,620
I want to see.

621
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,120
I want to see what happened.

622
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,970
Something's wrong.

623
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,380
Stop! No! No! No!

624
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,600
No!

625
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,970
El, are you okay?

626
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,270
Are you okay?

627
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,770
I'm okay.

628
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,350
What's going on?

629
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,900
I'm... on a beach.

630
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,620
Okay, I may be dense,

631
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,430
but the last I checked,

632
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,200
there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.

633
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,170
What else do you see?

634
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,720
A woman.

635
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
She's...

636
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,830
pretty.

637
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,770
I...

638
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,580
I think she's looking at me.

639
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,430
Woo!

640
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,850
Yeah!

641
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,020
You did it!

642
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,690
There's...

643
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
a boy.

644
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,900
Did you see that?

645
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,150
Yeah, I saw that!

646
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,950
That was at least seven feet.

647
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,640
I don't know what it was,\Nbut it almost gave me a heart attack.

648
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,790
Ten more minutes?

649
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,670
- Yeah, okay, ten more minutes.\N- Okay.

650
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,170
But any longer than that,\NDad's gonna be mad, okay?

651
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,120
Okay!

652
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,470
Billy?

653
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,340
Watch out for rip currents!

654
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
I know.

655
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
It's Billy.

656
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,050
It's California.

657
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,770
It's a memory.

658
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,570
I think I see it.

659
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,190
The source.

660
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,190
Two minutes, Jim.

661
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,990
It's a secure line, but any longer\Nthan that and they could trace you.

662
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,170
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.

663
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,420
What?

664
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,520
Philadelphia Public Library.

665
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,320
Uh...

666
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,790
This is Jim Hopper...

667
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,120
uh... police chief, Hawkins.

668
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,670
I got this number\Nfrom Dr. Sam Owens.

669
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,570
What is your identification code?

670
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,870
Identification code?

671
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,840
You don't know it?

672
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,090
You must be joking.

673
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,620
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.

674
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,090
I got it.

675
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,540
You wrote it down and kept it\Nin your wallet?

676
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,890
"Antique Chariot." Listen.

677
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,590
Um, tell Owens that the Russkies\Nare opening the gate.

678
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,740
Now, he'll know what that means.

679
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,520
Not about the Russkies,\Nbut about the gate.

680
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,640
Tell him that there's an entrance\Nat Starcourt Mall.

681
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,100
I know how to get in,

682
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,740
but I need backup, a lot of backup.

683
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,570
Have him call me back here\Nat 618-625-8313.

684
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,150
Your message will be relayed.

685
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,740
- So, now what?\N- Now, we, uh...

686
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,790
we wait.

687
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,070
You compromised me, Jim.

688
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,840
You do realize that, don't you?\NI'm gonna have to relocate.

689
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,950
- How long do we wait?\N- As long as it takes.

690
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,290
How can you just sit there being calm?

691
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,870
I am not calm!

692
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,640
Our kids are in danger!

693
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,720
You said they were at the festival!

694
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,720
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!

695
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,590
What are you doing? Joyce?

696
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,100
What are you doing?

697
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,640
Philadelphia Public Library.

698
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,770
Yes, hello.

699
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,740
Uh, this is,\Nuh, Antique Chariot's partner...

700
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,490
Wheelbarrow.

701
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,620
I don't think Antique Chariot

702
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,940
properly conveyed the urgency\Nof our situation.

703
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,290
What are you doing?

704
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,370
Can't just sit around and wait for a call.

705
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,670
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm.\N- No.

706
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,240
Don't you dare patronize me!

707
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,120
I don't know who you are,

708
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,870
if you're some glorified secretary\Nor what,

709
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,000
but if you don't wanna lose your job,\Nhere's what's gonna happen.

710
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,300
When I hang up,

711
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,020
you're gonna get up off your ass,

712
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,720
and you're gonna go find Owens\Nand tell him what's going on.

713
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,020
We don't have time to talk about it\Nand neither does he.

714
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:11,320
He's gotta get to Hawkins,\Nand he's gotta bring his men right now!

715
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,890
Do you understand me?

716
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,140
Yes, yes, ma'am.

717
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,400
Thank you. And good day.

718
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,190
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.

719
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,820
That's one minute too long.

720
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,150
Alexei.

721
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,420
What's going on?

722
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,950
We gotta go. Vroom, vroom.

723
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,590
Back to Hawkins. Come on.

724
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,090
Come on.

725
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,590
Honestly, I don't really feel anything.

726
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,270
Do you?

727
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,470
I mean, I... I feel fine.

728
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,070
- I feel normal.\N- Yeah, I feel... I feel fine.

729
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,570
I kinda feel good.

730
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,820
- Wanna know a secret?\N- What?

731
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,150
I like it, too!

732
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,490
- I feel good.\N- Morons. They messed up the drug.

733
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,990
They messed it up!

734
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,950
- Morons. Hey, morons!\N- Morons!

735
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,620
- Moron! Mor...\N- Hey!

736
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,970
Whoa-oh!

737
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,890
Oh, no. There's definitely\Nsomething wrong with us.

738
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,790
Something's wrong.

739
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,900
Would now be a good time to tell you\Nthat I don't like doctors?

740
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,870
Let's try this again, yes?

741
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,170
Who do you work for?

742
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,370
Scoops.

743
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,340
Scoops Ahoy.

744
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,200
How did you find us?

745
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,750
Totally by accident.

746
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,290
More lies.

747
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,970
- What is that shiny little toy?\N- Where you going with that, doc?

748
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,940
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.\NWait! No! Wait! Wait!

749
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,520
- Whoa!\N- There was a code! We heard a code!

750
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,140
Code.

751
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,190
What code?

752
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,440
"The week is long.

753
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,900
The silver cat feeds\Nwhen blue meets yellow in the west."

754
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,120
Blah, blah, blah.

755
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:28,320
You broadcast that stupid spy shit\Nall over town,

756
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,800
and we picked it up on our Cerebro,

757
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,320
and we cracked it in a day.

758
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:33,920
A day!

759
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,420
You think you're so smart,

760
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:40,420
but a couple of kids\Nwho scoop ice cream for a living

761
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,790
cracked your code in a day,\Nand now, people know you're here.

762
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,920
Who knows we are here, little bitch?

763
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,140
Uh, well, Dustin knows.

764
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,340
Hey, Steve?

765
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,590
- Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.\N- Steve!

766
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,770
Dustin Henderson.

767
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,940
It is your small, curly-haired friend?

768
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,100
Oh, curly-haired. Great hair. Small.\NKind of like a 'fro. Yeah.

769
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,190
Where is he?

770
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,850
He's long gone, you big asshole.

771
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,440
And he's probably calling Hopper,

772
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,740
and Hopper's calling the US cavalry.

773
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,120
They're gonna come in here,\Ncommando-style, guns a-blazin',

774
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,040
and kick your sorry asses back to Russia.

775
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,620
You're gonna be two pieces of toast.

776
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,000
Is that so?

777
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:21,920
Yeah.

778
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,490
Hey! Henderson!

779
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,500
That's crazy,\NI was just talking about you.

780
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:03,540
- Oh, my God!\N- Get ready to run.

781
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,650
Hey! Billy, stop!

782
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,420
What the hell is wrong with you?\NWhat did we talk about, huh?

783
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:38,370
You gotta slide!

784
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,670
- I know.\N- Wait.

785
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,090
- Afraid you're gonna get hurt, is that it?\N- No.

786
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,620
Well, what then? What?

787
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,970
What did I raise, a pussy for a son?

788
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,000
- Leave me alone!\N- Hey!

789
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,840
That's right, run!\NLike you always do!

790
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,520
Where were you last night?\NWhere were you?

791
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,100
- I told you, I was with Wendy.\N- Stop lying to me!

792
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,700
- I'm not lying to you!\N- You saw him again, didn't you?

793
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,740
- Didn't you?!\N- Get away from me!

794
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,650
- I said, get away!\N- You... You whore!

795
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,740
- Stop it!\N- Bitch!

796
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,850
- Don't hurt her!\N- No!

797
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,650
- Don't hurt her!\N- You bastard!

798
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,990
Mom!

799
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,450
I don't understand. Why not?

800
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,500
Please, Mom, don't do this.

801
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,700
Please come home.

802
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,800
No. How long? How long?!

803
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,340
I miss you.

804
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,920
Get back here!

805
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,970
Get up! What, are you scared to fight me?

806
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,350
You scared?

807
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,020
Get up and fight me, pussy! Pussy!

808
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,350
Billy, come over here,\NI want you to meet someone.

809
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,690
This is your new sister.\NHer name's Maxine.

810
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,350
Max.

811
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,700
- Shake her hand.\N- Who's there?

812
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,070
- I said, shake her hand.\N- I said, who's there?!

813
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,750
I think I found it.

814
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,000
The source.

815
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,640
Where, El? Where are you?

816
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,590
Brimborn...

817
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,550
Steelworks.

818
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,770
Here. Okay, uh, steelworks, steelworks...

819
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,350
Uh...

820
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,490
Here, steel.

821
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:16,770
Uh...

822
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,040
Found it.\N6522 Cherry Oak Drive.

823
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,700
- That's close.\N- El, El, we found it. Get out of there.

824
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,150
Get out.

825
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:50,940
Mike?

826
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,300
Mike?

827
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,400
Mike?

828
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,940
Mike!

829
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,350
Mike!

830
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,140
He can't hear you.

831
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,340
You shouldn't have looked for me.

832
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,500
Because now I see you.

833
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,340
Now we can all see you.

834
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:47,490
You...

835
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,870
let us in.

836
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,040
And now...

837
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,200
you are going to have to let us stay.

838
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,840
David, where you going?

839
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,420
David?

840
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,690
Adam!

841
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,800
You're gonna miss it!

842
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,600
Adam!

843
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,490
Don't you see?

844
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,350
All this time,

845
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,290
we've been building it.

846
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:28,320
We've been building it...

847
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,900
for you.

848
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,370
All that work,

849
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,000
all that pain...

850
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,250
all of it... for you.

851
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,600
And now it's time.

852
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,520
Time to end it.

853
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,190
And we are going to end you.

854
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,270
And when you are gone,

855
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,270
we are going to end your friends.

856
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:06,320
- No!\N- And then we are going to end...

857
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,100
everyone.

858
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,620
Get away!

859
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,240
No!

860
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,900
El, you're okay. It's... It's okay.

861
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,200
El.
