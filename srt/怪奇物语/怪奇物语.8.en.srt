1
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,950
Mother of God.

2
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,720
It's... it's polycarbonate.\NIt can't get through.

3
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,640
Mother Mary and Joseph.

4
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,300
You sure about that glass?

5
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,850
What the hell?

6
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,940
- We're too late.\N- What?

7
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,200
We're too late!

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,700
What's going on?

9
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,040
We're under attack.

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,540
What's going on down there?\NDoes anybody copy?

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,500
Hurry!

12
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,140
This way.

13
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,550
We need to make Will sleep.

14
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,990
- What?\N- He's a spy. If he knows where we are,

15
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,750
- so does the shadow monster.\N- He's lying!

16
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,620
He killed those soldiers.\NHe'll kill us, too!

17
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,990
He's lying! He's lying! He's lying!\NHe's lying! He's lying!

18
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,420
Shit!

19
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
Those are gunshots!

20
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,670
He's lying! He's lying!

21
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,250
Okay, Will, Will, listen, listen.\NDo you know who I am?

22
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,050
Do you know who I am?

23
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,300
You're...

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,140
You're... You're Mom.

25
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,850
Hold him down.

26
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,900
No! No! Let go! No! No!\NLet me go! Let go!

27
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,600
- No, let me go!\N- I'm sorry.

28
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,950
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\N- Let me go! Let go! Let me go!

29
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,400
No! Let go! Let me go! Let me go!

30
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,470
We gotta go. We gotta go.

31
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,240
Come on!

32
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,940
Oh, my God.

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,210
Oh, my God.

34
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,070
Hey, guys, we're home.

35
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,190
Guys?

36
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,120
Hello?

37
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,190
Max?

38
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,820
Billy?

39
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,240
Yeah, I'm a little bit\Nbusy in here, Susan.

40
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,870
Open the door. Right now.

41
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,000
What's wrong?

42
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,090
Why don't you tell us?

43
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,800
Because I don't know.

44
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,920
- We can't find Maxine.\N- And her window's open.

45
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,920
- Where is she?\N- I don't know.

46
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,670
You don't know?

47
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,000
Look, I'm sure she just,

48
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,170
I don't know, went to the\Narcade or something.

49
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,520
I'm sure she's fine.

50
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
You were supposed to watch her.

51
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,270
I know, Dad. I was.

52
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,190
It's just you guys\Nwere three hours late,

53
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,020
and, well, I have a date.

54
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm sorry, okay?

55
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,550
That's why you've been staring\Nat yourself in the mirror

56
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,570
like some faggot instead\Nof watching your sister?

57
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,750
I have been looking after\Nher all week, Dad. Okay?

58
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,100
She wants to run off, then\Nthat's her problem, all right?

59
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,000
She's 13 years old. She shouldn't\Nneed a full-time babysitter.

60
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,250
And she's not my sister!

61
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,050
What did we talk about?

62
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,070
What did we... talk about?

63
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,190
Respect and responsibility.

64
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,740
That is right.

65
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,990
Now, apologize to Susan.

66
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,450
I'm sorry, Susan.

67
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,700
It's okay, Neil, really...

68
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,790
No, it's not okay. Nothing\Nabout his behavior is okay.

69
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,220
But he's gonna make up for it.

70
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,550
He's gonna call whatever\Nwhore he's seeing tonight

71
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,970
and cancel their date.

72
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,140
And then he's gonna go find his sister.

73
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,970
Like the good, kind,\Nrespecting brother that he is.

74
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,490
Isn't that right, Billy?

75
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,400
Isn't that right?

76
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,320
Yes, sir.

77
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,620
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

78
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,040
Yes, sir.

79
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,120
Find Max.

80
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,190
You're positive that was Dart?

81
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,020
Yes. He had the same exact\Nyellow pattern on his butt.

82
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,550
- He was tiny two days ago.\N- Well, he's molted three times already.

83
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,570
- Malted?\N- Molted.

84
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,850
Shed his skin to make room\Nfor growth like hornworms.

85
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,870
- When's he gonna molt again?\N- It's gotta be soon.

86
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,600
When he does, he'll be fully\Ngrown, or close to it.

87
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,740
And so will his friends.

88
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,850
Yeah, and he's gonna eat a\Nlot more than just cats.

89
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,900
Wait, a cat?

90
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,400
- Dart ate a cat?\N- No, what? No.

91
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,150
What are you talking about? He ate Mews.

92
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Mews? Who's Mews?

93
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,490
- It's Dustin's cat.\N- Steve!

94
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,920
I knew it! You kept him!

95
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,990
No!

96
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,590
No.

97
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,370
No, I... No, I...

98
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,920
He missed me. He wanted to come home.

99
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,970
Bullshit!

100
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,470
I didn't know he was a Demogorgon,

101
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,820
- Okay?\N- Oh, so now you admit it?

102
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,070
Guys, who cares? We have to go.

103
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,220
I care! You put the party in jeopardy!

104
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,670
You broke the rule of law!

105
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,590
- So did you!\N- What?

106
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,090
You told a stranger the truth!

107
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,640
A stranger?

108
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,020
You wanted to tell her, too!

109
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,270
But I didn't, Lucas, okay?

110
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,890
I didn't tell her!

111
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,600
We both broke the rule of law, okay?

112
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,090
So we're even. We're even.

113
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,570
No, no! We're not even.\NDon't even try that.

114
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,070
Your stupid pet could\Nhave ate us for dinner!

115
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,750
- That was not my fault!\N- Guys?

116
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,790
He wasn't gonna eat us.

117
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,500
He was crawling to come say hello?

118
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,720
Guys!

119
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,070
No, no, no. Hey, guys,

120
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,070
why are you headed towards the sound?

121
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,420
Hello?

122
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,370
Hello?

123
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,020
I don't see him.

124
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
It's the lab.

125
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,420
They were going back home.

126
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,770
Look, this is us, and\Nthis is the nearest exit.

127
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,420
But even if we somehow make\Nit there, there's no way out.

128
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,570
- What do you mean?\N- The locks are fail secure.

129
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,670
Fail secure?

130
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,070
If there's a power outage, the\Nbuilding goes on lockdown.

131
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,520
Can it be unlocked remotely?

132
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,120
With a computer, sure, but\Nsomebody's gotta reset the breakers.

133
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,420
- Where are the breakers?\N- Breakers are in the basement,

134
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,620
three floors down.

135
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,270
Hey, where are you going?

136
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,720
To reset the breakers.

137
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,870
Okay, then what?

138
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,520
- Then we get out of here.\N- No, then the power comes back on.

139
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,820
If you wanna unlock the doors,

140
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,570
you have to reboot the computer system,

141
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,220
and then override the security\Ncodes with a manual input.

142
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,670
Fine, how do I do that?

143
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,370
You can't. Not unless you know BASIC.

144
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,820
I don't know what that means.

145
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,170
- It's a computer programming language.\N- Teach it to me.

146
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,470
Shall I teach you French\Nwhile I'm at it, Jim?

147
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,620
How about a little German?

148
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,770
How about you, Doc? You speak BASIC?

149
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,370
No.

150
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,270
Okay, I got this.

151
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
I got this.

152
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,120
No. Bob.

153
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,170
It's okay.

154
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,120
It's gonna be okay. Remember,\NBob Newby, superhero.

155
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,220
Okay, grab his walkie.

156
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,920
All right, you know how\Nto use one of these?

157
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,920
No.

158
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,470
Safety on. Safety off. Point. Squeeze.

159
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,220
Point and squeeze. Okay. Easy-peasy.

160
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,670
If anything happens down there,

161
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,320
I want you to come right back up.

162
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,970
Right back here. Listen.

163
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,220
Don't wait for me. As soon\Nas I get those doors open...

164
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,320
- I'm gonna get them out.\N- Yeah?

165
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,740
I promise.

166
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,920
Okay, well... I'll be in touch.

167
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,770
Why are the lights off?

168
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,690
Maybe it's closed?

169
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,360
Security took the night off?

170
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,970
I don't think so.

171
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,410
It's not working?

172
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,320
No! The power's off.

173
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,790
- Jonathan?\N- What?

174
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,790
I think there's something in the woods.

175
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,840
Nancy, stay back.

176
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,220
Hello?

177
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,510
Who's there?

178
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,420
Who's there?

179
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,340
Steve?

180
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,020
- Nancy?\N- Jonathan.

181
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,970
What are you doing here?

182
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,060
What are you doing here?

183
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,970
We're looking for Mike and Will.

184
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,690
- They're not in there, are they?\N- We're not sure.

185
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,840
Why?

186
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,220
Keep it together, Bob.

187
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,790
Oh, God.

188
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,020
Okay, here we go.

189
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,190
He made it.

190
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,570
- We haven't seen Will...\N- I haven't seen him since...

191
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,370
The power's back.

192
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,420
- Let me try.\N- Hang on...

193
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,810
Let me try, Jonathan!

194
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,890
Son of a bitch! You know what...

195
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,270
Okay, Bob, can you hear us?

196
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,860
Loud and clear, Doc.\NCan you hear me back?

197
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,060
We hear you all right.

198
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,940
Give me a minute.

199
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,910
Open sesame.

200
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,090
It's open.

201
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,590
Okay.

202
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,060
Hey! I got it!

203
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
I got it!

204
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,190
Easy-peasy.

205
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,390
Son of a bitch did it.

206
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,720
Right, I'll meet you outside.

207
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,510
Nice job.

208
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,940
- Hold on a second, Chief.\N- What's wrong?

209
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,060
West stairwell's not clear anymore.

210
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,190
- What's going on?\N- We've got some company.

211
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,570
- Where?\N- The west stairwell.

212
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,940
I got an idea.

213
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,890
What the hell's he doing?

214
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,290
Okay. And splash.

215
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,540
Okay. Okay, that worked.

216
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,940
Now, get out of there.

217
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,540
Go! Go!

218
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,390
Wait a second, Chief?

219
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,690
- What?\N- Take this.

220
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,240
What are you doing?

221
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,140
Any more surprises, I'll let you know.

222
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,990
Go. Go!

223
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,390
Come on, Bob. Come on.

224
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,390
Hey, Bob?

225
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,340
Yeah?

226
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,890
- I'm gonna guide you, okay?\N- Is there a problem?

227
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,940
No, it's just... It's, uh, getting\Na little crowded up here,

228
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,690
so we're gonna have to take this slow.

229
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,590
Okay.

230
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,390
All right, just start walking.

231
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,040
Okay, good.

232
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,290
Okay, now, your next right.

233
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,340
Now, keep going, keep\Ngoing, keep going...

234
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,790
Stop!

235
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
What?

236
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
What?

237
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,240
Bob, there's a door on your\Nleft, do you see that?

238
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,290
Yeah?

239
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,140
- That's a closet.\N- Okay?

240
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
- Yeah, I need you to get in it.\N- What?

241
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,390
Now! Right now. Get in the closet.

242
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,640
Jesus Christ.

243
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,390
Okay.

244
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,940
How you holding up there, Bob?\NYou all right?

245
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,890
Yeah. Yeah.

246
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,830
You got a pretty clear\Nshot to the front door.

247
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,380
Okay.

248
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,960
You can do this, okay?

249
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,790
You're almost home free, all right, Bob?

250
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,340
Run!

251
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,390
Bob!

252
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,030
Bob.

253
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,130
No!

254
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,260
No!

255
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Go!

256
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,860
No!

257
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,290
Go!

258
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,610
Bob!

259
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,610
Bob!

260
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,290
No!

261
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,380
- What happened?\N- No!

262
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,590
No!

263
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,680
He's gone! He's gone!

264
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,680
Come on! Get in!

265
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,530
Guys?

266
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Let's go.

267
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,540
Come on!

268
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,740
Come on, let's go! Let's go! Come on!

269
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,910
I'm sorry, bud.

270
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,910
Sorry I wasn't there. I\Nshould have been here.

271
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,710
Sam Owens. Dr. Sam Owens.

272
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
How many people at the lab?

273
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,080
I don't know how many people are there!

274
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,130
I don't know how many\Npeople are left alive!

275
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,410
Have you contacted the police?

276
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,130
I am the police! Chief Jim Hopper!

277
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,010
Is there a number I can reach you at?

278
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,060
Yes, the number that I gave you, yes.

279
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,680
- Okay, yes, I got it.\N- 6767...

280
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,390
- I will be here.\N- I'll have them contact you.

281
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,310
They didn't believe you, did they?

282
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,860
We'll see.

283
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,130
"We'll see"?

284
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,730
We can't just sit here while\Nthose things are loose!

285
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,280
We stay here, and we wait for help.

286
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,960
Did you guys know that Bob

287
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,810
was the original founder of Hawkins AV?

288
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
Really?

289
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,160
He petitioned the school to\Nstart it and everything.

290
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,060
Then he had a fund-raiser for equipment.

291
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,710
Mr. Clarke learned everything from him.

292
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,160
Pretty awesome, right?

293
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,360
Yeah.

294
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,160
We can't let him die in vain.

295
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,560
What do you want to do, Mike?

296
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,860
The Chief's right on this.

297
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,760
We can't stop those\NDemo-dogs on our own.

298
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,910
Demo-dogs?

299
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,910
Demogorgon dogs.

300
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Demo-dogs.

301
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,760
It's like a compound.

302
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,610
It's like a play on words...

303
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,660
Okay.

304
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,760
I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe...

305
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,010
But there's an army now.

306
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,960
- Precisely.\N- His army.

307
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
What do you mean?

308
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260
His army.

309
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,260
Maybe if we stop him, we\Ncan stop his army, too.

310
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,210
The shadow monster.

311
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,660
It got Will that day on the field.

312
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,810
The doctor said it was like\Na virus, it infected him.

313
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,510
And so this virus, it's\Nconnecting him to the tunnels?

314
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,710
To the tunnels, monsters, the\NUpside Down, everything.

315
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,610
Whoa. Slow down. Slow down.

316
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,810
Okay, so, the shadow\Nmonster's inside everything.

317
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,760
And if the vines feel something\Nlike pain, then so does Will.

318
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,330
- And so does Dart.\N- Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us.

319
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,080
- The hive mind.\N- Hive mind?

320
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,500
A collective consciousness.\NIt's a super-organism.

321
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,330
And this is the thing that controls\Neverything. It's the brain.

322
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,050
Like the mind flayer.

323
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,010
- The what?\N- What?

324
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,210
The mind flayer.

325
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,510
What the hell is that?

326
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,230
It's a monster from\Nan unknown dimension.

327
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,930
It's so ancient that it doesn't\Neven know its true home.

328
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,230
Okay, it enslaves races\Nof other dimensions

329
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,460
by taking over their brains\Nusing its highly-developed

330
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,210
psionic powers.

331
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Oh, my God, none of this is real.\NThis is a kids' game.

332
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,780
No, it's a manual. And\Nit's not for kids.

333
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,200
And unless you know\Nsomething that we don't,

334
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,580
this is the best metaphor...

335
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,730
Analogy.

336
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,030
Analogy? That's what\Nyou're worried about?

337
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,360
Fine. An analogy for understanding\Nwhatever the hell this is.

338
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,500
Okay, so this mind flamer thing...

339
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,210
Flayer. Mind flayer.

340
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,380
What does it want?

341
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,830
To conquer us, basically.

342
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,660
It believes it's the master race.

343
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,080
Like the Germans?

344
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,930
Uh, the Nazis?

345
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,430
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis.\N- Uh...

346
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,880
If the Nazis were from\Nanother dimension, totally.

347
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:27,180
Uh, it views other races, like\Nus, as inferior to itself.

348
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,150
It wants to spread, take\Nover other dimensions.

349
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,480
We are talking about the destruction\Nof our world as we know it.

350
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,110
That's great. That's great.\NThat's really great. Jesus!

351
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,980
Okay, so if this thing is like a brain

352
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,010
that's controlling everything,

353
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,860
then if we kill it...

354
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,580
We kill everything it controls.

355
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,750
- We win.\N- Theoretically.

356
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,260
Great. So how do you kill this thing?

357
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,800
Shoot it with Fireballs or something?

358
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,660
No. No, no Fire... No Fireballs.

359
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,050
Uh, you summon an undead\Narmy, uh, because...

360
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,560
...because zombies,

361
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,330
you know, they don't have brains,

362
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,980
and the mind flayer, it...\Nit... It likes brains.

363
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,030
- It's just a game. It's a game.\N- What the hell are we doing here?

364
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,350
I thought we were waiting\Nfor your military backup.

365
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,650
We are!

366
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,110
How are they gonna stop this?

367
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,630
You can't just shoot this with guns.

368
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,730
You don't know that! We\Ndon't know anything!

369
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,980
We know it's already killed\Neverybody in that lab.

370
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,680
We know the monsters\Nare gonna molt again.

371
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,350
We know that it's only a matter of time

372
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,310
before those tunnels reach this town.

373
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,250
They're right.

374
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,500
We have to kill it.

375
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,950
I want to kill it.

376
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,980
Me, too.

377
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,680
- I...\N- Me, too, Joyce, okay?

378
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,800
But how do we do that?

379
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,180
We don't exactly know what\Nwe're dealing with here.

380
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,180
No. But he does.

381
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,960
If anyone knows how to destroy\Nthis thing, it's Will.

382
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,810
He's connected to it.\NHe'll know its weakness.

383
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,810
I thought we couldn't trust him anymore.

384
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,400
That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.

385
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,280
Yeah, but he can't spy if he\Ndoesn't know where he is.

386
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,110
Yeah, this'll work.

387
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,850
Hey.

388
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,010
What you did, um, helping the kids...

389
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,900
that was... really cool.

390
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Yeah.

391
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,060
Those little shits are\Nreal trouble, you know?

392
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,610
Believe me, I know.

393
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,500
Hey.

394
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,250
I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all.

395
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,460
I guess I just thought\Nthat he was my friend.

396
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,600
I was wrong.

397
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,080
I broke the rule of law,

398
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,350
so if you want your girlfriend to...

399
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,630
to take over my spot in\Nthe party, I understand.

400
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,560
She's not my girlfriend.

401
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,850
I saw you two holding\Nhands in the bus, Lucas.

402
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,780
She was just scared.

403
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,580
Maybe, but I could feel it.

404
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,860
Feel what?

405
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,610
The electricity.

406
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,930
I get why El was your mage now.

407
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
What?

408
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,530
Lucas. He told me all about her.

409
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,630
Well, he shouldn't have.

410
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,080
And just because you know the truth,

411
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,680
it doesn't mean you're in our party.

412
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,130
You do know that, right?

413
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,580
Yeah, I know.

414
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,930
I mean,

415
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,480
why would you want a stupid\Nzoomer in your party anyway?

416
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,080
I'm just saying, El?

417
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,030
She sounds like she was really awesome.

418
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,430
Yeah, she was.

419
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,830
Until that thing took her.

420
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,380
Just like it took Bob.

421
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,830
You sure this is gonna work?

422
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,680
He knew who I was.

423
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,480
He's still in there.

424
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,130
It's gonna work.

425
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,680
It has to.

426
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,730
- All right, you ready?\N- Yeah.

427
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,780
If he finds out where we are...

428
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,030
will he send those dogs after us?

429
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,310
He won't find out.

430
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,280
Yeah, but, if he does...

431
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,470
Judgment day.

432
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,320
What? What? What is this?

433
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,570
What? What is this?

434
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,820
Why am I tied up?

435
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,480
Will, we just wanna talk to you.

436
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,870
We're not gonna hurt you.

437
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,080
Where am I?

438
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,170
You recognize this?

439
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,170
Do you recognize this?

440
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,950
Hey.

441
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,800
We wanna help you.

442
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,380
But to do that, we have to\Nunderstand how to kill it.

443
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,970
Why am I tied up?

444
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,830
Why am I tied up?

445
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,880
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

446
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,120
Hey.

447
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,100
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

448
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,520
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!\NLet me go!

449
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,700
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

450
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,030
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!\NLet me go!

451
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,650
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

452
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,330
Let me go...

453
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,450
Go...

454
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,050
Go...

455
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,430
Do you know what March 22nd is?

456
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,770
It's your birthday.

457
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,930
Your birthday.

458
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,000
When you turned eight,

459
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:17,570
I gave you that huge box of crayons.

460
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,200
Do you remember that?

461
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,650
It was 120 colors.

462
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,450
And all your friends, they\Ngot you Star Wars toys,

463
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,250
but all you wanted to do was\Ndraw with all your new colors.

464
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,050
And you drew this big spaceship,\Nbut it wasn’t from a movie.

465
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,180
It was your spaceship.

466
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,020
A rainbow ship is what you called it.

467
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,730
And you must have used\Nevery color in the box.

468
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,370
I took that with me to Melvald's

469
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:04,250
and I put it up and I told\Neveryone who came in,

470
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,580
"My son drew this."

471
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,130
And you were so embarrassed.

472
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
But I was so proud.

473
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,350
I was so, so proud.

474
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,350
Do you remember the day Dad left?

475
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,820
We stayed up all night\Nbuilding Castle Byers...

476
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,200
just the way you drew it.

477
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,200
And it took so long because\Nyou were so bad at hammering.

478
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,170
You'd miss the nail every time.

479
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,450
And then it started raining, but\Nwe stayed out there anyway.

480
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,080
We were both sick for\Nlike a week after that.

481
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,920
But we just had to finish it, didn't we?

482
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,000
We just had to.

483
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,020
Do you remember the\Nfirst day that we met?

484
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,770
It was... It was the first\Nday of kindergarten.

485
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,350
I knew nobody.

486
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,650
I had no friends and...

487
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:25,450
I just felt so alone\Nand so scared, but...

488
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,150
I saw you on the swings\Nand you were alone, too.

489
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,000
You were just swinging by yourself.

490
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,650
And I just walked up to you and...

491
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,850
I asked.

492
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,150
I asked if you wanted to be my friend.

493
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,350
And you said yes.

494
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,400
You said yes.

495
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,500
It was the best thing I've ever done.

496
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,250
Will, baby...

497
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,450
if you're in there, just please...\Nplease talk to us.

498
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,300
Please, honey, please,\Ncan you do that for me?

499
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,100
Please. I love you so much.

500
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,900
Let me go.

501
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,000
What happened?

502
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,750
I think he's talking,\Njust not with words.

503
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,600
What is that?

504
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,650
Morse code.

505
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,500
H-E-R-E.

506
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,850
Here.

507
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,050
Will's still in there.\NHe's talking to us.

508
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,250
Do you remember the first\Ntime I played you this?

509
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,900
Mom and Dad were both\Narguing in the next room.

510
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,600
So I played you the mix tape I made you.

511
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,000
And it was the first time you\Ngot into music. Real music.

512
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,800
Dash, dot, dash, dot.

513
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,950
- Yeah, got it.\N- C.

514
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
And then the party\Nescaped into the sewers,

515
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,500
and there were those big insect things,

516
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,350
and you guys were still on level one.

517
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,450
L.

518
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
O.

519
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,050
Then you cast Fog Cloud\Nand you saved us.

520
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,850
You saved the whole party.

521
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,250
S.

522
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,100
You saw that little girl\Nand she was in the sandbox

523
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,300
and she was crying.

524
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,750
E.

525
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,300
You gave him your Tonka Truck

526
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,600
and I told you we couldn't\Nafford to buy another one.

527
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,250
G.

528
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,200
You said she should have\Nit because she's sad.

529
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,420
"She's sad, Mommy."

530
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,000
A.

531
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,870
- I love you so much.\N- T.

532
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,000
So, so much.

533
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,500
E.

534
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,420
"Close gate."

535
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,890
Shit. Shit.

536
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,990
Do you think he heard that?

537
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,900
It's just a phone. It\Ncould be anywhere. Right?

538
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,920
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

539
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,550
It knows. It knows where we are.

540
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Oh, shit.

541
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,400
That's not good.

542
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,450
- They're coming!\N- What?

543
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,650
- Come on. We gotta go.\N- Come on.

544
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,640
- We gotta go.\N- Okay.

545
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,620
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go.

546
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,720
Hey. Hey, get away from the windows!

547
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,020
- Do you know how to use this?\N- What?

548
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,900
Can you use this?

549
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,490
I can.

550
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,540
Where are they?

551
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,250
What are they doing?

552
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,720
Holy shit.

553
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,670
Is it dead?
