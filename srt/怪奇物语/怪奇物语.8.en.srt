1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,180
Let me out of here!

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,890
Somebody, please!

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,100
Let me out!

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,920
Your son.

5
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,210
We know you've been in contact with him.

6
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,340
- You have to let me...\N- When...

7
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,060
and how did you make contact with him?

8
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,850
- What?\N- Hmm?

9
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,140
Six.

10
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,520
What?

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,150
Six.

12
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,450
Six people have been taken this week.

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,080
This... thing that took your son...

14
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,100
we don't really understand it.

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,710
But its behavior is predictable.

16
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,880
Like all animals...

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,210
it eats.

18
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,470
It will take more sons.

19
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,550
More daughters.

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,220
I want to save them.

21
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,770
I want to save your son.

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,440
But I can't do that.

23
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,590
Not without your help.

24
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,900
Stop.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,570
I know who you are.

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,120
I know what you've done.

27
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,390
You took my boy away from me!

28
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,230
You left him in that place to die!

29
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,330
You faked his death!

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,530
We had a funeral.

31
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,010
We buried him.

32
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,180
And now you're asking for my help?

33
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,850
Go to hell.

34
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,380
Okay, now what do you know?

35
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,070
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,150
Did I stutter?

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,260
I told you.

38
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,720
Everything.

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
What do you know?

40
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,400
I know you do experiments\Non kidnapped little kids,

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,880
whose parents' brains\Nyou've turned to mush.

42
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,530
And I know you went a\Nlittle too far this time

43
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,550
and you messed up in a big way.

44
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,660
I mean, you really messed\Nup, didn't you? Big time.

45
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,680
That's why you're trying\Nto cover your tracks.

46
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,710
You killed Benny Hammond,\Nyou faked Will Byers' death.

47
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,210
You made it look like that\Nlittle girl just ran away.

48
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,730
See, I told you.

49
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,400
- I know everything.\N- All right, who are you working with?

50
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,680
Nobody.

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,930
But I did give all this over\Nto my friend at the Times.

52
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,830
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,190
You're just a junkie.

54
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,990
A small town cop who\Nhad a really bad week.

55
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,340
Took one too many pills this time.

56
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,200
You made a mistake coming back here.

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,890
No, I didn't.

58
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,230
Here's what's gonna happen.

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,860
You're gonna let me\Nand Joyce Byers go...

60
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,130
you're gonna give us anything we need,

61
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,280
and we're gonna find her son.

62
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,060
And then we're gonna forget\Nthat any of this ever happened.

63
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,280
Oh, is that right?

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,870
Yeah.

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,040
That's right.

66
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,760
Nancy? Jonathan?

67
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,670
- They're gone.\N- What?

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,090
Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone.

69
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,870
They're probably just\Nsucking face somewhere.

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
- Gross.\N- No. No way!

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,890
Did they go with the chief?

72
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,990
I don't know.

73
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,700
No.

74
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,080
What? Did you see them? Do\Nyou know where they went?

75
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,370
- Yes.\N- Where? Where did they go?

76
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,500
Demogorgon.

77
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,150
Where's the girl?

78
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,620
You gotta give me your word.

79
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,710
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

80
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,460
And those other three kids, those\Nboys, you're gonna leave them alone.

81
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,590
Then I'll tell you.

82
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,890
Tell you where your little\Nscience experiment is.

83
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,400
I don't understand.

84
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,150
We came to an agreement.

85
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,820
What?

86
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,720
Look, everything that's happened here\Nand everything that's gonna happen,

87
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,950
we don't talk about.

88
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,260
You want Will back?

89
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,970
This place had nothing to do with it.

90
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,600
That's the deal. You got it?

91
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,510
What is this?

92
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,430
Protection. The atmosphere is toxic.

93
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,890
But my son's in there. He...

94
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,110
Put it on.

95
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,210
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.

96
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,330
It's gone. Isn't that what you wanted?

97
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,830
And if they find the boy?

98
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,510
That's not gonna happen.

99
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,460
Hey, you all right?

100
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,580
Yeah.

101
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,360
I need you to relax, okay?

102
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,840
I want you to slow down your\Nbreathing, take deep breaths.

103
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,020
In and out.

104
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,820
Deep breath in...

105
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,900
and out.

106
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,530
In and out.

107
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,850
- In and out.\N- It's troll's favorite food!

108
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,680
- Princess!\N- No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

109
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,970
Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!

110
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,730
No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy.

111
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,150
Whoa, hey!

112
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,570
Hey.

113
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,320
You all right?

114
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,410
- What's going on?\N- Whoa.

115
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,910
- What happened? What happened?\N- I don't know. I don't know.

116
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,080
Hey, you all right?

117
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

118
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,290
Relax, relax. Honey, honey.

119
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,290
Honey, just breathe.\NBreathe, breathe, breathe.

120
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,090
In and out. Slow, slow, slow.

121
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,680
In and out with me.

122
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,780
In...

123
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,810
- You okay?\N- Yeah.

124
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,030
Yeah.

125
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,790
Remember...

126
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,620
- Straight into Will's room. And...\N- Don't step on the trap.

127
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,120
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

128
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,690
Then...

129
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,650
All right.

130
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,570
You ready?

131
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,360
Ready.

132
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,570
On three.

133
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,610
One...

134
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,280
two...

135
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,520
You don't have to do this...

136
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,600
Jonathan, stop talking.

137
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,520
- I'm just saying, you don't have to...\N- Three.

138
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,570
Guys, guys! This is crazy.

139
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,940
We can't just wait around.

140
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,320
Mike, in case you forgot,\Nwe're still fugitives.

141
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,880
The bad men are still looking for us.

142
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,870
Yeah, and we don't even\Nknow where your sister is.

143
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,820
El can find them.

144
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,930
Mike, look at her.

145
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,770
I still think we should\Nstick to the chief's plan.

146
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,330
Exactly. We stay here, keep El\Nout of sight and keep her safe.

147
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,210
That's the most\Nimportant thing, remember?

148
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,210
Besides, she's okay.\NShe's with Jonathan.

149
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,730
Yeah, and she's kind\Nof a badass now, so...

150
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,090
Well, where are you going? You\Njust said stick to the plan!

151
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,550
I am. I'm just gonna go\Nget some chocolate pudding.

152
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,720
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady\NPhyllis hoards that shit.

153
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,060
Are you serious?

154
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,830
El needs to be recharged!

155
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,060
Did you hear that?

156
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,310
It's just the wind.

157
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,430
Don't worry.

158
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,850
My mom, she said the\Nlights speak when it comes.

159
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,030
Speak?

160
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,140
Blink.

161
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,330
Think of them as alarms.

162
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,880
Is that too tight?

163
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,240
No, it's fine.

164
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,550
Thanks.

165
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,100
Nancy?

166
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,570
Yeah?

167
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,510
Jonathan?

168
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,950
Are you there, man? It's... it's Steve!

169
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,520
Listen, I just want to talk!

170
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,250
- Steve, listen to me.\N- Hey. Nancy, what...

171
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:51,990
You need to leave.

172
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,730
I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

173
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,440
I don't care about\Nthat. You need to leave.

174
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,400
No, no, no. Listen, I messed up, okay?

175
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,160
I messed... I messed up.

176
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,240
Okay?

177
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,080
Really. Please.

178
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,720
I just want to make things right.

179
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,100
Okay? Please. Please...

180
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,580
Hey, what happened to your hand?

181
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,920
Is that blood?

182
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,750
Nothing. It was an accident.

183
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,710
- Yeah, what's going on?\N- Nothing.

184
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,590
- Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?\N- No.

185
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,990
- Nancy, let me in!\N- No. No! No, Steve!

186
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,010
- What is... What the...\N- You need to get out of here.

187
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,890
- Whoa. What is all...\N- Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

188
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,520
- I'm telling you, get out of here!\N- What is that smell?

189
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,420
- Is that... is that gasoline?\N- Steve, get out!

190
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,810
Wait. What? What is going on?

191
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,190
You have five seconds\Nto get out of here.

192
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,970
Okay, is this a joke?\NStop. Put the gun down.

193
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,570
- I'm doing this for you.\N- Nancy.

194
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,270
- Wait. Is this a... What is this?\N- Nancy.

195
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,900
- Three. Two.\N- No, no, no! No, no!

196
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,710
Nancy! The lights.

197
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,570
- It's here.\N- Wait, what's here?

198
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,660
- Where is it?\N- Where is what? Whoa!

199
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,240
- Easy with that!\N- Where is it?

200
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,410
I don't know. I don't see it.

201
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,500
Where is what?

202
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,350
Hello? Will someone please explain\Nto me what the hell is going...

203
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,720
No!

204
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,970
Go! Go! Run! Go!

205
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,400
Get out of here!

206
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,450
- Jump!\N- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

207
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,930
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

208
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,640
- What the hell was that?\N- Shut up!

209
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,380
What's it doing?

210
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,590
I don't know.

211
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,650
Do you hear anything?

212
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,590
No.

213
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,270
Will!

214
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,870
Will!

215
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,670
Will!

216
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,760
Will!

217
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,630
"I asked Mrs. Spencer what made\Nthem red and she said she didn't know

218
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,590
and for pity's sake not to\Nask her any more questions.

219
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,580
She said I must have asked\Nher a thousand already.

220
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,680
I suppose I had, too,

221
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,770
but how are you gonna find things\Nout if you don't ask questions?

222
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,730
And what does make roads red?

223
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,560
'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.

224
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,290
It just makes me feel\Nglad to be alive...

225
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,590
it's such an interesting world."

226
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,940
Will!

227
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,690
Will!

228
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,960
This is crazy. This is\Ncrazy. This is crazy.

229
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,320
This is crazy! This is\Ncrazy! This is crazy!

230
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,430
What are you do... What are\Nyou doing? Are you insane?

231
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,680
It's going to come back!

232
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,510
So you need to leave.

233
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,490
Right now.

234
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,330
Where is it?

235
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,710
Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch.

236
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,710
- You see it?\N- No. Where...

237
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,900
Come on.

238
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,610
Where are you? Come on!

239
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,680
Jonathan!

240
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,500
Jonathan!

241
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,690
Jonathan!

242
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,090
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

243
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,060
Steve!

244
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,370
He's in the trap!

245
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,910
- He's stuck!\N- Jonathan, now!

246
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,360
Did you hear that?

247
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,430
Get back!

248
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,940
- Where did it go?\N- No.

249
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,450
It has to be dead.

250
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,710
It has to be.

251
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,370
Come on.

252
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,340
Is that my house?

253
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,280
It was hurt.

254
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,690
Mom.

255
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,710
Is that you?

256
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,250
Mom.

257
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,420
Jonathan?

258
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,010
Joyce, come on.

259
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,190
Where's it going?

260
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,610
I don't think that's the monster.

261
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,270
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.

262
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,690
- I knew it.\N- Yeah.

263
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,230
Always lying, saying she's out.

264
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,900
Bald-faced liar.

265
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,280
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

266
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,750
Okay!

267
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,050
Are you feeling any better?

268
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,450
What's "putting"?

269
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,160
Pudding, it's...

270
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,020
it's this chocolate goo\Nyou eat with a spoon.

271
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,330
Don't worry,

272
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,800
when all this is over, you won't\Nhave to keep eating junk food

273
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,340
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

274
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,590
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.

275
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,170
She can make you whatever you like.

276
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,550
Eggos?

277
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,900
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

278
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,720
See, I was thinking,

279
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,060
once all this is over and Will's\Nback and you're not a secret anymore,

280
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,650
my parents can get you an\Nactual bed for the basement.

281
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,440
Or you can take my room if you want,

282
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,070
since I'm down there\Nall the time anyways.

283
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,280
My point is, they'll take care of you.

284
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,070
They'll be like your new parents,

285
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,920
and Nancy, she'll be\Nlike your new sister.

286
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,790
Will you be like my brother?

287
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,580
What? No, no.

288
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,210
Why "no"?

289
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,680
Because...

290
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,790
'cause it's different.

291
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,130
Why?

292
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,270
I mean, I don't know, I guess it's not.

293
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,650
It's stupid.

294
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,930
Mike?

295
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,180
Yeah?

296
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,410
Friends don't lie.

297
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,700
Well...

298
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,080
I was thinking...

299
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,370
I don't know...

300
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,190
maybe we can go to\Nthe Snow Ball together.

301
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,240
- "Snow Ball"?\N- It's this cheesy school dance,

302
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,030
where you go in the gym and\Ndance to music and stuff.

303
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,930
I've never been, but I know you're\Nnot supposed to go with your sister.

304
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,620
- No?\N- I mean...

305
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,830
you can, but it'd be really weird.

306
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,600
You go to school dances with\Nsomeone that, you know...

307
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,170
someone that you like.

308
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,210
- A friend?\N- Not a friend.

309
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,690
Uh... uh...

310
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,360
Uh, someone like a...

311
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,360
Nancy. Hold on, I'll be right back.

312
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,800
Stay here.

313
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,400
Go!

314
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,900
You two, on me.

315
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,140
This will charge your battery\Nright up, I'm telling you.

316
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,680
- Guys! Guys!\N- What is it?

317
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,350
They found us.

318
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,080
We know they're here.

319
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,710
Be advised, west side\Nof the building is clear.

320
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,150
Sir, we've searched everywhere.\NThere's no sign of them.

321
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,760
Nothin'.

322
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,080
Keep it locked down.

323
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,390
All right.

324
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,520
Kitchen.

325
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,840
How did they find us?

326
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,700
I don't know, but they\Nknew we were in the gym.

327
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,970
Lando.

328
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,220
- Got 'em!\N- Go, go, go, go, go!

329
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,470
Come on!

330
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,630
- There they are. Freeze.\N- Back! Go back!

331
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,520
Go, go! Go left!

332
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,400
El, are you okay?

333
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,050
El!

334
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,720
- Something's wrong.\N- She's just drained.

335
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,890
No, no, no, she won't wake up. El!

336
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,660
El! El!

337
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,080
There's more blood.

338
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,710
Oh, my God.

339
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,430
This way.

340
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,220
- She's barely breathing.\N- We gotta go.

341
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,320
Leave her.

342
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,180
- Step away from the child.\N- No!

343
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,970
You want her, you have to kill us first.

344
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,850
- That's right!\N- Eat shit!

345
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,750
- Oh, no! No, no!\N- No! No! Get off me!

346
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,170
- You idiot!\N- No!

347
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,380
- Get off me!\N- Ow! Let go!

348
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,610
Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me?

349
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,760
Eleven?

350
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,700
Papa?

351
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,240
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

352
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,710
- Get off of me.\N- I'm here now.

353
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,290
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!

354
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,130
Shh, shh, you're sick.

355
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,300
You're sick, but I'm\Ngoing to make you better.

356
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,220
I'm going to take you back home,\Nwhere I can make you well again.

357
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Where we can make all of this better,

358
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,240
so no one else gets hurt.

359
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,740
Bad.

360
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,910
Bad.

361
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,820
Mike. Mike.

362
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,570
Mike.

363
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,080
Blood.

364
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,390
What?

365
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,010
Blood.

366
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,120
Demogorgon.

367
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,370
Go, go, go, go, go!

368
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,810
- Come on, come on.\N- Go, go!

369
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,860
Oh, my God.

370
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,520
Will! Will!

371
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,170
Will! Oh, my God!

372
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,590
Will! Hopper!

373
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,520
Oh, my God! You need\Nto help get him out!

374
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,940
Get him out!

375
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,170
Oh, Jesus.

376
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,330
Come on, come on!

377
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,030
Oh, my God!

378
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,220
Sorry. Hold on, we're almost\Nthere. We're almost there.

379
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,140
Come on. Come on.

380
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,090
Help, help.

381
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,840
Come on, get her on the table.

382
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,550
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

383
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,430
He's gone. The bad man's gone.

384
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,620
We'll be home soon, and my mom...

385
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,200
she'll get you your own bed.

386
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,790
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

387
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,000
And we can go to the Snow Ball.

388
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,420
Promise?

389
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,680
Promise.

390
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,360
Is... Is it dead?

391
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,640
Go, go, go, go!

392
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,870
Get the wrist rocket!\NGet the wrist rocket now!

393
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,850
Go, go, go, go, go!

394
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,610
- Go, go, go.\N- Take it out now!

395
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,820
Get the rocks, get the\Nrocks, get the rocks!

396
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,900
Getting the rocks!

397
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,360
- Give me one.\N- Come on!

398
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,980
- Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it!\N- Fire! Fire!

399
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,820
- Give me another one.\N- Kill it! Bastard!

400
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,990
- Kill it! Go, go, go, go!\N- Kill it now!

401
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,240
Get, get, get... Come\Non, kill the bastard!

402
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,330
It's not working!

403
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,160
- Hit him again.\N- Kill him!

404
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,210
- Keep going! Come on!\N- Get, get, get...

405
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,350
- Come on, kill it!\N- Come on! Go, go, go!

406
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,040
Eleven, stop!

407
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,240
Goodbye, Mike.

408
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,260
No more.

409
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,740
El? El?

410
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,680
- El!\N- Eleven!

411
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,780
- Eleven!\N- El!

412
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,120
El, where are you?

413
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,250
Eleven!

414
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,580
El?

415
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,210
Oh, God.

416
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,280
He's not breathing, he's not breathing.

417
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,960
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen\Nto me, listen to me, listen to me.

418
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,840
- I need you to tilt his head back...\N- Okay.

419
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,660
- and lift his chin.\N- Okay.

420
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,250
One, two, three, four.

421
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,330
Now when I tell you,

422
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,210
you're gonna pinch his nostrils,\Nand breathe into his mouth...

423
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,210
- twice.\N- Okay.

424
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,340
One second...

425
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,920
then pause.

426
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,680
22, 23.

427
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,800
- Then one second.\N- Okay.

428
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,890
24, 25, 26, 27, 28...

429
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,870
29, 30. Now! Go!

430
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,630
- Oh, come on, come on.\N- Come on...

431
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,520
Come on, kid.

432
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,730
- Come on, kid!\N- Will!

433
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,020
Will, listen to me.

434
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,360
It's me, it's your mom\Nand I love you so much.

435
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,570
I love you so much.

436
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,870
I love you more than\Nanything in the world.

437
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,870
Please...

438
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,490
Blood pressure keeps dropping.

439
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,410
Her pulse ox is falling.

440
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,210
I love you so much. I love you\Nmore than anything in the world.

441
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,050
Please, please come back to me. Just...

442
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,300
- Come on, kid!\N- Please, please wake up.

443
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,590
Please, please.

444
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,590
Breathe, Will, come on!

445
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,950
Flatlining!

446
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,670
Come back to me, breathe.

447
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,310
I need you to wake up now.

448
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,750
I need you to breathe.

449
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,370
Please breathe!

450
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,190
Please!

451
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,360
That's it.

452
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,590
Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.

453
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,160
That's it, baby. Breathe.

454
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,370
Breathe. All right. Come on.

455
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,830
Come on.

456
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,000
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

457
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,790
Good, good, good, good.

458
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,980
Just breathe, Will, breathe.

459
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,930
Michael?

460
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,180
Michael!

461
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,190
Michael?

462
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,380
Oh, my God.

463
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,950
Oh, my God.

464
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,070
You're okay.

465
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,780
You're okay.

466
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,800
Hey.

467
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,700
- Hi, sweetheart.\N- Hey.

468
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,640
Where... where am I?

469
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,670
You're home. You're home now.

470
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,530
You're safe.

471
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,250
Jonathan.

472
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,970
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

473
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,850
We missed you.

474
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,760
We really missed you.

475
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,310
Are you okay?

476
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,690
What, this?

477
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,900
It's just a cut. It's nothing.

478
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,820
You're worried about my hand.

479
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,490
Oh, hey, uh...

480
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,180
We, uh...

481
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,490
We brought you some stuff...

482
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,160
so you don't get bored in here.

483
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,000
So...

484
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,050
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

485
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,550
There's some stuff on there\NI think you really might like.

486
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,290
Guys. Guys, he's up. Will\Nis up. Guys, Will's up.

487
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,100
Guys, come on.

488
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,750
Byers!

489
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,630
Be careful. Be careful with him.

490
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,300
- Move.\N- Guys, guys.

491
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,150
Go easy on him.

492
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
You won't believe what happened\Nwhen you were gone, man.

493
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,430
- It was mental.\N- You had a funeral.

494
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,350
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.\N- And Troy peed himself.

495
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,100
- What?\N- In front of the whole school!

496
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,250
Yes!

497
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,710
You okay?

498
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,800
It got me.

499
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,950
The Demogorgon.

500
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,490
We know.

501
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,570
It's okay.

502
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,030
It's dead.

503
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,240
We made a new friend.

504
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,310
She stopped it. She saved us.

505
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,270
But she's gone now.

506
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,920
- Her name's Eleven.\N- Like the number?

507
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,250
Well, we call her "El" for short.

508
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,420
She's basically a wizard.

509
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,670
She has superpowers.

510
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,760
More like a Yoda.

511
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,380
She flipped a van with her mind,

512
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,630
and these agents were\Ntrying to shoot us...

513
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,720
- Yeah, it flipped over us...\N- Then she squeezed the brains out...

514
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,850
And blood was pouring\Nout of their faces.

515
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,270
It was pouring out of their eyes.

516
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,330
Agents just started\Ngrabbing us and stuff...

517
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,950
... shot out of the wall...

518
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,150
Something is coming. Something angry.

519
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,480
Hungry for your blood.

520
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,400
It is almost here.

521
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,570
- What is it?\N- It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

522
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,740
It's not the thessalhydra.

523
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,370
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

524
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,910
The thessalhydra!

525
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,580
- Damn it.\N- It roars in anger!

526
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,370
- Will, your action!\N- What should I do? I...

527
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,180
Fireball him!

528
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,350
Fireball the son of a bitch.

529
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,050
Fourteen!

530
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,970
Direct hit. Will the Wise's\Nfireball hits the thessalhydra.

531
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,050
It makes a painful...

532
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,100
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

533
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,560
Its clawed hand reaches\Nfor you one last time

534
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,230
and, and, and...

535
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,730
and...

536
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,240
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

537
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,320
and Dustin places them\Ninto his bag of holding.

538
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:39,620
You carry the heads out\Nof the dungeon, victorious,

539
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,290
and you present them to King Tristan.

540
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,990
He thanks you for your\Nbravery and service.

541
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,790
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,\Nwhoa, that's not it, is it?

542
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,170
No, there's a medal ceremony...

543
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,420
Oh, a medal ceremony?\NWhat are you talking about?

544
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,460
- And...\N- The campaign was way too short.

545
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,090
- Yeah!\N- It was ten hours!

546
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,310
But it doesn't make any sense.

547
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,720
- It makes sense.\N- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

548
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,260
And the proud princess?

549
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,780
And those weird flowers in the cave?

550
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,870
I don't know, it's...

551
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,180
Jeez, what's that smell?

552
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,940
Have you guys been playing\Ngames all day, or just farting?

553
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,480
Oh, that's just Dustin.

554
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,730
He farted.

555
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,170
- Dustin farted.\N- Okay.

556
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,480
- Dustin farted.\N- Very mature, Lucas.

557
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,610
Oh.

558
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,150
- Will.\N- Shut up.

559
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,820
- Come on.\N- Dustin farted!

560
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,920
- Bye, guys.\N- Bye, Will.

561
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,990
See you, Will.

562
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,410
- Stop.\N- No, you stop.

563
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,760
No, you stop.

564
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,730
Yeah, scream! You're like a little girl.

565
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,680
- So, you have fun?\N- Yeah.

566
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,810
Hey, boys.

567
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:42,890
- Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.\N- Hi.

568
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,980
Hey, wish your mom a Merry\NChristmas for me, okay?

569
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,890
- Yeah.\N- Yeah, thank you. Uh, Merry Christmas.

570
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:48,330
Merry Christmas.

571
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,980
- So, uh, you win?\N- Yeah.

572
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,750
- Awesome.\N- Hey, Jonathan, wait up.

573
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,950
- Uh...\N- Merry Christmas.

574
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,720
Thanks, um...

575
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,200
I... I didn't get you anything.

576
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,200
- I... I feel bad.\N- No.

577
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:10,230
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

578
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,440
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

579
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,120
Merry Christmas.

580
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,030
- You ready? Let's go.\N- Yeah.

581
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,370
All right. Buckle up.

582
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,710
Can I open it?

583
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,260
Yeah, sure.

584
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,330
Whoa.

585
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,430
Pretty cool.

586
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,810
Yeah.

587
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,100
Yeah, pretty cool.

588
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,330
Did you give it to him?

589
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,450
Yeah.

590
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,010
You leaving already, Chief?

591
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,660
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted

592
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,390
to come to this thing?\NI was just hungry.

593
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,810
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

594
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,890
Well, your wife doesn't have time to\Ncook for me, you know what I'm saying?

595
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,750
Merry Christmas, Hop.

596
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,380
Mmm.

597
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,850
What you got there?

598
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:09,970
That one of yours?

599
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:12,070
- Yeah.\N- Looks pretty big.

600
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,750
Be careful. You'll break it.

601
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,940
What are you... What are you doing?

602
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,450
Documenting.

603
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,910
Oh, why?

604
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,360
Because...

605
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,620
- It looks great.\N- Oh, this is just so overcooked.

606
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,250
- And look, the potatoes are runny.\N- Mom.

607
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,670
- They're so runny.\N- Mom, it's gonna be great.

608
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:40,250
- It's definitely an Atari.\N- An a-what-i?

609
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,630
The green present. It's an Atari.

610
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,360
I felt Dustin's today,\Nit's the same exact weight.

611
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,300
- Really? Well...\N- Yeah.

612
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,680
We'll have to see, won't\Nwe? Hey, no more snooping.

613
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,930
No, I forgot to wash my\Nhands. I'll be right back.

614
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,240
Okay.

615
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,370
He's washing his hands?

616
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,410
Thanks.

617
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:45,790
Are you okay?

618
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,710
Yeah, I'm okay.

619
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,510
Mmm. Very good, Mom.

620
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,700
Mmm. Hey, Mom. Did Will\Ntell you about, uh, the game?

621
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,950
- Oh, yeah.\N- No. What game?

622
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,330
I threw a fireball at him and... dead.

623
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,710
Wait, what is... You mean, this is...

624
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,290
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

625
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,130
- Dungeons & Dragons. Right.\N- It's fun.
