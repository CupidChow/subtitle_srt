1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,370
- Still nothing?\N- Nothing.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,800
Food court? You sure they said food court?

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,100
I'm sorry, have my translation skills\Nbeen letting you down?

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,600
We don't know it's your kids.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,900
Yes, we do.

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,120
- What is that?\N- There's something in there.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,620
- No!\N- Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,900
Keep her talking.\NKeep her awake, okay?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,450
Jesus Christ.

10
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,300
Hey, hey, hey. Stay awake, stay awake.\NLet's get her on this side, on this side.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,200
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.\N- It's, uh...

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,150
You know, it's not actually that bad.\NThere was a...

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,350
The goalie on my soccer team,\NBeth Wildfire,

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,620
this other girl slid into her leg,\Nand the bone came out of her knee,

15
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,950
- six inches or something, it was insane.\N- Robin.

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,370
- Yeah?\N- You're not helping.

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,870
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,870
Okay. All right, El?

19
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,620
This is gonna hurt like hell, okay?

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,320
- Okay.\N- Need you to stay real still.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,820
Here, you're gonna want to bite down\Non this, okay?

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,120
Jesus Christ.

23
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,950
Holy shit. Holy shit.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,300
Do it.

25
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,370
Okay.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
Oh, shit.

27
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,720
- Jonathan!\N- Stop talking!

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,950
- Goddamn it!\N- No! Stop it!

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,770
Stop! Stop!

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,800
I can do it.

31
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,500
I can do it.

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
God!

33
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,400
God!

34
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,830
The Mind Flayer,\Nit built this monster in Hawkins,

35
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,960
to stop El, to kill her\Nand pave a way into our world.

36
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,880
And it almost did.\NThat was just one tiny piece of it.

37
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,430
How big is this thing?

38
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,930
It's big.

39
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,510
- Thirty feet, at least.\N- Yeah.

40
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,440
It sorta destroyed your cabin.

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,190
Sorry.

42
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,280
Okay, so, just to be clear, this...

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,940
this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El,

44
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,030
it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?

45
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,530
- Yes.\N- But instead of, like, screws and metal,

46
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,440
the Mind Flayer made its weapon...

47
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,040
with melted people.

48
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,910
- Yes, exactly.\N- Yeah, okay.

49
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,360
I... Yeah, I'm just making sure.

50
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,540
Are we sure this thing is still out there,\Nstill alive?

51
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,410
El beat the shit out of it,\Nbut, yeah, it's still alive.

52
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,110
- But if we close the gate again...\N- We cut the brain off from the body.

53
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,130
And kill it.

54
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,590
Theoretically.

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,510
Yoo-hoo!

56
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,260
Yoo-hoo!

57
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,510
Okay, this is what Alexei called\N"the hub."

58
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,610
Now, the hub takes us to the vault room.

59
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,190
Okay, where's the gate?

60
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,440
Right here.\NI don't know the scale on this,

61
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,740
but I think it's fairly close\Nto the vault room,

62
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,530
maybe 50 feet or so.

63
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,810
More like 500.

64
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,690
What, you're just gonna waltz in there\Nlike it's commie Disneyland or something?

65
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,240
I'm sorry, who are you?

66
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,990
Erica Sinclair. Who are you?

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Murray...

68
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,580
Bauman.

69
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,380
Listen, Mr. Bunman,

70
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,340
I'm not trying to tell you\Nhow to do things,

71
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,410
but I've been down in that shithole\Nfor 24 hours.

72
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,590
And with all due respect,\Nyou do what this man tells you,

73
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,790
you're all gonna die.

74
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,560
I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old\Nspeaking to me?

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,060
Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard!

76
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,810
- Erica!\N- Just the facts!

77
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,440
She's right. You're all gonna die,\Nbut you don't have to. Excuse me.

78
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,060
- Sorry, may I?\N- Please.

79
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,610
Okay, see this room here?\NThis is a storage facility.

80
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,730
There's a hatch in here that feeds\Ninto their underground ventilation system.

81
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,890
That will lead you to the base\Nof the weapon.

82
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,390
It's a bit of a maze down there,

83
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,080
but between me and Erica,\Nwe can show you the way.

84
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,690
You can show us the way?

85
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,480
Don't worry, you can do all the fighting\Nand the dangerous hero shit,

86
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,490
and we'll just be your...

87
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,390
navigators.

88
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,740
No.

89
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,380
Nope.

90
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,930
Well, that settles it.

91
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,290
He's gonna die. They're gonna die.

92
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,390
Yep, most likely.

93
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,510
You guys survived.

94
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,110
Barely.

95
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,160
We could've really used you guys\Ndown there.

96
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,310
Could've used you up here, too.

97
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,660
Yeah, man. We missed you, dude.

98
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,060
Yeah. Big-time.

99
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,760
I missed you guys, too.

100
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,210
Big-time.

101
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,010
Please don't cry, nerds.

102
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,960
- Erica.\N- Keep saying my name, see what happens.

103
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,660
Hey, heads up. You can navigate,\Njust from someplace safe.

104
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,610
- It's not that simple.\N- The signal won't reach.

105
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,210
Not with this. You need something\Nwith a high enough frequency band

106
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,810
to relay with the Russians' radio tower.

107
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,560
But for that to work, you need someone\Nwho has both seen their comms room

108
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,360
and has access to a super-powered\Nhandcrafted radio tower,

109
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,660
one preferably already situated\Nat the highest point in Hawkins.

110
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Oh, wait.

111
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,110
That's me.

112
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,910
If you want us to navigate, you got us.

113
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,160
But we need a head start.

114
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,210
And a car.

115
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,660
Oh, man, now this...

116
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,560
this is what I'm talkin' about!

117
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,860
- "Toddfather"?\N- Oh, screw Todd!

118
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,260
Steve's her daddy now.

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,810
Did you just talk about yourself\Nin the third person?

120
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,660
- Did he just call himself daddy?\N- All right, where are we going?

121
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,060
- Weathertop.\N- Weather-what?

122
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,910
- Just drive.\N- Okay. Jesus!

123
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,760
Bottom lock,

124
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,060
second-to-top lock,

125
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,010
third-to-top lock,

126
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,960
top lock.

127
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,160
Listen to me, I need to end this,

128
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,710
but I will be back before you know it,\Nokay?

129
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,160
- I don't know, Mom.\N- No, listen. You're gonna be safe there.

130
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,210
It's... It's far away from all this.

131
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,010
You just stick close to your brother\Nand... and do whatever he says.

132
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,310
No matter what. Okay?

133
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,260
I'm not worried about me, Mom,\NI'm worried about you.

134
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,110
Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine.

135
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,210
Okay? I'm gonna be fine.

136
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,310
Okay, Mom.

137
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,410
Okay, Mom. That's enough.

138
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,110
- I'm gonna be fine.\N- Okay.

139
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,860
Mom, I can't breathe.

140
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,210
- My battery's low, but...\N- You're suffocating me.

141
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,410
...it will recharge.

142
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,810
I know it will, kid.

143
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,210
I know.

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,660
I can fight.

145
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,310
Better than any of us.

146
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,510
But right now,

147
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,410
I need you safe.

148
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,910
This thing is after you.

149
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,260
It's not after me.

150
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,410
Do you understand?

151
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,160
Hey...

152
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,010
I need you to understand.

153
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,460
Okay?

154
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Hey.

155
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,160
We should probably go.

156
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Mike?

157
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,510
Be careful.

158
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
What?

159
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,610
It's a two-man operation. Two!

160
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,360
- Yeah, well, change of plans.\N- Change of plans?

161
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,510
- Yeah. Will you explain it to him, please?\N- We have two options here, Jim.

162
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,610
We can turn the machine off,\Nor we can explode it.

163
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,710
- Oh, yeah, says who?\N- Says the man who built it!

164
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,510
- Yeah, and we wanna explode it!\N- Or else our heroic efforts

165
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,460
will be for naught!

166
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,710
This is a three-man operation, Jim,\Nnot two.

167
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,510
Yeah, three.

168
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,760
El, you're bleeding.

169
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,860
Are you okay?

170
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,410
Yeah.

171
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,610
- Here.\N- Okay.

172
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,310
Here.

173
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,060
Lay down.

174
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,010
- What's wrong?\N- I don't...

175
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,660
I don't know.

176
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,410
You can't be serious. Come on!

177
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,910
Didn't your mom just buy this car?

178
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,610
Yes. I'm sure it's fine.

179
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,260
- Did you leave the lights on?\N- No.

180
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,960
- Do we have gas?\N- Yes!

181
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,560
- Come on!\N- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just stop, stop!

182
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,510
Pop the hood.

183
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,010
- What the hell?\N- What?

184
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,560
The ignition cable's gone.

185
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,810
Back in the mall!

186
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,510
Back in the mall!

187
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,660
- Go! Go, go, go!\N- Be careful!

188
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
Go! Go!

189
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,810
Go, go, go!

190
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,560
So then I yank those cables\Nlike I'm pulling weeds.

191
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,860
- And that'll set off the alarm...\N- According to Alexei,

192
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,360
may his soul rest in peace.

193
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,160
Which should give you two an opening\Nto retrieve the keys from the vault.

194
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,460
And then we just follow the map\Nto the observation room, turn the key...

195
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,860
- Kaboom, we blow this sucker sky-high.\N- Yeah.

196
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,710
And then, once the rift is closed,\Nwe escape back through the vents.

197
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,210
Right under their commie noses.

198
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
Then home free.

199
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,310
Uh...

200
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,480
Oh, God, just because it wasn't your plan\Ndoesn't mean it was a bad plan.

201
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,060
I didn't say it was a bad plan.

202
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,280
You made a noise.

203
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,950
- I did not make a noise.\N- You did too.

204
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,780
- I really think it's disrespectful...\N- What is up with you and noises?

205
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,950
Children! Children!

206
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,580
It is a good plan.

207
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,750
A solid B, which is laudable,\Ngiven the situation and time constraints.

208
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,880
Dare I say, if it all goes right...

209
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,630
...they'll never even know we were here.

210
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,560
Stop right there!

211
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,260
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

212
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,810
Documents, important documents...

213
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,180
for the Lieutenant-Comrade!

214
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,980
He called us, last minute.

215
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,610
Pardon our sloppy appearance.

216
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,610
Lieutenant? What Lieutenant?

217
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,150
Lieutenant...

218
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,110
Molotov?

219
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,410
Oh, shit.

220
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,710
Jim...

221
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,630
This is crazy.

222
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,800
- Oh, my God.\N- Jim, I... This...

223
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,510
I had it under control.

224
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,800
Yeah, sure you did.

225
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,460
What are you doing?

226
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,460
I'm improvising.

227
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,680
♪ Your love ♪

228
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,850
♪ Liftin' me higher... ♪

229
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,760
Jesus, how far is this place, man?

230
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,560
Relax, we're almost there.

231
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,260
Suzie must be pretty special, huh?

232
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,630
I mean, if you built this thing

233
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,450
and lugged it all the way to the middle\Nof nowhere just to talk to her?

234
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,530
I mean, nobody's scientifically perfect,

235
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,530
but Suzie's about as close\Nto being perfect

236
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,160
as any human could possibly be.

237
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,280
She sound made-up to me.

238
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,860
She sound made-up to you?

239
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,360
- Why are you hesitating, Steve?\N- I'm... I'm... I'm not! I'm not!

240
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,530
I think she sounds real.\NYou know, totally, absolutely real.

241
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,410
Left. Turn left.

242
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,330
- There's not a road here.\N- Turn left now!

243
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,460
Jesus! Hang on!

244
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,260
♪ Higher and higher ♪

245
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,630
Whoa! Henderson, where are we going?!

246
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,630
Up!

247
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,710

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,930

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,180
Yes, we are. Come on, baby.\NCome on, baby!

251
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,680
Come on!

252
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,450
Come on. Come on.

253
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Come on!

254
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,580
Guess the Toddfather has its limitations.

255
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,660
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

256
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,260
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

257
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,350
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

258
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,510
Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy?

259
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,760
We're trapped in the mall\Nand in need of emergency transportation.

260
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,560
Scoops Troop, do you copy?\NBilly has found us.

261
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,360
He has disabled our car\Nand we are trapped in the mall.

262
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,200
Repeat: Billy has disabled our car\Nand we are trapped in the mall.

263
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,400
- Scoops Troop...\N- You're gonna kill him, aren't you?

264
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,360
This is just a precaution, okay?

265
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,030
And not just against Billy.

266
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,410
If he knows we're here,\Nso does the Mind Flayer.

267
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,000
Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need\Nof emergency transportation.

268
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,750
Do you copy?

269
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,460
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

270
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,760
No chance that thing'll drive, right?

271
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,080
- Steve, do you copy?\N- We don't need it to drive.

272
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,510
Dustin!

273
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,430
We just need the ignition cable.

274
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,980
Push!

275
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,780
Shit!

276
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,310
Let me try.

277
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,780
El...

278
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,360
I can do it.

279
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,330
Can I help?

280
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,080
Picking up.

281
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,030
Do I know you?

282
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,000
New arrivals.

283
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,630
Landed last night.

284
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,510
Say goodbye to sunlight.

285
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,080
Who needs sunlight

286
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,960
when we have one another, comrade?

287
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,880
Indeed, comrade!

288
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
And a bottle of Stolichnaya.

289
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,710
Why are you talking so much?

290
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
He was nice.

291
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,580
- He was nice?\N- He was a nice guard.

292
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,480
Yeah, I mean, we should probably\Ninvite him over after all this is done.

293
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,980
Yeah, I can bake him a casserole.

294
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,480
Get a six-pack,\Nshare some laughs.

295
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,580
You know, have a drink.

296
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,680
Ugh.

297
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,060
Anyone wanna trade jobs?

298
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,200
Bald Eagle, do you copy?

299
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,060
Bald Eagle, I repeat,\Nthis is Scoops Troop, do you copy?

300
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,230
Yes, I copy.

301
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,230
Call sign?

302
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,980
Bald Eagle.

303
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,280
Please repeat.

304
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,580
- Bald Eagle. This is Bald Eagle!\N- Copy that.

305
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,780
Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle.\NWhat's your 20?

306
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,410
We reached the vent.\NI'll contact you when I need you.

307
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,780
Until then, silence.

308
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Roger that, Bald Eagle.

309
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,830
This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent.\N10-10, over.

310
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,330
I hate children.

311
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,100
- Remember, if anyone says anything, just...\N- Smile and nod.

312
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,930
Good luck.

313
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,110
Push!

314
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,160
All right, great.

315
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,830
All right, now, all the way. Ready?

316
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,050
Three, two, one... Push!

317
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Told you.

318
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,630
Physics.

319
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,380
How do we get it open?

320
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,510
Uh, there should be a latch.\NCheck under the wheel.

321
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,350
- You see it?\N- I don't know, hold on.

322
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,360
What's she doing?

323
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,350
El.

324
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,560
Are you okay?

325
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,080
- Do you see it?\N- I don't know.

326
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,460
It should be right here.

327
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,110
Distributor, distributor...

328
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Mike.

329
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,850
Got it.

330
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,600
Nancy!

331
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,550
Come on!

332
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,230
We just found them like this.

333
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,580
The American.

334
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,130
It's taking too long.

335
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,980
- It's fine.\N- No, it's not. It is not.

336
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,230
She could've died back there.

337
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,480
She almost did.

338
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,680
Well, she's safe now.\NShe's on her way to Murray's.

339
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,230
That thing won't find her,

340
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,830
not before we kill it.

341
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,380
Hey. This isn't the way\Nthis is supposed to work, all right?

342
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,480
You're supposed to say,\N"Yes, I told you so.

343
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,330
That's why we needed to go back\Nto the kids."

344
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,780
Oh, yeah, and then\Nyou say something like...

345
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,630
"Yeah, well, it's really hard to listen

346
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,830
when you make everything sound\Nlike it's the end of the goddamn world."

347
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,680
You know...

348
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,830
I think, despite everything,\NI mean, despite the arguing,

349
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,530
I think we make a pretty good team.

350
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,730
Well, we made it this far, didn't we?

351
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,730
Yeah.

352
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,730
We did.

353
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,930
We did.

354
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,680
So, uh...

355
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,080
did I get the job or what?

356
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,030
Ah, come on.

357
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,430
Detective Byers.

358
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,630
It has a ring, doesn't it?

359
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,280
It's kinda hard to serve in a town\Nwhere you don't live, Detective.

360
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,430
You're still moving outta here.\NI mean, that is the plan, right?

361
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,530
Eh, we'll see how it goes.

362
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,880
"How it goes"? How what goes?

363
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,480
You know, if... if we actually do\Nmake it out of here,

364
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,230
we... we deserve to celebrate, right?

365
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Yeah.

366
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
I mean...

367
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,730
yes.

368
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,180
Absolutely.

369
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,630
I hear Enzo's is pretty good.

370
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,630
What do you say, Friday, eight o'clock?

371
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,080
Uh, El likes to watch Miami Vice\Non Fridays.

372
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,780
It... It starts at 10:00,\Nso I... I can't be out late on a Friday.

373
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,730
Okay, well, how about 7:00, then?

374
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
7:00?

375
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,430
Enzo's, Friday, I meet you there?

376
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,930
No, you pick me up.

377
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,480
Picking you up, 7:00 p.m. Friday.

378
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,780
Yeah, it's a date.

379
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,830
Just for clarification, just because I...\NI mean, just... If...

380
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,080
When you say "date,"\Njust so that we're crystal clear,

381
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,930
- so there's no confusion... Yeah?\N- Yeah, Hop?

382
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,630
Stop talking or I'm gonna change my mind.

383
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,980
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

384
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,780
Okay.

385
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,180
Scoops Troop, this is...

386
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Hm.

387
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,830
Bald Eagle.

388
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,480
I've reached another junction.

389
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,380
- This is what?\N- The fourth junction.

390
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,030
All right, so if memory serves, this is\Nright after the My Little Pony thesis.

391
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
- We went left, so he has to go right.\N- Right.

392
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,130
Fly right, Bald Eagle.

393
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,980
- Fly right.\N- Roger that, flying right.

394
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,930
Little shit.

395
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,030
What's the My Little Pony thesis?

396
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,430
Don't get him started.

397
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,730
- Get him started? Just tell me...\N- Hey, guys?

398
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,180
Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop!\NDo you copy? Over!

399
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,980
Griswold Family, I repeat,\Nthis is Scoops Troop. Do you...

400
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,130
Griswold Family, do you copy?

401
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,880
Do you copy?!

402
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,630
Griswold Family,\Nthis is Scoops Troop.

403
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,930
Please confirm your safety!

404
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,430
Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop!\NPlease confirm your safety!

405
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,530
Are you en route to Bald Eagle's nest?

406
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,930
Please confirm your safety!

407
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,780
Someone, please just answer.\NIs anyone there?

408
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,130
Just answer!

409
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,030
Anyone, please...

410
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,280
Griswold Family, do you copy?

411
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,330
Griswold Family, do you copy?

412
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,130
Griswold Family, do you copy?

413
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,930
Do you copy?!

414
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,930
- Where are you going?!\N- To get them the hell outta there!

415
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,630
Stay here, contact the others!

416
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,030
- Shit.\N- Wait, Robin!

417
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,900
Stay in touch.

418
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,650
Got it.

419
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,080
Bald Eagle, this is Scoops Troop.\NWhat's your 20?

420
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,330
I told you, radio silence!

421
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,950
Yeah, but we have a problem.

422
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,250
What kind of problem?

423
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,130
It's turned away.\NIf we go up the stairs now, we'll make it.

424
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,000
- No way, not with El's leg.\N- We have to try.

425
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,550
There's another way...

426
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,630
to get out.

427
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,830
Through the Gap.

428
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
Okay.

429
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,130
Now.

430
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,550
Bald Eagle has landed.

431
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,550
Repeat.

432
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,520
Bald Eagle

433
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,850
has landed.

434
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,700
Okay.

435
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,150
Come on, how much longer?

436
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,400
I don't know, I've never done this before!

437
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,620
Okay.

438
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,830
Okay, okay!

439
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,000
Get ready, lovebirds,\Nyou're almost up to bat.

440
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,080
Oh, shit.

441
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,180
- What are you doing?\N- Don't worry.

442
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,380
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

443
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,380
Let's go.

444
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,350
Let's go.

445
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,000
Did Mikhail send for you?

446
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,930
- All right.\N- Okay.

447
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,730
- Give me the code.\N- Okay.

448
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,730
Six-six-two,

449
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,070
six-oh-eight,

450
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,600
oh-oh-four.

451
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,250
Uh...

452
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,650
again?

453
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,630
Six-six-two,

454
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,670
six-oh-eight,

455
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,580
oh-oh-four.

456
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Murray?

457
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,630
Your goddamn code...

458
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
is wrong.

459
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,300
What? Are you sure?

460
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,430
Yeah, I'm sure.

461
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,020
Well, I... I suppose it could be wrong.

462
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,820
How could it be wrong?

463
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,100
The code is a number,\Na famous number.

464
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,350
Planck's constant\NI... I thought I knew it.

465
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,250
Planck's constant.

466
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
- You know it?\N- Not by heart. You?

467
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,250
I'm not a nerd, nerd.

468
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,500
He told me it was\NPlanck's constant, which I know.

469
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,130
Why would I need him to give me a number\NI already know?

470
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,200
What are you doing?

471
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,130
Go, go, go!

472
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,730
- Shit.\N- Get the car started. Go!

473
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\NCome on.

474
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,530
- Come on.\N- We gotta go!

475
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,150
Come on!

476
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,780
We gotta go!

477
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,930
Are you okay?

478
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,730
Ask me tomorrow?

479
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:27,980
Oh, shit!

480
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,900
Get in!

481
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,380
- Go, go, go, go!\N- Go, go, go!

482
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,230
Suzie, do you copy?

483
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,370
Suzie, do you copy?

484
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,230
Suzie, do you copy?

485
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,570
This is Suzie. I copy.

486
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,620
- Suzie!\N- Dusty-bun?

487
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
"Dusty-bun"?

488
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,680
Where have you been?

489
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,930
I'm so, so sorry.\NI... I've been really busy...

490
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,370
uh, trying to save the world\Nfrom Russians and monsters.

491
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,330
Of course you have.

492
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,330
Get the goddamn number already!

493
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,970
Who was that?

494
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,280
It was...

495
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,530
Uh, I don't know, actually.\NI think it was just some interference.

496
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,470
So, why don't we, uh, change frequency

497
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,020
to 14.158?

498
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,150
Copy that, shifting frequency. Standby.

499
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,450
- Dusty-bun, you copy?\N- I copy, Suzie-poo.

500
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,250
It sounds much better now, thanks.

501
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,050
- Suzie.\N- Okay, so, listen,

502
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,600
do you know Planck's constant?

503
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,450
Do you know the Earth orbits the sun?

504
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,600
Okay, so I know it starts\Nwith two sixes, and then a...

505
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,800
W-What is it?

506
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,350
Okay, let me just be clear on this.\NI haven't heard from you in a week,

507
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,800
and now you want a mathematical equation\Nthat you should know

508
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,850
so you can... save the world?

509
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,100
Suzie-poo, I promise,

510
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,000
I will make it up to you\Nas soon as possible.

511
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,900
You can make it up to me now.

512
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,400
- What?\N- I want to hear it.

513
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,700
- Not right now.\N- Yes, now, Dusty-bun.

514
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,550
Suzie-poo, this is urgent.

515
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,700
Yes, yes, you're saving the world,\NI heard you the first time,

516
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,650
but Ged is also saving Earthsea\Nand he's about to confront the shadow,

517
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,550
so this is Suzie, signing off.

518
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,750
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.

519
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,400
Okay. Okay.

520
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,800

00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,950
Gosh, I miss you, Dusty-bun.

542
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,700
And I miss you more, Suzie-poo.

No, I miss you...

545
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,650
Enough.

546
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,050
- Shit!\N- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

547
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,350
It's turning around.

548
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,250
- What?\N- It's turning around!

549
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,450
Maybe we wore it out.

550
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,300
I don't think so. Hold on.

551
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,800
Hey! Everybody out.

552
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,250
Everybody out!

553
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
Hey.

554
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,000
You ready to end this?

555
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,650
In here. In here.

556
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,650
Okay. Come on, come on, come on...

557
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,950
Billy.

558
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,850
Billy, you don't have to do this.

559
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,900
Billy. Your name's Billy, Billy Hargrove.

560
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,300
You live on 4819 Cherry Lane.\NBilly, please, I'm Max, I'm your...

561
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,000
Murray, you all set down there?

562
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,990
All set, but I've got some company\Nwhich I'd love you to obliterate.

563
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,650
Will do. Hang tight.

564
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,620
On three.

565
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,820
On three.

566
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,000
One...

567
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,450
Two...

568
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,270
The Americans,

569
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,600
I've found them...

570
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,370
Don't be afraid.

571
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,740
It'll be over soon.

572
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,750
Just try and stay... very still.

573
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,570
Flay this, you ugly piece of shit!

574
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,290
Hey, asshole! Over here!

575
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,940
- We're almost out!\N- I know!

576
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,820
Dustin! We're out of time!

577
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,100
Hurry! Close it now!

578
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,520
Close it!

579
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,800
Come on!

580
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:01,470
Mike...

581
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,550
Mike.

582
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,140
Mike.

583
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,970
Mike. Mike. Mike, get up.\NMike, can you hear me? Mike! Mike!

584
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,470
Hey, come on.

585
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,020
You okay?

586
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:18,650
Where's El?

587
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,120
- Leave me alone!\N- Stop it!

588
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,970
- Mom!\N- This is your new sister.

589
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,500
...at least seven feet.

590
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,170
Seven... feet.

591
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,640
You told her...

592
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,100
the wave was seven feet.

593
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,020
Woo!

594
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,320
Yeah!

595
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,320
You ran to her, on the beach.

596
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,700
There were seagulls.

597
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,870
She wore a hat...

598
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,170
...with a blue ribbon.

599
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,470
A long dress...

600
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,270
with a blue and red flower.

601
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,800
Yell... Yellow sandals,

602
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,970
covered in sand.

603
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:41,850
She was pretty.

604
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,870
She was really pretty.

605
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,670
And you...

606
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,200
you were happy.

607
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,540
I'll see you in hell!

608
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Hit me.

609
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,900
We're out!

610
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,600
Damn it!

611
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,700
No!

612
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,820
Close it now!

613
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,720
Close it!

614
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,720
Billy!

615
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,720
- El.\N- Mike!

616
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:30,570
Billy?

617
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:32,820
Billy.

618
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,870
Billy, Billy, get up, please.\NBilly, get up, please, please.

619
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,970
- I'm sorry.\N- Billy...

620
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,470
Billy. Billy.

621
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:45,320
Billy, wake up. Billy, get up.\NPlease, Billy...

622
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,620
Billy!

623
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:51,870
Billy...

624
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,370
Billy...

625
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,970
I'm sorry.

626
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,520
It's okay. It's okay.

627
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,770
It's okay. It's okay.

628
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,020
Hop.

629
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,470
Jim. Where's Jim?

630
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,670
Let's go! Go! Come on!

631
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,470
You all right?

632
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,770
Hands up!

633
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:41,170
Don't shoot! American!\NWe're Americans! Americans!

634
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,670
Hey, come on, let's go!

635
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:33,920
Go, go!

636
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,070
Thank God!

637
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,890
Welcome to Hawkins, Indiana,

638
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,310
a wonderful place to grow up,

639
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,520
to raise your family,

640
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,140
to walk your dog.

641
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,640
But then...

642
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,270
...on July Fourth,\Neverything changed.

643
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,940
A terrible tragedy struck\Nthis small town.

644
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,120
But this was not this small town's\Nfirst brush with tragedy.

645
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,410
Mysterious deaths, government cover-ups,

646
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,740
a bizarre chemical leak.

647
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,960
Is it all linked?

648
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,490
All a vast conspiracy?

649
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,590
The fault of a disgraced,\Ncorrupt mayor?

650
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,760
Or is something more going on\Nin the heartland?

651
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,390
Can a town itself be cursed?

652
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,640
Some believe a rise in Satanism\Nis to blame.

653
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,670
To find out,

654
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,220
tune in tonight at 8:00 p.m.\Nfor "Horror in the Heartland"

655
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,970
on Cutting Edge.

656
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,390
You put your mom down as a reference?

657
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,240
Yeah. Why not?\NShe's, like, super well-respected.

658
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,020
You're such a dingus.

659
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,520
Wha...

660
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,340
Uh, just to be clear,\Nwe weren't fired, you know.

661
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:18,540
The mall burned down and, like,\Nkilled a bunch of people.

662
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,490
Thanks for sharing.\NDidn't know.

663
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,210
Three favorite movies. Go.

664
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,420
Uh... The Apartment,

665
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,920
Hidden Fortress, Children of Paradise.

666
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,040
You, go.

667
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,170
- Favorite movies?\N- Did I stutter?

668
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,670
Uh... Animal House, for sure.

669
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,020
Um...

670
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,940
Eyes on me, Harrington.

671
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:40,720
Yeah. Uh...

672
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,890
Star Wars.

673
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,970
A New Hope?

674
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:44,940
A new what-now?

675
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,990
Which Star Wars?

676
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,520
The one with the teddy bears. Duh.

677
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,910
No? Uh... Oh, the one that just came out.\NThe movie that just came out.

678
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,290
The one with the DeLorean\Nand Alex P. Keaton,

679
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,290
and he's trying to bang his mom.

680
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,620
The time...

681
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,140
Yeah, those are my top three. Classics.

682
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,460
You start Monday.

683
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:05,990
You start never.

684
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,920
Will you just, um...\NWill you give us a minute?

685
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,970
Why?

686
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,040
Steve.

687
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,890
All right, you have to understand, Keith,

688
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,140
I know his taste is a bit pedestrian,

689
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,720
but the dingus has other qualities.

690
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,110
He's a douchebag of the highest order,\NRobin.

691
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:31,070
He was a bit of a prick to us\Nin high school, I'll grant you that,

692
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,320
but he remains...

693
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,160
a total chick magnet.

694
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,870
Yeah, okay,\Nand this is relevant to me how?

695
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,120
Uh, Earth to Keith.

696
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,620
The ladies will come in just to see him.

697
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,040
They'll come in in droves.

698
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,670
Droves, Keith.

699
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,460
We sold so much ice cream,

700
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,670
they had to get a second shipment in\Nfrom Michigan.

701
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,920
Goddamn Michigan, Keith.

702
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,590
And these ladies...

703
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,470
These ladies are hot.

704
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,470
They're so very hot.

705
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,140
And there are too many of them\Nfor little Steve.

706
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,810
He needs assistance.

707
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,720
He needs your assistance, Keith.

708
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:09,570
What's in it for you?\NYou got a thing for him or something?

709
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:12,860
Goddammit. This is...

710
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,740
Hm.

711
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,520
We're just, um...

712
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,660
We're just friends.

713
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,070
Oh!

714
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:24,320
Fast Times. Fast Times. Ever heard of it?

715
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,870
Top three for me, Keith.

716
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,240
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down.\N- Sorry. Sorry.

717
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,540
- Still got it?\N- Yeah, yeah.

743
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:49,170
Not possible.

744
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:58,790
Is that...

745
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,670
everything?

746
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,340
I guess so.

747
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:17,070
Seventeen years of my life...

748
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,360
packed up in one day.

749
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,120
What if I just...

750
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,470
don't let you go?

751
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,340
I think...

752
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,510
the new owners might kick us out.

753
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,890
You could stay in our basement.

754
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,610
Your dad'd love that.

755
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,270
We could hide you in a tent,

756
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:57,020
like El.

757
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:03,610
Hey.

758
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,320
It's gonna be okay.

759
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,960
As a wise man once said...

760
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,320
we've got shared trauma.

761
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,460
So what's a little more, right?

762
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,690
What's a little more?

763
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,440
They'll come back.

764
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,290
I know they will.

765
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,640
Thanks.

766
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,640
- You packed your walkie, right?\N- Yes.

767
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,090
Because you know that I'm gonna\Nsteal Cerebro from Dustin

768
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:43,640
and call you so much,\Nyou're gonna have to turn it off, right?

769
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,140
Did you talk to your mom?

770
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,940
About Thanksgiving?

771
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,290
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\NI got the okay. I'll be there.

772
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,890
And then I was thinking maybe\Nyou could come up here for Christmas.

773
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,040
And Will, too.

774
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,890
You can come before or after Christmas,\Nor whatever Mrs. Byers wants,

775
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:02,340
but I was thinking Christmas Day\Ncould be super fun,

776
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,140
because we'd all have cool new presents\Nto play with and, uh...

777
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,790
Sorry, that made me sound like\Na seven-year-old.

778
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,540
I like presents, too.

779
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,140
Yeah, cool. Yeah.

780
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,590
I like... I like presents, too.

781
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:18,890
Cool.

782
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:29,790
Mike?

783
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,340
Yeah?

784
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,190
Remember that day...

785
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:39,490
at the cabin, you were talking to Max?

786
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,640
Um...

787
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,140
I don't think I follow.

788
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,340
You talked about your... your feelings,

789
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:45,890
your heart.

790
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:46,740
Oh.

791
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,140
Oh, yeah, that.\NMan, that was so long ago. Um...

792
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,940
That was really heat of the moment stuff,\Nand we were arguing and...

793
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:56,840
I don't really remember...

794
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,490
What did I say, exactly?

795
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,590
Mike...

796
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,840
I love you, too.

797
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,090
Donation box?

798
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:44,890
Uh, yeah, sure.

799
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,140
What is that?

800
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:50,990
Uh...

801
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,490
It... It's the speech Hop wrote\Nfor you and Mike.

802
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,040
Speech?

803
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,640
Yeah. You know, the heart-to-heart.

804
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:05,740
He never talked to you, did he?

805
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,690
Can I read?

806
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,990
"There's something I've been\Nwanting to talk to you both about.

807
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,840
I know this is a difficult conversation,

808
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,640
but I care about you both very much.

809
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,890
And I know that you care about each other\Nvery much.

810
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:41,640
And that's why it's important that\Nwe set these boundaries moving forward,

811
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:43,790
so we can build an environment...

812
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,290
where we all feel...

813
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,290
comfortable...

814
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,190
trusted...

815
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,040
and open...

816
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,590
to sharing our feelings."

817
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,090
Feelings.

818
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,240
Feelings.

819
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,090
Jesus.

820
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,040
The truth is,

821
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:32,840
for so long,\NI'd forgotten what those even were.

822
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,440
I've been stuck in one place,

823
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,640
in a cave, you might say.

824
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:40,890
A deep, dark cave.

825
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,940
And then,\NI left some Eggos out in the woods,

826
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,140
and you came into my life and...

827
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:51,040
for the first time in a long time,

828
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,490
I started to feel things again.

829
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,540
I started to feel happy.

830
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:05,740
But, lately, I guess I've been feeling...

831
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:08,890
distant from you.

832
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,310
Like you're...

833
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,610
you're pulling away from me or something.

834
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,910
I miss playing board games every night,

835
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:23,580
making triple-decker Eggo extravaganzas\Nat sunrise,

836
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,860
watching westerns together\Nbefore we doze off.

837
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,290
But I know you're getting older.

838
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,910
Growing.

839
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:34,840
Changing.

840
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,680
And I guess...

841
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,430
if I'm being really honest,

842
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:42,810
that's what scares me.

843
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,840
I don't want things to change.

844
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:53,310
So, I think maybe that's why\NI came in here,

845
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:56,560
to try to maybe... stop that change.

846
01:07:58,410 --> 01:07:59,990
To turn back the clock.

847
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:04,160
To make things go back\Nto how they were.

848
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,660
But I know that's naive.

849
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:12,630
It's just...

850
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,160
not how life works.

851
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,260
It's moving.

852
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,540
Always moving, whether you like it or not.

853
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,730
And, yeah, sometimes it's painful.

854
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:28,340
Sometimes it's sad.

855
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:31,390
And sometimes...

856
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,940
it's surprising.

857
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,440
Happy.

858
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:39,910
So, you know what?

859
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,240
Keep on growing up, kid.

860
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,940
Don't let me stop you.

861
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,540
Make mistakes, learn from 'em,

862
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,460
and when life hurts you,\Nbecause it will,

863
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,880
remember the hurt.

864
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,590
The hurt is good.

865
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:01,710
It means you're out of that cave.

866
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,640
But, please,

867
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,090
if you don't mind,

868
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,590
for the sake of your poor old dad,

869
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,360
