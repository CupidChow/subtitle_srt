Oh, you found Ralph Macchio.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,790
- Macchio?\N- Yeah, he's the Karate Kid.

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,240
Hai-yah!

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,920
He's so hot, right?

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,020
I bet he's an amazing kisser, too.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Hey, uh...

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,170
is Mike a good kisser?

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
I don't know.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,790
He's my first boyfriend.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,790
Ex-boyfriend.

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,090
Hey, don't worry about it. Okay?

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,170
He'll come crawling back to you\Nin no time, begging for forgiveness.

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,340
I guarantee you, him and Lucas are, like,

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,920
totally wallowing in self-pity and misery\Nright now.

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,220
They're like,\N"Oh, I hope they take us back."

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,340
God, what I wouldn't give\Nto see their stupid faces.

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,390
What is it?

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,940
Is this really gonna work?

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,540
Holy shit, this is insane.

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,070
- Max.\N- Yeah, quiet. I'm sorry.

24
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,220
What's wrong with me?\NWhat did I do wrong?

25
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,370
Nothing.

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,340
What did I do wrong?\NWhat could I have done wrong?

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,120
Do I have to\Ngo through this again?

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,140
I see them.

29
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,970
What are they doing?

30
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,090
Eating.

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,020
I just don't understand what I did\Nto deserve this.

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,390
Nothing. Nothing.\NThat's my whole point.

33
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,570
You are the victim here.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,890
I know. It's just,\Nwhy is she treating me this way?

35
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,420
- I don't know.\N- Mike...

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,670
What did I do wrong?

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,520
- What did I do wrong?!\N- Mike, stop.

38
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,740
Relax. Just relax.

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,570
Okay? Stop asking rational questions.

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,170
I know, I know, you're right.

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,290
- Yeah.\N- Because women act on emotion

42
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,290
- and not logic.\N- Precisely.

43
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,040
It's a totally different species.

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,670
They say we are "species."

45
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,420
- What?\N- "Emotion, not logic."

46
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,520
What?

47
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,890
Guys, it's ready.

48
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,340
- Will, not right now.\N- They broke up with you.

49
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,370
- What else is there to talk about?\N- Tons.

50
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,690
Yeah, we're trying to solve\Nthe great mystery of the female species.

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,070
Dude, you can smell the nacho cheese.

52
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,070
- I got that beat.\N- What?

53
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,270
- Oh, no.\N- No, Lucas, no.

54
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,190
No!

55
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,540
Lucas! Lucas!

56
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,740
What happened?

57
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,420
What...

58
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,790
What? What happened?

59
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,670
Hey!

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Hey!

61
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,370
When I say three inches, three...

62
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,620
Do you knock? Jeez!

63
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,140
Yeah! Jeez!

64
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,740
Oh, hey.

65
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,690
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,690
- I thought that, uh...\N- Mike's not here.

67
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,670
Max wanted to have...

68
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,120
a sleepover.

69
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,920
Is that... okay?

70
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,290
Yeah.

71
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,740
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

72
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,920
Your parents know about it?

73
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,470
Yup.

74
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,470
Uh, yeah, it's cool.

75
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah.

76
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,270
That's... That's really cool.

77
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,720
Did you need something?

78
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,020
No, no.

79
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,220
Uh, I'll leave.

80
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,940
I'll just let you... I'll leave you...

81
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,420
Holy shit,\NI can't believe we're really doing this.

82
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,240
- Ready?\N- Ready.

83
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,470
Mr. Wheeler.

84
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,840
Ugh. Boring.

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,270
Yeah, boring.

86
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,620
Spin again.

87
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,020
Against the rules?

88
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,670
We make our own rules.

89
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,970
Billy.

90
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,690
Okay, look, I should just warn you,

91
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,020
if he's with a girl\Nor doing something gross,

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,620
just get out of there right away\Nbefore you're scarred for life.

93
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,370
- Max...\N- No, I'm just saying, I'm serious.

94
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,740
- He's really gross.\N- Max!

95
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,370
Okay, shutting up now.

96
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,970
I found him.

97
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,610
What's he doing?

98
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,190
I don't know.

99
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,810
Don't be afraid.

100
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
He's...

101
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,610
on the floor...

102
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,440
It'll be over soon.

103
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,820
...talking to someone.

104
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,160
Just stay very still.

105
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,010
Billy!

106
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,760
What is it?

107
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,970
What happened?

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,330
Yes!

109
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,810
- What are you doing?\N- Yeah, Will, can you turn down the music?

110
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,060
Please address me by my full name.

111
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,330
- What?\N- My full name!

112
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,580
Oh, my God. Okay, Will the Wise,

113
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,780
can you please turn down the music?

114
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,280
That is not music.

115
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,860
That... is the sound of destiny!

116
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,910
I have seen into the future,\Nand I've seen that today is a new day,

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
a day...

118
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
free of girls!

119
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,500
What is happening right now?

120
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,910
Will, come on.

121
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,800
A tribe of villagers are under threat\Nfrom an evil force

122
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
from the swamps of Kuzatan.

123
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,250
Will, it's so early.

124
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,350
Is it?

125
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,350
Is it early, Michael?

126
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,980
Tell that to the villagers\Ncrying for your help,

127
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,900
the children so frightened,

128
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,350
they cannot sleep.

129
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,730
Are you truly going to let them perish?

130
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,410
Or are you going to come to their rescue

131
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,060
and become the heroes\Nyou were always meant to be?

132
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,400
Uh...

133
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,980
Can I at least take a shower first?

134
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,030
Oh, God.

135
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,480
Hopper? Are you there?

136
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,980
Oh! Look who it is!

137
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,530
We need to talk.

138
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,950
Yeah, we do.

139
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,450
I haven't been stood up like that\Nsince Alice Gilbert in the 9th grade.

140
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,950
What are you doing?

141
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Joyce.

142
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,080
- Hello?\N- Just watch.

143
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,180
Okay, you're freaking me out.

144
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,800
- You slipped on this, remember?\N- Yeah.

145
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Yeah, it fell in the night.\NIt lost its magnetism.

146
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,380
- Oh, did it?\N- And the same exact thing happened

147
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,260
at my house the day before.

148
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,430
- Wow.\N- And I thought, "Okay, that's weird."

149
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,680
Right? Why are all these magnets\Nsuddenly losing their magnetism?

150
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,650
- Uh-huh?\N- So, I went and saw Scott.

151
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,930
Scott.

152
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,030
Who's Scott?

153
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,600
- Scott Clarke.\N- Your child's science teacher?

154
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,810
He's pretty brilliant, actually.

155
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,860
And I asked him, "How is this happening?"

156
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,580
And he built this magnetic field\Nusing an AC transformer

157
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,500
and plugging it into a solenoid.

158
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,950
And... And with that solenoid,\Nwhich basically...

159
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,250
Slow down, slow down.

160
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,580
I just want to get this exactly right,\Nokay?

161
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,710
You stand me up...

162
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,550
...no phone call, no apology,

163
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,880
because you had to go\Nto Scott Clarke's house.

164
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,210
Yeah.

165
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,260
You've outdone yourself, Joyce.

166
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,930
You really have.\NNo, you've outdone yourself.

167
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,810
Oh, come on, Hop,\Nyou're not even listening to me.

168
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,060
Scott was able to demagnetize\Nsome of the magnets, and he thinks...

169
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,580
I don't care what Scott thinks!

170
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,610
He thinks that a large-scale\Nmagnetic field could be built

171
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,250
using some sort of machine\Nor... or experimental technology.

172
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,660
He's brilliant, isn't he?

173
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,580
He's really brilliant. Is he single too?

174
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,180
What if it's them?

175
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,100
To build a machine like this,\Nyou need resources.

176
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,600
You need scientists, you need funding,

177
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,430
- tens of millions of dollars.\N- Joyce.

178
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,010
It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper.

179
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
It has to be them.

180
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,150
Joyce, stop.

181
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,480
It has to be the lab.

182
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,680
It is impossible.

183
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,810
- Well, then, prove it to me.\N- Prove it?

184
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,030
- Yeah, take me back there.\N- To the lab.

185
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Yeah, I wanna go back.

186
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,150
Because some magnets\Nfell off your fridge.

187
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,230
Yes.

188
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
Okay, makes sense.

189
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,250
Thank you.

190
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,900
It makes sense.

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,500
I'm a little busy right now,\Nbu t maybe we canmeet up there,

193
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,330
like tonight, like seven o'clock?

194
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,050
You know, of course,\Nunless something comes up

195
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,880
- which, you know, it will.\N- You know,

196
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,800
after everything that's happened,

197
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,350
this is no joke.

198
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,710
No, I don't think it's a joke.

199
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,510
I think that when I asked you out,\NI think you got scared.

200
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,900
I think you got scared, and now,\Nyou're inventing things.

201
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,400
You're inventing things\Nto get worked up about

202
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,350
so that you can push me away.

203
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,810
Because God forbid

204
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,400
any of us

205
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,830
move on!

206
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,700
Because that...

207
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,030
that would be...

208
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,450
I mean, that would be\Ntoo much, right, Joyce?

209
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
You know?

210
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,130
That would be too much,\Nwouldn't it, Joyce?

211
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,960
Wouldn't it, Joyce?

212
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
Joyce?

213
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,350
Joyce!

214
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,930
- What the hell are you doing?\N- I need to borrow these.

215
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,810
No, you're not going back there.

216
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,310
Joyce...

217
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,450
Joyce, you're not going back there...

218
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,730
Son of a bitch!

219
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,330
It's gonna start pouring soon.

220
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,200
We should be at the mall\Nor, like, watching a movie or something.

221
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,080
You don't believe me?

222
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,460
I believe you saw some\Nsuper weird stuff, totally,

223
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,250
but you said Mike has\Nsensed you in there before, right?

224
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,180
So maybe it was just like that.\NMaybe Billy just...

225
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,880
sensed you somehow.

226
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,150
- But the screams.\N- Yeah, I know, but here's the thing.

227
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,310
When Billy is alone with a girl,

228
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,850
they make, like, really crazy noises.

229
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,980
- They scream?\N- Yeah, but, like... happy screams.

230
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,780
- Happy screams? What is happy screams?\N- It's like...

231
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,700
I'm just gonna lend you\Nmy mom's Cosmo.

232
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,030
His car's not here.

233
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,130
You really want to do this?

234
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,300
Why do I get the feeling we're gonna find\Nall kinds of wrong in here?

235
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,650
Ugh!

236
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,510
Gag me with a spoon.

237
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Max?

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,030
Ice. It's just ice.

239
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,630
Probably for his muscles or something.\NHe works out like a maniac.

240
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,850
El, what is it?

241
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,530
You sure about this?

242
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
You really are your mother's son,\Nyou know that?

243
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,160
What's that supposed to mean?

244
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,950
It means...

245
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,630
you worry too much.

246
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,330
- Huh.\N- I got this, okay?

247
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,180
Okay.

248
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,430
So, what exactly are we looking at here?\NIs this the Driscoll lady's stuff?

249
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,930
No. No, see, that's the thing. I mean,

250
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,930
listen, I thought she was crazy too, but...

251
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,650
She told me Johnson killed Kennedy.

252
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,700
But, it turns out, she's not alone.

253
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,360
Blackburn's Supply, Hawkins Farming,\Nthe Crawleys,

254
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,530
they've all had some supplies go missing,\Nall in the past few days.

255
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
And it's not just fertilizer.

256
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,850
It's pesticides, cleaning supplies,\Ndiesel fuel.

257
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,780
And that's just from one day\Nof calling around. I mean...

258
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,180
there's gotta be more.

259
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,530
Okay, wait, wait, wait.\NLet me get this little...

260
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,450
story of yours straight.

261
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,080
So, little rodents have gone cuckoo\Nin their furry little minds

262
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,250
and they're running around\Nthe town of Hawkins,

263
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,080
dining out on chemicals.

264
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,580
I know how it sounds, but...

265
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,750
But you've got proof!

266
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,980
I mean, fellas, you gotta admit,\Nit's a hell of a headline, right?

267
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,430
"Hawkins Rodents Prefer Poison:\NNutjob Tells All."

268
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,500
Guys, that's enough.

269
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,930
I think this is...

270
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,880
big.

271
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,100
Bigger than one article.

272
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,030
In fact,\NI think this has got to be a book.

273
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,830
The Mysterious Case\Nof the Missing Fertilizer,

274
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,350
a Nancy Drew mystery.

275
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,100
Next time a call comes in,

276
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,730
do what you were hired for,

277
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,030
and let us know, yeah?

278
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,950
Ah...

279
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,830
We'll decide what's a story\Nand what's not.

280
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,130
Okay.

281
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,280
Bye-bye, Nancy Drew.

282
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,430
Hey, it's okay. Nancy. Nancy!

283
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,580
Excuse me.

284
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
Ahoy!

285
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,780
I'd like to try the peanut butter\Nchocolate swirl, please.

286
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,830
No. No more samples today.

287
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,150
Why not?

288
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,180
Because you're abusing our company policy.

289
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,100
Where's the sailor man?

290
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,900
Sorry, he can't help you. He's busy.

291
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,650
Busy with what?

292
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,950
Spycraft.

293
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,250
You see anything?

294
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,200
Uh, I guess I don't totally know\Nwhat I'm looking for.

295
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,950
Evil Russians.

296
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, exactly. I don't know\Nwhat an evil Russian looks like.

297
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,550
- Tall, blond, not smiling.\N- Mm-hmm?

298
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,680
Also, look for earpieces,

299
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,230
camo, duffel bags,\Nthat sort of thing.

300
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,800
Right, okay, duffel bags.

301
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,150
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.\N- What?

302
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,330
Anna Jacobi's talking\Nwith that meathead Mark Lewinsky.

303
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,480
If you're not gonna focus,\Njust gimme the binoculars.

304
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,600
Aw, Jesus Christ,\Nwhatever happened to standards?

305
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,330
I mean,\NLewinsky never even came off the bench.

306
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,880
Dude, you are the worst spy in history,\Nyou know that?

307
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,900
- Stop, hey. Stop.\N- Give me those.

308
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,380
I don't get why you're looking at girls.\NYou have the perfect one in front of you.

309
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,830
- Seriously, if you say Robin again...\N- Robin.

310
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,780
- No, don't. No.\N- Robin, Robin, Robin.

311
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,230
- Stop, no, no, no.\N- Robin. Robin.

312
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,080
- Robin.\N- No.

313
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,000
- Robin.\N- No!

314
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,580
No, man, she's not my type.

315
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,750
She's not even...

316
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,730
in the ballpark of what my type is,\Nall right?

317
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,050
What's your type again? Not awesome?

318
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,250
- Thank you.\N- Hm.

319
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,480
For your information,\Nshe's still in school. And she's weird.

320
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,480
She's a weirdo. And she's hyper.

321
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,900
I don't like that she's hyper.

322
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,230
And she did drama.\NThat's a bad look.

323
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,580
And she's in band?

324
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,600
- No.\N- Now that you're out of high school,

325
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,080
which means you're technically an adult,\Ndon't you think it's time you move on

326
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,130
from primitive constructs\Nsuch as popularity?

327
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,950
Oh, primitive constructs? That some\Nstupid shit you learned at Camp...

328
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,200
Know... Nothing?

329
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,400
Camp Know Where, actually.

330
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,300
- And no, it's shit I learned from life.\N- Hm.

331
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,780
Instead of dating somebody\Nyou think's gonna make you cooler,

332
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,200
why not date somebody you actually enjoy\Nbeing around?

333
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,550
Like me and Suzie.

334
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,630
Oh, Suzie.

335
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,930
Yeah, you mean,\N"hotter than Phoebe Cates."

336
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,050
Yeah, that Suzie.

337
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,430
And, uh, let's think about

338
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,800
how exactly did you score\Nthat beautiful girlfriend?

339
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,300
Oh, yeah. With my advice.

340
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,930
Because that's how this works, Henderson.

341
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,100
I give you the advice, you follow through.

342
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,150
Not the other way around,\Nall right, pea-brain?

343
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,950
Do you guys hear that?

344
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,780
It sounds like... thunder.

345
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,830
But, no, wait. That's not thunder.

346
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,030
It's...

347
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,200
a horde of juju zombies!

348
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,000
Sir Mike, your action.

349
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
What should I do?

350
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,500
Attack?

351
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,430
Okay, I attack with my flail.

352
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,050
Whoosh!

353
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,300
You miss.

354
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,600
Your flail clanks the stone, the zombie\Nhorde lumbers towards you, and...

355
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,300
the juju bites your arm. Flesh tears!

356
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,380
Aah!

357
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,900
Seven points of damage.

358
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,300
Oh, no, my arm.

359
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,780
Lucas, look, my arm.

360
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,780
Sir Lucas, the zombie horde roars!

361
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,580
Do you fight back or do you run?

362
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,000
No! It's a distraction!

363
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,250
A trap. Do not answer it.

364
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
What... No!

365
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,180
El?

366
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,250
No.

367
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,050
Sorry, not interested.

368
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,980
Telemarketers.

369
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,750
Maybe we should just call them.

370
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,180
We can do that?

371
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,300
- I think so.\N- Yeah, but what would we say?

372
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,980
We'll say nothing! The Khuisar tribe\Nstill needs your help.

373
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,180
All right, then.

374
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,530
I'll use my torch to set fire\Nto the chambers, sacrificing ourselves,

375
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
killing the jujus, and saving the Khuisar.

376
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,430
We all live on as heroes\Nin the memories of the Kalamar.

377
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,030
Victory.

378
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,100
Okay. Fine.

379
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,150
You guys win.

380
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,380
- Congratulations.\N- Will, I was just messing around.

381
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,280
Hey, let's finish for real.

382
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,830
- How much longer is the campaign?\N- Just forget it, Mike.

383
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,780
No, you want to keep playing, right?

384
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,580
Y-Yeah, totally.

385
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,680
- We'll just call the girls afterwards.\N- I said forget it, Mike, okay?

386
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,050
- I'm going home.\N- But...

387
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,730
- Come on, Will.\N- Move!

388
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,680
Will, come on.

389
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,350
You can't leave. It's raining.

390
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,400
Listen, I said I was sorry, all right?

391
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,150
It's a cool campaign. It's really cool.

392
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,150
- We're just not in the mood right now.\N- Yeah, Mike. That's the problem.

393
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,830
You guys are never in the mood anymore.

394
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,100
- You're ruining our party.\N- That's not true.

395
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Really? Where's Dustin right now?

396
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,100
See? You don't know\Nand you don't even care.

397
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,250
And obviously he doesn't either\Nand I don't blame him.

398
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
You're destroying everything,\Nand for what?

399
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,380
So you can swap spit\Nwith some stupid girl?

400
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,380
El's not stupid.

401
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,400
It's not my fault you don't like girls.

402
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,550
I'm not trying to be a jerk. Okay?

403
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,550
But we're not kids anymore.

404
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,730
I mean, what did you think, really?

405
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,120
That we were never gonna get girlfriends?

406
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,050
We were just gonna sit\Nin my basement all day

407
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,750
and play games for the rest of our lives?

408
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,150
Yeah.

409
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,420
I guess I did.

410
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,620
I really did.

411
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
Will.

412
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,470
Will!

413
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,420
Will, come on!

414
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,770
Excuse me.

415
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,570
No one in the water\Nuntil 30 minutes after the last strike.

416
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,400
And don't try and argue with me.

417
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,530
You wanna get electrocuted,\Ngo climb a tree.

418
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,570
Yeah, we don't care.\NWe're not here to swim.

419
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,280
Or get electrocuted.

420
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,280
We found this.

421
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,700
Does that belong to anybody?

422
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Oh, yeah.

423
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,800
That's Heather's.

424
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,870
I'll get it back to her.

425
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,380
We could give it back to her.

426
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,380
You could.

427
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,220
'Cept she's not here.

428
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,880
Bailed on me today.

429
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,020
What is this?

430
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,600
You girls want a reward or somethin'?

431
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,270
No.

432
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,470
We're just...

433
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,180
Good Samaritans.

434
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,670
Heather.

435
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,370
Do you think you can find her?

436
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,250
No way!

437
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,180
What do you see?

438
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,970
A door.

439
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,520
A red door.

440
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,880
Help me.

441
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,350
Help me!

442
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,230
No!

443
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,150
What happened? El!

444
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,570
Hello?

445
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,680
Anybody home?

446
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,370
We come in peace.

447
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,800
No!

448
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,350
No!

449
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,670
Let's go!

450
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
Joyce.

451
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
You okay?

452
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,430
I'm fine.

453
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,350
You want to wait in the car?

454
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,070
I said I'm fine.

455
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,020
- Target acquired.\N- Where?

456
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,520
- Ten o'clock. Sam Goody's.\N- Give me that.

457
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Shit.

458
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,270
Duffel bag.

459
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,900
Evil Russian.

460
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Slow down.

461
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,700
We're losin' him.

462
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,370
- You're getting too close.\N- Watch it, dickwad.

463
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,500
Hello. Yes. I am fine.

464
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
How are you?

465
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,600
All right, everyone, listen up!

466
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,980
I just have one question for you.

467
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,070
Who...

468
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,120
is ready to sweat?

469
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,450
That's right!

470
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,030
Okay! Let's start it nice and easy now.

471
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,820
Let's move our thighs. Yeah!

472
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,550
Yeah, ladies, warm it up.

473
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,830
Bring it down to your hips.

474
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,330
Start feeling that burn,

475
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,330
everywhere, down in the loins, right?

476
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,130
Come on, ladies, show me what you got.

477
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,550
Slow now. Just isolate.

478
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,880
Ooh, tip that up. That feels good!

479
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,270
"The week is long.

480
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,680
The silver cat feeds\Nwhen blue meets yellow in the west.

481
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,400
A trip to China sounds nice\Nif you tread lightly."

482
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,400
"Tread lightly"?

483
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,320
- Delivery for you.\N- Thank you.

484
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,300
- Have a nice day.\N- Yeah, you too.

485
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Silver cat.

486
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,350
Silver cat.

487
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,720
You're not gonna believe\Nwho Dustin thought was a Russian.

488
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,150
- You did too.\N- No, I did not.

489
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,070
- Yes, you did.\N- No, I did not.

490
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,320
"A trip to China sounds nice."

491
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,450
A trip to China sounds nice.

492
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,520
A trip to China sounds nice.

493
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,950
A trip to China sounds nice.

494
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
A trip to China sounds nice.

495
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,570
"If you tread lightly."

496
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,320
If you tread...

497
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,570
If you tread...

498
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,050
If you tread lightly.

499
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,920
"When... When blue and yellow\Nmeet in the west."

500
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
When blue meets yellow...

501
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,000
in the west.

502
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,700
Robin.

503
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,550
What are you doing?

504
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,100
- I cracked it.\N- Cracked what?

505
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,170
I cracked the code.

506
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,470
Oh-ho-ho! Oh!

507
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,570
There it is!

508
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,250
Careful! It might have rabies!

509
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,050
Better get that thing outta here.

510
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,700
You don't want it eatin' the tires\Noff your car.

511
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,000
Come on!

512
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,870
What...

513
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,170
- What's this?\N- Proof.

514
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,250
Proof?

515
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,800
They said they wanted proof, right?\NSo let's give it to 'em.

516
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,170
A rubber rat?

517
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,500
No, the real rat.

518
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,400
Driscoll's rat.

519
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,050
You said yourself it looked sick.

520
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,820
We can take it\Nto an animal control center,

521
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,300
they can run some blood tests on it,

522
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,020
- figure out what's wrong with it...\N- Whoa, Nancy, slow down.

523
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,600
Tom didn't ask for proof.

524
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,400
He asked us to drop the story.

525
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,070
That's because he didn't believe us.

526
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:21,970
Nancy.

527
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,950
I'm right.

528
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,070
That's not the point.

529
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,150
Then what's the point?

530
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,500
You should've thought about that\Nbefore you talked to them.

531
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,300
All right? They're assholes, okay?\NI get it.

532
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,820
But it's just some stupid story.

533
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,270
Oh, it's stupid?

534
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,620
It's stupid to get fired over.

535
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,550
No one's going to fire us.

536
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,050
Look, if you don't want to go,\Nthat's fine.

537
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Just...

538
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
give me the keys.

539
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,250
You're relentless, you know that?

540
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,670
Come on.

541
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,950
Nobody's home.

542
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,720
All the cavities\Nhave been filled.

543
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,970
I watched 'em do it, Joyce.

544
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,550
Will!

545
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,350
It's over.

546
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,600
It's over.

547
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,320
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

548
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,570
You're not losing your mind.

549
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,200
Not any more than I am.

550
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,720
You know, the other day,\NI almost shot Betsy Payne's dog

551
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,250
because it came rushing at me\Nfrom behind this fence, and I...

552
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,400
I swear to God, I thought it was\None of those things.

553
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,020
You know that I'm keeping\Na close eye on things, right?

554
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,550
- Yeah.\N- Because it's important to me.

555
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,070
It is important to me that you feel safe.

556
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,770
That you and your family feel safe.

557
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,850
I want you to feel

558
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,650
like this can still be your home.

559
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,250
What?

560
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,200
You didn't think I'd find out about that?

561
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,000
Gary called me.

562
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,100
He said he's fixing up your house\Nto put on the market.

563
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,500
The kids know yet?

564
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,470
After Sarah...

565
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,650
I had to get away.

566
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,570
I had to get the hell out of that place,\Nyou know?

567
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,570
Outrun those, uh...

568
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,950
those memories, I guess.

569
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,670
I mean, why do you think\NI ended up back in this shithole?

570
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,620
But you have something that I never had.

571
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,500
You have people that know\Nwhat you've been through.

572
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,350
You have people that care about you.

573
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,750
Right here.

574
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,050
In Hawkins.

575
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,650
You mean...

576
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,220
You mean, people like Scott Clarke.

577
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,250
That was a joke.

578
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,770
Mm.

579
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,750
What's that?

580
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Wait here.

581
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,450
Will!

582
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,500
Will, I'm sorry, man, all right?

583
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,250
I was being a total asshole.

584
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,250
Please, can you just come outside\Nand we'll talk?

585
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Will!

586
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,320
Hey, Will!

587
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,870
Come on, man! We're sorry!

Will!

589
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,920
Something is coming,

590
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,620
something hungry for blood.

591
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,790
- What is it?\N- What if it's the Demogorgon?

592
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,920
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed\Nif it's the Demogorgon.

593
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,050
It's not the Demogorgon.

594
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,340
- Will, your action!\N- Fireball!

595

Stupid.

603
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,790
Mrs. Driscoll?

604
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,550
Oh, she must not be home.

605
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,020
She's an 80-year-old woman\Nand it's pouring.

606
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,100
Where else would she be?

607
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,150
- Whoa, what are you doing?\N- Maybe she fell.

608
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,570
Or something.

609
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,070
Nancy...

610
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,740
Mrs. Driscoll?

611
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,120
- Seriously?\N- Mrs. Driscoll?

612
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,750
It's Nancy.

From The Hawkins Post.

614
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,600
Mrs. Driscoll?

615
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,770
Mrs. Driscoll?

616
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,240
Look for Imperial Panda\Nand Kaufman Shoes.

617
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,750
They're with that whistling guy,\Nten o'clock.

618

619
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,670
Chemical weapons?

620
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,890
Whatever it is,\Nthey're armed to the teeth.

621
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,670
Great.

622
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,270
That's great.

623
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,970
Hey, what's in there?

624
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,570
It's just more boxes.

625
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,020
Let me check it out.

626
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,670
- No, I'm still looking.\N- Lemme see it.

627
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,940
Hang on!

628
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,150
Duck!

629
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,290
Stay here.

630
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,220
Watch the door.

631
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,100
Well, I think we found your Russians.

632
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,790
This is Hawkins Chief of Police!\NCome out with your hands up!

639
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,100
- This is her house.\N- What?

640
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,890
Heather's house.

641
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,020
Isn't that cute, huh?

642
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,120
He's so funny.

643

Max.

644
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,240
We didn't mean to... barge in.

645
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,870
We tried to knock, but...\Nmaybe you didn't hear us over the storm.

646
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,570
I'm sorry, who is this dripping\Nall over my living room right now?

647
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
I'm sorry.

648
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,000
Janet, Tom,

649
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,090
this...

650
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,550
is my sister, Maxine.

651
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,890
Oh!

652
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,850
What on earth are you doing here?

653
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,390
Is something wrong?

654
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,640
We just wanted to make sure\Neverything was okay.

655
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,890
Okay?

656
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,850
- Why wouldn't it be okay?\N- Where is she?

657
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,370
I'm sorry.

658
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,440
Where is who?

659
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,640
Well, they're a little burnt, I'm sorry...

660
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,070
Heather! This is my sister, Maxine.

661
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,970
And, I'm sorry,\NI did not quite catch your name.

662
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,270
El.

663
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,570
El.

664
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,490
Now, what is it you were saying, El?

665
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,170
You were looking for somebody?

666
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,290
I... I saw...

667
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,740
- I saw you...\N- Your manager. At the pool.

668
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,390
He said you guys didn't come in\Nto work today, so we got worried.

669
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,220
Heather wasn't feeling so hot today,

670
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,770
so we thought we'd take the day off\Nto nurse her back to health.

671
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,720
But you're feeling just fine right now,\Naren't you, Heather?

672
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,140
I'm feeling so much better.

673
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,570

674
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,090
