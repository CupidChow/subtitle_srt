1
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,740
Dusty!

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,540
Dusty, how was it?

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,440
How was what?

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,390
"How was what?" The greatest\Nnight of the year, of course.

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,090
Oh. Oh, yeah, it was...\NIt was, uh, tubular.

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,890
- What's wrong with you?\N- Nothing.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,040
- Did something happen?\N- No. What? No.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,540
Are you constipated again?

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,840
No. Mom!

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,140
Okay, you're acting weird.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,690
I am not acting weird!

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,790
- Whoa!\N- Ah!

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,990
Awesome, right? Yeah...\NI rigged the trap with, uh,

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,690
a motor to make it look\Nlike I caught a ghost.

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,940
Just like the movie.

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,540
- Oh, Dusty.\N- Yeah.

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,940
Funny. Look at that. Look at that.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,640
I told you to keep quiet.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,890
All you had to do was\Nstay still for one minute.

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,140
One minute.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,940
Sorry, Yertle.

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,590
Temporary eviction, buddy.

23
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,290
What are you, little guy?

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,540
What were you doing in my trash?

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,990
You hungry?

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,340
Nougat.

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,540
Go on, eat.

28
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,790
Too hot?

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,590
Sorry about that, little guy.

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,290
You like nougat, too, huh?

31
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,140
You're pretty cute, you know that?

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,290
I'm glad I found you.

33
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,890
D'Artagnan.

34
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,890
I'm gonna call you d'Artagnan.

35
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,460
Rise and shine.

36
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,840
So that's it, huh?\NYou're still not talking?

37
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,590
All right.

38
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,760
I guess I'm just gonna have to, uh...

39
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,110
enjoy this triple-decker\NEggo extravaganza on my own.

40
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,230
Mmm!

41
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,190
Mmm!

42
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,190
Good, right?

43
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,330
Know the great thing about\Nit? It's only 8,000 calories.

44
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,760
You visited him again last night?

45
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,460
He says he needs me.

46
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,340
Want me to go check on him?

47
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,180
I know that you miss him, all right?

48
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,910
But it's too dangerous.

49
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,980
You're the last thing\Nhe needs right now.

50
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,730
You're gonna see him. Soon.

51
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,910
And not just in that head of yours.\NYou're gonna see him in real life.

52
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,580
I feel like I'm making\Nprogress with these people.

53
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,460
Friends don't lie.

54
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,510
What?

55
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,910
You say "soon" on day 21.

56
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,790
You say "soon" on day 205.

57
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,510
- You now say "soon" on day 326?\N- What is this?

58
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,060
You're counting the days now\Nlike you're some kind of prisoner?

59
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,130
When is "soon"?

60
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,860
"Soon" is when...

61
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,510
it's not dangerous anymore.

62
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,860
When?

63
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,780
- I don't know.\N- On day 500?

64
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,190
- I don't know.\N- On day 600?

65
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,030
- I don't know.\N- Day 700?

66
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,480
- On day 800?\N- No!

67
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,610
- I need to see him. Tell me!\N- I said I...

68
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,410
Oh! Shit! Shit!

69
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,380
Friends don't lie!

70
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,180
Jesus. Have you seen them?

71
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,210
- We're looking, Mom.\N- Yeah, we're... we're looking.

72
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,930
- A-ha! Found 'em.\N- Oh!

73
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,840
Hiding under some jeans,\Nsneaky little buggers.

74
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,610
Thank you. Thank you.\NYou're a life saver.

75
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,230
Can you take Will to school\Ntoday? I cannot be late again.

76
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,480
- He's staying over now?\N- Can you just take Will, please?

77
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,010
I can take him.

78
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,410
- Will you make sure he gets in okay?\N- Yeah, of course.

79
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,880
What do you say, big guy? Wanna\Ngo for a ride in the Bobmobile?

80
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,140
Mr. Henderson, you know\Nthe rules. Five at a time.

81
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,610
Yep.

82
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,390
One, two, three, four and five.

83
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,910
Ten.

84
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,780
You already have five books checked out.

85
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,980
My mistake.

86
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,730
However...

87
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,580
I am on a curiosity voyage,\Nand I need my paddles to travel.

88
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,230
These books...

89
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,930
These books are my paddles.

90
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,880
Five at a time.

91
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,080
- Are you shitting me?\N- Excuse me?

92
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,930
What the hell is...

93
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,780
- Mr. Henderson!\N- I need my paddles!

94
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,080
Was that you I heard milling around\Nlast night, or was that a ghost?

95
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,280
Yeah. Me, probably.

96
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,480
- Another nightmare?\N- Um... no.

97
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,080
Did I ever tell you about Mr. Baldo?

98
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,880
- Mr. Baldo?\N- Yeah.

99
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,340
I was a little younger than you,

100
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,990
standing in line for the Ferris\Nwheel at the Roane County fair.

101
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,840
- Mmm-hmm.\N- And suddenly,

102
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,640
I feel this fat white glove\Ntap me on the shoulder.

103
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,440
I spin around, and there he is.

104
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,040
Mr. Baldo.

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,690
"Hey, kiddo, would you like a balloon?"

106
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,240
Go ahead, laugh. It's funny.

107
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,690
It wasn't funny back\Nthen, I can tell you that.

108
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,190
I couldn't get him out of my head.

109
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,240
Every night, he would\Ncome to me in my dreams.

110
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
And every night when he came to me...

111
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,390
I ran.

112
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,840
It got so bad that I made my\Nmom stay in the room with me

113
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
until I could fall asleep every night.

114
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,690
- Really?\N- Really.

115
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,690
It went on like that for months.

116
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,040
And then one day, the\Nnightmares suddenly stopped.

117
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,740
- Wanna know how?\N- How?

118
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,890
Well, I fell asleep...

119
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,090
and just like always,\NMr. Baldo came to me.

120
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,390
Only this time, I didn't run.

121
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,990
This time, I stood my ground.

122
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,290
I just looked at Mr. Baldo

123
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,640
in his stupid face, and I\Nsaid, "Go away. Go away!"

124
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,290
Just like that, he was gone.

125
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,240
Never saw him again.

126
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,190
Easy-peasy, right?

127
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,440
Easy-peasy.

128
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
Just like that.

129
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,940
I still don't get why\Nthey call him zombie boy.

130
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,640
I mean, I get it. He got lost in\Nthe woods for a week or something,

131
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,090
but why is he a zombie? Because\Neveryone thought he was dead?

132
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,690
Yeah. I mean, we had a\Nfuneral for him and everything.

133
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,390
After a week?

134
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,740
Well, see, some other\Nkid drowned at the quarry.

135
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,490
We thought it was Will because\Nhis body was super decomposed.

136
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,540
What?

137
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,240
Okay, that's not funny.

138
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,540
It's not a joke, all right?\NIt's public knowledge.

139
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,040
You can ask anybody.

140
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,840
Except Will, because he is\Nreally sensitive about it.

141
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
All right?

142
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,490
Okay.

143
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,390
Have a great day, kiddo.

144
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,090
The case of Phineas Gage

145
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,790
is one of the great medical\Ncuriosities of all time.

146
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,840
Phineas was a railroad worker in\N1848 who had a nightmarish accident.

147
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,490
A large iron rod was driven\Ncompletely through his head.

148
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,790
Phineas miraculously\Nsurvived. He seemed fine.

149
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,140
And physically, yes, he was.

150
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,690
But his injury resulted in a\Ncomplete change to his personality.

151
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,290
So much so that friends that knew him

152
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,740
started referring to\Nhim as "No longer Gage."

153
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,700
At the time, this was known\Nas the American Crowbar Case.

154
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,130
Although it wasn't a...

155
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,460
I am so sorry, Mr. Clarke.

156
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,330
Really, I'm so sorry. Please\Ncontinue with the class.

157
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,450
Don't mind me.

158
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,680
Really, continue, please. Thanks.

159
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,380
Although it wasn't a crowbar,\Nit was a rod, as I said.

160
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,050
We have to meet. All of\Nus. At lunch, AV Club.

161
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,050
Why?

162
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,900
I have something that you won't believe.

163
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,690
AV Club. Lunch.

164
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,230
- Dustin!\N- Yes, my lord?

165
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,650
- Would you care to join the class now?\N- Please, yes.

166
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,700
- The case of Phineas Gage.\N- Phineas Gage.

167
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,530
- Page 104.\N- 104. 104.

168
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,880
- Focus.\N- Focusing. Focusing.

169
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,830
AV Club.

170
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,410
And he began to curse,\Nusing terrible words

171
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,250
that I don't dare repeat here.

172
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,430
And we found some\Nmore by Gilbert's farm.

173
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,100
Some real nasty stuff.

174
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,150
- It was sticky.\N- All right. Where else?

175
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,730
That was it, Chief.

176
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,900
That was it, or you\Nget tired of looking?

177
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,700
- It was getting dark.\N- I mean, it was really dark.

178
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,730
They're called\Nflashlights, you dipshits.

179
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,850
Oh, okay. Someone woke up on the

180
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,280
wrong side of the bed this morning.

181
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,000
More lady problems, Chief?

182
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,650
Hey, Chief! Where you going?

183
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,510
You want us to go back out there?

184
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,850
- Why's he gotta kick the door?\N- Hey, Chief!

185
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,600
My granddad used to live here.

186
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,430
Long time ago.

187
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,050
I mainly just use it for storage now.

188
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,980
Lot of history here.

189
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,830
So, uh... what do you think?

190
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,060
It's a work-in-progress.\NYou know, it's, uh...

191
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,280
It takes a little\Nimagination, but, uh...

192
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,250
once we fix it up, it's gonna be nice.

193
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
Real nice.

194
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,450
This is your new home.

195
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,150
Home.

196
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,600
Oh, yeah.

197
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,200
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,850
All right, this...

199
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,900
this is music.

200
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,750
All right. Let's get to work.

201
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,860
Give me those.

202
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,960
Okay.

203
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,460
Now, this is called a trip wire.

204
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,510
It's like an alarm.

205
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,760
You, uh, set it up like this.

206
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,910
And then, anybody gets close,

207
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,010
it's gonna make a loud\Nnoise like, uh, gunfire.

208
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,760
Bang!

209
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,460
Those bad men aren't gonna find ya.

210
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,760
All right? Not way the hell out here.

211
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,410
We'll take some precautions.

212
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,260
There's gonna be a couple ground rules.

213
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,360
Rule number one:

214
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,660
always keep the curtains drawn.

215
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,410
Rule number two:

216
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,710
only open the door if\Nyou hear my secret knock.

217
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,560
And rule number three:

218
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,660
don't ever go out alone,\Nespecially not in the daylight.

219
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,160
That's it. Three rules.

220
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,710
I call 'em the, uh...

221
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,310
Don't Be Stupid Rules.

222
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,760
'Cause we're not stupid.

223
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,410
Right?

224
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,460
Not stupid.

225
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,770
Harrington, right?

226
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,800
I heard you used to run\Nthis school. That true?

227
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,100
King Steve, they used to call you, huh?

228
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,050
Then you turned bitch.

229
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,350
Hey, maybe you should just\Nshut up and just play the game.

230
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,980
Whoo!

231
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,400
That's what I'm talking about! Whoo!

232
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Steve?

233
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,780
- What are you doing here?\N- What do you think?

234
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,570
Where were you this morning?\NI missed first period.

235
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,950
I figured Jonathan would take you.

236
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,750
Wha... What are you talking about?

237
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,250
Jesus, you really can't\Nhandle your alcohol.

238
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,250
Uh...

239
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,750
You remember going to Tina's\Nparty last night, right?

240
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,630
- Yes.\N- And then what?

241
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,650
I remember dancing, and...

242
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,680
spilling some punch.

243
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,850
You got mad at me because I was drunk...

244
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,680
and then you took me home.

245
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,070
No, see, that's where your\Nmind gets a little bit fuzzy.

246
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,900
That was your other boyfriend.\NThat was... That was Jonathan.

247
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,520
- I don't understand.\N- It's pretty simple, Nancy.

248
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,530
- You were just telling it like it is.\N- What?

249
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,450
Uh...

250
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,750
apparently, uh...

251
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,620
we killed Barb and I don't\Ncare, 'cause I'm bullshit...

252
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,330
and our whole... our whole\Nrelationship is bullshit, and...

253
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,050
I mean, pretty much everything is\Njust bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

254
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,330
Oh, yeah, also, you don't love me.

255
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,420
I was drunk, Steve. I\Ndon't remember any of that.

256
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,380
So that makes everything that you\Nsaid... It's what? Just bullshit, too?

257
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,800
- Yes.\N- Well, then tell me.

258
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,650
Tell you what?

259
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,770
You love me.

260
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,350
Really?

261
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,470
Harrington!

262
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,230
Dude, we need you, man. That\Ndouchebag's killing us. Let's go!

263
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,480
- All right!\N- Come on!

264
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,470
I think that you're bullshit.

265
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,000
His name is d'Artagnan.

266
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,520
Cute, right?

267
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,470
- D'Artagnan?\N- Dart for short.

268
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,820
- And he was in your trash?\N- Foraging for food.

269
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,400
- You wanna hold him?\N- No, no.

270
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,930
- He doesn't bite.\N- I don't want to...

271
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,400
Oh, God, he's slimy!

272
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,480
Ugh, he's like a living booger.

273
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,350
Ugh, oh, God!

274
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,920
What is he?

275
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,750
My question exactly.

276
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,450
At first, I thought it\Nwas some type of pollywog.

277
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,500
- Pollywog?\N- It's another word for tadpole.

278
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,300
- A tadpole is the larval stage of a toad.\N- I know what a tadpole is.

279
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,720
All right, then you know that\Nmost tadpoles are aquatic, right?

280
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,750
Well, Dart, he isn't.\NHe doesn't need water.

281
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,970
Yeah, but aren't there\Nnonaquatic pollywogs?

282
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,050
Terrestrial pollywogs?\NYep. Two to be exact.

283
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,520
Indirana semipalmata.

284
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,520
And the Adenomera andreae.

285
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,020
One's from India, one's\Nfrom South America.

286
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,820
So how did one end up in my trash?

287
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,350
Maybe some scientists brought\Nit here, and it escaped?

288
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,770
Do you guys see that?

289
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,120
Looks like something\Nis moving inside of it.

290
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,520
Whoa.

291
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,720
It's okay. It's okay.

292
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,870
I got you, little guy.

293
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,720
I know you don't like that. It's okay.

294
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,020
And there's another thing.

295
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,720
Reptiles, they're cold-blooded.\NEctothermic, right?

296
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,070
They love heat, the sun.\NDart hates it. It hurts him.

297
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,870
So, if he's not a\Npollywog or a reptile...

298
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,820
Then I've discovered a new species.

299
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,920
We gotta show him to Mr. Clarke.

300
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,720
- What if he steals my discovery?\N- He's not gonna steal your discovery.

301
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,680
You know, I'm thinking about\Ncalling it Dustonious pollywogus.

302
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,930
- What do you think?\N- I think you're an idiot.

303
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,880
When I become rich and\Nfamous for this one day,

304
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,230
don't come crawling back, saying,

305
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,630
"Oh, my God, Dustin, I'm so sorry for

306
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,030
being mean to you back in 8th grade.

307
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,130
Oh, my God."

308
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,080
- Have a nice day.\N- Thank you.

309
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,280
Baloney?

310
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,530
Mmm.

311
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,530
- Last night was fun.\N- Mmm-hmm.

312
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,130
I'm sorry if I overstepped anything.

313
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,330
No! No, you didn't.

314
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,630
Okay.

315
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,680
I mean...

316
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,380
I... I like you so much.

317
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,330
Not just you, everything\Nthat comes with you.

318
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,180
Your family, your boys.

319
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,680
And I hope it's not\Nwishful thinking, but...

320
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,430
I kinda feel like I'm\Nbreaking through with them.

321
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
Not so much Jonathan. He's a\Ntough cookie to crack, but...

322
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Yeah.

323
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,830
With Will, I don't know, I\Nfeel like we're connecting.

324
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,230
He likes you, too.

325
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,580
- Yeah?\N- Mmm-hmm.

326
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,980
I can tell.

327
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,980
Good.

328
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,130
Oh, there was... something\Nelse I was gonna mention, but...

329
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,880
It's not a big deal at all, but...

330
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,280
I just noticed this morning that\Nmy JVC was a little dinged up.

331
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,580
- Your what?\N- The video camera.

332
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,730
- Oh.\N- Yeah.

333
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,930
It still works fine and\Neverything. I just...

334
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,730
I went back and watched the tape...

335
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,280
and there were some older\Nkids picking on Will.

336
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,130
- What?\N- They scared him.

337
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,830
Who were they? Were they\Nthe Zimmerman brothers again?

338
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,130
Um, I don't know.

339
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,080
They were wearing masks\Nor sort of makeup and...

340
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,630
Maybe. They were the right age.

341
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,130
I'll kill them.

342
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,280
I swear to God, I\Nwill... I will kill them.

343
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,780
That's what I love about\Nyou. You punch back.

344
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,080
I was never really\None to put up a fight.

345
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,930
I struggled a lot like\NWill when I was a kid.

346
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,030
With bullies.

347
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,280
It's the ones like us,\Nthat don't punch back,

348
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,330
that people really take\Nadvantage of, you know?

349
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,780
They rub your nose in it,\Njust a little bit more.

350
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,030
I don't know why they do that.

351
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,130
Maybe it makes them feel powerful.

352
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,380
I don't know.

353
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,080
But, hey, look at me now.

354
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,180
I get to date Joyce Byers. Ha!

355
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,780
Are you kidding me? I get to date...

356
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,430
It all works out in the end, doesn't it?

357
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,730
Yes, it does.

358
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,830
Grass, crops, trees.

359
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,280
Everything in this area\Nis either dead or dying,

360
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,620
and that's a radius of over three miles.

361
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,920
And it all leads back to here.

362
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,840
See, these patterns here are\Nreally pretty. I like the design.

363
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,250
It's almost psychedelic.

364
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,090
- This is a joke to you, huh?\N- No, it's not a joke. I just...

365
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,670
I don't understand what this\Nhas to do with me, Chief Hopper.

366
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,970
Whatever is happening is spreading\Nfrom this place, from this lab.

367
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,190
That's impossible. It's...\NThe last burn was two days ago.

368
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,350
It's contained.

369
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,390
- What if there's a leak?\N- A leak?

370
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,190
- I don't know, man. You're the scientist.\N- Exactly.

371
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,650
And I'm telling you there's\Nnothing to worry about.

372
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,490
- Convince me.\N- Convince you?

373
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,040
Yeah. You and your egghead friends

374
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,450
go out there to every area on\Nthis map and you run your tests,

375
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,290
or whatever the hell it is you do,\Nand you see if anything comes up.

376
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,590
All right, so...

377
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,040
So you're... you're\Ngiving me orders now?

378
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,800
No.

379
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,800
- I keep things nice and quiet for you...\N- Mmm-hmm.

380
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,270
And you keep your shit out of my town.

381
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,640
That is the deal.

382
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,720
I have done my part, now you do yours.

383
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,520
Convince me.

384
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,150
So, he asked you to take me home?

385
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,320
Yeah.

386
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,900
Yeah, he was upset.

387
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,450
I mean, he was... He was really upset.

388
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,120
But he was still worried about you.

389
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,700
Hey.

390
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,090
You need to cut yourself\Nsome slack, okay?

391
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,290
People say stupid things\Nwhen they're wasted.

392
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,640
Things they don't mean.

393
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,140
Yeah, but that's the thing.

394
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,300
What if I did mean it?

395
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,390
All this time, I've been trying so

396
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,770
hard to pretend like everything's fine,

397
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,850
but it's not.

398
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,570
I... I feel like there's this...

399
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,390
I don't know, like this...

400
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,190
Like there's this weight\Nyou're carrying around with you.

401
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,570
All the time.

402
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,740
I feel it, too.

403
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,240
Yeah, but it's different for you.

404
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,150
Will came home.

405
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,040
Yeah.

406
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Yeah, he did.

407
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,370
But he's not the same.

408
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,000
I try to be there for him,\Nyou know, to help him, but...

409
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,720
I don't know.

410
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,090
I mean, maybe...

411
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,340
maybe things just can't go\Nback to the way they were.

412
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,940
Doesn't that make you mad?

413
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,820
Mad?

414
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,850
Yeah, that those...\Nthose people who did this,

415
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,850
who ruined so many lives,\Nthey just get away with it.

416
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,770
The people responsible for this...

417
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,370
- they're dead.\N- Do you really believe that?

418
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,250
Your mom's boyfriend.

419
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,500
- He works at RadioShack, right?\N- Yeah.

420
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,640
Why?

421
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,050
What are you thinking?

422
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,140
Do you wanna skip fourth period?

423
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,340
Isn't this fun?

424
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,440
Pump your feet.

425
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,540
"I would feel so sad if I thought\NI was a disappointment to her...

426
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,240
because she didn't live very\Nlong after that, you see.

427
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,640
She died of a fever when I\Nwas just three months old.

428
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,490
I do wish she'd lived long enough\Nfor me to remember calling her mother.

429
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,440
I think it would be so\Nsweet to say 'mother.'"

430
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,090
Do I have a mother?

431
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,940
Yeah, of course you have a mother.

432
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,490
You couldn't really be born without one.

433
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,940
Where is she?

434
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,090
She...

435
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,740
She's not around anymore.

436
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,290
Gone?

437
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,740
Yeah.

438
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm sorry about that, kid.

439
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,900
"And, uh, father died four\Ndays afterwards from fever, too.

440
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,350
That left me an orphan and\Nfolks were at their wits' end,

441
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,400
so Mrs. Thomas said to\Nme, what to do with me.

442
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,000
You see, nobody wanted me even then.

443
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,750
It seems to be my fate."

444
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,750
Is your mom here?

445
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,700
Sweetie?

446
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,400
School.

447
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,100
Where is school?

448
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,450
The school? It's, uh...\Nit's about a mile that way.

449
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,050
At least.

450
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,300
Where are your parents?

451
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,850
Look, Mommy, look.

452
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,850
RadioShack, Bob Newby\Nspeaking. How can I help ya?

453
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,050
Bob, it's Joyce.

454
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,600
Hey, Joyce, how ya doing?

455
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Hey, um... I'm trying to\Nwatch your video thingy,

456
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,150
and the tape, it's... it's\Ntiny. It's like it's shrunk.

457
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,050
That's 'cause it's a VHS-C, not a VHS.

458
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,700
You gotta find the\NRF-P1U with coaxial cable

459
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,800
so you can connect\Nthe video ins and outs.

460
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,650
Bob, English.

461
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,600
Right. Sorry. Um...

462
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:18,000
No, yeah, I did the coaxial\Nthings in the back, so I...

463
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,550
This one just goes\Ninto the camera itself?

464
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,750
- Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\N- It's blue. I think it's working.

465
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,000
I was thinking maybe tonight...

466
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,500
Joyce?

467
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,000
So you hit T to zoom\Nin, and W zooms back out.

468
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,300
See? Easy-peasy.

469
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,240
Watch it, zombie boy.

470
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,910
Trick or treat, freak.

471
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,990
Boo!

472
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,120
Loser.

473
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,760
Mike! Mike!

474
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,140
Will, you coming? Let's\Ngo show Mr. Clarke.

475
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,520
What?

476
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
What?

477
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,660
It's about d'Artagnan.

478
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,240
This is the reason I was late for class.

479
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,910
Pretty neat. These doors function?

480
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,360
Well, yeah, obviously. But\Nit's not about the trap.

481
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,660
It's what's inside.

482
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,790
Now, this very well may change\Nyour perception of the world.

483
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,960
Consider my interest piqued.

484
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,160
All right, first, let's\Njust clarify that...

485
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,510
this is my discovery, not yours.

486
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,920
Dustin, Jesus! Just show him!

487
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,590
- I'm just trying to clarify...\N- Dustin!

488
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,840
Okay, fine.

489
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,920
Stop!

490
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Clarke. It\Nwas just a stupid prank.

491
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,310
- What are you doing?\N- I told him to stop. We need to go.

492
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,140
- Mike!\N- Right now. Right now!

493
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,490
So, your sister coming or what?

494
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,110
Screw it. That little\Nshit can skate home.

495
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,790
- And don't call her that.\N- What?

496
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,960
Sister. She's not my sister.

497
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,290
Hello? Hello?

498
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,560
- Guys, come on. Can I come in yet?\N- No!

499
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,010
- I don't understand.\N- What do you not understand?

500
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,940
Will saw something that\Nlooked like Dart last year?

501
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,970
Kind of, but there was no tail.

502
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,140
But then he heard it\Nyesterday. The exact same sound.

503
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,260
- Why didn't you tell us before?\N- I wasn't sure.

504
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,640
- A coincidence.\N- Or not.

505
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,610
What if when Will was\Nstuck in the Upside Down,

506
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,270
he somehow acquired True Sight?

507
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,270
True Sight?

508
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,520
It gives you the power to\Nsee into the ethereal plane.

509
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,840
Elaborate.

510
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,790
Maybe these episodes that Will keeps\Nhaving aren't really flashbacks at all.

511
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,110
Maybe they're real.

512
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,540
Maybe Will can somehow\Nsee into the Upside Down.

513
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,120
- So that would mean...\N- Dart is from the Upside Down.

514
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,290
- We have to take him to Hopper.\N- I agree.

515
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,870
No way. If we take him to\NHopper, Dart's good as dead.

516
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,790
- Maybe he should be.\N- How can you say that?

517
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,540
How can you not? He's\Nfrom the Upside Down.

518
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,460
Maybe. But even if he is, it doesn't\Nautomatically mean that he's bad.

519
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,920
That's like saying just because\Nsomeone's from the Death Star

520
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,640
- doesn't make them bad.\N- We have a bond.

521
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,040
A bond? Just because he likes nougat?

522
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,440
No, because he trusts me!

523
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,810
He trusts you?

524
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,560
Yes, I promised I\Nwould take care of him.

525
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,970
Guys, what's going on? Come on.

526
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,460
- Don't hurt him.\N- Only if he attacks.

527
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,910
Just open it already.

528
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,660
Holy shit!

529
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,060
Oh, shit!

530
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,110
No!

531
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,160
What the...

532
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,110
Oh, shit!

533
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,960
Where'd he go?

534
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,160
- What was that?\N- Dart!

535
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,660
- What?\N- You let him escape!

536
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,710
- Why did you attack him?\N- Come on.

537
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,890
Don't hurt him. Don't you hurt him!

538
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,170
Jonathan?

539
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,320
Uh... Mrs. Wheeler.

540
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,370
- What a pleasant surprise.\N- Yeah.

541
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,620
- Uh, we have a test tomorrow.\N- Hmm.

542
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,870
- Oh, did you go shopping?\N- Oh, uh, yeah. My Walkman broke.

543
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,370
- Aw!\N- Bummer.

544
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,220
Anyway, we should go.\NIt's a really big test.

545
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,620
- Yeah.\N- So...

546
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,370
- Stressful.\N- Very.

547
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,320
- Bye, Mrs. Wheeler.\N- Bye! It's good to see you.

548
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,070
Okay, are you sure about this?

549
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,070
No.

550
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,220
Hello. Marsha speaking.

551
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,320
Hello?

552
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,920
Hello?

553
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,420
Mrs. Holland. Hi,\Nit's, um... it's Nancy.

554
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,770
Nancy?

555
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,970
I, uh...

556
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,070
I need to tell you something.\NSomething about Barb.

557
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,220
About that night. I, uh...

558
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,520
I, uh... I haven't been honest with you.

559
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,770
But I can't tell you here on the phone.

560
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,620
Meet me tomorrow, Forrest\NHills Park, 9:00 a.m.

561
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,870
Don't tell anyone.

562
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,320
And don't call me back\Nhere. It's dangerous.

563
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,720
Nancy, what is this?

564
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,070
I just need you to trust me. Please.

565
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,870
Well, you were right\Nabout these pumpkins.

566
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,670
Some nasty stuff.

567
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,870
And the smell... Gee, mother of God.

568
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,520
What exactly do you think is going on...

569
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,770
Well, I told you what I think.

570
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,420
But we'll run the tests,\Nand we'll see what comes up.

571
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,170
In the meantime, I just need you\Nto keep the area clear for us.

572
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,270
I don't think it'll be\Nmore than a day or two.

573
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,020
What do you want me to tell people?

574
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,070
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

575
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,170
- Hey, Chief, you copy?\N- Yeah.

576
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,620
Do you remember that Russian girl

577
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
Murray was going on about the other day?

578
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,370
Yeah, well, now I'm thinking\Nhe's not so crazy after all.

579
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,020
Stay where you are. Do not move.

580
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,230
East is clear. No sign of Dart.

581
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,310
Where'd you go, you little bastard?

582
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,930
West is clear, too. Will?

583
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,830
South is clear. Lucas?

584
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,010
Anything?

585
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,810
Excuse me! Mr. Sinclair!

586
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,510
Sorry, I was looking for study hall.

587
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,790
Bye.

588
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,360
Nothing here, man.

589
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,690
- What the hell are you doing?\N- What are you doing?

590
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,310
- Why are you in here?\N- Looking for Dart.

591
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,930
- This is the boys' room.\N- Yeah, so?

592
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,480
So you should go home.

593
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,610
- Why do you hate me so much?\N- I don't hate you.

594
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,130
How can I hate you? I don't know you.

595
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,710
But you don't want me in your party.

596
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,740
- Correct.\N- Why not?

597
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,910
Because you're annoying. Also, we\Ndon't need another party member.

598
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,960
I'm our paladin, Will's our cleric,\NDustin's our bard, Lucas is our ranger,

599
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,460
and El is our mage.

600
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,710
- El? Who's El?\N- Someone. No one.

601
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,960
Someone or no one?

602
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,230
She was in our party a long\Ntime ago. She moved away, okay?

603
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,680
She was a mage?

604
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,390
Well, what could she do? Like,\Nmagic tricks or something?

605
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,280
Well, I could be your zoomer.

606
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,610
- That's not even a real thing.\N- It could be.

607
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,940
- See? Zoomer.\N- Mind-blowing.

608
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,740
Come on, you know you're impressed.

609
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,460
I don't see any tricks. You're\Njust going around in a circle.

610
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,530
If it's so easy, you try it.

611
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,160
- No.\N- Why not?

612
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,290
I don't know how.

613
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,510
So, then you admit\Nit's kind of impressive.

614
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,710
I think if I spent, like, all\Nday practicing, I could do that.

615
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,930
I would give you a\Nmillion bucks if you could.

616
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,560
Okay, you're making me dizzy.

617
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,090
- Please just stop.\N- I'll stop when I join your party.

618
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,730
- Come on, just stop.\N- It's a simple question. Am I in or out?

619
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
Jesus! Are you all right?

620
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,630
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

621
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,130
- What happened?\N- I don't know.

622
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,030
It was like a magnet or\Nsomething pulling on my board.

623
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,330
I know that sounds crazy.

624
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,330
Come on, come on, come on!

625
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,580
Hawkins Middle. May I help you?

626
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,330
Yes. Hi, Doris. It's Joyce.

627
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,080
- Uh, Joyce Byers.\N- Joyce.

628
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,780
Uh, Will has AV Club today. Could\Nyou transfer me to Mr. Clarke?

629
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,340
- Mr. Clarke? Huh. You know what?\N- What?

630
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,540
I just saw him leave for the\Nday. Maybe AV was canceled?

631
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,340
- What?\N- Would you like me to...

632
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Guys...

633
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,990
- I found him.\N- Where?

634
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,540
In the bathroom by Mr. Salerno's.

635
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,590
Copy that.

636
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,690
It's okay.

637
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm not gonna hurt you.

638
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:05,790
Hey, buddy.

639
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,490
Come here. You know I won't hurt you.

640
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,690
It's okay. It's just me.

641
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,890
You're okay.

642
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:18,040
- Let's go. Down here.\N- We're coming!

643
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,540
Stay low. Keep quiet.

644
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,140
Where's Dart?

645
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,040
- I don't know. Not here.\N- What?

646
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,440
- He said by Salerno's, right?\N- Yeah, maybe Will has him.

647
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,240
Where is Will?

648
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,440
Only this time, I didn't run.

649
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,490
This time, I stood my ground.

650
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,180
I said, "Go away. Go away!"

651
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,050
Go away!

652
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,260
Go away!

653
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,780
Go away!

654
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,980
Go away! Go away!

655
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,610
Go away!

656
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,180
Easy-peasy, right?

657
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,880
Easy-peasy.

658
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,550
Just like that.
