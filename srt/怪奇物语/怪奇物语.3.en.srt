1
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,050
Hello?

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,230
Nancy?

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,310
Nancy!

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,150
Hello?

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,790
Oh, my God...

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,840
Nancy!

7
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,050
Hey, what's the matter?

8
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,140
Nothing.

9
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,290
You're so beautiful.

10
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,050
Nancy!

11
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,430
Steve?

12
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,440
- Hey, Steve.\N- Mmm.

13
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,190
I'll...

14
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,240
see you tomorrow, okay?

15
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,370
Mmm-hmm.

16
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,570
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.

17
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,820
Oh, I scared you?

18
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,110
I know, I should have called.

19
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,780
Where have you been?

20
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,320
We agreed on 10:00.

21
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,370
After the assembly, some people\Nwanted to get something to eat.

22
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,810
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

23
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,710
You didn't think to\Ncall and let me know?

24
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,460
With everything that's been going on?

25
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,290
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

26
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,130
I'm sorry, Mom. What more do you want?

27
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,510
Hey, wait...

28
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,760
Whose sweatshirt is that?

29
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,510
Steve's.

30
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,300
Steve's.

31
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,710
So is Steve your boyfriend now?

32
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,010
What?

33
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
No!

34
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,230
It was just cold, so I\Nborrowed his sweatshirt.

35
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,560
It's not a big deal.

36
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,110
Nancy?

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,780
What?

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,240
You can talk to me.

39
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,210
You can talk to me. Whatever happened.

40
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,000
Nothing happened.

41
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,000
Nancy.

42
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Nothing happened.

43
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,390
Can I please go?

44
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,250
Will? Will?

45
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,000
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

46
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Will...

47
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,420
Please...

48
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,130
Will...

49
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,220
It's me.

50
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,800
It's me. Just talk to me. Talk to me.

51
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,890
Just say...

52
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,140
- Mom?\N- Jonathan!

53
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,100
- Come here. Come here.\N- Mom, what is this?

54
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,730
Come here. Come here.

55
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,150
- What's going on?\N- It's Will. It's Will, he's...

56
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,070
he's trying to talk to me.

57
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,240
- He's trying to talk to you?\N- Yes, through... through the lights.

58
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,450
- Mom...\N- I know.

59
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,910
I know.

60
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,120
Just... just watch.

61
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,790
Will... your brother's here.

62
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,670
Can you show him what\Nyou showed me, baby?

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,550
Please... Did you see that?

64
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,590
It's the electricity, Mom.

65
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,070
- It's acting up.\N- No.

66
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,800
It's the same thing\Nthat fried the phone.

67
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,220
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

68
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,520
Something is going on here!

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,230
- Yesterday, the wall...\N- What? What about the wall?

70
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,030
- I don't know. I don't know.\N- Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

71
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,940
I just know that Will is here.

72
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,520
No, Mom.

73
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,280
- Maybe if I get more lamps...\N- No, Mom.

74
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,780
You don't need more lamps.\NYou need to stop this, okay?

75
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,030
He is just lost.

76
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,200
People are looking for him,\Nand they're going to find him.

77
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,870
Okay.

78
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,170
- This isn't helping.\N- Okay, okay.

79
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,540
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

80
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,880
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

81
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
Can you just try and get some sleep?

82
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,470
- Yeah.\N- Huh? Can you do that for me?

83
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,800
- I promise. I will.\N- Yeah?

84
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,850
- Yeah.\N- I just need to sit here for a minute.

85
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,810
All right, I'll go make breakfast.

86
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,390
- Okay.\N- Yeah?

87
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,990
Will?

88
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,080
We just tell our parents we\Nhave AV Club after school.

89
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,750
That'll give us at least a few\Nhours for Operation Mirkwood.

90
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,370
You seriously think that the\Nweirdo knows where Will is?

91
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,170
- Just trust me on this, okay?\N- Okay.

92
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,750
- Did you get the supplies?\N- Yeah.

93
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,460
Binoculars... from 'Nam.

94
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,720
Army knife... also from 'Nam.

95
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,260
Hammer, camouflage bandana...

96
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,510
and the wrist rocket.

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,720
You're gonna take out the\NDemogorgon with a slingshot?

98
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,140
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

99
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,560
And second of all, the\NDemogorgon's not real.

100
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,650
It's made up.

101
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,980
But if there is something out there,\NI'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

102
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,740
- and blind it.\N- Dustin, what did you get?

103
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,820
Well, alrighty.

104
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,160
So, we've got...

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,620
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

106
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,250
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

107
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,500
- banana, and trail mix.\N- Seriously?

108
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,090
We need energy for our\Ntravels. For stamina.

109
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,300
And besides, why do we\Neven need weapons anyway?

110
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,010
- We have her.\N- She shut one door!

111
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,260
With her mind!

112
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,010
Are you kidding me? That's insane!

113
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,970
Imagine all the other\Ncool stuff she could do.

114
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,140
Like...

115
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,690
I bet... that she could make this fly!

116
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,400
Hey. Hey.

117
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,070
Okay, concentrate. Okay?

118
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,450
Okay, one more time.

119
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,780
Okay.

120
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,580
Use your powers, okay?

121
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,660
Idiot.

122
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,420
- She's not a dog!\N- Boys!

123
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,250
Time for school!

124
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,460
Just stay down here.

125
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,800
Don't make any noise, and don't leave.

126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,340
If you get hungry, eat\NDustin's snacks, okay?

127
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,300
- Michael!\N- Coming!

128
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,760
You know those power lines?

129
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,640
- Power lines?\N- Yeah.

130
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,760
The ones behind my house?

131
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,060
Yes.

132
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,680
Meet us there, after school.

133
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,440
After school?

134
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,850
Yeah, 3:15.

135
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,070
Ah.

136
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,740
When the numbers read\Nthree-one-five, meet us there.

137
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,040
"Three-one-five."

138
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,080
Three-one-five.

139
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,650
Hey!

140
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,820
Hey!

141
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,400
- Is everything okay?\N- Yeah!

142
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,940
Yeah, totally.

143
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,030
I just...

144
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,450
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.

145
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,040
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.

146
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,370
I know.

147
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,290
I know. Of course not.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,920
But what about, like,\NTommy, and Carol and them?

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,090
You're being paranoid.

150
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,550
- I'm sorry.\N- No. No, it's cute.

151
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Hey...

152
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,510
I had a good time.

153
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,560
Yeah.

154
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,350
Yeah. Me, too.

155
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,320
Mmm. Hmm.

156
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,800
Hey, Ally. Where's Barb?

157
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,720
Um, shouldn't you know?

158
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,970
You haven't seen her anywhere... at all?

159
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,230
There she is. Emerald City.

160
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,440
I heard they make\Nspace weapons in there.

161
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Space weapons?

162
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,730
Yeah. You know, like,\NReagan's Star Wars.

163
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,490
I guess we're gonna blow\Nthe Ruskies to smithereens.

164
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,940
Hey, can I help you?

165
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,870
Uh, yeah. We're here for a tour.

166
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,740
Oh, we don't give tours.

167
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,870
Okay... A quick look around.

168
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,580
You have to get clearance for\Nthat. You can contact, uh...

169
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,250
Rick Schaeffer at the\NDepartment of Energy.

170
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,650
Maybe you seen it on TV. We\Ngot a local kid that's missing.

171
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,860
We have reason to believe\Nhe might have snuck in here.

172
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Like I said, you have to\Nspeak to Mr. Schaeffer.

173
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,180
- What's your name?\N- Patrick.

174
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,850
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and\NI got reporters breathing down my neck

175
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,520
and I got a very upset mother.

176
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,110
Now, I know the kid's not in there,\Nbut I gotta check off this box.

177
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,400
Patrick, would you do me a favor?

178
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,030
Would you speak to your boss and\Nsee what you can swing for us?

179
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,620
I'd really appreciate it.

180
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.

181
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,730
... was occupying a\Nlarge part of Lebanon.

182
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,990
Today, Syria has become a home for...

183
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,200
I have the power!

184
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,960
... gift that will last forever.

185
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,160

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,610
- Joyce...\N- Just ring me up, Donald.

192
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,740
And you think this missing boy\Nmay have crawled through there?

193
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,450
Well, that was the idea.

194
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,950
Yeah, I just don't see\Nhow that'd be possible.

195
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,740
We've got over 100 cameras.

196
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,460
Every square inch\Ncovered, plus all my guys.

197
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,620
No one breaks in here.

198
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,330
Certainly not some kid.

199
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,840
Those cameras, you keep the tapes?

200
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,150
If you don't mind me asking,\Nwhat do you guys do in here?

201
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,990
You're asking the wrong guy.

202
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,770
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians?\N- I expect. Something like that.

203
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,270
- Who's in charge here?\N- That'd be Dr. Brenner.

204
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,230
And he builds the space lasers?

205
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,150
- Space lasers?\N- Ignore him.

206
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,240
This is the night of the 6th\Nand 7th we're seeing here?

207
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,650
That's correct.

208
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,790
Is that it?

209
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,800
Like I said, we would have seen him.

210
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,260
The night of the 7th, we had\Na search party out for Will.

211
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,050
You remember anything about that night?

212
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,390
Mmm, not much to\Nremember. Called it off.

213
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,060
- 'Cause of the storm.\N- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.

214
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,810
You see any rain on that tape?

215
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,440
What are you thinking?

216
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,070
I don't know.

217
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,280
But they're lying.

218
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,570
That's why science doesn't\Nmake any damn sense to me.

219
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,320
No, I swear. Look at this.\NIt's totally frostbite.

220
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,610
Oh, thanks, man. It's a heated pool.

221
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,530
Well, if it's not\Nfrostbite, then what is it?

222
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,450
Ugh, I don't care what\Nit is, it's disgusting!

223
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,240
Get it off the table. We're eating here.

224
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,620
Ew!

225
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,330
Hey, Tommy.

226
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,290
When you left, did you see Barb?

227
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,790
- What?\N- Barbara.

228
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,340
She's not here today.

229
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,550
I seriously have no idea\Nwho you're talking about.

230
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,800
Come on, don't be an\Nass, man. Did you...

231
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,720
Did you see her leave last night or not?

232
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,430
No, she was gone when we left.

233
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,980
Probably couldn't stand\Nlistening to all that moaning.

234
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,900
Oh, Steve!

235
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,400
- Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve!\N- Oh, Steve...

236
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,570
Oh, Steve!

237
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,330
Okay, chill.

238
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,240
Listen... I'm sure she's\Nfine. She's probably just...

239
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,830
she's probably just, like,\Nskipping or something.

240
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,330
Yeah.

241
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, probably.

242
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,310
- How about this one?\N- Too big for the sling.

243
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,650
So, do you think Eleven was born\Nwith her powers, like the X-Men,

244
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,030
or do you think she acquired\Nthem, like... like Green Lantern?

245
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,240
She's not a superhero. She's a weirdo.

246
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,740
Why does that matter?\NThe X-Men are weirdos.

247
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,280
If you love her so much,\Nwhy don't you marry her?

248
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,700
What are you talking about?

249
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,290
- Mike, seriously?\N- What?

250
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,410
You look at her all, like...

251
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,960
"Hi, El! El! El! El!

252
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,420
I love you so much!

253
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,580
- Would you marry me?"\N- Shut up, Lucas.

254
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,110
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.

255
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,760
What are you losers doing back here?

256
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,520
Probably looking for\Ntheir missing friend.

257
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,390
That's not funny. It's\Nserious. He's in danger.

258
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,640
I hate to break it to you,\NToothless, but he's not in danger.

259
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,100
He's dead. That's what my dad says.

260
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,480
He said he was probably\Nkilled by some other queer.

261
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,650
Come on. Just ignore them.

262
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,530
Watch where you're going, Frogface.

263
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,870
- You all right?\N- Yeah.

264
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,170
Hey.

265
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,750
How about this one?

266
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,340
- Yeah.\N- Yeah?

267
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,840
Yeah, this is it.

268
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,840
Oh, yeah.

269
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,300
Yeah, this is the monster killer!

270
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,430
Whoo!

271
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
Hey.

272
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,370
Oh, hey.

273
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,500
- Hey!\N- Hey, Karen.

274
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,590
Hi...

275
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,210
I brought you a casserole.

276
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,430
Oh! Thank you, uh...

277
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,050
Uh, you wanna... come in?

278
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,410
Hey, Marissa. How you doin'?

279
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,870
You have a lot of nerve showing up here.

280
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,290
What?

281
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,370
You could have at least called, said,

282
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,920
"Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out.\NSorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."

283
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,500
Yep.

284
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,550
I'm sorry. Uh...

285
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,010
Maybe we could go out again next week?

286
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,640
Newspapers? You guys got\Nnewspapers around here?

287
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,150
We have the New York Times,\Nthe Post, all the big ones.

288
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,770
Organized by year and topic.

289
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,570
You can find the corresponding\Nmicrofiche in the reading room.

290
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,450
Okay, we're looking for anything\Non the Hawkins National Laboratory.

291
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,570
Well, shouldn't you be\Nlooking for that missing kid?

292
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,760
Yeah. We are.

293
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,580
Uh, so, why don't you\Nstart with the Times,

294
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,080
and we'll check out the Post.

295
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,630
The librarian?

296
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,140
Will always loved Christmas, you know.

297
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,520
So I thought if I...\NI put the lights up...

298
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,190
I don't know, he...

299
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,940
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

300
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,520
It's silly, I know.

301
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,650
No. No, it's not silly.

302
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,740
How is Jonathan holding up?

303
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,780
You know, he's good at\Ntaking care of himself.

304
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,820
He always has been, you know?

305
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,160
I...

306
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,410
I mean, he thinks I'm\Nlosing my mind, but...

307
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,040
Is something the matter?

308
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,460
Uh, no.

309
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,790
No, I just...

310
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,090
We're having electrical problems.

311
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,300
Joyce.

312
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,800
I want you to know something.

313
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,010
If you need anything, anything at all...

314
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,640
Ted and I are here for you.

315
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,760
Thank you. Thanks.

316
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,140
Okay.

317
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,980
How... how's Mike dealing with this?

318
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,850
Is he, uh, okay?

319
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,900
Mike? Uh... I don't know.

320
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,530
He skipped school yesterday.

321
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,570
He's never done anything\Nlike that before.

322
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,190
Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

323
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,370
Oh, where's Holly?

324
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,670
Hey!

325
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,420
She shouldn't be here.

326
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:53,010
Oh, I'm sorry. She's quite\Nthe explorer these days.

327
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,350
- Wait, did you see something?\N- Yeah.

328
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,100
What did... what did you see? Tell me.

329
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,060
- What did you see? What...\N- Joyce... Joyce!

330
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,020
Listen... Karen, thank\Nyou for the casserole,

331
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,360
but I need you to leave.

332
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,150
Okay?

333
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,740
Come on, come on, come on...

334
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,780
- Hello?\N- Hi.

335
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,740
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

336
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,200
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

337
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,330
Good. I'm good.

338
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,620
Um, I was just wondering,\Nuh, is Barb there?

339
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,670
Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.

340
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,130
But she did come home,\Nright? After the vigil?

341
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,470
No, she said she was\Nstaying with you last night.

342
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,340
Right, yes. She did, sorry.

343
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,600
I meant, did she come home this morning?

344
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,850
I think she left some textbooks\Nand she was gonna go pick them up.

345
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,140
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

346
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,150
Do... Do you know what? I just\Nremembered... she's at the library.

347
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,860
Nancy, will you please have her\Ncall me as soon as you find her?

348
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,910
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

349
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,320
Sorry to bother you.

350
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,380
Hey, man.

351
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,510
What's going on?

352
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,590
Nicole here was, uh,\Ntelling us about your work.

353
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,040
- We've heard great things.\N- Yeah, sounds cool.

354
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,770
And we'd just love to take a look.\NYou know, as... connoisseurs of art.

355
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

356
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,330
- Oh, no? Oh...\N- Hey.

357
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,400
Please, give me my bag. No, just...

358
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,160
Man, he is totally trembling. He\Nmust really have something to hide.

359
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,280
Here we go.

360
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,070
Ah...

361
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,150
Here we go.

362
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,950
- Oh, man.\N- Let me see.

363
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Dude.

364
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,140
Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

365
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,980
- I was looking for my brother.\N- No.

366
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,410
No, this is called stalking. Mmm-hmm.

367
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,670
- What's going on?\N- Here's the starring lady.

368
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,880
What?

369
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,010
This creep was spying on us last night.

370
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,340
He was probably gonna\Nsave this one for later.

371
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,890
See, you can tell that he\Nknows it was wrong, but...

372
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,020
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

373
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,060
It's hardwired into 'em.

374
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,030
You know, they just\Ncan't help themselves.

375
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,990
So...

376
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,780
we'll just have to take away his toy.

377
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,990
- Steve...\N- No, please, not the camera.

378
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,790
No, no, wait, wait... Tommy, Tommy.

379
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,790
It's okay.

380
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,880
Here you go, man.

381
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,760
Come on, let's go. The\Ngame's about to start.

382
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,470
Boo.

383
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,850
Bye.

384
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,400
Hey, Nance!

385
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,740
Come on.

386
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,600
Three-one-five.

387
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,270
Three-one-five.

388
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,560
Three-one-five.

389
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,260
No! No!

390
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,630
Papa! Papa!

391
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,010
Papa!

392
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,180
Papa!

393
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,560
Papa!

394
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,230
No!

395
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,740
Incredible.

396
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,960
El!

397
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,460
You okay?

398
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,840
Hop on. We only have a few hours.

399
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,320
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

400
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,480
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

401
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,940
blow me."

402
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,510
Bull, if you did that, you'd\Nbe in detention right now.

403
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,910
Saturday.

404
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,780
I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

405
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,030
Oh, he's so a virgin!

406
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,000
Maybe you should blow him,\NCarol. Help your grades a bit.

407
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,080
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

408
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,670
I totally forgot.

409
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,340
I told my mom I would, um...

410
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,880
I would do something with her.

411
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,920
Well, what do you mean?\NThe game's about to start.

412
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,410
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,390
What the hell's wrong with her?

414
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,430
Maybe she freaked out when you\Nwent all psycho on the psycho.

415
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Oh, give me a break.

416
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,890
What'd you expect, dating Miss Perfect?

417
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,900
Why did they hurt you?

418
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,110
What?

419
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,700
Oh, that.

420
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,780
Uh...

421
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,540
I just fell at recess.

422
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,660
- Mike...\N- Yeah?

423
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,210
Friends tell the truth.

424
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,250
I was tripped by this\Nmouth breather, Troy, okay?

425
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,800
Mouth breather?

426
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,800
Yeah, you know...

427
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,010
a dumb person.

428
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,260
A knucklehead.

429
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,430
Knucklehead?

430
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,140
I don't know why I just didn't\Ntell you. Everyone at school knows.

431
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,060
I just didn't want you to think\NI was such a wastoid, you know?

432
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,270
- Mike...\N- Yeah?

433
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,860
I understand.

434
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,190
Oh.

435
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,030
Okay, cool.

436
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,320
Cool.

437
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,720
Barb?

438
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,220
Barb!

439
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,950
Barb?

440
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,960
Barb?

441
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,730
Barb?

442
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,730
Oh!

443
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,810
Will... are you here?

444
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,270
Okay, good, good, good, good.

445
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,230
Are you...

446
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,360
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

447
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,910
Can you do that for me, sweetie?

448
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,030
Can you do...

449
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,830
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

450
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,040
Baby, I need to know...

451
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,670
Are you alive?

452
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,930
Are you safe?

453
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,360
I need to know where to find you,\Nhoney. Where... where are you?

454
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,910
Can you... can you\Ntell me where you are?

455
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,320
Can you...

456
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,990
Please, baby. I need to\Nfind you. Tell me what to do.

457
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,960
Please just...

458
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,380
Will...

459
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,530
Hey! You're home\Nearly! How was the game?

460
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,950
Nancy? What's the matter?

461
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,120
It's Barb.

462
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,420
I think...

463
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,710
something happened.

464
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,710
Something terrible.

465
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,130
I don't know, Chief.

466
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,470
What don't you know?

467
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,720
This lady, Terry Ives,\Nsounds like a real nut to me.

468
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,850
Her kid was taken for LSD\Nmind control experiments?

469
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,020
She's been discredited.

470
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,460
Claim was thrown out...

471
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,610
Okay, forget about her.

472
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,730
Take a look at this.

473
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,030
- Dr. Martin Brenner.\N- Who?

474
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,740
Brenner.

475
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,740
He runs Hawkins Lab.

476
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,860
Okay.

477
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,450
You don't find that interesting?

478
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,950
Not really.

479
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,910
He was involved in some hippie\Ncrap back in the day, so what?

480
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,170
No, this isn't hippie crap.\NThis is CIA-sanctioned research.

481
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,380
Doesn't mean he had\Nanything to do with our kid.

482
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,460
Come on. Look at that.\NHospital gowns. All of 'em.

483
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,950
Now, that piece of fabric that\Nthe teacher found by the pipe.

484
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,950
That sure looked like a\Nhospital gown to me, huh?

485
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,260
- Am I wrong?\N- I don't know, Chief.

486
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,680
Come on, man.

487
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,060
Work with me here.

488
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,730
I'm not saying that there's\Nsome grand conspiracy.

489
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,060
I'm just...

490
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,190
I'm saying maybe something happened.

491
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,120
Maybe Will was in the wrong\Nplace at the wrong time

492
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,120
and he saw something\Nthat he shouldn't have.

493
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,870
- It's a reach.\N- It's a start.

494
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,500
Hey, Powell, is the chief with you?

495
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,790
Hopper here. What do you got?

496
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,420
Here.

497
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,050
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

498
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,670
Hiding.

499
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,390
No, no, this is where he lives.

500
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,470
He's missing from here. Understand?

501
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,040
- What are we doing here?\N- She said he's hiding here.

502
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,810
Um... no!

503
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,560
I swear, if we walked all the\Nway out here for nothing...

504
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,150
That's exactly what we did.

505
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,280
I told you she didn't know what\Nthe hell she was talking about!

506
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,070
Why did you bring us here?

507
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,370
- Mike, don't waste your time with her.\N- What do you want to do then?

508
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,040
Call the cops, like we\Nshould have done yesterday.

509
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,160
- We are not calling the cops!\N- Hey, guys?

510
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,000
- What other choice do we have?\N- Guys!

511
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,920
Will...

512
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,240
Okay.

513
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,650
Okay, baby, talk to me.

514
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,450
Talk to me. Where are you?

515
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,120
"R." Good, good, good, good.

516
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,580
That's good. Come on, come on.

517
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,410
"I...

518
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,620
G...

519
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,380
H... T...

520
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,340
H...

521
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,420
E...

522
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,550
R... E... "

523
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,220
"Right here."

524
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,340
"Right here"?

525
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,100
I don't know what that means.

526
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,470
I need you to tell me what to do.

527
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,560
What should I do?

528
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,890
How do I get to you? How do\NI find you? What should I do?

529
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,380
Oh, Jesus.

530
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,640
Oh, God. Please tell\Nme it's not the kid.

531
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,590
It's not Will. It can't be.

532
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,720
It's Will. It's really Will.

533
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,650
Mike...

534
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,900
"Mike"? "Mike," what?

535
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,110
You were supposed to\Nhelp us find him alive.

536
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,610
You said he was alive!

537
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,110
Why did you lie to us?

538
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,410
