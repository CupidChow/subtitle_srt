Let's give another big hand\Nfor the Hawkins High Marching Band!

11
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,070
I hope you're all having\Na good time tonight.

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,240
Are you having a good time?

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,500
I can't hear you!

14
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,120
Are you having a good time?

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,250
I want you to know\Nthat we spared no expense

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,340
to provide you with the very best\Nentertainment that money can buy!

17
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,880
Keep your arms inside.

18
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,220
Uh-oh! Dad can't get out now.

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,970
Why do you two enjoy torturing me?

20
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,390
- Because it's fun.\N- Yeah, Dad, 'cause it's fun!

21
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,190
Oh, here we go.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,600
Oh, boy.

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,150
Hoo!

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,940
But enough of me blabbering.

25
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,490
Who here wants to see some fireworks?

26
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,280
Come on, now, you can do better than that.

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,530
Who here wants to see some fireworks?

28
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,210
Uh, why are we stopping?

29
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,710
Because I slipped Jimmy a five.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
You what?

31
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,010
Come on,\Nthese are the best seats in the house.

32
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,550
The best seats in the house.

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
Oh!

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,310
Happy Fourth of July!

35
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,660
Whoa!

36
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,620
- That was pretty, wasn't it?\N- Yeah.

37
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Yeah.

38
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,950
Mom, the trees.

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,470
- What, baby?\N- The trees are moving.

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,470
Why are you looking at the trees, baby?

41
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,890
The fireworks. Look at the fireworks!

42
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,190
That was a big one,\Nwasn't it?

43
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,670
He said he was\Nbuilding something.

44
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,470
That it was all for me.

45
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,390
Building something...

46
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,690
- Is he talking about the flayed?\N- He must be.

47
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,990
So, he's building an army,\Njust like we thought.

48
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,240
Yeah, but he's not building this army\Nto spread.

49
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,640
He's building it to stop Eleven.

50
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,020
Last year, El closed the gate on him.

51
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,840
I have a feeling\Nthat really pissed him off.

52
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,890
Like, royally.

53
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,120
And the Mind Flayer now knows that\Nshe's the only thing that can stop him.

54
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,040
- But if she's out of the way...\N- Game over.

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,620
He also said

56
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,440
he was gonna kill all of you.

57
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,290
Yeah, well, that's nice.

58
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Do you guys hear that?

59
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,090
It's just the fireworks.

60
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Billy...

61
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,640
When he told you this,\Nit was here, in this room?

62
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,370
He knows we're here.

63
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,690
Jesus, slow down!

64
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,140
Yeah, what is this,\Nlike, the Indy 500?

65
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,490
It's the Indy 300.

66
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,390
- No, dingus, it's 500!\N- It's 300!

67
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,820
Let's say a million.

68
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,540
- What is wrong with them?\N- I don't know.

69
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,790
- Dustin, watch out!\N- Shit!

70
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,840
Oh!

71
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
You guys all right back there?

72
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,390
They're fine.

73
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,170
Come on. We gotta go, now.

74
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,020
- Come on! Get out!\N- Let's go!

75
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,390
Ow!

76
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,190
- We're coming!\N- Here goes nothin'.

77
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,770
This sucks.

78
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,990
- Hey! You look like you're surfing!\N- Surfing! Yeah!

79
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,070
Whoa!

80
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,790
- They seem drunk.\N- Why would they be drunk?

81
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,570
I'm a natural! Check it out!

82
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Whoop!

83
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,820
Wipeout!

84
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,420
- He's burning up.\N- You're burning up.

85
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,790
- One sec, one sec. Steve, Steve.\N- God, no.

86
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,490
Ow!

87
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,490
His pupils are super dilated.

88
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,840
Maybe he's drugged.

89
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,090
Ugh. Boop!

90
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,920
Steve, are you drugged?

91
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,290
How many times, Dad?

92
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,720
I don't do drugs. It's only marijuana.

93
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,170
This isn't funny, okay?\NI need to know what they did to you.

94
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,020
- Are you gonna die on us?\N- Boop.

95
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,590
We all die,\Nmy strange little child friend.

96
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,740
It's just a matter of how...

97
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
and when.

98
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,420
They're gonna be looking for us up there,

99
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,240
so I need you to tell me\Nwhere you parked your car.

100
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,740
Oh, can we make a pit stop\Nat the food court?

101
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,570
- I would kill for a hot dog on a stick.\N- Ooh!

102
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,670
All right. Yeah, food.

103
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,920
Yes, you can have\Nas much food as you want,

104
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,990
but only if you tell me\Nwhere your car is parked.

105
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,420
- Uh-oh.\N- Uh-oh?

106
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,620
The car's off the board.

107
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,220
- What?\N- They took the keys.

108
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,970
The Russians, they took the keys.

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
Like, forever ago.

110
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,720
That's a bummer, right?

111
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,690
Oh!

112
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,520
Oh, my God, that tastes so good. Ah!

113
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,090
Steve, can you taste the air?

114
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,940
I taste it! I taste it!

115
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,190
- Stop!\N- Shit! Come on! Come on!

116
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,040
Stop right there!

117
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,740
- Okay, okay, okay! Woo!\N- Why are we running?

118
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,740
Yeah. That's good like that.

119
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,140
Hey, get away from the windows.

120
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,940
It's close.

121
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,040
Where'd it go?

122
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,060
Holy shit.

123
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,490
El!

124
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,730
El!

125
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,280
Pull!

126
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,030
Nancy, shoot it!

127
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,190
Come on! Lucas!

128
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,380
Pull!

129
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,930
El! El, you okay?

130
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,090
- Go, go, go!\N- Come on, come on, go!

131
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,890
- Go!\N- Hurry up! Come on!

132
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,930
Everybody out!

133
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,880
- Go!\N- Go, come on!

134
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,180
Go, go, go, go!

135
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,480
- Come on!\N- Come on!

136
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,030
Come on! Come on!

137
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,840
Get in. Right here.

138
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,780
Drive! Drive!

139
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,090
- Whoa!\N- Where are we going?

140
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,630
Just trust me.

141
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,930
All clear.

142
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Doc!

143
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,480
What did I tell you?!

144
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,230
Eighty-eight miles per hour!

145
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,530
Come on.

146
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,310
The temporal displacement occurred\Nexactly 1:20...

147
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,830
- You two, sit.\N- No, no, no! These seats are too close!

148
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,440
- Dude, these seats blow.\N- Then don't watch the movie.

149
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,080
- We wanna watch it.\N- Then watch it!

150
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,390
- Shh!\N- Shh!

151
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,330
Sorry.

152
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,690
Whatever you do,

153
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,990
don't... go... anywhere.

154
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,240
Fine, Dad.

155
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,290
The appropriate question is\N"When the hell are they?"

156
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,490
You see, Einstein has just become

157
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,490
- the world's first time traveler!\N- Sorry. Sorry.

158
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,260
I sent him... into the future!

159
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,340
Okay, it's official.

160
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,730
I'm never having kids.

161
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,790
- What are we doing here?\N- We're laying low.

162
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,890
Cooling off.

163
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,790
Like Oswald.

164
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,060
Oswald was found in a theater\Nand shot to death.

165
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,140
A week later.

166
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,030
The point is, his plan didn't work.

167
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,440
Only because it was a setup.

168
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,940
- What?\N- He was just a patsy.

169
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,780
- Tell me you're joking.\N- Shh!

170
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,730
Shh!

171
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,230
We need to get outta here.

172
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,990
All right, you watch\NTweedledee and Tweedledum.

173
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,660
- Make sure they don't go anywhere.\N- Where are you going?

174
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,190
To find us a ride.

175
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,380
Look out!

176
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,880
Doc...

177
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,130
- What's happening?\N- I have no idea.

178
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,530
Are you telling me that\Nyou built a time machine...

179
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,930
- What's he saying?\N- He's showing me the location of the key

180
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,430
to turn off the machine.

181
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,240
Sorry, "keys." Two keys.

182
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,190
Two-man rule.

183
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,980
- Two-man rule?\N- Yeah, two men, two keys, like a...

184
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,580
nuclear launch.

185
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,860
But, uh, to retrieve the keys,\Nthere is a vault.

186
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,690
And to open the vault,

187
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,030
you need to enter Planck's constant.

188
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,990
- Planck's what?\N- Planck's constant.

189
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,740
- It's a very famous number.\N- All right, so we get the keys,

190
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,660
and then we turn the machine off.

191
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,940
That's what he says.

192
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,790
All right, well, that shouldn't be\Ntoo hard. We can do this.

193
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,060
Joyce, did you hear the part\Nwhere he said the place was like

194
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,180
an impenetrable fortress?

195
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,090
Yeah, but there has to be a way in.

196
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,510
Yeah, there is. Our military.

197
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,630
- Who are coming.\N- Well, we don't know that anymore

198
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,310
because you yelled at them\Nlike it was a parent-teacher conference,

199
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,230
and then you hung up on them,\Nso we don't know what the hell's going on,

200
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,140
because now we're...\NWait, wait, what are we do... Oh!

201
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,590
Wait, that's right!

202
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,190
We're on our way to rescue our children

203
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,280
from the big, bad\NFourth of July celebration!

204
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,860
You know what, if you can't handle this,\Nthen just turn around

205
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,110
and drop me off first.

206
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,610
What are you gonna do?

207
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,830
You gonna walk back to Hawkins?

208
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,410
I will do anything\Nif it gets me away from you!

209
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,660
Children! Children! Children!

210
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,330
This interminable bickering\Nwas amusing at first,

211
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,880
but it's getting very stale and we've\Nstill got a long drive ahead of us.

212
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,730
So, why don't you two cut the horseshit

213
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,540
and get to the part where you admit\Nyour sexual feelings for one another?

214
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,090
- Whoa!\N- You are way off base, buddy!

215
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,640
Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me!

216
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,090
Yes, yes, he's a brute. I know.

217
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,140
Probably reminds you\Nof a bad relationship,

218
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,730
and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man\Nto settle down with,

219
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,940
but, admit it, you're real curious to know\Nwhat he's like in the sack.

220
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,130
And you. Ha!

221
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,380
Well, you're just a big manbaby

222
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,880
who'd rather act tough\Nthan show his true feelings,

223
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,040
because the last time\Nyou opened your heart, you got hurt.

224
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,960
Owie.

225
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,290
And now, rather than admit these feelings,\Nyou're dancing around one another

226
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,480
with this mind-numbing\Nand frankly boorish mating ritual.

227
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,390
So, please, for my sake,

228
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,760
either quit your bickering, or pull over,

229
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,560
tear off those clothes,

230
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,680
and get it over with already!

231
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,440
What was that?

232
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,190
I told them they should have sex.

233
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,160
They have not had sex?

234
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
No.

235
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,680
Oh! Oh!

236
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,910
Okay, get her down.

237
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,510
Okay.

238
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,840
Lemme see.

239
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,060
Oh, shit.

240
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,060
What... What... Hey, what are you doing?

241
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
I'm cleaning the wound.

242
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,260
No, first, we need to stop the bleeding,

243
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,760
then clean, then disinfect, then bandage.

244
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,240
I skateboard. Trust me.

245
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,310
Mike, hold this.

246
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,790
Keep the pressure on it,\Nnice and firm, okay?

247
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,290
We're gonna need water, soap.

248
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
- Yeah, okay.\N- All right.

249
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,160
Does any of this help?

250
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,340
No.

251
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,840
Go get me a washcloth and a bowl.

252
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,910
- A bowl?\N- Lucas.

253
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,960
- Go.\N- Okay.

254
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,660
What did that thing\Nlook like to you?

255
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,710
Like that thing in the hospital,\Nonly bigger.

256
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,960
Yeah, a lot bigger.

257
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,390
Like, Tom and Bruce,\Nthey merged to become one, right?

258
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,040
And... And Driscoll kept saying\Nhow she needed to go back to the source...

259
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
Wait, you think Driscoll's in there?

260
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,560
Maybe.

261
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,110
And... And... And maybe Heather and Janet,\Ntoo, and God knows who else.

262
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,710
I don't know how we're gonna\Nkill this thing, but if we do...

263
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,590
- We kill all the flayed.\N- And... we end this.

264
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,090
Maybe.

265
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,510
All I know is...

266
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,460
we need El.

267
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Bowl...

268
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,790
Bowl...

269
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,210
Bowl...

270
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,560
- Why wouldn't it be with the cereal?\N- I don't know.

271
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,310
What else do you use a bowl for?

272
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,590
I... I don't know.

273
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,010
Oh, shit.

274
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,440
Satan's Baby.

275
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,060
You ever shot one of these suckers?

276
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,790
No. Is it sweet?

277
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,840
- That's an understatement.\N- That doesn't look like a bowl.

278
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,860
Nah, it's way better.

279
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,860
There is a reason this warning label\Nsays "18 or older."

280
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,760
This sucker is filled with 150 grains\Nof black powder.

281
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,660
AKA gunpowder.

282
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Strap two of these together,\Nand it's bigger than an M-80.

283
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Five of them,

284
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,210
we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite.

285
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,710
You wanna kill that thing with fireworks?

286
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,190
Do you have a better idea?

287
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,760
Uh, yeah. Eleven.

288
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,890
Against that thing?\NShe's gonna need some backup.

289
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,660
Oh, my God.

290
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
Hold this.

291
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,360
Does that hurt?

292
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,310
Uh, not bad.

293
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,540
You're gonna have an awesome scar.

294
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,710
You'll look even more badass.

295
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,660
Bitchin'.

296
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,010
Yeah, bitchin'.

297
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,790
El...

298
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,590
Yeah?

299
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,490
I've been meaning to tell you something.

300
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,560
It's just, being broken up,

301
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,810
it's been hard.

302
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,210
And...

303
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
I like that you and Max are friends now.

304
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,860
It's just, I was jealous at first,\Nand... and angry.

305
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,010
And that's why I said\Nall that stupid stuff.

306
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,190
And it's like I wanted you all to myself.

307
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,190
And now I realize how unfair that is.

308
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,990
And selfish. And, like... I'm sorry.

309
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,990
I just, like, I've never felt like this,\Nyou know, with anyone before...

310
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,740
and...

311
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,090
You know, they do say\Nit makes you crazy.

312
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,590
What makes you crazy?

313
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,960
You never... You never heard that term...

314
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,060
You know, like the phrase, like...

315
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,210
"blank makes you crazy," like the word...

316
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,610
- "Girlfriends"?\N- No, no, no, no, not... not girlfriends.

317
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,940
- "Boyfriends."\N- No! No, no, not boyfriends either.

318
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,410
- It's like... It's like a feeling or...\N- A feeling...

319
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,660
Yeah, like something... Like, old people\Nsay it to each other sometimes.

320
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,740
- Old people?\N- Yeah.

321
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,560
What I wanna say is...

322
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,160
that I just...

323
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,790
I know that I...

324
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,160
I repeat... this is a code red!

325
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,060
Dustin?

326
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,160
Mike?

327
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,960
- Dustin!\N- Mike!

328
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,540
Oh, my God, you have to listen.\NI know I've been MIA,

329
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,710
and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad.\NI mean, I actually was mad,

330
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,210
but it's also because\NI was trapped underground

331
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,460
in a secret Russian base.

332
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,060
Dustin, you're going way too fast.\NI can't understand you.

333
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,310
I know that sounds insane,\Nbut the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins!

334
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,610
The goddamn Russians!

335
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,860
And now... they're using...\Nto open the gate.

336
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,460
Dustin, you're... you're breaking up.

337
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,860
And now they're after us\Nand we don't have a way out of here,

338
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,860
so I need you to come and get us.\NCan Nancy drive?

339
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,160
Dustin, you're cutting out.

340
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,490
- Mike?\N- Dustin, you there?

341
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,990
Mike? Mike, do you copy?

342
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Dustin...

343
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,360
Shit! Not now. Please, not now. Mike!

344
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,040
- Dustin!\N- Mike!

345
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
What is it?

346
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,060
Do you have any batteries? Double-A?

347
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,410
Why would I have batteries?

348
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,660
I always carry batteries.

349
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,010
Then what's the problem?

350
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,190
I need eight.

351
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,190
Eight?

352
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,190
Shit. Guess we'll have to go to plan B.

353
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,110
Plan B? What's plan B?

354
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Where... are they?

355
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,040
That's amazing.

356
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,980
So, like, I wasn't totally focused\Nin there or anything, but...

357
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,060
I'm pretty sure...

358
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,810
that mom was trying to bang her son.

359
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,450
Wait, wait, the hot chick\Nwas Alex P. Keaton's mom?

360
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,610
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

361
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,250
But they're the same age.

362
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,330
No, but he went back in time.

363
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,550
Then why is it called Back to the Future?

364
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,250
He has to go back to the future

365
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,250
because he's in the past.

366
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,550
So, the future is actually the present,

367
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,910
which is his time.

368
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,680
Wh... What?

369
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,560
No, no, it's my turn. You've had enough.

370
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,030
Wow.

371
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,330
Hey, Robin.

372
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,130
You gotta check this out.

373
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,000
Check this...

374
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,510
This... The ceiling, it's beautiful.

375
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,430
Oh, wow.

376
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Oh.

377
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,930
Stay here,\Ngo over the plans with Smirnoff.

378
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,510
- I can help look.\N- No, you'll scare the children.

379
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,200
- Jim, if this is about earlier...\N- Stay put, Freud!

380
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
You hear me? Stay put!

381
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,710
You know,\Nsay what you will about Kline,

382
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,000
he certainly knows how to throw a party.

383
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,910
I'm sorry about him, by the way.

384
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,500
- Who, Larry?\N- No, Murray.

385
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,360
He's a sick individual\Nwho likes to get under people's skin.

386
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,660
So, let's not let him, you know,\Nget under our skin.

387
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,830
I'm not, I haven't.

388
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,800
I just, you seem\Na little more quiet than usual.

389
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,060
- I just... I just wanna find the kids.\N- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

390
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,450
I'll give it my best shot.

391
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,760
You won yourself a bear!

392
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,460
Thank you. Here you go.

393
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,630
Mayor Kline!

394
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,060
One more, one more.

395
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,700
Big smile. There we go.

396
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,530
- Watch it!\N- Happy Fourth, dick.

397
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,750
Come on, come on, come on!

398
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,250
Pick up, pick up, pick up,\Nyou commie bastards!

399
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,060
- Quiet.\N- Oh, sorry.

400
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,530
- How do you even drink that?\N- Because it's delicious.

401
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,610
What?

402
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,700
It's like Carpenter's The Thing.

403
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,500
The original is a classic,

404
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,060
no question about it.

405
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,860
But the remake...

406
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,260
Sweeter, bolder...

407
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,350
better.

408
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,710
You're insane.

409
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,400
So, you prefer the original Thing?

410
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,710
What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing,\NI'm talking about New Coke.

411
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,230
It's the same concept, dude.

412
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,980
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.

413
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,200
It is the same concept.

414
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,660
- No, it's not.\N- Yes, it is.

415
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,760
Hey.

416
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Sorry.

417
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,810
Sorry.

418
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,150
Did you... find him?

419
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,700
The movies?

420
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,330
Dustin's so freaked out about the gate,\Nhe decides to go watch a movie?

421
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,610
Yeah, makes total sense.

422
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,710
You're positive he said "gate"\Nand not "great"?

423
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,630
Yeah, like,\N"This movie I'm watching is great."

424
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,550
Sounded like "gate."

425
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,750
Which would explain how\Nthe Mind Flayer's still alive.

426
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,280
- Yeah, we just have to shut it again.\N- Then the monster dies.

427
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,680
But if not,\Nwe always have Lucas' fireworks.

428
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,350
Keep mocking my plan, Max.\NKeep mocking it.

429
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,930
I wanna hear you say it again,\Nbecause you keep doubting me.

430
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,010
You keep doubting me!

431
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,680
- Ridiculous.\N- Will?

432
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,600
We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right?

433
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,460
The ceiling stopped spinning for me.

434
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,550
Is it still spinning for you?

435
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,210
Holy shit.

436
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,210
No.

437
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,410
You think we puked it all up?

438
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,850
Maybe. Ask me something.

439
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,660
Interrogate me.

440
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,400
Okay. Interrogate you. Sure.

441
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,560
Um...

442
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,010
When was the last time\Nyou, uh, peed your pants?

443
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,260
Today.

444
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,350
What?

445
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,360
When the Russian doctor\Ntook out the bone saw.

446
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,060
Oh, my God.

447
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,060
It was just a little bit, though.

448
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,310
Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.

449
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,660
Oh...

450
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,530
- All right, my turn.\N- Okay.

451
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,950
Hit me.

452
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,860
Have you...

453
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,330
ever been in love?

454
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,710
Yep. Nancy Wheeler.

455
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,160
First semester, senior year.

456
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,380
Oh, my God.

457
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,850
She's such a priss.

458
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Hm.

459
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,710
Turns out, not really.

460
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,010
Are you still in love with Nancy?

461
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,610
- No.\N- Why not?

462
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,160
I think it's because I found someone\Nwho's a little bit better for me.

463
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,150
It's crazy.

464
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,910
Ever since Dustin got home,\Nhe's been saying,

465
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,800
"You know, you gotta find your Suzie.\NYou gotta find your Suzie."

466
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,200
Wait, who's Suzie?

467
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,050
It's some girl from camp,\NI guess his girlfriend.

468
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,460
To be honest with you,\NI'm not 100% sure she's even real.

469
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,300
But that's not...\Nthat's not really the point.

470
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,380
That doesn't matter. The point is,\Nthis girl, you know, the one that I like,

471
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,650
it's somebody that I...\Ndidn't even talk to in school.

472
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,710
And I don't even know why.

473
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,700
Maybe 'cause Tommy H.\Nwould've made fun of me or...

474
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,060
I wouldn't be...

475
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,260
prom king.

476
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,610
It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right,\Nit's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways.

477
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,000
Because, when I think about it,

478
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,400
I should've been hanging out\Nwith this girl the whole time.

479
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,800
First of all, she's hilarious.\NShe's so funny.

480
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,750
I feel like, this summer,\NI have laughed harder

481
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,080
than I have laughed...

482
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,250
in a really long time.

483
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,660
And she's smart.

484
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,460
Way smarter than me.

485
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,010
You know, she can crack, like,\Ntop secret Russian codes and...

486
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,710
You know? She's honestly unlike anyone\NI've ever even met before.

487
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,150
Robin?

488
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,860
Robin, did you just OD in there?

489
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,110
No.

490
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
I...

491
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,030
am still alive.

492
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,710
The floor's disgusting.

493
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,880
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood\Nand puke on my shirt, so...

494
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,430
What do you think?

495
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,460
About?

496
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,130
This girl.

497
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
She sounds awesome.

498
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,280
She is awesome. And what about the guy?

499
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,530
I think he's on drugs,\Nand he's not thinking straight.

500
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,330
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking\Na lot more clearly than usual.

501
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
He's not.

502
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Look...

503
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,680
he doesn't even know this girl.

504
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,830
And if he did know her,

505
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,680
like... like really know her,

506
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,230
I don't think he'd even want to be\Nher friend.

507
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,730
No, that's not true. No way is that true.

508
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,380
Listen to me, Steve.

509
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,930
It's shocked me to my core,

510
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,930
but I like you.

511
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,230
I really like you.

512
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,780
But I'm not like your other friends.

513
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,230
And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler.

514
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,410
Robin, that's exactly why I like you.

515
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,980
Do you remember what I said\Nabout Click's class?

516
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,530
About me being jealous and, like,\Nobsessed?

517
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,210
Yeah.

518
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,530
It isn't because I had a crush on you.

519
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,760
It's because...

520
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,430
she wouldn't stop staring at you.

521
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,260
Mrs. Click?

522
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,980
Tammy Thompson.

523
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,280
I wanted her to look at me.

524
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,560
But... she couldn't\Npull her eyes away from you

525
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,730
and your stupid hair.

526
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,330
And I didn't understand,\Nbecause you would get

527
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,030
bagel crumbs all over the floor.

528
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,460
And you asked dumb questions.

529
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,760
And you were a douchebag.

530
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,210
And... And you didn't even like her and...

531
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,680
I would go home...

532
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,810
and just scream into my pillow.

533
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,880
But Tammy Thompson's a girl.

534
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Steve.

535
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,230
Yeah?

536
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Oh.

537
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,030
Oh.

538
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,910
Holy shit.

539
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
Yeah.

540
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Holy shit.

541
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,580
Steve...

542
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,760
did you OD over there?

543
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,880
No, I just, uh...

544
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,330
just thinking.

545
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,430
Okay.

546
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,760
I mean, yeah.

547
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,130
Tammy Thompson, you know,\Nshe's cute and all, but...

548
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,630
I mean,

549
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,030
she's a total dud.

550
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,310
She is not.

551
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,110
Yes, she is.\NShe wants to be, like, a singer.

552
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
She wants to move to, like,\NNashville and shit.

553
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,680
- She has dreams.\N- She can't even hold a tune.

554
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,110
She's practically tone-deaf.\NHave you heard her?

555
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,460
All the time.

556
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,830
♪ You see me now tonight ♪

557
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,360
- Shut up.\N- ♪ You see me... ♪

558
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,610
- She does not sound like that.\N- She sounds exactly...

559
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,610
- That's a great impersonation of her.\N- She does not.

560
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,710
You sound like a Muppet.

561
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,280
She sounds like a Muppet.

562
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,430
She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.

563
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,130
♪ And if you could hold me tight ♪

564
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,810
♪ We'll be holding on forever ♪

565
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,680
- Exactly.\N- I know!

566
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,380
Okay.

567
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
What the hell?

568
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,110
And why all this?

569
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,680
If I just turn the keys,\Nit's like turning off a car.

570
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,830
But then the car still works, does it not?

571
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,360
Yes.

572
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,910
And do you want the car to still work\Nor do you want it to explode?

573
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,710
I want the car to explode.

574
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,910
Good. Then do this.

575
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,130
Just make sure you are nowhere near it\Nwhen it does. It is not pretty.

576
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,930
Turns people into dust.

577
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
And then...

578
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,880
It's over.

579
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,930
And I become an American citizen\Nand join in the fun, yes?

580
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,280
Who said you had to be an American\Nto join the fun?

581
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,180
It doesn't get\Nmore American than this, my friend.

582
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,580
Fatty foods, ugly decadence,

583
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,480
rigged games...

584
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,530
Fifteen tickets, please.

585
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,930
- They are rigged, these games?\N- Yes.

586
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,330
They do not look rigged.

587
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,060
That's just it, my dear Alexei.

588
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,760
They have been designed\Nto present the illusion of fairness!

589
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,980
But it's all a scam, a trick,

590
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,680
to put your money\Nin the rich man's pocket.

591
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,310
That, my dear friend, is...

592
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,280
America.

593
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,230
But, hey...

594
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,980
knock yourself out.

595
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,180
Where are you going?

596
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,730
To get us the closest thing to food\NI can find.

597
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,080
Hey. Hey.

598
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,580
Karen.

599
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,830
Step right up!

600
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,070
...feel the wind push you back\Nand it's gonna...

601
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,500
- Hold on. Do we have seat belts?\N- Hey, Karen.

602
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,420
Joyce!

603
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,170
Oh, my gosh! How funny to see you here!

604
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,180
Where are the kids?

605
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,930
I... I haven't seen them.\NI don't think they're here yet.

606
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,850
- You three, up against the wall!\N- No, where are they?

607
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,100
Oh, my gosh,\NI can hardly keep track these days.

608
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,070
Uh, they were at, uh...

609
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,100
Dustin's, then Lucas's,

610
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,650
- then Max's.\N- Max...

611
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,930
You know how it is. Summer!

612
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,150
Probably getting into some kinda trouble.

613
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,820
Last warning, you two.\NUp against the wall!

614
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,580
Hold the ride!

615
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,200
On your life, Magnum.

616
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,220
Woo! Here we go!

617
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,170
Holy smokes!

618
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,220
Holy smokes!

619
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,070
Roads?

620
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,230
Where we're going,\Nwe don't need roads.

621
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,630
And...

622
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,720
blend.

623
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,880
It is so good!

624
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,320
- Well, shit, that worked.\N- Course it worked.

625
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,620
We just have to get on the bus\Nwith the rest of these plebes,

626
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,020
and home sweet home, here we come.

627
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,270
- Uh, Dustin?\N- What?

628
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah, we might not wanna\Ngo to your house.

629
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,930
Why?

630
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,980
Well, I might've told them your full name.

631
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,170
- What is wrong with you?\N- Dude, I was drugged.

632
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,620
- So?\N- So?

633
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,230
So, you resist. You tough it out.\NYou tough it out like a man.

634
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,870
Oh, yeah, it's easy for you to say.

635
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,970
Guys?

636
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,880
Sorry for the inconvenience.\NHave a pleasant evening.

637
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,420
Abort.

638
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,330
Abort. Abort.

639
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Shit.

640
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Okay.

641
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,130
Come on, let's go, let's go.

642
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,680
That's three green!

643
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,930
And here's dart number four!

644
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,870
One more for the big prize!

645
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,670
You can do it, mister!

646
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,880
We have a winner!

647
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,730
Step right up,\Nladies and gentlemen!

648
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,770
Get your tickets right here!

649
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,270
Murray!

650
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,150
Look!

651
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,650
It's not rigged!

652
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,650
Ah!

653
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,980
It's not rigged.

654
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,720
Traitor.

655
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,900
Alexei!

656
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,130
Alexei!

657
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,000
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Let's go.

658
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,470
Easy.

659
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,580
Keep pressure on it.

660
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,270
I'll get you help.

661
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,730
I'll get help.

662
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,780
Jim... Jim.

663
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,330
Jim!

664
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,250
They got Alexei, Jim!

665
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,280
Jim! Alexei! They got Alexei, Jim!

666
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,580
We gotta go.

667
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,470
- We gotta go.\N- What?

668
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Let's go.

669
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,320
They make an odd couple, don't they?

670
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,870
Well, it's like they say,

671
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,820
there's someone for everyone.

672
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,920
Who wants a hot dog?

673
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,670
Find Murray, get the car,

674
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,170
- bring it around back.\N- Okay.

675
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,070
Heading to "Big Top."

676
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,680
Northeast side of the fair.

677
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,970
Step right up,\Nladies and gentlemen!

678
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,730
Get your tickets to the Big Top here!

679
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,930
...this side of the Mississippi.

680
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,070
Hey! Get your kids outta here! Police!

681
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,030
Get 'em out of here! Go!

682
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
You, sir!

683
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,820
Step on up!

684
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,070
I see you eyeing the maze!

685
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,870
Don't be surprised! Don't be scared!

686
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,250
Step on up, sir!

687
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,050
Do you dare enter the cave of horrors?

688
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,470
You never know what you might find\Naround the corner.

689
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,430
Don't show your fear\Nin the presence of the tiger.

690
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,600
Or you may never escape this cave alive.

691
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,700
Alexei!

692
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,080
Oh, my God.

693
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,970
I... I just left for a minute...

694
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,420
for a corn dog.

695
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,800
A stupid corn dog.

696
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,830
Oh, God.

697
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,430
Oh, no.

698
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,850
Vasilev, are you there? Vasilev? Answer!

699
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,300
What are you doing?

700
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,250
Hey!

701
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,550
- Larry.\N- Joyce.

702
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,430
Ooh!

703
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,900
Yeah, lady!

704
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,100
Hey.

705
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,700
Comrade!

706
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
Get off me!

707
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,480
Goddamn!

708
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,550
Son of a bitch!

709
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:53,950
Hey!

710
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,500
Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go!

711
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,330
Alexei?

712
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
On the lower level...

713
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,300
Hey, translate.

714
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,700
We've found the children.

715
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,050
They are still in the mall. Lower level.

716
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,980
Keep all entrances locked down.

717
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:21,900
I repeat...

718
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,930
Keep all entrances locked down.

719
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,680
Everyone, get over here.

720
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,050
I found them.

721
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:37,750
What the hell?

722
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,400
You flung that thing\Nlike a Hot Wheel!

723
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,300
- Lucas?\N- What are you doing here?

724
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,730
Ask them. It's their fault.

725
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,030
True, yeah. Totally true.\NIt's absolutely our fault.

726
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,650
I don't understand what happened\Nto that car.

727
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,730
El has superpowers.

728
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
- I'm sorry?\N- Superpowers. She threw it with her mind.

729
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,480
- C'mon, catch up.\N- That's El?

730
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,700
- Who's El?\N- I'm sorry, who are you?

731
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,450
- I'm Robin. I work with Steve.\N- She cracked the top secret code.

732
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,430
Yeah, which is how we found out\Nabout the Russians.

733
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,750
Russians? Wait, what Russians?

734
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,700
- The Russians!\N- Those were Russians?

735
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,880
- Some of them.\N- What are you talking about?

736
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,430
- Didn't you hear our code red?\N- Yeah.

737
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,050
- Couldn't understand what you were saying.\N- Goddamn low battery.

738
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,150
How many times do I have to tell you\Nwith the low battery?

739
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,730
Well, everything worked out, didn't it?

740
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,980
- Worked out? We almost died.\N- Yeah, but we didn't, did we?

741
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,850
- It was pretty damn close.\N- Okay, Russians?

742
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,180
As in, they're working for\Nthe Russian government?

743
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,650
What are you not comprehending?

744
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,930
Am I not speaking English?

745
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,700
We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation.

746
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,700
So this has nothing to do\Nwith the gate?

747
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,030
It has everything to do\Nwith the gate...

748
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

749
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,550
El! El!

750
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,250
- What's wrong with her?\N- What's wrong?

751
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:29,670
My leg. My leg.

752
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:30,690
Her leg, her leg. Okay.

753
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,020
- Get that off.\N- Okay.

754
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,400
El! El!

755
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,500
El! El, are you okay?

756
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,400
El! El!

757
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,500
El!
