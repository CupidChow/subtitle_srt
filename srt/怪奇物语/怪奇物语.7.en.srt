1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,360
That's better.

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,620
You don't need it.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,900
Still pretty?

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,780
Yeah!

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,750
Pretty. Really pretty.

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,090
El?

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,390
Yes?

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,640
Um, I'm happy you're home.

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,230
Me, too.

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,340
Guys!

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,250
It's Lucas, I think he's in trouble.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,930
Do you remember how he said\Nhe was looking for the gate?

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,600
- Yeah.\N- What if he found it?

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,730
What's he saying?

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,870
I don't know, he's way out of range.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,900
... son of a bitch!

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,110
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow\Ndown. We can't understand you.

18
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,780
Yes, I copy! Do you?

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,620
They know about Eleven!

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,740
Get out of there!\NThey know about Eleven!

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,330
The bad men are coming! All of them!

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,080
Do you hear me? The bad men are coming!

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,830
"Mad hen." Does that\Nmean anything to you?

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,250
Like a code name or something?

25
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,800
- The bad men are coming!\N- "Bad men."

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,510
Bad men!

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,530
Stay here.

28
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,100
What's that guy doing?

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,120
You don't think...

30
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,500
Well, I know she and Steve have\Nbeen spending some time together,

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,750
- so I thought maybe...\N- Mom!

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,490
Well, is he home?

33
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,610
- Maybe you could ask him?\N- Mom!

34
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,990
I'm sorry, can you just hold on, please?

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,330
Michael, I'm on the phone.\NI've told you a million times...

36
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,200
- Did you schedule any repairs?\N- What?

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,970
Is there anyone supposed to\Ncome and do repairs on the house?

38
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,670
I don't understand. Is\Nthere something wrong...

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,010
- No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.\N- Mike!

40
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,050
- One second.\N- Mike!

41
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,080
We need to leave... right now.

42
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,120
Michael!

43
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,980
If anyone asks where I\Nam, I've left the country.

44
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,170
What?

45
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,900
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,730
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

47
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,280
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\N- Dustin!

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,150
Dustin, do you copy?

49
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,070
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.

50
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,780
- Where are you?\N- Cornwallis.

51
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,160
Meet me at Elm and Cherry!

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,870
Copy. Elm and Cherry!

53
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,180
Okay.

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,600
- Shit!\N- This way, come on!

55
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,970
Out of the way!

56
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,700
Out of the way!

57
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,480
- Lucas!\N- Where are they?

58
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,460
- I don't know.\N- I think we lost them.

59
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,320
Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,490
Go, go, go, go, go!

61
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,920
- Faster, faster!\N- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

62
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,500
Holy... holy shit!

63
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,960
Did... did you see what\Nshe did to that van?

64
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,130
No, Dustin, we missed it.

65
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,710
- I mean that was...\N- Awesome.

66
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,490
It was awesome.

67
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,210
Everything I said about you\Nbeing a traitor and stuff...

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,920
I was wrong.

69
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,750
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,470
Friends...

71
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,260
friends don't lie.

72
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,480
I'm sorry, too.

73
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,020
Me, too.

74
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,520
Hey.

75
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,060
Jonathan? Jesus, what... what happened?

76
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,370
- Ma'am...\N- I'm fine.

77
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,860
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

78
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,070
Well, your boy assaulted a\Npolice officer. That's why.

79
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,450
- Take them off.\N- I am afraid I cannot do that.

80
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,620
- Take them off!\N- You heard her. Take 'em off.

81
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,180
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here,\Nbut there's something you need to see.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,170
What is this?

83
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,840
Why don't you ask your\Nson? We found it in his car.

84
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,550
- What?\N- Why are you going through my car?

85
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,890
Is that really the question\Nyou should be asking right now?

86
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,590
I wanna see you in my office.

87
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,030
You won't believe me.

88
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,120
Why don't you give me a try?

89
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,910
Mike? Mike?

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,230
Yeah, just a minute, please!

91
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,980
Jiminy Christmas.

92
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,360
Hold your horses.

93
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,390
Mr. Wheeler?

94
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,120
Yes?

95
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,930
I don't understand.

96
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,390
You think my son is hiding this girl?

97
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,600
What happened to her hair?

98
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,230
We just need to know if you've\Nseen her in the past week.

99
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,530
- No, no.\N- Absolutely not.

100
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,320
Our son with a girl?

101
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,700
I mean, believe me,

102
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,120
if he had a girl sleeping in\Nthis house, we'd know about it.

103
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,790
Wouldn't we?

104
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,710
This girl...

105
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,830
what has she done?

106
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,670
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

107
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,330
Oh, my God, is she Russian?

108
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,250
- You can't treat us like this.\N- I need you to stay calm.

109
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,050
You come into my house,

110
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,630
and you tell me that my\Nson is hiding some girl,

111
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,850
and that he's in danger,\Nbut you can't tell us why?

112
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,780
And you, what, you expect\Nme to remain, what, calm?

113
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,460
I understand how upsetting this is.

114
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,760
I wish we could tell you more...

115
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,140
but I can tell you that your\Nson, Michael, is in real danger.

116
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,040
We want to help him.

117
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,940
We will help him. I give you my word.

118
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,900
But in order for me to do that...

119
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,320
you have to trust me.

120
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,450
Will you trust me?

121
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,400
Good.

122
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,670
Now...

123
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,050
do you have any idea where\Nyour son might have gone?

124
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,370
This is Randolph Road, right here.

125
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,010
The fence starts here, and\Ngoes all the way around.

126
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,040
And this is the lab right here.

127
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,630
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

128
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,710
It's gotta be.

129
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,670
Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

130
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,170
The sign says "Department of Energy."

131
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,380
Department of Energy? What\Ndo you think that means?

132
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,430
It means government. Military.

133
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,680
- Then why does it say "Energy"?\N- Just trust me, all right?

134
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,260
It's military. My dad's told me before.

135
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,060
Mike's right. There's\Nsoldiers out front.

136
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,190
Do they make, like,\Nlightbulbs or something?

137
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,480
No, weapons...

138
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,260
to fight the Russians,\Nand commies and stuff.

139
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,910
Weapons.

140
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,150
Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

141
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,030
Really bad. The place\Nis like a fortress.

142
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,160
Well, what do we do?

143
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,910
I don't know, but we can't go home.

144
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,410
We're fugitives now.

145
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,140
Guys?

146
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,970
Do you hear that?

147
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,420
- Go, go, go, go!\N- Come on, come on!

148
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,170
- It's stuck.\N- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

149
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,510
- Hurry up! Hurry, come on!\N- Come on!

150
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,010
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

151
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,910
Get down!

152
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,660
Mental.

153
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,570
You say blood draws this thing?

154
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,010
We don't know.

155
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,260
It's just a theory.

156
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,540
I'm sorry, Mom.

157
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,630
What, you're sorry?\NYou're... you're sorry?

158
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,500
- That is not good enough, Jonathan.\N- I know.

159
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,090
That's not even close. That's not\Neven in the... in the ballpark.

160
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,670
I wanted to tell you, I just...

161
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,010
What if this thing took you, too?

162
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,390
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

163
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,930
I thought I could save\NWill... I still do.

164
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,390
This is not yours to fix alone.

165
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,320
You act like you're all alone out\Nthere in the world, but you're not.

166
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,530
You're not alone.

167
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,990
I know.

168
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,490
God damn it, Jonathan.

169
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,300
- I know.\N- Damn it.

170
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,370
I want an apology!

171
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,620
An apology for what, exactly?

172
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,450
Where is the chief?\NI want to speak to him

173
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,870
- right this instant.\N- Stay here.

174
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,790
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

175
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,040
What is your name, Deputy?

176
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,920
Well, I'm an officer... okay?

177
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,460
Name and badge number, both of you!

178
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,570
- What the hell is going on here?\N- Chief...

179
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,470
These men are humiliating my son.

180
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,550
- No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.\N- Yes.

181
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,100
There was some kind of fight, Chief...

182
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,760
A psychotic child broke his arm!

183
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,100
- A little girl, Chief. A little one.\N- That tone! Do you hear that tone?

184
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,440
Honestly, I'm just\Ntrying to state a fact.

185
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,940
- I don't have time for this.\N- It was a little girl...

186
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,610
Will you please take a\Nstatement... and get her out?

187
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,590
- Yes.\N- So what'd this girl look like?

188
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,110
She had no hair and she\Nwas bleeding from her nose.

189
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,110
Like a freak.

190
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,340
What'd you just say?

191
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,530
I said she's a freak!

192
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,410
No, her hair. What'd\Nyou say about her hair?

193
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,410
Her head's shaved.

194
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,270
She doesn't even look like a girl.

195
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,690
And...

196
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,520
And what?

197
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,610
Tell the man, Troy.

198
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
She can...

199
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,800
do things.

200
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,180
What kind of things?

201
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,330
Like...

202
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,750
make you fly.

203
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,020
And piss yourself.

204
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,130
What?

205
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,710
Was she alone?

206
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,990
She always hangs out with those losers.

207
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,260
"Losers"?

208
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,890
What losers?

209
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,060
Hey.

210
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,690
You owe me $1.20.

211
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,040
Don't worry, he'll need more than\Naspirin when we're done with him.

212
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,550
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

213
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,220
The cops should just\Nlock him up forever.

214
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,890
Did you see the look on his face?

215
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,810
Oh.

216
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,550
He probably had that same look\Nwhenever he killed his brother, right?

217
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,810
Oh, God, I just got an\Nimage of him making that face

218
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,230
while he and Nancy are screwing.

219
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,260
Carol, for once in your\Nlife, shut your damn mouth!

220
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,070
- What?\N- Hey, what's your problem, man?

221
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,360
You're both assholes. That's my problem.

222
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,780
- Are you serious right now, man?\N- Yeah, I'm serious.

223
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,970
You shouldn't have done that.

224
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,240
- Done what?\N- You know what.

225
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,200
You mean call her out\Nfor what she really is?

226
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,540
Oh, that's funny, because I don't\Nremember you asking me to stop.

227
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,290
I should've put that spray\Npaint right down your throat.

228
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,000
- What the hell, Steve?\N- You know,

229
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,170
neither of you ever cared about\Nher. You never even liked her,

230
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,920
because she's not\Nmiserable like you two.

231
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,470
She actually cares about other people.

232
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,760
The slut with a heart of gold.

233
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,050
I told you to watch your mouth!

234
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,430
Hey! I don't know what's\Ngotten into you, man,

235
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,810
- but you don't talk to her that way.\N- Get out of my face.

236
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,390
Or what?

237
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,560
Or what?

238
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,230
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

239
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,390
You gonna fight me now, too?

240
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,790
Because you couldn't\Ntake Jonathan Byers...

241
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,630
so I wouldn't recommend that.

242
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,780
Here, let me get the\Ndoor for you, buddy.

243
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,660
That's right. Run away, Stevie boy!

244
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,250
Run away! Just like you always do.

245
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,690
That Nancy's turning\Nyou into a little pussy!

246
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,050
That's right, Harrington, run away!

247
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,780
Run away!

248
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,940
I have to go home.

249
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,540
No, you can't.

250
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,380
- My mom... my dad are there.\N- They're gonna be okay.

251
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,900
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\N- Let go.

252
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,650
- Let go!\N- Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

253
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,160
The last thing in the world we need

254
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,950
is them knowing you're\Nmixed up in all this.

255
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,580
- Mike is over there...\N- They haven't found him.

256
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,950
Not yet, at least.

257
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,310
- For Mike?\N- Come on, get in the car.

258
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,760
Look, we need to find\Nthem before they do.

259
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,580
Do you have any idea\Nwhere he might have gone?

260
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,050
- No, I don't.\N- I need you to think.

261
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,840
I don't know. We haven't talked a lot.

262
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,760
I mean, lately...

263
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,010
Is there any place that your...

264
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,060
your parents don't know\Nabout that he might go?

265
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,270
- I don't know.\N- I might.

266
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,440
What?

267
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,540
I don't know where he is, but\NI think I know how to ask him.

268
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,010
Whoa.

269
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,100
I got it.

270
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,640
Mike, are you there? Mike?

271
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,060
You guys hear that?

272
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,280
Mike, it's me, Nancy.

273
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,020
Mike, are you there?

274
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,770
Answer.

275
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,520
Mike, we need you to answer.

276
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,170
Is that your sister?

277
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,780
This is an emergency, Mike.

278
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,170
Do you copy?

279
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,830
Mike, do you copy?

280
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,450
Okay, this is really weird.

281
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,040
Don't answer.

282
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,210
- She said it was an emergency.\N- What if it's a trick?

283
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,040
- It's your sister!\N- What if the bad people kidnapped her?

284
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,830
What if they're forcing her to say this?

285
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,000
I need you to answer.

286
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,630
It's like Lando\NCalrissian. Don't answer.

287
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,480
We need to know that you're there, Mike.

288
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,010
Listen, kid, this is the\Nchief. If you're there, pick up.

289
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,100
We know you're in trouble\Nand we know about the girl.

290
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,220
Why is she with the chief?

291
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,600
How the hell does he know about...

292
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
We can protect you, we can\Nhelp you, but you gotta pick up.

293
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,330
Are you there? Do you copy? Over.

294
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,260
Anybody got any other ideas?

295
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,340
Yeah, I copy.

296
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,370
It's Mike.

297
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,810
I'm here.

298
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,440
We're here.

299
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,570
Need a hand?

300
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,830
Did you have something to do with this?

301
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,990
I just...

302
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,160
I wanna help.

303
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,880
All yours.

304
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,460
They expect us to just\Nsit here like prisoners.

305
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,170
We should be out there looking for him.

306
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,050
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

307
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,930
This is our government.\NThey're on our side.

308
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,950
That man gives me the creeps.

309
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,650
Nancy.

310
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,190
You don't think she's\Ninvolved in this, too, do you?

311
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,690
Nancy with Mike?

312
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,250
No.

313
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,340
No.

314
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,170
Will you stop pacing?

315
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,210
It's been way too long.

316
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,210
Do you know what? Maybe you're\Nright. Maybe this is all a trap

317
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,080
and the bad men are\Ncoming to get us right now!

318
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,090
It's not a trap.

319
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,180
Why would the chief set us up?

320
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,430
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

321
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,890
Lando Calrissian.

322
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,640
Would you shut up about Lando?

323
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,980
I don't feel good about this.\NI don't feel good about this!

324
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,970
When do you feel good about anything?

325
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,620
Shit!

326
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,050
Go, go, go, go.

327
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,000
Lando.

328
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,830
You think they saw us?

329
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,600
Both of you, shut up.

330
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,890
Hey!

331
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,650
What the...

332
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,320
All right, let's go.

333
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,660
Let's go!

334
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,190
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

335
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,050
I was so worried about you.

336
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,570
Yeah, uh... me, too.

337
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,280
Is that my dress?

338
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,940
Okay, so, in this\Nexample, we're the acrobat.

339
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Will and Barbara, and that\Nmonster, they're this flea.

340
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,400
And this is the Upside\NDown, where Will is hiding.

341
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,950
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get\Nthere is through a rip of time and space.

342
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,650
- A gate.\N- That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

343
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,050
With our compasses.

344
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,210
Okay, so the gate has a really\Nstrong electromagnetic field,

345
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,500
and that can change the\Ndirections of a compass needle.

346
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,790
Is this gate underground?

347
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,560
Yes.

348
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,650
Near a large water tank?

349
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,530
Yes.

350
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,860
How do you know all that?

351
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,020
He's seen it.

352
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,950
Is there any way that you could...

353
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,690
that you could reach Will? That\Nyou could talk to him in this...

354
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,860
The Upside Down.

355
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,580
Down. Yeah.

356
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,360
And my friend Barbara?

357
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,920
Can you find her, too?

358
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,230
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,360
What?

360
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,590
What's wrong? What happened?

361
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,340
I can't find them.

362
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,110
Whenever she uses her\Npowers, she gets weak.

363
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,730
The more energy she uses,\Nthe more tired she gets.

364
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,400
- Like, she flipped the van earlier.\N- It was awesome.

365
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,780
- But she's drained.\N- Like a bad battery.

366
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,740
Well... How do we make her better?

367
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,660
We don't. We just have\Nto wait and try again.

368
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,580
Well, how long?

369
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,040
I don't know.

370
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,380
The bath.

371
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,730
What?

372
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,020
I can find them.

373
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,570
In the bath.

374
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,950
Oh!

375
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,350
Oh. Oh, my... No, mmm-mmm.

376
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,540
Hey, you know how they did\Nthat? You know what that is?

377
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,770
No, what?

378
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,400
Melted plastic and\Nmicrowaved bubble gum.

379
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,360
No way. Really?

380
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,000
Really.

381
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,450
- What in the world?\N- Do you want me to pause it?

382
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,140
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

383
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,120
Hello?

384
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,000
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

385
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,960
Dustin? Is everything okay?

386
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,670
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

387
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,840
I have a science question.

388
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,300
It's ten o'clock on Saturday.\NWhy don't we pick this up...

389
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,350
Do you know anything about\Nsensory deprivation tanks?

390
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,220
Specifically how to build one?

391
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,290
Sensory deprivation? What is this for?

392
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,560
Fun.

393
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,330
Okay. Well...

394
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,570
Why don't we talk about it\NMonday? After school, okay?

395
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,110
You always say we should\Nnever stop being curious.

396
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,110
To always open any\Ncuriosity door we find.

397
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,240
Dustin...

398
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,970
Why are you keeping this\Ncuriosity door locked?

399
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,790
Uh-huh.

400
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,850
Uh-huh. How much?

401
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,810
Uh-huh.

402
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,880
Yep, all right. Yeah, we'll be careful.

403
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,590
Definitely. All right, Mr. Clarke.

404
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,180
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.\NI'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

405
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,350
Bye.

406
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,720
Do you still have that kiddie\Npool we bobbed for apples in?

407
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,100
- I think so. Yeah.\N- Yeah.

408
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,850
Good. Then we just\Nneed salt. Lots of it.

409
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,660
How much is "lots"?

410
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,830
1,500 pounds.

411
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,630
Well, where are we\Ngonna get that much salt?

412
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,710
Hey, wait.

413
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,750
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

414
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,920
Worst case, no school.

415
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,720
Even if we find Will in there...

416
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,340
what are we gonna do about that thing?

417
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,720
We're not gonna do anything.

418
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,220
I don't want you anywhere\Nnear this, all right?

419
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,830
Your mom's been through enough already.

420
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,720
He's my brother.

421
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,140
Listen to me. I'm gonna\Nfind him. All right?

422
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,770
You gotta trust me on this.

423
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,580
I am going to find him.

424
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,090
This damn thing is heavy.

425
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,040
Come on. It's upside down.

426
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,390
No, this way.

427
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,750
- Okay, um...\N- How does this even work?

428
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,000
- Try that side.\N- Son of a bitch!

429
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,090
- Pull it back. Pull it back.\N- I am!

430
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,800
One, two, three.

431
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,240
Shit!

432
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,850
Ah.

433
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,040
Stand back.

434
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,510
Whoa.

435
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,210
What did she even eat?

436
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,920
- What?\N- Eleven.

437
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,270
Oh. Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

438
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,610
She really likes Eggos.

439
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,890
I knew you were acting weird. I just...

440
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,020
I thought it was because of Will.

441
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,990
I knew you were acting weird, too.\NI thought it was 'cause of Steve.

442
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,500
Hey...

443
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,400
No more secrets, okay?

444
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,530
From now on we tell\Neach other everything.

445
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,660
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?

446
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,720
What? No.

447
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,470
No, it's... it's not...\Nit's not like that.

448
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,290
Do you like Eleven?

449
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,730
What? No. Ew. Gross.

450
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,890
This will keep it dark for you.

451
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,080
Just like in your bathtub.

452
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,900
You're a very brave girl.

453
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,790
You know that, don't you?

454
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,800
Everything you're doing\Nfor my boy... for Will...

455
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,880
for my family...

456
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,140
Thank you.

457
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,980
Listen.

458
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,340
I am gonna be there\Nwith you the whole time.

459
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,380
And if it ever gets too scary...

460
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,860
in that place, you\Njust let me know, okay?

461
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,950
Yes.

462
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,660
Ready?

463
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,630
Ready.

464
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,600
Colder!

465
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,860
Warmer!

466
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,650
Right there!

467
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,520
Barb?

468
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,880
Barbara?

469
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,280
- What's going on?\N- I don't know.

470
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,270
Is Barb okay? Is she okay?

471
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,360
Gone! Gone!

472
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,190
Gone!

473
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,940
Gone! Gone!

474
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,320
Gone. Gone.

475
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,910
Gone.

476
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,780
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

477
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,160
- Gone. Gone!\N- It's okay. It's okay.

478
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,660
Gone!

479
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,500
Hey. It's okay.

480
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,080
It's okay, we're right here.\NWe're right here, honey.

481
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,420
It's okay. I got you.

482
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,340
Don't be afraid.

483
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,920
I'm right here with you.

484
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,550
I'm right here with you.

485
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,800
It's okay. It's okay.

486
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,180
It's okay.

487
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,390
It's okay, you're safe.

488
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,870
You're okay, honey.

489
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,370
Castle Byers.

490
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,330
Castle Byers.

491
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,770
Will.

492
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,710
Will?

493
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,110
You tell him... tell him I'm coming.

494
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,700
Mom is coming.

495
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,930
Your mom... she's coming for you.

496
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,930
Hurry.

497
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,560
Hurry.

498
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,000
Okay. Listen, you tell him\Nto... to stay where he is.

499
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,090
We're coming. We're coming,\Nokay? We're coming, honey.

500
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,430
Just... just hold on a little longer.

501
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,610
Will. Will.

502
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,960
Will?

503
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,960
Will!

504
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,660
Oh!

505
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,470
Oh, okay, okay.

506
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,720
I've got you.

507
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,020
It's okay. I got you. I got you.

508
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,270
I got you, honey. You did so good.

509
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,730
Are you okay?

510
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,260
So this fort. Where is it?

511
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,250
Uh, it's in the woods behind our house.

512
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,770
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.

513
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,650
Hey, get back inside.

514
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,860
What, are you insane?

515
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,240
- No, I'm...\N- Look, if something happens to me,

516
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,360
I don't make it back...

517
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,150
Yeah, but then I'll go. You stay.

518
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,360
Are you kidding me?

519
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,700
He's my son, Hop. My son.

520
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,890
I'm going!

521
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,100
Now, listen, I need you to stay here...

522
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,710
No.

523
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,230
- and watch over the kids.\N- No, Mom.

524
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,330
- I can help.\N- Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan.

525
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,130
Joyce!

526
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,380
- Please.\N- Please, be careful.

527
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,600
- Joyce, come on!\N- Please. I'm gonna find him.

528
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,840
I'm gonna find him.

529
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,230
We have to go back to the station.

530
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,730
What?

531
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:35,240
Your mom and Hopper are just\Nwalking in there like bait.

532
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,240
That thing is still in there.

533
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,640
And we can't just sit here\Nand let it get them, too.

534
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,040
We can't.

535
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,380
You still wanna try it out?

536
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,460
I wanna finish what we started.

537
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,050
I want to kill it.

538
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,090
So this is your plan?

539
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,880
Worked for me before, didn't it?

540
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,200
- Well, did it?\N- Come on, trust me.

541
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,390
I'd like to hear your\Nthoughts on the war.

542
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,480
I think we're dealing with a\Nwhole different environment here.

543
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,500
I'll tell you what, we always planned

544
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,890
on the Russians massing\Nthe fire and we...

545
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,620
Don't move!

546
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,080
All right, move in.

547
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,630
It's all right.

548
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,090
Let me do the talking.

549
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,970
♪ If I go there will be trouble ♪

550
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,030
♪ And if I stay it will be double ♪

551
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,830
♪ So, come on and let me know ♪

552
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,940
♪ Should I stay or should I go now? ♪
