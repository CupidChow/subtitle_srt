1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Mama? It's me. Jane.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,200
I'm home.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,090
No.

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,450
Breathe.

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,640
Sunflower.

6
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:08,950
Rainbow.

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,000
- Four-fifty. Three to the right...\N- Breathe.

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,940
Four to the left. Sunflower.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
- Four-fifty. Rainbow.\N- Breathe.

10
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,850
- Three to the right. Four to the left.\N- Breathe.

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,450
Four-fifty. Sunflower. Rainbow.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,990
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,450
Three to the right. Four to the left.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,290
Okay. You okay?

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,900
And it just kept repeating?

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,590
Repeat?

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,050
Like a circle?

18
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,740
Just showing you the same\Nimage over and over?

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,750
She kept showing the girl in the room.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,890
The rainbow room?

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,450
What did the girl look like?

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,800
- Different.\N- Different than you?

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,550
I think this is why Mama wanted to talk.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,990
To show you the girl?

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,200
I think she wants me to find her.

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,590
When Terry was looking for you,

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,050
she kept these files\Nof other missing kids.

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,600
Kids she thought were like you.

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,500
Maybe that girl is in here somewhere.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Here.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,740
Does anyone look familiar?

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,750
Is that her?

33
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,300
Did you find her?

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,540
No.

35
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,340
Hello?

36
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,320
Becky! Becky, I found her.

37
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,410
I just... I didn't\Nknow who else to call.

38
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,520
He gave me this number, and\Nhe came here looking for her.

39
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,620
I thought maybe he could help me.

40
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,670
Yeah, Jim Hopper,

41
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,510
he came here with some\Nwoman named Joyce Byers?

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,960
Well, that's a little\Nhard to explain. Uh...

43
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,960
There's another girl, and she's missing,

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,660
and I think she's in trouble.

45
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,420
I just... I didn't know who to call.

46
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,010
Thank you, thank you. And you are?

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,610
Florence...

48
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,810
I'm gonna have to call you back.

49
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,690
Jane? Jane?

50
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,320
Jane?

51
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,990
Jane!

52
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,160
Jane!

53
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,390
Jane!

54
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,290
Four-fifty... Breathe. Sunflower...

55
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,210
Watch it, kid.

56
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,380
Mouth breather.

57
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,760
They're dead.

58
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,480
They're all dead!

59
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,010
They're all dead!

60
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,900
They're all dead!

61
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,760
You should do stand-up, Axe.

62
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,260
There's a spot a few blocks away.

63
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,860
Hello?

64
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,730
Well, well...

65
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,610
What do we have here?

66
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,650
What is she wearing?

67
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,250
What are those, overalls?

68
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,500
There aren't any cows to milk here, kid.

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,250
Go on back to the farm now.

70
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm looking for my sister.

71
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,300
Aw... Shirley Temple lost her sister.\NSo sad.

72
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,000
I saw her. Here.

73
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,960
Uh-uh. Hand out of pocket. Slow.

74
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,130
Give me that shit.

75
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,660
- Is that Kali?\N- Kali?

76
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,210
How did you find us?

77
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,410
- Who else knows you're here?\N- No one.

78
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,660
So, what then?

79
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,410
Poof! You just show up like\Nmagic with that picture?

80
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,960
Stay calm. She's just a kid.

81
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,610
A kid who could get us all killed.

82
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,950
If I have to ask again, Shirley,\Nyou'll start losing things.

83
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,210
Starting with those pretty\Nlittle locks of yours. Yeah?

84
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,610
Come on, Axe. Put down the knife.

85
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,110
How did you find us?

86
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,360
- I saw her.\N- Axe!

87
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,710
That's not an answer.

88
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,610
Jesus. Jesus Christ!

89
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,300
Get off! Shit! Shit!

90
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,910
You're a terrible dancer, Axel.

91
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,110
I told you, stay out of my head.

92
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,600
So, we're threatening\Nlittle girls now, are we?

93
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,750
- She knows about you.\N- She had this.

94
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,400
Where did you get this?

95
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Mama.

96
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,450
Your mother gave this to you?

97
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
In her dream circle.

98
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,450
Dream circle. I think she's\Na schizo or something.

99
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,850
Says she's looking for her sister.

100
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,550
Yeah. Like I said, schizo.

101
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,450
Jesus!

102
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,250
I saw you.

103
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,250
In the rainbow room.

104
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,050
What is your name?

105
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,250
Jane.

106
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Sister.

107
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,000
Sister.

108
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,350
And this memory your mother shared...

109
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,000
that is your only memory of me?

110
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,850
Yes.

111
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,600
And how long have you\Nbeen with this policeman?

112
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,450
Three hundred and twenty-seven days.

113
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,350
And this policeman, he thinks

114
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,050
he can work out some sort of deal

115
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,800
with these men to set you free?

116
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

117
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,150
- He says soon.\N- He's naïve then.

118
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,050
We'll always be monsters to them.\NDo you understand?

119
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,700
Let me guess. Your policeman,

120
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,250
he also stops you from using your gifts?

121
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,760
What you can do is incredible.

122
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,410
It makes you very special, Jane.

123
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Wait.

124
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,660
- Do you have a gift?\N- Different.

125
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,900
I can make people see, or\Nnot see, whatever I choose.

126
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,910
Is that why you made the man\Nwith the crazy hair dance?

127
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,710
Axel is not so fond of spiders, so...

128
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,860
You made him see spiders?

129
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,310
But it doesn't have to be scary.

130
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,160
This butterfly, it isn't real.

131
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,460
I've just convinced your mind it is.

132
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,760
Think of it as a kind of magic.

133
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,150
Are you real?

134
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,900
Yes, I'm real.

135
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,380
What's wrong?

136
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,130
Nothing is wrong.

137
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,230
I just feel... whole... now.

138
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,180
Like... a piece of me was missing,

139
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,150
and now it's not.

140
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,430
Does that make sense?

141
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,280
Yes.

142
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,120
I think your mother sent\Nyou here for a reason.

143
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,920
I think she somehow knew\Nthat we belong together.

144
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,120
I think this is your home.

145
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,080
Home.

146
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,300
Yes. Home.

147
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,270
This is car 13,

148
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,930
responding to a 245 at 31 Ashbury.

149
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,320
..suspect under surveillance.

150
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,600
Shit.

151
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,570
How's your white hick sister?\NYou tuck her in real tight?

152
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,420
Yeah, what about a lullaby?\NDid you sing her one?

153
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,830
- ♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪\N- Yeah.

154
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,030
♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪

155
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,750
♪ And on his farm he had a cow ♪

156
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,120
She found me with only this.

157
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,130
What's that mean?

158
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,800
It means she can find\Npeople without moving.

159
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,520
With nothing but an image.

160
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,050
You telling me Shirley's a human\Nradar detector or some shit?

161
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,550
Or some shit, yes.

162
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,220
Come on. No way.

163
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
We'll find out soon enough.

164
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,980
I want to do one. Tomorrow.

165
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,070
- You serious, Kal?\N- We're way too hot right now.

166
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,150
Paranoid.

167
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,970
Realistic. You don't kill their men

168
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,770
and expect them to look the other way.

169
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,180
If they find us, they will unleash hell.

170
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,550
So we give in to fear?

171
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,780
She's in pain. She needs this.

172
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,950
We go out tomorrow.

173
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,670
Swear to God, Shirley Temple's\Ngonna get us all killed.

174
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,020
It's me.

175
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,680
I know that I've been\Ngone too long, and, uh...

176
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,400
I just want you to know that\Nit's not because of you.

177
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,820
And it's not because of our fight.

178
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,030
Something came up,

179
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,370
and, uh, I'll explain everything soon.

180
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,830
I just, um...

181
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,130
I want you to know that I'm not...\NI'm not mad at you. I...

182
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,170
I'm just sorry.

183
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,280
It's okay. It's only me.

184
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,780
Bad dream?

185
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,470
What time is it?

186
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,080
It's late.

187
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,630
You slept well. Come.

188
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,430
It's time you meet my friends.\NProperly this time.

189
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,280
We need more money, Kal. I can't\Nkeep eating this garbage.

190
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,980
- This is Axel.\N- The spider hater?

191
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,180
Yes, the spider hater.

192
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,980
This is Dottie, our newest.

193
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,770
Like you, she just left home.

194
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,180
You mean the loony bin.

195
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,220
Mick, our eyes, our protector.

196
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,320
This is Funshine, our warrior.

197
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,230
Don't let his size frighten you.\NFun's a teddy bear.

198
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,030
Nice to meet you, Miss Jane.

199
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,630
If you're looking for a\Nnumber, you won't find one.

200
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,020
They're not like us.

201
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,870
No, not in that way. But\Nlike us, they're outcasts.

202
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,170
Outcasts?

203
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,370
- Freaks.\N- Speak for yourself.

204
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,720
Society left them behind,\Nhurt them, discarded them.

205
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,870
We were dead, all of us.

206
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Kali saved us. Here. And here.

207
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Don't get all mushy on us now, Fun.

208
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,870
No, not mushy. True.

209
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,070
Now we help her.

210
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,170
In this life, kid, you roll\Nover or you fight back.

211
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,120
We're all fighters here.

212
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,220
Fight who?

213
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,720
Everyone you see here was\Nin some way responsible

214
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,920
for what happened to us.

215
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,370
You hurt the bad men?

216
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,470
No, we just give 'em a pat on the back.

217
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,120
You kill them?

218
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,820
They're criminals. We simply\Nmake them pay for their crimes.

219
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,570
Boom.

220
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,420
Damn, Shirley. What's the matter?

221
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,970
You look like you've seen a ghost.

222
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,870
We can't all be fighters, I guess.

223
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,620
I'm a fighter. I've killed.

224
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,370
These men you killed,\Ndid they deserve it?

225
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,670
They hurt me.

226
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,520
And they still want to hurt you.\NTo hurt us.

227
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,670
We're just making the first move.

228
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,370
Come.

229
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,220
I was just like you once.

230
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,870
I kept my anger inside.

231
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,620
I tried to hide from it, but\Nthen that pain festered.

232
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,220
Festered?

233
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,370
It spread.

234
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,620
Until finally I confronted my\Npain, and I began to heal.

235
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,680
- Do you see that train?\N- Yes.

236
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,930
I want you to draw it to us.

237
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,470
I can't.

238
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,440
Last night you told me\Nyou lifted a van once.

239
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,520
Yes.

240
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,300
The bad men were trying\Nto take you again,

241
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,020
and that made you angry.

242
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,540
Good. So, find that anger,

243
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,200
focus on that, not the\Ntrain, not its weight.

244
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,040
I want you to find\Nsomething from your life.

245
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Something that angers you.

246
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,640
Now channel it.

247
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,500
Dig deeper. Your whole life\Nyou've been lied to...

248
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,640
- Do I have a mother?\N- She's not around anymore.

249
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,350
...imprisoned.

250
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,050
Don't walk away from me!\NGrow the hell up!

251
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,740
The bad men took away your home,

252
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,400
your mother...

253
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,570
Jane.

254
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,120
They took everything from you.

255
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Papa!

256
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,400
They stole your life, Jane.

257
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,200
I want you to find them.

258
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,100
Yeah!

259
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,140
Yeah, Jane!

260
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,650
So, how do you feel?

261
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,650
Good.

262
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,590
These are the bad men, as you call them.

263
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,090
The one's we believe are still alive.\NDo you know any?

264
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Him.

265
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,940
Four-fifty...

266
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,220
He hurt Mama.

267
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,390
His name is Ray Caroll. And he\Ndid more than hurt your mother.

268
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,900
The bad men like Ray,\Nthey know about us.

269
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,940
It's made them hard to track.\NBut maybe not anymore.

270
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,740
"Gramercy Apartments.\NWashington and Bethel."

271
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,940
That's gotta be it. Right?

272
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,040
- "Lilburn." Where is that?\N- About an hour east.

273
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,850
We don't even have a new ride.

274
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,040
So we swap plates. We\Nhave plates, right?

275
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,950
- Yeah.\N- It's risky.

276
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,900
Where's the fun if there's no risk?

277
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,090
We want to give my sister a\Nmemorable first day, right?

278
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,250
I'm in. For Miss Jane.

279
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,170
Yeah, sure. Why not? Mick?

280
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,350
Screw it!

281
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Bitchin'.

282
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Bitchin'.

283
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,790
Get off me! Get off me!

284
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,490
What are we doing?

285
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,990
Stocking up.

286
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,040
Hey, your bathroom is leaking.

287
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,040
Oh, shit.

288
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,090
Yes.

289
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,890
Shit.

290
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,940
Okay, contestants, you\Nhave a minute and a half,

291
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,290
let's begin your supermarket sweep!

292
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,290
Hey! Put that back, or\NI'll blow your head off.

293
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,590
- You hear me, freak?\N- Put the gun down.

294
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,290
Stay back. Stay back.

295
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,290
Darrel, your money is insured.

296
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,290
We're only stealing from the\Nwar criminal billionaires

297
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,100
who own this place.

298
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,590
- You won't even lose a dime.\N- I said stay back.

299
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,250
We're on the same side.

300
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,140
- I promise.\N- Stay back.

301
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,900
Damn, Shirley.

302
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,500
Let's go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

303
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,240
Mick! We gotta go, Mick!

304
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,110
We should case the place, stick\Nto the routine. We have time.

305
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,910
We also have her. Can you look?

306
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,790
- He's watching television.\N- Is he alone?

307
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,710
I saw him. No one else.

308
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,010
- Good enough for me.\N- Me, too.

309
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,270
Let's do this.

310
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,020
- Keep it running.\N- Meet you around back.

311
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,110
Punky, what's the matter?

312
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,190
A nightmare.

313
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,240
I dreamt I was in the doctor's office.

314
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,460
All of a sudden, he's started\Nto give me my shot in my arm.

315
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,710
Then the needle got bigger\Nand bigger and bigger...

316
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,060
Hello, Ray.

317
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,770
Jesus Christ!

318
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,860
Sit down. Please.

319
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,190
- I said sit.\N- Please...

320
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,570
Just, please... just take what you want.

321
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,270
Oh, we will.

322
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,110
Where's your wallet?

323
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,270
- Bedroom. My bedroom. My jeans.\N- Come on.

324
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,410
Yes.

325
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,160
Got it.

326
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,560
Do you remember us?

327
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,820
What about us? Do you remember us, Ray?

328
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,240
Please. Please.

329
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,960
You hurt Mama.

330
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,260
Wait.

331
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,960
Please. Listen...

332
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,810
I just did what he told me to do.

333
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,140
He said she was sick.

334
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,510
You had a choice, Ray.

335
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,390
And you chose to follow a\Nman you knew was evil.

336
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,060
No, wait! No, wait! Wait!

337
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,770
I can help. I can help you find him.

338
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,190
- Find who?\N- Brenner!

339
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,770
I can take you to him.

340
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,110
Papa is gone.

341
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,160
No, he is alive.

342
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,820
Do not lie to us, Ray.

343
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,370
I'm not lying!

344
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,960
I swear...

345
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,120
He trusts me.

346
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,670
I'll take you to him.

347
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,590
If he's alive, Jane will find him.

348
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,420
Just as she found you.

349
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,070
Do it, Jane.

350
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,220
- Do it.\N- Wait.

351
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,670
Not too quick.

352
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,860
He wasn't so generous with your mother.

353
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,770
Sweetie, just stay calm.

354
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,220
Oh, shit!

355
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,460
The police are on their way, honey.\NOkay?

356
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,320
What's wrong?

357
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,710
- What's wrong?\N- We got a problem.

358
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,360
Kids in the apartment.

359
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,860
Please...

360
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,110
- Did he show your mother mercy? No.\N- Please. No.

361
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,560
I'm sorry.

362
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,960
He took her from you,\Nwithout hesitation.

363
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,910
Please don't. Please.

364
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,210
We got to go, K. They called the cops.

365
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,460
We finish this first.

366
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,710
- Kali!\N- Jane, now!

367
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,710
Please, don't...

368
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,960
Please. Please.

369
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,010
Kali, we gotta go!

370
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,410
- Shit!\N- Go, go, go!

371
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,760
Shit!

372
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,860
Come on. Get in!

373
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,360
If you wanted to show\Nmercy, that is your choice.

374
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,860
But don't you ever take away mine. Ever.

375
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,810
Do you understand? Do you understand?

376
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,010
I see you, and I raise you ten.

377
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,560
How ya like that?

378
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,310
That was a mistake right there, girl.\NA mistake.

379
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,610
I think you're full of shit.

380
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,860
May I sit?

381
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,320
I was once just like you, you know that?

382
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,420
But that's why I'm hard on you, because

383
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,020
I see in you my past mistakes.

384
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,920
They were kids.

385
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,420
Does that excuse that man's sins?

386
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,620
Were we not also children?

387
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,070
I remember the day

388
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,460
I came to the rainbow\Nroom and you were gone.

389
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,170
So, when my gifts were strong enough,

390
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,870
I used them to escape.

391
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,460
And I ran.

392
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,270
I ran away as far as I could.

393
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:34,320
And it was there, far away,\Nthat I found a place to hide.

394
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,220
A family.

395
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,810
A home.

396
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,230
Just like you and your policeman.

397
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,480
But they couldn't help me.

398
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,830
So, eventually, I lost them, too.

399
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,780
So, I decided to play the part.

400
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,240
To stop hiding.

401
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,130
To use my gifts against\Nthose who hurt us.

402
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,880
You're now faced with\Nthe same choice, Jane.

403
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,490
Go back into hiding and\Nhope they don't find you.

404
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,460
Fight, and face them again.

405
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,790
Face who?

406
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,140
The man who calls himself our father.

407
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,430
Papa is dead.

408
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,140
That man tonight disagreed.

409
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,730
You're not real.

410
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,390
All this time? And you\Nhaven't looked for me?

411
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Why?

412
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,910
Because you thought I was dead?

413
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,190
Or because you were afraid\Nof what you might find?

414
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,460
Go away.

415
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,830
You have to confront your pain.

416
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,260
You have a wound, Eleven,\Na terrible wound.

417
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,680
And it's festering.

418
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,930
Do you remember what that means?\NFestering?

419
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,680
It means a rot.

420
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,640
And it will grow.

421
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,530
Spread.

422
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,610
- Get out of my head.\N- And eventually, it will kill you.

423
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,830
Get out of my head!

424
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,790
This isn't a prison, Jane.

425
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,040
You're always free to\Nreturn to your policeman.

426
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,290
Or stay, and avenge your mother.

427
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,230
Let us heal our wounds together.

428
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,940
- Full house.\N- Screw this. I'm out.

429
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,540
Out of money, you mean. You are broke!

430
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,210
- You want in, Mick?\N- Nope.

431
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,680
- Aw, come on! Just one hand.\N- You're the worst.

432
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,930
How am I the worst?

433
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,130
Because, one hand leads to two hands,

434
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,440
two hands leads to three.

435
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,690
Before you know it,\NI'm as broke as Axel.

436
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,590
- Are you in or out?\N- Out.

437
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,090
Today, tomorrow, the next day.

438
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,290
Maybe we can call you\N"El." Short for Eleven.

439
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,130
You'd better run! She's our\Nfriend, and she's crazy!

440
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,130
No, El, you're not the monster.

441
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,340
You saved me, you understand?\NYou saved me.

442
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,790
Compromise?

443
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
It's something that's\Nkind of in between.

444
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,390
Like halfway happy.

445
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,990
Once we fix it up, it's gonna be nice.\NReal nice.

446
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,790
This is your new home.

447
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,690
That's where I was.\NIt's a damn graveyard.

448
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,590
I need to get through!\NI need to get through!

449
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,390
- Whoa! Whoa!\N- I need to warn them. It's a trap!

450
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,440
I need to get through. It's a trap.\NI need to tell them it's a trap.

451
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,530
- Mike!\N- It's a trap! It's a trap!

452
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,730
Mike!

453
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,730
Mike! Mike!

454
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,830
Mike! Mike, where are you?

455
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,430
Mike! Mike!

456
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,730
Go, go, go!

457
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Let's go.

458
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,430
Don't move!

459
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,280
- The hell's going on?\N- They found us!

460
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,980
- Jesus! Jesus Christ!\N- No, no, no.

461
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,280
Shh...

462
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,880
- Spread left.\N- Right.

463
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,680
Let's go! Now!

464
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,480
- Hey! Hey!\N- Jane, come on!

465
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,130
Come on, hurry!

466
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,380
Look out! Look out!

467
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,430
Get down! Get down!

468
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,530
Do something, Kal. Do something!

469
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,440
Jane, get in.

470
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,140
It's a damn graveyard.

471
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,090
- Mike!\N- It's a trap! It's a trap!

472
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,090
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,\Nbut I have to go back.

473
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,590
My friends... My friends are in danger.

474
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,690
This isn't time for a talk.\NWe got to go right now!

475
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,580
Your mother sent you here\Nfor a reason, remember?

476
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,080
We belong together.

477
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,890
There's nothing for you back there.\NThey cannot save you, Jane.

478
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
No.

479
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,380
But I can save them.

480
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,440
Jane. Jane!

481
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,930
Jane!

482
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,290
Jane!

483
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,910
The hell was that?\NWhat's wrong with her?

484
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,430
You all right, sweetie?

485
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,400
You were looking a little forlorn there.\NYou mind if I join you?

486
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,000
Hmm.

487
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,830
You are awfully young to be\Ntraveling alone, aren't you?

488
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,660
Well, you are quite the chatterbox.

489
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,310
So, where are you headed?

490
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,460
To your parents, I hope?

491
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,060
I'm going to my friends.

492
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,710
I'm going home.
