1
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,442
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?

2
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:31,823
I remember long ago
Another starry night like this

3
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,326
In the fire…

4
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,748
Dadgum it!

5
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,337
No!

6
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,009
Help! Help!

7
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,719
Mom!

8
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,471
Mom! Dad!

9
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,231
Mom!

10
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,568
Mom! Mom!

11
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,654
-Holly?
-Mom! Mom!

12
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,449
-Mom, the monster!
-Baby, what are you doing? What's wrong?

13
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:18,745
-Mom, there's a monster in there.
-Holly, slow down. I can't understand you!

14
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,872
-Mom, there's a monster. The mon--
-Holly.

15
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,042
Whatever you saw, baby,
it was just a nightmare.

16
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,795
-No, Mom! Mom!
-Baby, it's just a nightmare!

17
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,089
I saw it. Please trust me, Mom.

18
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,676
Please, Mom, please.
You gotta believe me. Please.

19
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,611
What the heck?

20
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,626
What's your location? Over.

21
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,753
Pickett, five minutes away.

22
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,005
You're way ahead of us.
Radio as soon as you're there!

23
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,006
I will.

24
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,925
And Nancy, be careful.

25
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:14,926
Hold on.

26
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,186
There was something
In the air that night

27
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,858
The stars were bright, Fernando

28
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,154
They were shining there for you and me

29
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,449
For liberty, Fernando

30
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,412
Though we never thought
That we could lose

31
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,997
There's no regret

32
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,585
If I had to do the same again

33
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,302
There was something
In the air that night

34
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,055
The stars were bright, Fernando

35
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,024
Karen!

36
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,200
Heavens to Betsy.

37
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,118
Karen!

38
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,206
Everything all right?

39
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,460
Holly?

40
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,802
Holly!

41
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,555
Holy smokes.

42
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,520
Oh God. Hey. Stay back. Stay back!

43
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,647
Back!

44
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:13,878
Go! Go!

45
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,008
Mom!

46
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,597
Oh, God!

47
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,932
Holly, get back!

48
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:40,530
Stay away from my daughter!

49
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,949
Mom, no!

50
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,297
It's inside.

51
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,257
I see it. Get ready.

52
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,233
Nancy, what's going on?
Talk to me! What's happening?

53
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,444
Nancy!

54
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:28,494
Stay away from my daughter!

55
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,158
Mom!

56
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,999
Don't try to talk, okay?
Just stay calm, okay?

57
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,543
You're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine, okay?

58
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,087
You're gonna be fine.

59
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,088
Holly.

60
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,527
Go. Go, go, go, go! Go!

61
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,492
You're gonna be okay, Mom.
I'm right here. Just stay with me. Okay?

62
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,953
Can you do that?
Can you please stay with me?

63
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,788
I promise
I won't let anything happen to you.

64
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,833
I'm gonna get you help.
I just need you to hold on, okay?

65
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,126
Just hold on.

66
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,989
Vitals. Talk to me.

67
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,699
Female, 46 years old.

68
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,785
-Heart rate 120. BP 103/67.
-Got a male, late forties.

69
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,496
Multiple blunt impact. Weak abdominal…

70
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,331
Pulse is thready and weak.

71
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,542
Lacerations to the right anterior chest
and penetrating neck trauma.

72
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,044
We're right here. You're okay.

73
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,421
I'm sorry. You have to wait outside.

74
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,549
-Can't we stay with them?
-We have to let the doctors do their job.

75
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,719
We'll update you
as soon as we know something, okay? Okay?

76
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,179
I can't see a damn thing.

77
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,431
Cross-match, get to the bag.

78
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,766
Where’s my X-ray cart?

79
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,227
-Maybe four broken ribs.
-Stand by to intubate.

80
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,079
This is our fault.

81
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,874
This is all our fault.

82
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,629
We got there as fast as we could.

83
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,632
I'm not talking about tonight.

84
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:57,430
We could have acted yesterday,
last week, last fall.

85
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,599
We could've tried
to get them out of Hawkins,

86
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,518
or… or at least told them the truth.

87
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,730
We could have done something, anything.

88
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,691
We couldn't have known
any of this would happen.

89
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,109
Do you really believe that?

90
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,529
After all this time, it comes for Holly?

91
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,906
Holly, who has nothing to do
with any of this.

92
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,700
It makes no goddamn sense.

93
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,620
It makes perfect goddamn sense.

94
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,371
Vecna told me this would happen.

95
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,914
He showed me.

96
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,416
And not just the four gates.

97
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,168
Holly, Mom, Dad dead.

98
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,880
And we just…
we just chose not to believe him.

99
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,967
But now it's all coming true.
Like, don't you get it, Mike?

100
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,764
Vecna's come back
to realize his vision, to punish us.

101
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,016
He did it with Fred and Chrissy and Max,

102
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,267
and now it's our turn.

103
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,727
And he's not gonna stop.

104
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,648
He's not gonna stop until we're drained
of every last ounce of suffering.

105
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,234
I'm not so sure this was about punishment.

106
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,363
Vecna doesn't leave things unfinished.

107
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,198
He doesn't hold back.

108
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:01,452
Because if this was really about
making you guys suffer,

109
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,204
why leave your parents alive?

110
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,289
Why take Holly into the Upside Down

111
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,124
and not leave her body here
for you to find?

112
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,834
Why not come here himself?

113
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,836
Why send one of his… his pets?

114
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,838
What are you saying? It's not Vecna?

115
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,175
What I'm saying is I don't know,

116
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,510
and neither do you.

117
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,637
There are just too many questions
right now.

118
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,265
I… I just know I'm having serious déjà vu,

119
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,685
because this is
exactly what happened to Will

120
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,895
at almost exactly the same time.

121
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,694
You know what date it is, right?

122
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,904
November 3rd.

123
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,823
Will was taken on the 6th.

124
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,367
We are less than three days away.

125
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,955
Three days away
from the day that changed everything.

126
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,834
I don't know about you guys, but…

127
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,255
…I don't believe in coincidences.

128
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,758
Not anymore.

129
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,137
But we got Will back.

130
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,514
And we're going to get Holly back,
'cause she's not alone.

131
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,266
Eleven's in there with her.

132
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,268
And if anybody can save your sister--

133
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,602
It's El.

134
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:10,855
It's El.

135
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,529
Stay indoors!

136
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,614
Stay inside!

137
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,215
The daughter found her mother here.

138
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,886
We believe Mrs. Wheeler was trying
to escape when she was attacked.

139
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,014
And no one saw this intruder?

140
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,975
No. By the time she got home,
the intruder was gone,

141
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,310
along with her sister.

142
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,566
The daughter, she arrive alone?

143
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,276
That's what she told us, sir.

144
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,254
I want you to pull up
all video surveillance

145
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,673
within a two-mile radius of this house.

146
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,468
-You think it could be her, sir?
-Now.

147
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,821
Holly! Holly!

148
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,406
Holly!

149
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,082
Hop.

150
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,251
Hop!

151
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,169
Hop?

152
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,589
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

153
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,840
El.

154
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,384
How are you here?

155
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,768
Wait. Wait.

156
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,938
Wait. You gotta…

157
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,358
You gotta get out of here. It's not safe.

158
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,235
-There's--
-A Demogorgon.

159
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,904
I know. It's bleeding.

160
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,698
She must have hurt it.

161
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,866
What? Who?

162
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,410
Karen. With her wine.

163
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,120
What?

164
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,666
When I search for Holly,
I can't find her, but she must be close.

165
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,919
-Holly?
-We just need to find the blood.

166
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,212
Holly Wheeler? What are you…

167
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,591
El, wait! Goddamn it!

168
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,057
Whoa.

169
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,435
It's like everything went kablooey
all at once.

170
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,735
Has this kind of thing happened
with his visions before?

171
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,821
Where the lights go kooky
and electronics short-circuit?

172
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,323
No.

173
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,909
So this is just, like,
a fun, new development.

174
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,787
Aren't there any backup fuses
or something?

175
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,248
Yeah, in storage, I think so.
I mean, I hope so, right?

176
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,170
Oh! Uh… You'd like me to go get them?

177
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,463
-Yeah.
-Right.

178
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,675
Uh, of course. I am totally on it.

179
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,426
I… I'll be right back.

180
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,893
I know it's hard to talk about,

181
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,647
but these… these visions,

182
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,816
were they like before?

183
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,652
Like when you had your now memories?

184
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,702
Only more intense.

185
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,956
It's like I was there. I was right there.

186
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:45,254
It's… It's like I was the Demogorgon.

187
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:53,762
I was seeing what it was seeing
and thinking what it was thinking.

188
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,100
Do you have any idea
why it would go after the Wheelers,

189
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,393
take Holly?

190
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,770
I don't… I'm not sure. It's…

191
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:08,652
It's so hard to remember everything.
It's… It's almost like a dream.

192
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,363
This doesn't make any sense. I…

193
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:17,036
I… I must have somehow
tapped back into the hive mind.

194
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,746
But we severed the connection.

195
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:25,419
I don't think it was ever… truly severed.

196
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,216
Ever since he took me, it's like I… I was…

197
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,720
permanently changed.

198
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,436
These feelings of connection,
they come and go.

199
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,898
But that summer, after the gate opened,

200
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,526
I felt him again.

201
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,740
And it went away when I was in California.

202
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,701
But the day after I got back,

203
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,621
the feeling returned.

204
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,374
And now he's closer.

205
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,461
He's closer than ever before.

206
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,339
Maybe you're like a receiver.

207
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,551
You know, like a radio receiver,
just a magical human version.

208
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,930
-I… I don't follow.
-Okay.

209
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,685
Imagine that you have an antenna
coming up from the top of your head.

210
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,898
And Vecna, he uses
Mind Flayer particles like radio waves.

211
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,902
When the antenna is close to the waves,
the signal comes through clear as day.

212
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,612
But if you're too far away…

213
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,613
Static.

214
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,492
So maybe that's how we do it.

215
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,868
That's how we find Holly.

216
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,831
What, with your antenna?

217
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,334
Earlier, I had a vision
in the woods near the school.

218
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,754
I didn't understand it at the time,

219
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,924
but maybe I was seeing
through the Demogorgon's eyes then too.

220
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,342
And maybe if I go back there,

221
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,761
I can connect back to the hive mind,
to the signal.

222
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,679
Will.

223
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,849
-I've spied on Vecna before.
-And he took control of you.

224
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,809
-I know, but--
-You almost died.

225
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,853
And Holly will too
if we don't do something.

226
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,312
We are doing something.

227
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,564
Replacing fuses?

228
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,650
We've got to get the Squawk back up
so we can find Hopper.

229
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,986
Hopper, right.
This is about your boyfriend.

230
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,614
He's our only connection
to the Upside Down, to El.

231
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,700
How does that get us closer to Holly?

232
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,828
She's in there, Mom, all alone.
I know what that's like.

233
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,663
I won't just leave her there.

234
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,831
We're gonna get her back,

235
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,458
but we're not gonna risk your life
while doing it.

236
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,924
-Are you just gonna stand there?
-Right.

237
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,178
Uh, intimate family moment. Sorry.

238
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,180
Fuses, power. On it.

239
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,446
How long is this gonna take?

240
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,697
Not too long.

241
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,658
We just gotta let this sucker charge
for a few minutes, then hopefully…

242
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,452
vroom, vroom.

243
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,629
Bopper, while we wait?

244
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,759
Well, this better be quick.

245
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,887
Our good Samaritan's turning sour.
I think she might have placed me.

246
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,224
-Placed you?
-Stood up her sister. Multiple occasions.

247
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,183
Great.

248
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,518
Did you get a hold of Nance?

249
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,732
Dad's in an induced coma,
and Mom's in surgery.

250
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,110
They're not gonna know anything
for a couple hours.

251
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,988
Jesus Christ, man.

252
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,866
Yeah.

253
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,870
You think we should go see her
at the hospital?

254
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,207
I mean, if we can get
this hunk of junk moving.

255
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,291
Mmm…

256
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,086
No. No, we stick to the plan.

257
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,921
Search Zone G1.

258
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,716
-Find Hopper, find Eleven and find Holly.
-Right.

259
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,762
Just… That seems complicated.

260
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,599
Like, it might take a lot of time.

261
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,101
Okay.

262
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,061
You know, the hospital is on the way.

263
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,605
We could just swing by,

264
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,607
bring Nance, like, flowers or something.

265
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,858
Jesus Christ.

266
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,068
What?

267
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,696
I just thought that,
tonight of all nights,

268
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,489
you might just give it a rest.

269
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,782
Give what a rest?

270
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,702
This bullshit macho competition
for Nancy's attention.

271
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,246
-What are you talking about?
-What am I talking about?

272
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,998
-Yeah.
-Really?

273
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:35,335
Dude, ever since I got back from Lenora,
you are constantly showing off for her.

274
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,087
How you're better than me!

275
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,964
Which is shitty enough on a normal day,

276
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,301
but now her parents are fighting
for their lives, her sister is missing,

277
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,553
and all you can think about
is giving her flowers.

278
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,014
You selfish, chauvinistic meathead!

279
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,358
You know what, Byers?

280
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,277
You're totally right.

281
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,530
Me worrying about
my good friend, my friend,

282
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,615
that makes me the selfish one here.

283
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,828
Or maybe, just maybe,
you're the problem, dude.

284
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,204
Ever since you got back,

285
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,457
you've been acting
like a paranoid pothead weirdo.

286
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,544
And maybe if you stopped focusing on me
and started focusing on her,

287
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,963
maybe then the two of you
would finally be happy.

288
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,465
Because right now, the only one

289
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,925
who's more miserable
in that relationship than you…

290
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,761
is Nance.

291
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,657
You've got to be shitting me.

292
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,460
And you got there how, exactly?

293
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,544
Get where?

294
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,381
The Wheeler house.
Did you take the Henderson shelter?

295
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,174
No. Nancy drove me.

296
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,513
Nancy drove you?

297
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,765
Yes.

298
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,101
We don't drive ever, do we?

299
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,603
-Do we?
-No.

300
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,271
No, we take the tunnels,

301
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,066
and we don't surface until it's clear,
until it's safe.

302
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,150
I wore my hoodie.

303
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,069
Oh, well, geez, that's great.

304
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,155
I don't know why we've been
crawling around in the mud all this time.

305
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,324
We should've just drove you around
in your hoodie.

306
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,700
The tunnels are too slow.

307
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,202
Holly was in danger.

308
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,620
Yeah, and now so are you.

309
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,748
If those military guys haven't already
caught you on camera, they will.

310
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,666
And when they do,

311
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,752
they'll be coming for you
with everything they got.

312
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,088
Then we have to end this
before they find us.

313
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,048
Is that what this is about, ending this?

314
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,509
The Demogorgon can lead us to Vecna.

315
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,468
How?

316
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:52,222
When I searched for Holly,
I could not find her, just like Vecna.

317
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:57,477
So maybe wherever she is, he is,
where my powers cannot reach.

318
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,398
I'm sorry.
So your… your theory is what, exactly?

319
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:05,110
It's that the Demogorgon has taken
little Holly Wheeler to Vecna

320
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,529
as some kind of early Christmas present?

321
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:12,451
What does Vecna want with Holly Wheeler?
What… How does any of this make sense?

322
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,619
-I don't know!
-Exactly, you don't know.

323
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,165
Because you haven't put any thought
into anything you've been doing tonight.

324
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:23,295
You've been acting on impulse, on emotion,
everything I taught you not to do!

325
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,046
Goddamn it…

326
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,591
More blood than before.

327
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,968
It's slowing down.

328
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,554
We can still catch it.

329
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,474
And not emotion.

330
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,185
Instinct.

331
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,156
We don't know where Hop or El are,

332
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:55,285
or if they found each other or Holly,
or… or anything.

333
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,038
We're totally in the dark up here.

334
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,044
You don't wanna hurt me

335
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,923
I wish I… I had better news.

336
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,637
Hopefully my next update will be

337
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,266
something like El and Hop saved Holly,
and killed Vecna,

338
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,603
and everyone's back home
celebrating and everything.

339
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:27,150
But if I've learned anything
over the years…

340
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,404
it's never gonna be that easy.

341
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,244
El's amazing.

342
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:43,333
But she can't do this alone.
She's gonna need all the help she can get.

343
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,545
She's going to need the party,
the full party.

344
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,588
Which is why I'm here.

345
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,592
The final battle…

346
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,804
I feel like it started tonight.

347
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,893
And Max, we can't win this without you.

348
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,604
If my theory is right,
we're running out of time.

349
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:08,858
So if you're planning on resurrecting
anytime soon, now… now is the time.

350
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,574
Even a sign would be enough
to show me you're still in there.

351
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,162
Please, Max.

352
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,249
Please.

353
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,752
Wake up.

354
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,214
Just… something.

355
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,051
I miss you.

356
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:40,724
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darlin'

357
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:44,853
Let's exchange the experience

358
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,853
Okay, so, you're not gonna believe this,

359
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,689
but she still won't give us a timeline
on seeing Mom.

360
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,733
And… And I wasn't even asking to see Mom.

361
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,903
I was just asking to talk to the doctor,
and she just kept saying…

362
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,239
Mike. Mike, are you listening?

363
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,076
Yeah. Yeah, no. Uh…

364
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,245
I was thinking about
something Lucas said earlier,

365
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,124
about how he doesn't believe
in coincidences anymore, and…

366
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,002
Did Holly ever talk to you
about Mr. Whatsit?

367
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:55,715
Her… imaginary friend from the book?

368
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,719
Well, yeah, it's Mrs. Whatsit in the book.
So… So, this is her own creation.

369
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,012
At least that's what I thought.

370
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,056
When I went to pick her up
from school today,

371
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:07,018
she said that Mr. Whatsit told her
that there were monsters in Hawkins.

372
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,772
And he warned her that these monsters,
they were coming for her.

373
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,067
And on the same day,
she's actually taken by a monster?

374
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,404
I mean, as far as coincidences go,
that's a hell of a one.

375
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,490
And your theory is… what exactly?

376
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,535
What if Mr. Whatsit isn't a figment
of Holly's imagination?

377
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,497
-What if he's real?
-Real?

378
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,749
Yeah, what if?

379
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:34,629
It… It doesn't make sense.
How have we never seen him?

380
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,423
Maybe we have, and we just didn't know.

381
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,591
-So who the hell is he?
-I don't know.

382
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,386
-How does he know that Holly's in danger?
-I don't know.

383
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,139
If he was so worried,
then why wouldn't he warn us or Mom

384
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,432
or do something about it?

385
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,933
I don't know, Nance.

386
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,018
My theory, it has holes.

387
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,275
You were right
about what you said earlier.

388
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:59,237
We could have done more
to protect Mom and Dad and Holly, and…

389
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,991
I don't want to have any more regrets.

390
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,160
And maybe my theory is wrong.

391
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:10,039
But if it isn't, if Mr. Whatsit is real,
then he would know things.

392
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,460
Like why Holly was taken,
or… or maybe even--

393
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,295
Where she was taken.

394
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,760
And how do you propose
we go about finding out who this guy is?

395
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,970
I was kind of hoping you'd tell me.

396
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,973
You're the genius investigative reporter
after all.

397
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,934
That's not fair. Appealing to my ego.

398
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,405
Okay. I'm gonna need you
to talk to that receptionist

399
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,867
and do your best sad,
lost boy, puppy dog thing.

400
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,535
My what? Why?

401
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,747
Because she hates me, and you're cute,
and we're gonna need her help

402
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,042
if we want to get close to the one person
who knows about Mr. Whatsit,

403
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,668
Mom.

404
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,466
And by sheer luck,
Jessica was coming back from a party,

405
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,551
and I charmed my way
into getting us a jump.

406
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,889
Which brings us to you,
arriving looking like Rocky Balboa.

407
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:13,353
So basically, of all the crawls,
this was, like, the one to miss.

408
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:17,607
So, well done, Henderson.
Really, really, like, well done.

409
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,113
Speechless. That's new.

410
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,574
I'm still processing, Steve. It's a lot.

411
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,952
Holly?

412
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,662
Why Holly?

413
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,832
Well, maybe Eleven could tell us,
but it's a bit difficult to contact her

414
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,167
now that we've lost our connection
to the Upside Down.

415
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,921
Okay. For the future, when the lights go
from really bright to really dim,

416
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,841
it means the generator is surging
so you have to turn everything off.

417
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,300
-Wow. Great.
-Immediately.

418
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,428
Thank you. I'll remember that
the next time that happens.

419
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,891
Or, maybe, and this is just a suggestion,
you could be where you're supposed to be.

420
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,726
I was en route to the Squawk.

421
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,563
When you fell off your bike. That's right.

422
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,399
Remind me. What did you fall into again?
A knuckle sandwich?

423
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,484
Hey, can you keep it down up there?

424
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,654
I'm listening for a signal back here,
in case you forgot.

425
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,827
Who was it?
It was Andy and his goons, wasn't it?

426
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,871
You poked the bear one too many times.

427
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,873
Your concern for me
is overwhelming, Steve.

428
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,499
My concern?

429
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,836
I have shown nothing but concern for you
since forever,

430
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,547
and I have been repeatedly ignored,
and now look what's happened.

431
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,007
We are totally screwed.

432
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,050
Correction, we are screwed
because you don't know

433
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,012
how to do the most basic thing
like prevent a power surge.

434
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,599
-See, this right here is your problem.
-It's the easiest thing in the world.

435
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,059
-You can't admit you were wrong.
-My mother could prevent a surge.

436
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,353
-You can't admit it.
-Shockingly, I think your mother--

437
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,606
Jesus Christ! Just do it for once!

438
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,150
Just admit it, Henderson.
You're wrong! You screwed up!

439
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,153
Hey! Can you guys shut the hell up?

440
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,989
Jesus Christ.

441
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,244
You two seem to be getting along.

442
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,414
Yeah, well, in this case,
I actually like his suggestion.

443
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,084
-I don't wanna talk to you.
-I don't wanna talk to you either.

444
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,044
Good.

445
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,379
Good.

446
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,505
Good.

447
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,601
This is Dungeon Master
to Scout Battalion. Do you copy? Over.

448
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,313
This is Dungeon Master to Scout Battalion.

449
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,023
Do you copy? Over.

450
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:32,075
This is Dungeon Master to Scout Battalion.
Do you copy? Over.

451
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,662
Great Scott!

452
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,499
-How long has that light been red?
-Oh. I don't know.

453
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,418
Shit, shit, shit!
The flux capacitor is down again.

454
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,253
-Is that bad?
-I mean, it could be.

455
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,422
It's fixable, but it's a two-man job.

456
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,716
Come on.

457
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,552
We'll be right back.

458
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,015
Flux capacitor?

459
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,768
Shh! I was lying, obviously.
That light is always red.

460
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,561
Everything's totally fine, except…

461
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,605
-Whoa.
-Except for your mom's plan.

462
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,399
I mean, no offense to your mom,
but come on.

463
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,652
The boys have already circled Zone G1,
like, five times.

464
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,155
Even if they miraculously find Hopper,
where does that get us exactly?

465
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,950
I mean, Holly is still missing.

466
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,328
Whereas your plan is genius.

467
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,955
-You think so?
-Totally.

468
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,582
You got an antenna in your head, use it.

469
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,669
The Enigma machine won the war.
Knowledge is power.

470
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,296
-So…
-So… So, you want to…

471
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,798
Skip school, play hooky,

472
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,509
connect your brain into
an interdimensional monster's signal,

473
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,511
and save little Wheeler?

474
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,138
Yeah, kind of.

475
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,266
I mean, your mom is gonna be raging mad,

476
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,600
and she's probably right.

477
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,060
It is super dangerous, but…

478
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,146
Isn't everything we do super dangerous?

479
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,232
Precisely. So what do you say?

480
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,903
This is Dungeon Master to Scout Battalion.

481
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,946
Screw it.

482
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,875
When were these taken?

483
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,418
Three hours ago, give or take.

484
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,670
We've had sightings before.

485
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,049
-Yes, but this time is different.
-Different.

486
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,886
Don't interrupt me again
until you have her in custody.

487
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,764
She's here, Dr. Kay.

488
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,809
What do you mean, "here"?

489
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,988
Hey, come on. Slow down. Hang on.

490
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,324
I found more blood. It must be close.

491
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,660
Oh, you goddamn stubborn punk-ass…

492
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,248
What are you doing?

493
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,416
We're gonna lose her.

494
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,252
It's just a cramp. It's just old age.
Just give me a second.

495
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,254
-Hey.
-No, hey. Hey! Ahh!

496
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,717
Looks worse than it is.

497
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,267
Where did you learn to do this?

498
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,352
Max.

499
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,939
First clean, then disinfect, then bandage.

500
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,070
-Stop moving.
-Yeah, well, it stings. It stings!

501
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,905
That means it's working.

502
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,117
You're more like me
than I'd like to admit.

503
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,786
What, a stubborn punk-ass?

504
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,329
You heard that?

505
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,456
You talk loud.

506
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,628
Yeah, I guess I am a stubborn punk-ass.

507
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,297
Or at least I was.

508
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,175
I never listened to my pops either.

509
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,886
Always thought I knew best.

510
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,179
Pissed him right off.

511
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,309
I remember one day it got so heated,
he took me to the recruitment office.

512
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,228
He made me enlist right there.

513
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:51,190
He thought the Army would do me some good.
Give me some structure, discipline.

514
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,320
The thing was,
I thought I was smarter than the officers.

515
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,489
Were you?

516
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,824
Sometimes.

517
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,327
But mostly, no, I was just dumb.

518
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,996
Naive.

519
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,416
I used to trust my gut and my instinct.

520
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,586
Never… Like you.

521
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,924
Did a lot of crazy things in that war.
Reckless things.

522
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,177
You might call them brave,

523
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,763
but there's a fine line
between bravery and stupidity.

524
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,850
Saw a lot of brave men die in that war.

525
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,311
Friends of mine.

526
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,230
My daughter…

527
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,357
Sara.

528
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,526
She was brave.

529
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,620
Bravest person I ever knew.

530
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,250
She stared death in the face.
She never got scared. She never wavered.

531
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,711
Fought her heart out.

532
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,839
The doctors said
they never saw anything like it.

533
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,676
They thought she was gonna make it too.

534
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,695
So, that's why you don't want me in here?

535
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,075
Because you think Vecna will win,

536
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,243
and I will die?

537
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,327
I don't think…

538
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,288
I don't think anything. I've just…

539
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,669
Just been around long enough to know that…

540
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,382
you can't count on anything in this life.

541
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,847
I don't want to lose you.

542
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,477
I won't.

543
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,815
Which is why whatever happens
from here on out,

544
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,650
wherever this blood leads,

545
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,652
I need you to do what I say.

546
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,281
So don't be a stubborn punk-ass like you?

547
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,158
Yeah, don't be a stubborn punk-ass.

548
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,006
Hey, hey, hey!

549
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,091
I lead.

550
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:44,071
So sorry to disturb you, Doctor,
but it's the Wheeler children.

551
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,324
What about them?

552
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,701
They say they need to speak to you.
They say it's--

553
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,785
An emergency!

554
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,995
What kind of emergency?

555
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,456
Our… Our sister,
she's missing, as you know.

556
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,333
I understand. And I'm very sorry.

557
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,376
Well, we think our mom has something.

558
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,669
Or knows something.

559
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,504
About our sister,
about finding our sister.

560
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,840
And I wish I could get you in to see her.

561
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,927
But your mother's recovering from surgery.
Her system is still in shock.

562
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,389
And beyond that,
her larynx is extremely damaged.

563
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,351
She wouldn't be able to talk,
even if she were awake.

564
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,853
Right, but even so--

565
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,146
Listen to me.

566
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,775
Finding your mother
when you did saved her life.

567
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,109
Let's not risk it now.

568
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,695
All right, sweetheart.

569
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:29,909
What now?

570
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,539
So we need to change sheets in 307.

571
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,460
Rooms 202 and 203 are vacant.
And they need mopping.

572
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,337
Denise needs help later…

573
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,340
-What?
-Come on.

574
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,175
-What are we doing?
-Ignoring doctor's orders.

575
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,719
-He said it's too risky.
-When has that stopped us before?

576
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,598
Besides, did you smell his breath?

577
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,475
I don't trust doctors who smoke…

578
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,435
or call me "sweetheart."

579
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:15,121
Hey, man, I'm gonna turn on Irwin.
One more loop around the zone?

580
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,957
Yeah. Go ahead.

581
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,423
No, wait. Scratch that.

582
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,258
I think I got something.

583
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,135
-Seriously?
-Is it Hop?

584
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,471
Yeah, I… I don't know.
I'm not getting a hit on the decoder,

585
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,098
but I can hear something.

586
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,725
Yeah, I definitely hear something.

587
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,278
Is that him?

588
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,321
Yo, dude!

589
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,908
Yeah, uh, we're not sure.

590
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,621
-No, it's not Hop.
-What? Then what the hell is it?

591
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,874
I don't know.
It could be a million things.

592
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,669
Military broadcast, TV channel,
any EMI within our frequency zone.

593
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,088
I do know it's not Hop's telemetry tag,

594
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,425
because if it was,
it would show up on the decoder.

595
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,802
So… search continues.

596
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,517
Hey, Mom, um, disregard.
It's a false alarm.

597
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,062
Jonathan, is your receiver
in any way connected

598
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,814
to the flux capacitor?

599
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,903
Uh, sorry, Mom.
Can, uh… Can you repeat that?

600
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,279
The flux capacitor.

601
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,697
Robin said it was down,

602
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,741
but she and Will are working on it.

603
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,076
I wanted to make sure
it wasn't messing with your connection.

604
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,121
Hello?

605
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,500
Hello?

606
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,144
You know, we can still turn back
if you want.

607
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,981
I'm more scared of my mom at this point,
to be honest.

608
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,233
Fair.

609
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,994
Is this where it happened?

610
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,957
Where you had your vision?

611
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,878
Yeah. Right here.

612
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,092
Are you… feeling anything?

613
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,594
No.

614
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,181
What…

615
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,395
So, what are we doing now, exactly?

616
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:48,524
If your theory's right,
and my receiver is proximity-based,

617
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,819
I need to get close to the Demo
to tap into the hive mind.

618
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,656
And maybe, earlier,
when the Demo was passing by,

619
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,075
it was headed for its monster lair.

620
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,785
Right. Monster lair.

621
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,329
We're already here.
Might as well push our luck.

622
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,507
I've been meaning to ask you,
were you at the hospital yesterday?

623
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,633
The hospital?

624
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,677
No. No, no, no.

625
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,307
Weird. I could have sworn
I saw you there, but…

626
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,392
Vickie, she's a candy striper…

627
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,810
-Oh yeah.
-She's my friend.

628
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,438
We're friends. Good friends. But, uh…

629
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,650
The thing is, some people
might not understand our friendship.

630
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,113
Basically, what I'm trying to say is
if you were there and did see something,

631
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:39,533
it might just be better if,
uh, nobody knew,

632
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,368
if it stayed between us.

633
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,703
I didn't see anything.

634
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,290
Sorry. It's just
I tend to be off-topic when I'm nervous,

635
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,959
and you said that thing
about monster lair, and I thought,

636
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,087
"What if your mom was right,
and you get kidnapped by Vecna, and…"

637
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,380
Holy shit.

638
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,216
What… Where are you going?

639
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,678
It's a mandala. Did you do this,
Mrs. Harris's class, fifth grade?

640
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,307
So cool. Though, come to think of it,
it's not even really a mandala.

641
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,352
I mean, it's just a spiral.
Mandalas are usually concentric circles

642
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,437
but it's the thought that counts.

643
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,022
Speaking of the thought that counts,

644
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:14,777
is it a mandala,
or a mandah-la, or a man-dala?

645
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,823
-I heard laughter.
-What?

646
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,034
In my vision.

647
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,245
Kids laughing, playing.

648
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,127
What does that have to do
with a monster lair? Will!

649
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,772
That's not a Demogorgon.

650
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,274
Stay close to me.

651
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,703
Hop?

652
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,958
Jesus Christ.

653
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,546
What is it?

654
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,404
Holly was here.

655
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,825
Right here.

656
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,914
Maybe that's why
I can't find her in my mind.

657
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,168
It took her…

658
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,337
through the wall.

659
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,836
Incoming, incoming.

660
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,714
-Limp or something.
-What?

661
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,757
Limp!

662
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,802
…to New England?

663
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,720
Oh, it is amazing.

664
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,971
Don't look back.

665
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,558
-What kind of limp is that?
-It's a limp, a regular limp.

666
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,476
Whoa.

667
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,411
Hi, Mom.

668
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,374
Mom, can you hear us, Mom?

669
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,087
Mom?

670
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,256
Can you hear me?

671
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,592
Mom.

672
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:31,932
Hi.

673
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,226
Hi there.

674
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,769
Hi, Mom.

675
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,271
Hey, Mom.

676
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,232
Don't try to talk.

677
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,277
It's your throat. It's gonna be okay.
It needs time to heal.

678
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,361
Yeah.

679
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,116
But could you… could you maybe write?

680
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,245
Yeah? Okay.

681
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,329
Okay.

682
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,515
"Holly?"

683
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,143
Yeah, that's, um…

684
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,729
That is why we're here, Mom.

685
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,564
Holly's…

686
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,776
She's missing.

687
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,615
Hey, we're gonna get her back.

688
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,033
We just need your help.

689
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,619
We think there's someone
that knows where Holly is,

690
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,829
who knows why she was taken
and where she is.

691
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,831
We just don't know where he is.

692
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,459
And so, we're hoping that you might.

693
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,385
"Who?"

694
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,970
Um…

695
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:58,268
We don't know his name, but Holly, she…

696
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,773
she calls him Mr. Whatsit.

697
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:17,829
Come on.

698
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,999
I don't understand.
What exactly are we doing here?

699
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,585
We're looking for this.

700
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,884
"Teacher saw talking to W."

701
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,719
"W" as in "Whatsit"?

702
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,223
"Nobody…"

703
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,143
"…there."

704
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,230
In my vision earlier,
the sky was spinning.

705
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,692
So, I think I was here,

706
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,903
right here on this merry-go-round
during Ms. Harris's recess.

707
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,239
Blast off!

708
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,865
Derek, stop!

709
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,368
Stop, Derek! Get off! Go away!

710
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,205
I don't understand. I thought you were
seeing through the Demogorgon.

711
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,123
I know. So did I.

712
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,750
But you said yourself
Vecna controls the hive mind,

713
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,337
which means he's a part of it too.
So, when he searches for his victims…

714
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,881
-He invades their minds.
-He sees what they see.

715
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,677
Did Holly ever describe
Mr. Whatsit to you?

716
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,348
Like, maybe what he's wearing
or anything like that?

717
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,269
Holly, time for breakfast.

718
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,188
"Pocket watch."

719
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,734
"Tall. Vest."

720
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,361
Okay, he wears a vest.

721
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:35,365
Uh, he's gentle and kind.

722
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:40,787
So, what if I was seeing
through the eyes of Vecna's next victim,

723
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,416
this victim he's stalking,
which means I was seeing through--

724
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,584
Holly's eyes.

725
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,170
But if that's true, it would mean…

726
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,296
I was him.

727
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,506
I was Vecna.

728
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,304
Did Holly ever say if he has a first name?

729
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,227
Are the others here yet?

730
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:06,897
No, not yet.

731
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:12,778
You will save them, too, won't you?
Save them from the monsters?

732
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:18,658
Yes, Holly. Don't you worry.
I'm going to save your friends.

733
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,205
Every last one of them.

734
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,628
And my family?

735
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,380
Are they coming too?

736
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,015
Your friends first.

737
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,477
Then after, I'll save your family too,
of course.

738
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,022
I have room for everyone here.

739
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,339
Mr. Sandman

740
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,466
Bring me a dream

741
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:21,388
Make him the cutest
That I've ever seen

742
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:26,017
Give him two lips
Like roses and clover

743
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,771
Then tell him that
His lonesome nights are over

744
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,231
Sandman

745
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,776
I'm so alone

746
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,988
Don't have nobody to call my own

747
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,576
Please turn on your magic beam

748
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:46,121
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

749
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:09,227
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

750
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:13,315
Make him the cutest
That I've ever seen

751
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:17,319
Give him the word that I'm not a rover

752
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:21,198
Then tell him that
His lonesome nights are over

753
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:25,410
Sandman, I'm so alone

754
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:29,497
Don't have nobody to call my own

755
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,500
Please turn on your magic beam

756
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:36,713
Ah, Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

757
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,686
Mr. Sandman

758
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,812
Yes?

759
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,397
Bring us a dream

760
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:58,693
Give him a pair of eyes
With a come-hither gleam

761
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:03,865
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci

762
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:07,744
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

763
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,624
-Mr. Sandman, someone to hold
-Someone to hold

764
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:16,086
Would be so peachy
Before we're too old

765
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:20,423
So please turn on your magic beam

766
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:24,386
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

767
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,810
Mr. Sandman, bring us

768
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,603
Please, please, please

769
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,231
Mr. Sandman

770
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:42,404
Bring us a dream
