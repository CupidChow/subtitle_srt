1
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,150
Mike?

2
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,200
Mike?

3
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,900
Mike? Mike!

4
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,820
Mike!

5
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,150
Mike!

6
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,350
Bravo team, check in.

7
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,260
What about the Russians? What\Nif they come looking for her?

8
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,510
They don't know where she is.

9
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,590
And she can't contact\Nyou without us knowing.

10
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,970
The most important thing is for\Nyou to try to go on with your lives

11
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,110
- and to keep all of this...\N- Top secret. Yeah.

12
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,170
Understood. We're all\Npatriots in this house.

13
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,990
- Go back to the beginning.\N- I told you everything.

14
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,910
- I understand this is difficult, Michael.\N- I don't know where she is.

15
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,910
And even if I did, I'd never tell you.

16
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,660
I would never tell you.

17
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,960
I know it's difficult to accept,

18
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,240
the stories she told you were not true.

19
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,760
She's a very dangerous individual.

20
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,170
If she contacts you, you must tell us.

21
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,590
Otherwise, you're putting yourself\Nand your entire family at risk.

22
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,890
Do you understand,\NMichael? Do you understand?

23
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
Michael?

24
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,740
Michael?

25
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,740
Fan out.

26
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,070
Somebody check the left side,\NI'll check the right side.

27
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,430
Oh, Jesus!

28
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,900
Ghost.

29
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,730
Yeah, I see that.

30
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,360
- Halloween.\N- Sure is.

31
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,310
But right now, it's breakfast,\Nokay? Come on, let's eat.

32
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,750
They wouldn't see me.

33
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,410
- Who wouldn't see you?\N- The bad men.

34
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,860
What are you talking about?

35
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,750
Trick or treat.

36
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,910
You want to go\Ntrick-or-treating?

37
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,000
You know the rules.

38
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,880
- Yes, but...\N- Yeah, so you know the answer.

39
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,660
- No, but they wouldn't see me.\N- No. Hey. I don't care.

40
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,130
- But they wouldn't see me.\N- I don't care, all right?

41
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,150
You go out there, ghost\Nor not, it's a risk.

42
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,510
We don't take risks. All right?

43
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,160
They're stupid, and...

44
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,830
We're not stupid!

45
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,900
Exactly.

46
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,380
Now, you take that off, sit down\Nand eat. Your food's getting cold.

47
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,480
All right, look...

48
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,330
How about I get off early tonight,\Nand I buy us a bunch of candy,

49
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,530
and we can sit around and get fat,\Nand we watch a scary movie together?

50
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,910
How's that for a compromise?

51
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,830
"Compromise"?

52
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,830
C-O-M-promise. Compromise.

53
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,680
How about that's your\Nword for the day? Yeah?

54
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,780
It's something that's kinda\Nin-between. It's like halfway happy.

55
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,830
By 5-1-5?

56
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,300
5:15. Yeah, sure.

57
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,450
Promise?

58
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,400
Yes.

59
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,800
I promise.

60
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,200
Halfway happy.

61
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Will?

62
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,050
Come on, honey, up and at 'em.

63
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,800
Will?

64
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,500
- Jonathan?\N- Yeah?

65
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,800
Where's Will?

66
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,050
- What?\N- Where's Will?

67
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,600
- He's not in his room?\N- No.

68
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,100
Uh...

69
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,300
Will?

70
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,900
What are you doing?

71
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,000
Peeing?

72
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,100
Okay.

73
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,250
Okay.

74
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,300
Let's get this... on.

75
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,250
Oh!

76
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,950
You need some tape. Hold on.

77
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,700
What's this?

78
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,800
Nothing.

79
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,500
Did you have another episode?

80
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
No, it's just, um... a sketch\Nfor a story I'm writing.

81
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,450
All right.

82
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,350
Three, two, one...

83
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,950
Great. Hold up the proton blaster.

84
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,150
All right, now turn to the light.

85
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,600
Oh! I want to see those pearls. Yeah!

86
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,250
Who you gonna call?

87
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,150
Oh!

88
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,780
Adorable, baby. Just adorable!

89
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,080
- God. You are such a nerd.\N- Shut up.

90
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,400
No wonder you only hang out with boys.

91
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,600
- Erica!\N- Just the facts.

92
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,080
Nerd.

93
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,330
My God, I love this costume. Keep it up.

94
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,350
All right, that's the last one.

95
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,430
No, just one more. Come on, please?

96
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,650
Ah!

97
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,200
- Can I go to school?\N- Wait, wait.

98
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,130
- Okay, say, "Who you gonna call?"\N- No!

99
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,050
- ♪ Who you gonna call?  ♪\N- ♪ Ghostbusters! ♪

100
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,250
Hey, Spengler!

101
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,050
- Egon! Yeah!\N- Venkman!

102
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,530
Whoa! Whoa!

103
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,130
- What?\N- Why are you Venkman?

104
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,100
- Because I'm Venkman.\N- No, I'm Venkman.

105
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,830
Why can't there be two Venkmans?

106
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,180
Because there's only one Venkman in\Nreal life. We planned this months ago.

107
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,580
I'm Venkman, Dustin's Stantz,\Nyou're Egon, and you're Winston.

108
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,420
- I specifically didn't agree to Winston.\N- Yes, you did!

109
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,000
- I don't think he did.\N- No one wants to be Winston, man.

110
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,420
What's wrong with Winston?

111
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,420
What's wrong with Winston?\NHe joined the team super late,

112
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,550
he's not funny, and he's\Nnot even a scientist!

113
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,720
- Yeah, but he's still cool.\N- If he's cool, then you be Winston.

114
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,020
- I can't!\N- Why not?

115
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,520
- Because...\N- Because you're not black?

116
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,320
- I didn't say that!\N- You thought it.

117
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,230
- I didn't say that!\N- Mike!

118
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,150
Guys... Guys! Guys!

119
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,530
Why is no one else wearing costumes?

120
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,200
Crap.

121
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,080
Oh, my God!

122
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,280
When do people make these decisions?

123
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,220
Everyone dressed up last year.

124
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,470
- It's a conspiracy, I'm telling you.\N- Just be cool.

125
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,770
Who you gonna call? The nerds!

126
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,480
- We gonna do this?\N- Not right now. We look like morons.

127
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,100
Maybe she likes Ghostbusters?

128
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,730
Of course she likes Ghostbusters,\Nbut that's not the point.

129
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,270
The point is we're\Ndressed up and she isn't.

130
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,120
I didn't bring regular clothes. You?

131
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,070
No.

132
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,950
Then we have no choice. We\Ngotta do this. It's now or never.

133
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,120
- Right.\N- Let's engage.

134
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,970
We could ask her after class.

135
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,130
- Yup.\N- Okay.

136
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,550
See? It's an exact match.

137
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,300
- But... why would he lie to me?\N- He's a kid, Joyce.

138
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,770
I mean, you heard him\Ndescribe these episodes.

139
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,230
It's not like he's\Ndescribing a nightmare.

140
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,830
He talks about them like they're real.

141
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,180
Yeah, because they're not\Nnightmares, they're flashbacks.

142
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,870
I know a couple guys who\Nhave had these things,

143
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,820
and it feels like you're\Nthere, like it's happening.

144
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,030
- Then what the hell is this?\N- Owens said it would get worse.

145
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,620
- That place...\N- What do you wanna do?

146
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,250
You wanna take him back to Chicago?

147
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,330
Well, there's that guy in\NBoston that's supposed to be...

148
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,750
They're all a bunch of quacks.

149
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,380
They'll all tell you the same\Nthing, just cost you more money.

150
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,030
I think he's right... about trauma.

151
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,300
And we're coming up on a year, you know.

152
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,100
I think everybody's on edge.\NMe, you... Will most of all.

153
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,630
I think we just gotta get\Nthrough the next few weeks.

154
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,370
Nothing's gonna go back\Nto the way that it was.

155
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,930
Not really.

156
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,320
But it'll get better.

157
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,480
In time.

158
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,830
- Here.\N- Thank you.

159
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,130
Jesus! Hopper...

160
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,270
Brings me back to old times.

161
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,300
What?

162
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,800
- Sharing my cigarettes between...\N- Fifth and sixth period.

163
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,970
Yeah, under the steps.

164
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,180
Mr. Cooper caught us\Nthat time, remember?

165
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,680
He was like, "Hey, assholes."

166
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,620
We ran. We just ran.

167
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,550
God, I want this to be over.

168
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,500
I know.

169
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,370
How's it looking out there, cowboy?

170
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,120
Uh, you know, Doc. The usual.

171
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,820
Nice and nasty with a\Nchance of radioactivity.

172
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,270
Oh, yeah, it's barbecued\Nall right. Anyone hungry?

173
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
And...

174
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,070
we're back on!

175
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,120
There was this storm.

176
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,620
Okay. So how did you feel\Nwhen you saw the storm?

177
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,170
I felt frozen.

178
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,520
Actually frozen? Cold?

179
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,020
No, like how you feel\Nwhen you're scared,

180
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,120
and you can't breathe\Nor talk or do anything.

181
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,220
I felt... I felt this evil...

182
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,720
Nancy, this isn't you.

183
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,070
Barb, just go ahead and go home, okay?

184
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,420
Nancy?

185
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,420
Nancy!

186
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,370
Nancy.

187
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,170
What's going on? Are you okay?

188
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,470
- I can't keep doing this.\N- Doing what?

189
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,820
- Pretending like everything's okay.\N- What are you talking about?

190
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,770
Barbara.

191
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,950
It's like everyone forgot.

192
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,820
It's like nobody cares.\NExcept her parents.

193
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
- And now they're selling their house.\N- Nance...

194
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,000
And they're going to spend the\Nrest of their lives looking for her.

195
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,450
- I know.\N- It's destroying them.

196
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,550
I know. Okay? I get it. But listen,\Nthere's nothing we can do about it.

197
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,250
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.

198
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,100
Well, you know that we can't do that.

199
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,120
We don't have to tell them everything.

200
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,850
This isn't some game, Nance. If\Nthey found out that we told any...

201
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,350
They could put us in jail. Okay?

202
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,350
Or worse, they could\Ndestroy our families.

203
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,750
They could do anything they want. Okay?

204
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,700
Just think about what you're saying.

205
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,420
Hey...

206
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,550
Hey, hey...

207
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,050
Hey, it's...

208
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,470
It's hard, but let's...

209
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,300
let's just go to Tina's stupid party...

210
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,990
wear our stupid costumes

211
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,940
that we've been working on\Nfor a stupid amount of time,

212
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,100
and just pretend like we're\Nstupid teenagers, okay?

213
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,990
Can we just do that, just for tonight?

214
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,150
Okay.

215
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,570
Come here.

216
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
Um...

217
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,800
Hi, Max. I'm Dustin, and this is...

218
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,470
- Lucas.\N- Yeah, I know.

219
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,550
The stalkers.

220
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,990
Uh, no. Actually...

221
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,150
We weren't stalking you.

222
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,070
No, we were just concerned because,\Nyou know, you're new and all.

223
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,540
Yeah, for your safety.

224
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,450
Mmm-hmm. There are a lot of bullies here.

225
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,540
- So many bullies, it's crazy.\N- Yeah.

226
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,720
Is that why you're wearing proton packs?

227
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, these don't function. But...

228
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,970
I do have this handy-dandy\Nlittle trap here.

229
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,300
And look, it even opens and\Ncloses. Look, look, look...

230
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,140
VoilÃ !

231
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,250
It's cool, right?

232
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,390
No? Okay. But, um...

233
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,720
So, we were talking last\Nnight, and you're new here,

234
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,550
so you probably don't have any\Nfriends to take you trick-or-treating,

235
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,690
and you're scared of\Nbullies, so we were thinking

236
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,990
that it would be okay\Nif you come with us.

237
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,240
- "It'd be okay"?\N- Yeah. Our party's a democracy,

238
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,650
the majority voted you could come.

239
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,400
Didn't realize it was such an honor\Nto go trick-or-treating with you.

240
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
We know where to get the\Nfull-sized candy bars.

241
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,820
We figured you'd want in.

242
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,400
That's presumptuous of you.

243
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,590
Yeah. Totally. Uh,\Nso, um... you'll come?

244
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,890
We're meeting at the Maple\NStreet cul-de-sac at 7:00.

245
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,300
That's 7:00 on the dot!

246
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,550
"Presumptuous."

247
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,940
That's a good thing, right?

248
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,490
Is it bad?

249
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,020
Lucas, is it bad? Lucas? Son\Nof a bitch, Lucas. Is it bad?

250
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,820
How does it feel? Like\Npouring pure silk onto my skin.

251
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,150
Inhuman. Relentless.

252
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,120
Arnold Schwarzenegger is... The Term...

253
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,590
Well, I'm stunned. I\Ndon't know what to think.

254
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,000
- Don't you love me?\N- Of course I love you.

255
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,690
It's just that it's so sudden.\NI mean, it's not like you.

256
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,500
Erica, I am this way because of you.

257
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,920
- Me?\N- "Me?"

258
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,890
Mmm-hmm.

259
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,440
You have made me wild and impetuous,

260
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
- just like you.\N- "Impetuous."

261
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,390
People are going to be aghast.

262
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,270
- "People are going to be aghast."\N- They're gonna love it.

263
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,600
I mean, it's gonna stun the\Nwhole town. The whole world!

264
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,350
Erica, tell me that you will\Nmarry me, in this house, tonight...

265
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,490
Hey.

266
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,590
I'm not gonna hurt you.

267
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,390
What's your name?

268
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,540
What're you doing out here in the cold?

269
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,440
So, you're telling me that\NMerrill poisoned your farm,

270
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,440
because he thinks you poisoned\Nhis, which, of course, you didn't?

271
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,490
No, sir. And I got me an\Nalibi the night he accuses me.

272
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,240
My Jenny and her boys were in\Ntown. I was with them all night.

273
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,140
- Did you actually see Merrill?\N- No need. That man done lost his mind.

274
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,890
Went around slandering me,\Nthreatening all sorts of madness.

275
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,390
A pumpkin conspiracy.

276
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,040
Hawkins' very own Chinatown.

277
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,440
Merrill threatening to do something\Nand him actually doing something

278
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,740
are two very different things.

279
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,890
- You got a better explanation?\N- Cold weather.

280
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,090
- It's October.\N- Yeah, it's a cold one.

281
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,440
- You see these hands?\N- Yeah.

282
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,390
- You know why they look like that?\N- Because you're old?

283
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,940
You're damn straight.

284
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,790
And I've been doing this a\Nlong time, Chief. A long time.

285
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,190
And I ain't never seen\Nanything the likes of this.

286
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,940
- None of us have.\N- None of us?

287
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,340
Merrill didn't just hit me last\Nnight. He hit damn near everyone.

288
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,590
What are you talking about?

289
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,390
Jack O'Dell, Pete Freeling,\NRick Neary, the Christensens.

290
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,220
All of their crops, dead.

291
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,520
Give me those names again.

292
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,320
You're late again.

293
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,670
- Yeah, I had to get catch-up homework.\N- Jesus. I don't care.

294
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,740
You're late again, and\Nyou're skating home.

295
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
Do you hear me?

296
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,720
God, this place is such a shithole.

297
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,440
- It's not that bad.\N- No?

298
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,570
Mmm!

299
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,960
You smell that, Max?\NThat's actually shit.

300
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,970
- Cow shit.\N- I don't see any cows.

301
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,020
Clearly, you haven't met\Nthe high-school girls.

302
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,870
- So what, you like it here now?\N- No.

303
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,090
- Then why are you defending it?\N- I'm not.

304
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,310
Sure sounds like it.

305
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,560
- It's just we're stuck here, so...\N- Hmm.

306
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,890
You're right. We're stuck here.

307
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,940
And whose fault is that?

308
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,960
Yours.

309
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,610
- What'd you say?\N- Nothing.

310
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
- Did you say it's my fault?\N- No.

311
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,960
You know whose fault it is.

312
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,710
Say it.

313
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,240
Max...

314
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,010
say it.

315
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,290
Say it!

316
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,590
Really, everyone dressed up last year.

317
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,060
Billy, slow down.

318
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,510
- Oh, these your new hick friends?\N- No! I don't know them.

319
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,410
I guess you won't care\Nif I hit 'em, then?

320
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,470
I get bonus points, I\Nget 'em all in one go?

321
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,010
No, Billy, stop. It's not funny.

322
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,410
Hey, guys?

323
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,410
Billy, come on, stop\Nit. It's not funny. Stop!

324
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,570
- Go!\N- Mike, you need to haul ass!

325
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,570
Billy, stop it!

326
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,210
Whoa! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

327
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,910
Yeah! That was a close one, huh?

328
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,070
Holy shit!

329
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,920
Was that...

330
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,170
Mad Max.

331
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:37,360
Now, you tryin' to tell me, with\Na straight face, cold did this?

332
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,340
How far does it go?

333
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,110
Hey, Chief, you copy?

334
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,410
Uh...

335
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,440
Hey, Chief.

336
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,190
How's it looking over there?

337
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,440
Like a giant pissed all\Nover Jack's bean field.

338
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,160
Smells, too. It smell over there?

339
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,860
Uh, yeah, little bit.

340
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,870
Smells like a nursing home, man.

341
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,490
Listen. I want you guys to track\Nthe rot, see how far it goes.

342
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,070
Just, uh, mark anything that's dead.

343
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,790
- That's gonna take some time.\N- So take it.

344
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,460
And, look, we don't know what\Ncaused this. Could be poison.

345
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,370
So don't touch anything without gloves.

346
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,090
Copy that, Chief.

347
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,810
You got any marking flags?

348
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,340
So you hit "T" to zoom\Nin, and "W" zooms back out.

349
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,540
See? Easy-peasy.

350
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,220
Just make sure to turn off\Nthe power to save energy there.

351
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,770
Listen. Stay close\Nto your brother, okay?

352
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,540
And listen, listen, listen...

353
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,290
If you get a bad feeling or anything,

354
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,090
you tell him to take you straight home.

355
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,840
- You promise?\N- Okay.

356
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,320
- Are you ready, bud?\N- Yeah.

357
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,740
Be safe.

358
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,190
I hope it doesn't suck!

359
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,870
I just don't get what she sees in him.

360
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,340
What?

361
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,440
Bob.

362
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,940
At least he doesn't treat me different.

363
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,120
I mean, I can't even go\Ntrick-or-treating by myself. It's lame.

364
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,490
What? You think I'm lame?

365
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:40,790
No, but it's not like Nancy's\Ncoming to watch over Mike, you know?

366
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,510
Will! Hey!

367
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,860
Hey, don't cross the streams.\NDon't cross the streams!

368
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,210
Hey, listen.

369
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,460
Yeah?

370
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,860
If I let you go on your own, you\Npromise to stay in the neighborhood?

371
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,710
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, totally.\N- And be back at Mike's by 9:00.

372
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,060
- 9:30?\N- 9:00.

373
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,010
- Yeah.\N- Deal?

374
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,210
- Yeah, deal.\N- All right.

375
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,410
Hey, Will. Don't let any of your\Nspazzy friends use this, all right?

376
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,410
Okay.

377
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,510
I hope it doesn't suck.

378
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,710
Will!

379
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,060
- Egon!\N- Yeah! You ready for tonight, man?

380
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,910
Awesome!

381
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,160
...thirty-eight, thirty-nine,\Nforty, forty-one, forty-two!

382
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,710
- Yeah!\N- Forty-two!

383
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,110
We got ourselves a new Keg King!

384
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,510
- Billy! Billy! Billy!\N- That's how you do it, Hawkins!

385
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,860
Billy! Billy! Billy!

386
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,710
We got ourselves a new\NKeg King, Harrington.

387
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,460
- Yeah, that's right!\N- Yeah. Eat it, Harrington.

388
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,940
What's in this?

389
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,240
Pure fuel! Pure fuel!

390
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,490
Whoo!

391
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,440
Hey... Whoa, whoa! Hey...\NWhoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy.

392
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,490
Take it easy. Nance, Nance, Nance...

393
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,960
We're just being stupid teenagers\Nfor the night. Wasn't that the deal?

394
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,960
Yeah.

395
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,240
- No. No, no.\N- Come on. Yes.

396
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,430
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Come on.\N- No. No. No.

397
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,180
Oh, there it is.

398
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,480
You playing Frankenstein to my Dracula?

399
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,530
- Come on, you're stiff as a board. Relax.\N- I'm sorry. It's...

400
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,310
He's fine. Okay? Jonathan's with him.

401
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,480
I know.

402
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,280
It's just every time he's away\Nfrom me, it's like I can't function.

403
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:08,410
- I know it sounds silly.\N- No, it's not silly. It's not silly.

404
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:16,430
What if we were to move\Nout of Hawkins... together?

405
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,630
- What?\N- I know.

406
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,480
Whoa, Nellie, right? No, I just...

407
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,640
I've been thinking about what you said.

408
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,430
About how we've got\Nall these memories here,

409
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,510
and you wish you had\Nenough money to move.

410
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,230
Well, my parents are\Nselling their house in Maine.

411
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,140
There's a RadioShack nearby.\NI'm sure they'd take me on.

412
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,190
We could just...

413
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,830
- My turn to be silly now.\N- Bob...

414
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,660
No, it's fine. Wine makes me crazy.

415
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,330
Oh, it's just so hard to explain.

416
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,540
It's just this... This\Nis not a normal family.

417
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,240
It could be.

418
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,460
It could be.

419
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,060
Finally.

420
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,690
Huh?

421
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,090
Victims.

422
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,910
Trick or treat!

423
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,490
Oh!

424
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,880
Well, aren't you cute?\NThe little exterminators.

425
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,690
If I get another 3 Musketeers,\NI'm gonna kill myself.

426
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,740
- What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?\N- "What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?"

427
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,180
- No one likes 3 Musketeers.\N- Yeah, it's just nougat.

428
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,680
Whoa. "Just nougat"?

429
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,130
Just nougat? It is top three for me.

430
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,790
- Top three?\N- Top three!

431
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,180
Oh, God. Give me a break.

432
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,790
Seriously, I can just eat a\Nwhole bowl of nougat. Straight up.

433
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,930
Holy shit! You should have\Nseen the look on your faces.

434
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,610
And you? Who screams like that?\NYou sound like a little girl.

435
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,530
Hey, you guys coming or not? Oh,\NI heard we should hit up Loch Nora.

436
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,910
That's where the rich\Npeople live, right?

437
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,660
Yeah!

438
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,160
You're dead.

439
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,640
Yeah, you got me, kid.

440
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,260
Happy Halloween.

441
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:17,360
Oh, shit, shit, shit,\Nshit, shit, shit, shit.

442
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,530
Hey, kid. Give me some\Nof that candy, would you?

443
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,380
No way.

444
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,730
All right. How about now?

445
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,680
Who are you? I'm Maria.

446
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,330
Will you play with me?

447
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,480
Would you like one of my flowers?

448
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,380
L...

449
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,580
A...

450
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,530
T...

451
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,680
E.

452
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,330
Late.

453
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,760
Another full-size. Like, seriously,\Nrich people are such suckers.

454
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:42,480
- Wait. You're not rich, right?\N- No, I live up Old Cherry Road.

455
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,860
Oh.

456
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,360
No, it's fine. I mean, the\Nstreet's good for skating.

457
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,480
Hmm.

458
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,860
Yeah, totally tubular.

459
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,860
What? Did I say that right?\NOr is it, like, tubular.

460
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,860
It's, like, totally tubular.

461
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,780
- Totally tubular!\N- What a gnarly wave, dude.

462
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,380
- Totally brodacious, bro!\N- Stop. My ears are hurting.

463
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,960
- Did you agree to this?\N- What?

464
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,110
To her joining our party.

465
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,880
- It's just for Halloween.\N- You should have checked with me.

466
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,980
Well, they were excited. I guess\NI thought you'd be okay with it.

467
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,730
She's ruining the\Nbest night of the year.

468
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,430
Watch it, Zombie Boy.

469
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,130
Trick or treat, freak.

470
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,180
Boo!

471
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,310
Mike?

472
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,860
Mike?

473
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,800
Mike!

474
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,550
Will!

475
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,880
Will, what's wrong?

476
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,850
I couldn't find you. Are you hurt?

477
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,680
Holy shit!

478
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,160
- Is he okay?\N- I don't know.

479
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,730
I'm gonna get you home, okay?\NI'm gonna get you home. Hold on.

480
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,100
- All right, take it easy.\N- I got him.

481
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,180
Mike?

482
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,560
Keep trick-or-treating. I'm bored anyways.

483
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,150
What's wrong with him?

484
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,810
Nice costume.

485
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,150
- Huh?\N- Nice costume.

486
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,010
Oh, uh, yeah. I'm going\Nas a guy who hates parties.

487
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,530
- I'm Samantha.\N- Uh, Jonathan.

488
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Kiss?

489
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,300
The band.

490
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,700
- No, no, no.\N- Get off.

491
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,130
- No, you've had enough, okay?\N- Screw you!

492
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,960
Nance, I'm serious. Hey. Hey.\NHey. Stop. No, I'm serious.

493
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,550
- Put it down.\N- No!

494
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,350
- Nance, put it down.\N- Steve! Stop.

495
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,150
Stop. Stop.

496
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,010
What the hell?

497
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,200
Nance.

498
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,060
Nance, I'm sorry.

499
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,510
- That's not coming off, Nance.\N- It's coming.

500
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,230
Come on. Let me just take\Nyou home, okay? Come here.

501
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,130
- Let me take you home. Come on.\N- You wanted this.

502
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,310
No, I didn't want this. I\Ntold you to stop drinking.

503
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,630
- It's bullshit. Bullshit.\N- No, it's not bullshit. Okay?

504
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,860
- No, it's not bullshit, Nancy.\N- No, you. You're bullshit.

505
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,660
What?

506
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,660
You're pretending like\Neverything is okay.

507
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,530
You know, like we didn't...\Nlike we didn't kill Barb.

508
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:28,130
Like, it's great. Like, we're\Nin love and we're partying.

509
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,260
Yeah, let's party, huh?\NParty. We're partying.

510
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,250
This is bullshit.

511
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,300
"Like we're in love"?

512
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,350
It's bullshit.

513
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,850
You don't love me?

514
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,150
It's bullshit.

515
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,100
It's like... like I'm stuck.

516
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,800
Like, like, stuck in the Upside Down?

517
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,000
No.

518
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,950
You know on a View-Master,\Nwhen it gets, like...

519
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,000
- Caught between two slides?\N- Yeah. Like that.

520
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,300
Like one side's our\Nworld, and the other...

521
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,450
The other slide is the Upside Down.

522
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,500
And...

523
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,000
And there was this noise\Ncoming from everywhere.

524
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,800
And then I saw something.

525
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,450
- The Demogorgon?\N- No.

526
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:06,650
It was like this huge shadow in the sky.

527
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,900
Only, it was alive.

528
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,300
And it was coming for me.

529
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,250
Is this all real?

530
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Or is it like the doctors\Nsay, all in your head?

531
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,100
I don't know. Just...

532
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,100
Just please don't tell the others, okay?

533
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,780
They won't understand.

534
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,650
Eleven would.

535
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,280
She would?

536
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,330
Yeah.

537
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,030
She always did.

538
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,000
Sometimes I feel like I still see her.

539
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,280
Like she's still\Naround, but she never is.

540
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,050
I don't know. Sometimes I\Nfeel like I'm going crazy.

541
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,550
Me, too.

542
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,230
Hey, well, if we're both going crazy,\Nthen we'll go crazy together, right?

543
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,800
Yeah. Crazy together.

544
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,770
Jonathan?

545
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,120
Hey, kid. Open up, all\Nright? Look, I know I'm late.

546
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,950
I got candy here, all right?\NI got all the good stuff.

547
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,020
Please, will you open the door?\NI'm gonna freeze to death out here.

548
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,380
Hey, kid. Open up, would you?

549
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,180
I got, uh... stuck somewhere,\Nand I lost track of time.

550
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,570
And I'm sorry.

551
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,670
El, would you please open the door?

552
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,950
El?

553
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,370
All right.

554
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,720
I'm just gonna be out here by\Nmyself, eating all this candy.

555
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,170
I'm gonna get fat.

556
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,680
It's very unhealthy\Nto leave me out here.

557
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,180
Could have a heart attack or something.

558
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,630
But, you know, you do what you want.

559
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,930
One quarter pound of all-American beef,

560
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,580
fresh-cut tomato, and four\Nstrips of crispy bacon.

561
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,680
Did somebody say bacon?

562
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,450
Refreshing lemon...

563
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,400
...and they're perfect for dunking. Mmm!

564
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,180
It's day 353.

565
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:35,620
I had a bad day today.\NI don't know. I...

566
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,470
I guess I wish you were here.

567
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,470
I mean, we all do.

568
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,520
If you're out there, just\Nplease give me a sign.

569
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,420
Mike.

570
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,620
Eleven?

571
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,470
Tubular.

572
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,370
Tubular.

573
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:01,770
Tubular.

574
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,770
Mews, is that...

575
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,970
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

576
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,020
Holy sh...
