1
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,420
911, what's your emergency?

2
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,520
Is someone there? Hello?

3
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,070
What do you want?

4
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,470
Hey! I said, what do you want?

5
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,020
I said, what do you want?

6
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,210
Hey. Is everything okay?

7
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Yes.

8
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,660
Hello, this is the Wheelers.

9
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,260
Yeah, just a sec.

10
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,630
Mike!

11
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,760
Phone!

12
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,930
Okay!

13
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,980
Hello?

14
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,650
It's 9:32. Where are you?

15
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,530
Sorry, I... I was just about to call.

16
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,780
I, um...

17
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
can't see you today.

18
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,910
What... Why not?

19
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,110
It's my Nana.

20
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,200
She's very sick.

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,410
But Hop said that your Nana was okay,

22
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,910
that it was a false alarm.

23
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,610
Yeah.

24
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,800
That's... what...\Nwe thought it was at first,

25
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,210
but then she took a real turn\Nfor the worse.

26
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,800
- Oh.\N- Yeah.

27
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,710
We think she might...

28
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,850
- die.\N- What?

29
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,600
Mom! Get off the phone!

30
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,180
How many times?!

31
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,430
Did Nana call?!

32
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,060
No, Mom! Just get off the phone!

33
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,110
Sorry about that.

34
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,950
- Was that your mom?\N- Yeah.

35
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,150
She's so upset, she's making no sense.

36
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,200
Because we have to go to the nursing home.

37
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,400
To see Nana.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,700
- You can come over after?\N- No!

39
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,000
I mean, I...

40
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,550
I just think... I need to be alone today.

41
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,700
With my...

42
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,460
feelings?

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,910
Do you lie?

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,750
What? No.

45
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,300
Friends don't lie.

46
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,460
What, Mom?

47
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,880
My mom's calling me. Better go.

48
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,700
Talk to you tomorrow.\NMiss you already. Bye!

49
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,510
Hey.

50
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,110

Uh, this is the first day

66
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,130
in six long, excruciating months

67
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,880
that they will not be seeing each other.

68
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,760
Yes, I think it worked! Yes!

69
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
No, stop.

70
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,350
It's all you.

71
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,310
I'm a puppet, you're the master.

72
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,150
So you remembered everything?

73
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,850
Yeah, yeah.

74
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,980
I mean, I had to improvise a little bit,\Nyou know?

75
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,700
It turns out, getting to Mike,

76
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,950
now that was the key.

77
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,780
And you didn't yell at him?

78
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,110
I'll tell you everything over dinner.

79
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,310
I was thinking, you know, Enzo's,\Ntonight, 7:00.

80
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,700
Hey, before you say no,

81
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,860
I'd... I'd like to make one thing\Ncrystal clear.

82
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,300
This is not a date.

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,500
Wait, a date?

84
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,730
You never said anything about a date.

85
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,750
I know,\NI didn't say anything about a date.

86
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,730
I just wanted to clear it up in case\Nthere was any confusion on your part.

87
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,880
- There's not.\N- Great.

88
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,260
It's just two friends\Ngetting together for a nice dinner.

89
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,300
I mean, we've earned it, haven't we?

90
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,550
I can't be out late.

91
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,650
You'll be home by 9:00.

92
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,150
- 8:00.\N- 8:30, I'll pick you up.

93
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,150
- I'll meet you there.\N- 7:00. Enzo's. Meeting there.

94
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,310
Deal.

95
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,610
Hey, Chief, you copy? Chief!

96
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,110
Yeah, I'm a little busy right now.

97
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,260
Recall the mall!

98
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,400
- Yeah, well, I'm busier here.\N- Recall the mall!

99
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,800
You wanna keep your job tomorrow,

100
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,000
I think you need to get your ass\Nto Town Hall. Now.

101
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,450
Duty calls.

102
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,860
Oh! Jeez.

103
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,210
Cleanup on aisle five.

104
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,660
- Bye.\N- See you tonight.

105
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Oh, shit, shit.

106
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,300
Whoopsie-daisy!

107
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,960
Careful there, Nancy Drew. Careful.

108
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,130
Pouring coffee's\Na tough gig, girl.

109
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,930
And here you are, two creams, two sugars.

110
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,880
Thanks, sweetheart.

111
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,080
Of course.

112
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,510
- Tom?\N- Hm?

113
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,060
I really hate to ask this,

114
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,680
but do you think one of the other girls\Ncould run and grab lunch today?

115
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,460
They're needed at their desks.

116
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,260
I know, I just, um...

117
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,560
I really need to go to the doctor.

118
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,010
I've been having some...

119
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,060
um...

120
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,760
girl problems.

121
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,660
- Oh, come on! The light!\N- Let's go.

122
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Look, I just...

123
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,860
I just don't know\Nif this is such a good idea anymore.

124
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,710
Really? Because I feel like\Nit's the best idea I've had all summer.

125
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,980
Look, all I'm saying is,\Nwhat harm is there in asking?

126
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,380
The harm in asking\Nis that Tom will say no.

127
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,430
We ask for forgiveness, not permission.

128
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,780
And if this story's as good as I think\Nit's gonna be, then Tom won't care.

129
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,430
In fact, he'll thank us.

130
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,930
Or the old lady is nuts

131
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,480
and the story blows up in our face

132
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,280
and Tom fires us.

133
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,830
And then we never have to work\Nat this shithole again.

Pleasure to meet you. Uh, is... is he here?

147
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,010
Henderson.

151
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,810
I got the job!

152
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,860
Hey! Oh!

153
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,810
Ah!

154
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
How many children are you friends with?

155
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,710
No, no. No way.

156
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,560
- Hotter than Phoebe Cates? No.\N- Mm-hmm.

157
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,860
Brilliant, too. And she doesn't even care\Nthat my real pearls are still coming in.

158
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,910
She says kissing is better without teeth.

159
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,160
Wow. Yeah, that's great.\NProud of you, man.

160
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,010
That's ro... That's kinda romantic.

161
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,510
- That's like... Wow.\N- Hm.

162
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,710
So do you really just get to eat\Nas much of this as you want?

163
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,060
Yeah. I mean, sure. It's not really\Na good idea for me, though.

164
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,310
- I gotta keep in shape for the ladies.\N- Yeah, and how's that working out for you?

165
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,810
- Ignore her.\N- She seems cool.

166
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,410
She's not.\NSo, where are the other knuckleheads?

167
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,160
They ditched me yesterday.

168
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,860
- No.\N- My first day back.

169
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,860
- Can you believe that shit?\N- Whoa. Seriously?

170
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,210
I swear to God. Mm.

171
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,510
They're gonna regret it, though, big time,\Nwhen they don't get to share in my glory.

172
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,060
Glory? What glory?

173
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,710
So, last night,

174
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,110
we're trying to get in contact\Nwith Suzie...

175
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Oh. Mm.

176
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060
- Mm-hmm?\N- Mm-hmm.

177
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
And, uh...

178
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,710
...and the orange sherbert\Nand chocolate.

179
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,660
I intercepted a secret\NRussian communication.

180
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,560
What?

181
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,910
Uh...

182
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,860
I intercepted a secret\NRussian communication.

183
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,710
- Just speak louder.\N- I intercepted

184
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,610
a secret Russian communication!

185
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,660
Jeez, shh. Yeah, okay,\Nthat's what I thought you said.

186
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,660
What... What does that mean?

187
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,560
It means, Steve, we could be heroes.

188
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,960
True American heroes.

189
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,710
- Huh.\N- Mm-hmm?

190
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,210
- American heroes.\N- Just think,

191
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,360
you could have all the ladies you want\Nand more.

192
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,660
- More?\N- More.

193
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,510
- I like more.\N- Mm-hmm.

194
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,260
What's the catch?

195
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,360
No catch, I just need your help.

196
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
With what?

197
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Translation.

198
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,810
Shit!

199
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,210
Hi.

200
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,210
Hi?

201
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,910
Can we talk?

202
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,060
And then he said he... he missed me.

203
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,410
And then he just hung up.

204
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,710
- He's a piece of shit.\N- What?

205
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,410
Mike doesn't have jack shit to do today,\Nand his Nana obviously isn't sick.

206
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,010
I guarantee you, him and Lucas\Nare playing Atari right now.

207
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,610
But friends don't lie.

208
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,960
Yeah, well, boyfriends lie.

209
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,260
All the time.

210
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,660
She knows I'm lying. She knows I'm lying.

211
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,560
- I don't even understand. Why lie?\N- Hopper.

212
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,910
He threatened me.

213
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,310
- Did he say he'd kill you?\N- What? No.

214
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,410
- So then, what's the big deal?\N- The big deal is

215
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,110
if I don't do what he says,\Nthen he'll stop me from seeing El.

216
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,410
Like, permanently.

217
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,460
You don't understand, Lucas. He's crazy.

218
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,260
He's lost his mind.

219
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,010
Hey, guys, I'm almost set up here.

220
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,010
I had no choice, Lucas.\NI really had no choice.

221
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,660
I just wish you'd consulted me,

222
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,610
because the way you handled this,

223
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,310
you're in deep shit.

224
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,610
You're going to stop calling him.\NYou're going to ignore his calls.

225
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,460
As far as you're concerned,\Nhe doesn't exist.

226
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,710
Doesn't exist?

227
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,460
He treated you like garbage.

228
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,460
You're gonna treat him like garbage.\NGive him a taste of his own medicine.

229
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,660
Give him the medicine.

230
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,010
Mm-hmm. And if he doesn't fix this,

231
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,810
if he doesn't explain himself,

232
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,080
dump his ass.

233
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,510
I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna be bad.

234
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,510
But...

235
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,610
you can fix this.

236
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,980
It's just one little mistake.

237
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,280
I've made hundreds, thousands.

238
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,910
Max has dumped me five times.

239
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,010
But what have I done?

240
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,910
Huh? Have I despaired? No.

241
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,010
I've marched back into battle,

242
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,460
and I've won her back\Nevery single freaking time.

243
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,630
- How?\N- I'll show you.

244
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,310
Come on.

245
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,310
Come on.

246
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,760
- Where are we going?\N- To have some fun.

247
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,710
There's more to life than stupid boys,\Nyou know.

248
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,460
Wait, guys!

249
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm still here!

250
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,220
Guys?

251
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,820
Hey! No dunking, Curtis.

252
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
No...

253
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,070
dunking.

254
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,980
God, even her voice annoys me.

255
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,530
Nails on a chalkboard.

256
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,330
Don't worry, ladies,\Nten more minutes till showtime.

257
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,330
Liz, will you get my back?

258
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,200
♪ I've done it again ♪

259
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,080
♪ I've let you in ♪

260
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,080
♪ To tear my heart in two... ♪

261
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,230
Hey, Jill, I gotta use the restroom.\NWill you watch Holly for me?

262
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,380
- Sure thing, hon.\N- Thanks.

263
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Billy?

264
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Billy?

265
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,370
I...

266
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,170
I understand if you're angry with me.

267
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,170
I just...

268
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,530
I wanted to explain...

269
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,980
...why I didn't come last night.

270
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,580
It's not you, it's just...

271
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,250
I have a family.

272
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,850
And I can't do anything\Nthat will hurt them.

273
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,350
You can understand that, right?

274
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,080
But I shouldn't have said that...

275
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,450
Billy.

276
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Billy...

277
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,750
Please, will you talk to me?

278
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,750
Stay away from me, Karen.

279
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,350
Looking good, Billy.

280
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,850
Afternoon, Billy.

281
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,380
Mmm.

282
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,680
Can I try the peppermint stick?

283
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,930
Haven't you already tried\Nthe peppermint stick?

284
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,900
Yes, and I'd like to try it again.

285
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,320
Steve!

286
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,750
So what do you think?

287
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,700
- It sounded familiar.\N- What?

288
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,500
The music.\NThe music right there at the end.

289
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,630
Why are you listening to the music, Steve?

290
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Listen to the Russian!

291
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,450
- We're translating Russian!\N- I'm trying to listen to the Russian,

292
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,850
- but there's music...\N- All right, babysitting time is over.

293
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,930
You need to get in there.

294
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,930
Hey, my board.\NThat was important data, shitbirds.

295
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,470
I guarantee you, what we're doing\Nis way more important than your data.

296
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,630
Yeah? And how do you know these Russians\Nare up to no good anyways?

297
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,450
- How does she know about the Russians?\N- I don't know.

298
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,000
- You told her about...\N- It wasn't me.

299
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,150
Hello, I can hear you.\NActually, I can hear everything.

300
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,450
You are both extremely loud.

301
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,320
You think you have evil Russians\Nplotting against our country, on tape,

302
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,850
and you're trying to translate,\Nbut haven't figured out a word

303
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,750
because you didn't realize Russians\Nuse an entirely different alphabet.

304
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,570
Sound about right?

305
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,850
- Whoa! What do you think you're doing?\N- I wanna hear it.

306
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,870
- Why?\N- 'Cause maybe I can help.

307
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,670
- I'm fluent in four languages, you know.\N- Russian?

308
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,530
Ou-yay are-yay umb-day.

309
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,950
Oh-ho-ho!

310
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,880
Holy shit!

311
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,500
That was Pig Latin, dingus.

312
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,300
- Idiot.\N- But I can speak Spanish

313
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,330
and French and Italian,\Nand I've been in band for 12 years.

314
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,930
- My ears are little geniuses, trust me.\N- Uh...

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,630
Come on, it's your turn\Nto sling ice cream, my turn to translate.

316
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,880
I don't even want credit. I'm just bored.

317
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,870
Yes?

318
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,130
- Mrs. Driscoll?\N- Yes?

319
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Hi, um, I'm Nancy.

320
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,170
Nancy Wheeler.\NWe spoke briefly on the phone last night.

321
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,380
We're from The Hawkins Post.

322
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,080
Oh! Oh, yes!

323
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,380
Oh, my goodness.

324
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,050
Oh. You look too young for reporters.

325
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,770
We get that a lot.

326
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Follow me.

327
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,980
Oh, it's... it's lovely.

328
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,480
Um, do you live here all alone?

329
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,770
Yes. Jack, my husband,

330
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,480
he passed away, what is it now,\Nten years ago.

331
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,450
Oh, um... I'm... I'm so sorry.

332
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,150
Oh, don't be.

333
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,230
I kinda like the quiet.

334
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,370
At least, I did.

335
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,830
This way.

336
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,630
It's right over there.

337
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,350
You see those\Nlittle teeth marks, don't ya?

338
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
And...

339
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,780
these bags, um...

340
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,280
you're sure they were full before?

341
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,780
I'm old, honey, not senile.

342
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,920
Bought them over at Blackburn's Supplies\Njust last Tuesday.

343
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,170
Now you tell me,

344
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,670
why would rats want to eat\Na poor old woman's fertilizer?

345
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,930
Are you sure they did?

346
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,220
Maybe they just gnawed the bag? I mean...

347
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,220
eating fertilizer seems...

348
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Crazy. Believe me, I know, honey.

349
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,270
But...

350
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,650
...something's not right with these rats.

351
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,230
What does that mean, exactly...

352
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,930
"not right"?

353
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,070
Rabies, my guess.

354
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,770
That's when I said to myself,

355
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,820
"Doris, you gotta call the paper.

356
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,150
Because if those diseased rats\Nare runnin' loose,

357
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,870
the people, they oughta know."\NWouldn't you agree?

358
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,580
Oh, yes, I forgot to mention!

359
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,780
Come on over here.

360
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,920
I caught one of the little bastards.

361
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,850
Kline's a swine!\NKline's a swine!

362
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,130
Kline's a swine!

363
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,350
Kline's a swine! Kline's a swine!

364
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,180
Kline's a swine!\NKline's a swine!

365
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,030
Kline's a swine!

366
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,400
Kline's a swine!

367
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,230
Kline's a swine!

368
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,530
Kline's a swine!

369
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,950
Jim?

370
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,650
Mayor Kline is ready for you.

371
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,830
Great.

372
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,830
Thank you.

373
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,570
Jim.

374
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,720
Thanks for coming by.

375
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,070
I'm not doing it, Larry.

376
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,870
Calm down, now.\NYou don't even know what I want.

377
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,120
You don't like your fan club, you want me\Nto shut 'em down. Sound about right?

378
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,570
When'd you get so serious?

379
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,670
Take a seat.

380
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,070
My fan club, as you call them,

381
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,120
now, you know why they're out there,\Ndon't ya?

382
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,670
They're not actually fans?

383
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,820
They lost their jobs to the mall

384
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,020
and blame me for helping make that happen.

385
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,970
Now,

386
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,970
you go ask anyone else in this town.

387
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,470
They all love the mall.

388
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,020
It's helped our economy grow,\Nbrought in new jobs,

389
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,070
and just some incredible new stores.

390
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:30,820
Which is why they all stopped shopping\Nat their, uh, mom-and-pops.

391
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,470
Now, that's not me, Jim.

392
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,470
- Mm-hmm?\N- Uh-uh.

393
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,070
That's just, uh, good old fashioned\NAmerican capitalism.

394
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,670
Well, Larry,\NI think that they're just exercising

395
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,320
their good old fashioned American right\Nto protest.

396
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,170
I agree.

397
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,920
- Yeah.\N- If.

398
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,570
If they had a permit.

399
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,270
Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, Jim,\Nbut, uh...

400
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,470
I don't believe they secured a permit\Nfrom your office,

401
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,420
did they?

402
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,520
Not that I'm aware of.

403
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,820
Then I do believe it's within my right\Nto get rid of them.

404
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,770
Larry,

405
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,520
I'm not a politics guy,

406
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,170
but I think if you force those people\Nout of here without provocation,

407
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,870
I don't think that's a good look\Nfor your re-election campaign.

408
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,770
You know what's in four days, Jim?

409
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,170
Independence Day?

410
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,270
That's right.

411
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,070
And I'm gonna throw this town\Nthe biggest bash it's ever seen.

412
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,420
Fireworks, music, activities, you name it.

413
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm gonna pull out all the stops.\NYou know why?

414
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,570
'Cause at the end of the day,\Nthat's all the voters will remember.

415
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,570
But I can't think, much less plan,

416
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,320
with all that racket going on out there.

417
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,070
So, if you don't mind,

418
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,870
please...

419
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,470
just do your job.

420
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,520
Flash your little gold badge,

421
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,870
and get rid of them.

422
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,570
So, what do you think?

423
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,870
Hey, what's wrong?

424
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,720
Too many people.

425
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,620
Against the rules.

426
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,420
Seriously?

427
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,320
You have superpowers.

428
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,820
What's the worst that could happen?

429
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,270
So, what should we do first?

430
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,820
You've never been\Nshopping before, have you?

431
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,870
Well, then I guess we're just\Ngonna have to try everything.

432
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,920
Ooh. Come on.

433
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,420
I just...\NI don't understand what we're looking for.

434
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,670
Something pretty and shiny\Nthat says "I'm sorry."

435
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,770
What, just something\Nthat literally says "I'm sorry"?

436
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,820
No!

437
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Do you like that?

438
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,320
How do I know... what I like?

439
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,270
You just try things on.

440
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,470
Until you find something\Nthat feels like you.

441
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,070
Like me?

442
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
Yeah.

443
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
Not Hopper.

444
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
Not Mike.

445
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
You.

Yeah, um...

461
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,920
I have a bit of a weird question for you.

462
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,850
I was wondering if you guys\Nhad gotten any recent calls about, um...

463
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,020
rabid rats?

464
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,350
No, uh, rabid rats.

465
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,220
Rats with rabies?

466
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,670
Okay, um...

467
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,150
What about just rats, in general?

468
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,770
Uh-huh.

469
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,700
Okay. Thank you.

470
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,470
You're a regular little detective,\Naren't ya?

471
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
Lemonade? It's fresh-squeezed.

472
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,750
Sure, thanks.

473
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,370
Um...

474
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,000
Do you mind if I make\Njust a few more calls?

475
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,300
Not at all. I enjoy the company.

476
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,750

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,870

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,120
Yeah, okay, but, uh...

481
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,170
I just think there's something\Nreally wrong with this rat.

482
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,420
Yeah, no shit.

483
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
- Come on.\N- No, I...

484
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,690
Nancy, wait up.

485
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,240
I said, what do you want?!

486
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,820

487
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,650

489
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,920
What you see.

490
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,950
I don't understand.

491
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,920

What's going on? I heard screaming.

501
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,640

00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,250
Can we please play D&D now?

540
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,370
- No.\N- No.

541
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,120
Wait, that last part, just one more time.

542
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,250
Okay.

543
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,750
Okay, that word. Um...

544
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,100
It's pronounced... "dly-nna-ya."

545
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,550
- "Dly-nna-ya..."\N- Which is spelled...

546
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,100
D... D, D, D...

547
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,100
The... The chair. The chair-looking thingy.

548
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,440
Yeah, okay.

549
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,700
- We've got our first sentence.\N- Oh, seriously?

550
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,270
- Yeah.\N- "The week is long."

551
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,040
Well, that's thrilling.

552
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,450
I know. But, progress.

553
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,320
Okay, here you go, you got a strawberry\Nand then a vanilla with sprinkles,

554
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,340
- extra whipped cream.\N- Thanks.

555
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Wait a second.

556
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,950
Are you even allowed to be here?

557
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,970
That...

558
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,250
Okay.

559
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
You wanna trade?

560
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,550
That's ridiculous.\NWhy can't I just...

561
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,900
Oh, you've gotta be shitting me.

562
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,370
- Haven't got that much.\N- Okay, what if we split it?

563
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,240
Split it with what?\NDoes that even make sense?

564
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,200
Isn't this a nice surprise.

565
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,770
What are you doing here?

566
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,540
Shopping.

567
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,900
This is her new style.

568
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,540
- What do you think?\N- What's wrong with you?

569
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,140
You know she's not allowed to be here.

570
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,420
What is she, your little pet?

571
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,470
Yeah.

572
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,890
- Am I your pet?\N- What? No!

573
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,340
- Then why do you treat me like garbage?\N- What?

574
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,440
- You said Nana was sick.\N- She is.

575
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,290
She is. She is sick.

576
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,990
- Yeah, sick... she's sick.\N- She's sick.

577
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,790
She's super sick.\NThat's why we're here, actually.

578
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,090
Yeah, we're shopping.

579
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,940
Not for us, but for her, for Nana.

580
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,390
- For Nana.\N- Also, we're here to get a gift for you.

581
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,390
Just, we couldn't find anything\Nthat suited you

582
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,640
and I only have, like, $3.50,\Nso it's hard.

583
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,090
Super hard.

584
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,040
It's... It's expensive.

585
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,640
You lie.

586
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,690
Why do you lie?

587
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,240
I dump your ass.

588
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,790
♪ You're as cold as ice ♪

589
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,690
♪ You're willing to sacrifice\NOur love... ♪

590
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,540
- Now can we play D&D?\N- No.

591
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,340
He raised my property taxes, Jim.

592
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,590
Forced me off my land.

593
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,340
You can protest all you want, Henry,

594
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,540
you've just gotta go through\Nthe proper channels first.

595
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,890
Nothing proper about\Nwhat that man did to us!

596
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,640
- To our town!\N- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

597
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,990
Special delivery!

598
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,690
Ooh, yeah.

599
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,240
That the right one?

600
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,990
Yeah.

601
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,690
Yeah!

602
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,440
That's a lot of color for you, Chief.

603
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,490
It's cutting-edge stuff, all right?

604
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,240
It's cutting-edge!

605
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,340
I'll start off with a Scotch,\Nyou can make that a double.

606
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,690
Very good, sir.

607
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,740
And I think we'll have a bottle of red,\Nas well.

608
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,290
Very good, sir.

609
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,790
And how's your "chee-anti"?

610
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,240
- Our Chianti is quite good.\N- Chianti.

611
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,290
Medium-bodied, with just a hint of cherry.

612
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,390
Great.

613
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,790
Women love cherries, huh?

614
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:05,340
All right, we'll have that\Nand two... two glasses, please,

615
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,540
one for, uh, me and one for the lady.

616
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,340
Ooh. Very good, sir.

617
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,440
And what is this again?

618
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,790
This is a solenoid.

619
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,440
It's a coil,\Nwrapped around a metallic core,

620
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,440
and when electricity passes through it...

621
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,990
It creates an electromagnetic field.

622
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,140
Exactamundo.

623
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,690
Now for the fun part.

624
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,090
- Shall we?\N- Yeah.

625
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,240
I... I don't see anything.

626
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,240
Nope.

627
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,890
You can't see it, but it's there,\NI assure you.

628
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,690
Our very own Clarke-Byers\NElectromagnetic Field.

629
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,990
Pretty neato, huh?

630
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,340
Yeah.

631
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,540
And this field affects any charged object\Nin its vicinity.

632
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,590
- Just like my magnets.\N- Just like your magnets.

633
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,240
Okay, why is nothing happening?

634
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,190
Oh, because our field is stable.

635
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,340
But, if we reduce the current...

636
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,840
How...

637
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,740
The magnetic dipoles tried to orient\Naccording to the field, but...

638
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,590
No, no, no, I mean,\Nhow is this happening at my house?

639
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,840
You want my honest opinion?

640
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,590
One of your kiddos got up\Nin the middle of the night,

641
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,790
bumped into the fridge,\Nand knocked the suckers loose.

642
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,640
And the magnets at Melvald's?

643
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,940
- Apophenia.\N- Apo-what-o-whah?

644
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,690
Apophenia. Uh...

645
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,140
You're seeing patterns that aren't there.\NCoincidence.

646
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,040
But what if...

647
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,740
it's not?

648
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
Well...

649
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,640
Theoretically-speaking,

650
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:02,390
I suppose some large version\Nof this AC transformer could exist.

651
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,390
A machine of some kind.

652
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,390
A machine?

653
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:09,190
But, in order to reach your house\Nand downtown, gosh,

654
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,140
that would take\Nbillions of volts of electricity

655
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,490
and cost tens of millions of dollars.

656
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,540
But it is possible.

657
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,090
We cured polio in '53.

658
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,740
Landed on the moon in '69.

659
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,640
As I tell my students,

660
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,040
once you open up that curiosity door,

661
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,090
anything is possible.

662
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,890
"The week is long,

663
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,340
the silver cat feeds,

664
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,840
when blue meets yellow in the west."

665
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,640
I mean, it just...

666
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,390
it just can't be right.

667
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,740
- It's right.\N- Honestly, I think it's great news.

668
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,990
How is this great news?

669
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,340
I mean,\Nso much for being American heroes.

670
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,240
- It's total nonsense.\N- It's not nonsense.

671
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,290
It's too specific. It's obviously a code.

672
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,690
- What do you mean, a code?\N- Like a super secret spy code.

673
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,140
- That's a total stretch.\N- I don't know, is it?

674
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,640
You're buying into this?

675
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,890
Listen, just for kicks,

676
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,170
let's entertain the possibility\Nthat it is a secret Russian transmission.

677
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,820
What'd you think they were gonna say,\N"Fire the warhead at noon"?

678
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,840
- Exactly.\N- And my translation is correct.

679
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,720
I know that for sure, so...

680
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,990
"The silver cat feeds."\NW hy would anyone talk like that

681
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,240
unless they're trying to mask

682
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,870
- the meaning of their message?\N- Exactly.

683
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,090
Why would anyone mask\Nthe true meaning of their message

684
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,190
unless the message was somehow sensitive?

685
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,490
Exactly.

686
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,740
- So I guess that confirms your suspicion.\N- Evil Russians.

687
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,070
I can't believe I'm about to agree\Nwith this strange child, but,

688
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,570
yeah, totally evil Russians.

689
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
So how do we crack it?

690
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,690
Well, I guess we translate the rest\Nand hopefully a pattern emerges.

691
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,390
A pattern. Right, like maybe "silver cat"\Nis a meeting place?

692
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,540
Or a person.

693
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,540
Or a weapon.

694
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,060
It's probably gonna take a super genius\Nto crack it, but...

695
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,540
Where's Steve?

696
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,970
Hey, Steve.

697
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,090
What are you doing?

698
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,590
Uh, it's a quarter. I need...\NDo you have a quarter?

699
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,090
- Sure you're tall enough for that ride?\N- Quarter!

700
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,940
You need help getting up, little Stevie?

701
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,060
Shh!

702
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,840
Would you two just shut up and listen?

703
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,940
Holy shit.

704
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
The music.

705
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,660
The music!

706
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,960
I don't understand.

707
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,920
It's the exact same song\Non the recording.

708
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,490
Maybe they have horses like this\Nin Russia.

709
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,340
"Indiana Flyer"? I don't...

710
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,090
I don't think so.

711
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,340
This code, it... didn't come from Russia.

712
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,390
It came from here.

713
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,120
Would you like to order your entrée, sir?

714
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,240
You know what, Enzo?

715
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,290
My name is not Enzo.

716
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,920
I just lost my appetite, all right?

717
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,260
So, here you go.

718
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,890
You can keep the change.

719
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,420
Sir!

720
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,340
I'm afraid no alcohol is allowed\Noff the premises.

721
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,940
I can do anything I want.

722
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,890
I'm the chief of police.

723
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,070
Billy, are you okay?

724
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,720
Don't be afraid.

725
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,840
It'll be over soon.

726
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,560
Just stay very still.

727
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,170
No!
