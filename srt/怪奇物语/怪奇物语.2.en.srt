1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,260
Is there a number we\Ncan call for your parents?

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,310
Where's your hair?\NDo you have cancer?

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,600
Did you run away?

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,690
- Are you in some kind of trouble?\N- Is that blood?

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,760
- Stop it! You're freaking her out!\N- She's freaking me out!

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,990
I bet she's deaf.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,950
Not deaf.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,330
All right, that's enough, all right?\NShe's just scared and cold.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,790
Here, these are clean.\NOkay?

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,790
No, no, no!

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,470
Oh, my God.\NOh, my God.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,810
- See over there?\N- That's the bathroom.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,890
Privacy.\NGet it?

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,290
You don't want it closed?

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
No.

16
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,290
Oh, so you can speak.

17
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,580
Okay, well...

18
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,670
Um, how about we just keep the door...

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,510
just like this.

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,720
- Is that better?\N- Yes.

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,480
- This is mental.\N- At least she can talk.

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,440
She said "no" and "yes."\NYour three-year-old sister says more.

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,230
She tried to get naked.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,000
There's something\Nseriously wrong with her.

25
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,530
- Like, wrong in the head.\N- She just went like...

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,070
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,780
- From where?\N- The nuthouse in Kerley County.

28
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,550
- You got a lot of family there?\N- Bite me.

29
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,580
Seriously though, think about it.

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,710
That would explain her shaved hair\Nand why she's so crazy.

31
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,950
Why she went like...

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,800
She's an escapee is the point.\NShe's probably a psycho.

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
- Like Michael Myers.\N- Exactly!

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,550
We should've never brought her here.

35
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,590
So you just wanted to leave her\Nout in that storm?

36
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,800
Yes! We went out to find Will,\Nnot another problem.

37
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,890
- I think we should tell your mom.\N- I second that.

38
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,640
- Who's crazy now?\N- How is that crazy?

39
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,310
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be\Nout tonight, remember?

40
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,730
- So?\N- So if I tell my mom

41
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,650
and she tells your mom\Nand your mom...

42
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,980
- Oh, man.\N- Our houses become Alcatraz.

43
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,650
Exactly.\NWe'll never find Will.

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,950
All right, here's the plan.\NShe sleeps here tonight.

45
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,160
- You're letting a girl...\N- Just listen!

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,200
In the morning,\Nshe sneaks around my house,

47
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,330
goes to the front door\Nand rings my doorbell.

48
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,250
My mom will answer and know\Nexactly what to do.

49
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,690
She'll send her back to Pennhurst\Nor wherever she comes from.

50
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,970
We'll be totally in the clear.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,630
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

52
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,090
And this time, we find Will.

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Here you go.\NThis is my sleeping bag.

54
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,100
You really think she's psycho?

55
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,770
Wouldn't want her in my house.

56
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,810
Mental.

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,150
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

58
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,870
Is that real?

59
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,960
Sorry, I've just... never seen\Na kid with a tattoo before.

60
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,590
What's it mean?\NEleven?

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,050
That's your name?

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,220
Eleven. Okay.

63
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,640
Um, well, my name's Mike.\NShort for Michael.

64
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,940
Maybe we can call you "El."\NShort for Eleven.

65
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,400
Um, well, okay.

66
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,570
'Night, El.

67
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,110
'Night, Mike.

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,590
All right, Mom. Breakfast is ready.

69
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,470
- What? No, be careful of the poster.\N- Yeah, okay. All right.

70
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,430
- I can't eat.\N- I just need you to eat, Mom.

71
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,930
Listen. Listen, the Xerox place\Nopens in, like, 30 minutes.

72
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,430
- Yeah.\N- And I don't want you to go alone...

73
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,800
No, I know. I told you, I got it.

74
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,300
... so I'm gonna have Karen take\Nyou, 'cause I should be here.

75
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,560
- Okay.\N- We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

76
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,010
- How much is a copy?\N- Yeah, okay.

77
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,250
- Okay, Mom. Mom.\N- Ten cents?

78
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,650
- If we... Ten cents...\N- Mom. Mom. Mom!

79
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,990
You can't get like this, okay?

80
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,490
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\N- No, it's okay.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,370
We've been waiting six hours.

82
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,170
I know. I came as soon as I could.

83
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,830
Six hours.

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,040
A little bit of trust here, all right?

85
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,090
We've been searching all night.\NWent all the way to Cartersville.

86
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,840
- And?\N- Nothing.

87
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,340
God.

88
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,430
Flo says you got a phone call?

89
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,680
Oh, yeah.

90
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,660
Storm barbecued this pretty good.

91
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,110
- The storm?\N- What else?

92
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,110
You're saying that that's not weird?

93
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,860
No, it's weird.

94
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,450
Can we, like, trace who\Nmade the call? Contact the...

95
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,540
No, it doesn't work like that.

96
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,370
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

97
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,290
Because Flo said you\Njust heard some breathing.

98
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,360
No. It was him. It was Will.

99
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,300
And he was scared. And then something...

100
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,220
It was probably just a prank call.\NIt was somebody trying to scare you.

101
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,380
- Who would do that?\N- Well, this thing's been on TV.

102
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,310
It brings out all the crazies, you\Nknow. False leads, prank calls, uh...

103
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,390
No, Hopper, it was not\Na prank. It was him.

104
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,100
- Joyce.\N- Come on, how about a little trust here?

105
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,400
What, you think I'm...\NI'm making this up?

106
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,080
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

107
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,490
All I'm saying is it's\Nan emotional time for you.

108
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,860
And you think I don't know\Nmy own son's breathing?

109
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,570
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

110
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,630
- You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?\N- No.

111
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,180
It's been long enough.\NI'm having him checked out.

112
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,850
Oh, come on!

113
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,010
You're wasting your time.

114
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,730
Hey, Hopper.

115
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,980
Hopper.

116
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,310
Let me go.

117
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,730
- I'm sorry?\N- To Lonnie's.

118
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,690
You know, if Will's there,\Nit means he ran away.

119
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,200
And if he sees the cops,\Nhe'll think he's in trouble.

120
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,990
He'll... He'll hide.

121
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,780
- You know, he's good at hiding.\N- Yeah?

122
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,200
Well, cops are good at finding. Okay?

123
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,960
Stay here with your mom.

124
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,250
She needs you.

125
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,600
Slow down, Mike. That's disgusting.

126
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,940
Do a lot of studying last night?

127
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,610
Yeah, actually, I did.

128
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,070
What was your test on\Nagain? Human anatomy?

129
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,870
Hey, what's going on?

130
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,370
Nothing.

131
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,170
Hey, you found my supercomm.

132
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,420
Pretty cool, huh?

133
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,390
I talk to my friends with it.

134
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,350
Mostly Lucas, 'cause he lives so close.

135
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,510
Signal's pretty weak.

136
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,890
Got you breakfast.

137
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,440
So listen, this is gonna\Nsound a little weird,

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,960
but I just need you to go out there.

139
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,070
Then go to the front door\Nand ring the doorbell.

140
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,700
My mom will answer and you'll tell her\Nthat you're lost and that you need help.

141
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,910
But whatever you do, you can't tell her\Nabout last night or that you know me.

142
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,990
Understand?

143
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,500
Really, it's no big deal.

144
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,710
We'll just pretend to\Nmeet each other again.

145
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,380
And my mom, she'll know who to call.

146
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,880
No.

147
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,300
No?

148
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,140
No.

149
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,560
No... you don't want my mom to get help?

150
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,900
You're in trouble, aren't you?

151
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,780
Who...

152
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,910
Who are you in trouble with?

153
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,200
Bad.

154
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,370
Bad?

155
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,540
Bad people?

156
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,250
They want to hurt you?

157
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,750
The bad people?

158
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,180
Understand?

159
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,770
Michael, where are you?\NWe're going to be late.

160
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,770
- Let's go!\N- All right, I'll be back.

161
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,550
Just stay here, okay? Stay here.

162
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,160
When was this?

163
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,870
Last night. Less than two miles away.

164
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,740
- And the boy?\N- Still missing.

165
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,540
It was my son. I know it.

166
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,920
And I... I heard something else.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,380
Something else?

168
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,090
It was like, uh,\Nsome kind of animal.

169
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,680
I don't know. Just\Nplease tell Hop to hurry.

170
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,680
Will! Will Byers!

171
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,430
Will Byers!

172
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,270
- Will!\N- Will!

173
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,110
Hey! Anything?

174
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,110
You?

175
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,320
No, nothing but a dead phone.

176
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Joyce?

177
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,240
About one step from\Nfalling off the edge.

178
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,740
She's been a few steps for\Na while now, hasn't she?

179
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,580
Kid's missing, man.

180
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,950
Show a little class.

181
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,460
All right. Come on, let's go!

182
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,790
We got a lot of ground to cover.

183
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,290
The chief and her, they've\Nscrewed before, huh?

184
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,510
Will!

185
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,050
That a "yeah" or did they...

186
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,180
- Will!\N- Will!

187
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,150
"When alpha particles go through\Ngold foil, they become... "

188
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,780
- Unoccupied space.\N- "A molecule that can... "

189
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,940
- Hey!\N- I don't know,

190
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,510
I think you've studied enough, Nance.

191
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,990
- Steve...\N- I'm telling you, you know, you got this.

192
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,870
Don't worry. Now, on to\Nmore important matters.

193
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,910
My dad has left town on a conference\Nand my mom's gone with him,

194
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,410
- 'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him.\N- Good call.

195
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
So are you in?

196
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,000
In for what?

197
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,830
No parents? Big house?

198
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,630
A party?

199
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,630
Ding, ding, ding!

200
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,170
It's Tuesday.

201
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,720
It's Tuesday! Oh, my God.

202
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,130
Come on.

203
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,970
It'll be low key. It'll just be us.

204
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,430
What do you say? Are\Nyou in or are you out?

205
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,350
- Um...\N- Oh, God. Look.

206
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,060
Oh, God, that's depressing.

207
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,530
- Should we say something?\N- I don't think he speaks.

208
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,360
How much you want to bet he killed him?

209
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,700
Shut up.

210
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,500
Hey.

211
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,160
Oh, hey.

212
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,420
I just...

213
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,880
I wanted to say, you know, um...

214
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,880
I'm sorry about everything.

215
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,600
Everyone's thinking about you.

216
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,390
- It sucks.\N- Yeah.

217
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,150
I'm sure he's fine.

218
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,900
He's a smart kid.

219
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,700
I have to go. Chemistry test.

220
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Yeah.

221
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,320
- Good luck.\N- Thanks.

222
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,660
Attention, faculty and students.

223
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,210
At 8:00 p.m. tonight, there will be\Nan assembly on the football field

224
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,630
in support of Will\NByers and his family.

225
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,840
All are encouraged to attend.

226
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,090
Volunteer sign-ups for search parties\Nare still available in the office.

227
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,480
Oh, this is weird.

228
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,940
- He's never this late.\N- I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.

229
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,270
I thought you liked his plan.

230
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,690
Yeah, but obviously it was\Nstupid, or he'd be here.

231
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,730
If his mom found out a\Ngirl spent the night...

232
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,320
He's in deep shit right about now.

233
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,070
Hey, what if she slept naked?

234
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,070
Oh, my God, she didn't.

235
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,370
Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents...

236
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,330
- No way. Mike would never rat us out.\N- I don't know.

237
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,620
All that matters is, after school, the\Nfreak will be back in the loony bin,

238
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,840
and we can focus on what\Nreally matters, finding Will.

239
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,340
You want anything to drink?

240
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,030
We have OJ, skim milk... What else?

241
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,650
Um, we have...

242
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,320
Oh, this is my living room.

243
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,950
It's mostly just for watching TV.

244
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,580
Nice, right? It's a 22-inch.

245
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,740
That's, like, ten times\Nbigger than Dustin's.

246
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,470
- Pretty.\N- I guess.

247
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,970
That's my sister Nancy.

248
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,680
And that's baby Holly.

249
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,140
And those are my parents.

250
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,930
What are your parents like?

251
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,970
Do they live close?

252
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,980
That's our\NLa-Z-Boy.

253
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,940
It's where my dad sleeps.

254
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,730
You can try it if you want.

255
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Yeah.

256
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
It's fun.

258
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,740

Okay, that looks like $22.56.

295
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,210
Uh, yeah, you know, uh...

296
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,580
I gave Jonathan all my money for...

297
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,460

298
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,920
Uh, I need an advance.

306
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,490
Have I ever called in sick\Nor missed a shift once?

307
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,950
I've worked, uh, Christmas\NEve and Thanksgiving.

308
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,460
I don't know where my boy is.

309
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,750
He's gone.

His name's Yoda.

318
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,310
He can use the Force to move\Nthings with his mind, like this.

319
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,730
Whoosh!

320
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,190
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

321
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,270
Look, he has a speaker in\Nhis mouth so he can roar.

322
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,160
Oh, these are all my\Nscience fair trophies.

323
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,580
We got first every year.

324
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,370
Except for last year when we got third.

325
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,540
Mr. Clarke said it\Nwas totally political.

326
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,650

327
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,820
Did you see him? Last\Nnight? On the road?

328
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,490
We gotta go.

329
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,080
I bought pizza and macaroni.

330
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,710

331
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,340

332
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,630
Just me, Mom!

333
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,380
- Mike? What are you doing home?\N- One second!

334
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,720
In here. I'll be right back, okay?

335
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,520
Please, you have to get in,\Nor my mom, she'll find you.

336
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,560
Do you understand?

337
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,230
I won't tell her about you. I promise.

338
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,690
Promise?

339
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,780
It means something that you can't break.

340
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,780
- Ever.\N- Michael?

341
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,450

342
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,510

00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,680
I just... I don't feel good.

355
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,430
I woke up and my head,\Nit really hurt bad,

356
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,750
and my throat was all scratchy,\Nand I wanted to tell you,

357
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,370
but the last time I told you I was sick

358
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,490
- you made me go to school anyway, and...\N- Michael.

359
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,100
- Yeah?\N- I'm not mad at you.

360
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,480
- No?\N- No, of course not.

361
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,740
All this that's been going on with Will,

362
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,950
I can't imagine what\Nit's been like for you.

363
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,740
I just...

364
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,290
I want you to feel\Nlike you can talk to me.

365
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,120
I never want you to feel like\Nyou have to hide anything from me.

366
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,330
I'm here for you. Okay?

367
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,090
Is there someone else here?

368
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
No.

369
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,300
Eleven?

370
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,970
Is everything okay?

371
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,100
El?

372
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,480
- Mike.\N- Is everything okay?

373
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,900
Are you sure?

374
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,570
Promise.

375
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,110
- Will Byers!\N- Will!

376
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,800
Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful.

377
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,030
I need you alive for the\Nnext few days, at least.

378
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,370
Oh, hell, I could survive that.

379
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,580
What? George Burness made the jump.

380
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,000
And he was drunk as a skunk.\NHe did it on a $10 bet.

381
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
George is a liar.

382
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,040
You make that jump from this\Nheight, that water turns into cement.

383
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,730
Hits you like a ton of bricks.\NBreak every damn bone in your body.

384
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,920
Nah.

385
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,800
Chief, you copy?

386
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,890
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.

387
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,720
Hey, Chief, we got a call\Nfrom over at Benny's.

388
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,640
I think you need to\Nget there right away.

389
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,080
Ugh, Jesus!

390
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,380
Suicide?

391
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,340
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,510
Missing kid, suicide...

393
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,310
You must feel like a big\Ncity cop again, huh, Chief?

394
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,770
Well, I mostly dealt\Nwith strangers back then.

395
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,020
Benny was my friend.

396
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,100
Hello?

397
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,610
Yeah.

398
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,030
- Can I help you?\N- Yeah, is Lonnie around?

399
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,110
- Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?\N- To look around.

400
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,700
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!\N- I'll be fast.

401
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,120
Hey, Will?

402
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,580
Will!

403
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,750
Will, you here? Will!

404
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,880
Get off!

405
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,630
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

406
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,840
Will someone please explain\Nwhat the hell is going on?

407
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,100
Jonathan, Cynthia.\NCynthia, this is Jonathan.

408
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
My oldest.

409
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,140
- Come here.\N- Get off me, man.

410
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,620
- Are you out of your mind?\N- Just listen to me.

411
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
- You are out of your mind!\N- She knows about Will.

412
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,430
What do you mean she knows about Will?

413
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,460
She pointed at him, at his picture.\NShe knew he was missing. I could tell.

414
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,420
- You could tell?\N- Just think about it.

415
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,710
Do you really think it was a coincidence\Nthat we found her on Mirkwood,

416
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,420
the same place where Will disappeared?

417
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,800
- That is weird.\N- And she said bad people are after her.

418
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,180
I think maybe these bad people\Nare the same ones that took Will.

419
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,640
- I think she knows what happened to him.\N- Then why doesn't she tell us?

420
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,850
Do you know where he is?

421
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,340
Do you know where Will is?

422
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,750
- Stop it, you're scaring her!\N- She should be scared!

423
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,320
If you know where he is, tell us!

424
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,200
This is nuts. We have\Nto take her to your mom.

425
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,700
No! Eleven said telling any\Nadult would put us in danger.

426
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,200
- What kind of danger?\N- Her name is Eleven?

427
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,790
- El for short.\N- Mike, what kind of danger?

428
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,500
Danger danger.

429
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,250
No, no, no!

430
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,090
We're going back to plan\NA. We're telling your mom.

431
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,770
No.

432
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,700
Take a look at this beaut.\NShould've seen it when I got it.

433
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,660
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

434
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,530
Really? You want to\Ncheck up my ass, too?

435
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,040
I told you the same thing\Nas I told those cops,

436
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,710
he's not here and he never has been.

437
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,790
- Then why didn't you call Mom back?\N- I don't know, I just...

438
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,380
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

439
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,000
You know, he was lost or something.

440
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,340
That boy never was very good\Nat taking care of himself.

441
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,550
This isn't some joke, all right?\NThere are search parties, reporters...

442
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,970
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

443
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,180
Tell your mother she's gotta\Nget you out of that hellhole.

444
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,230
Come out here to the city.

445
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,940
People are more real here, you know?

446
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,730
And then I could see you more.

447
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,360
- What, you think I don't want to see you?\N- I know you don't.

448
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,490
See, that's your mother\Ntalkin' right there.

449
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,870
She even know you're here?

450
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,910
Oh, great.

451
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,700
So one kid goes missing,\Nthe other one runs wild?

452
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,580
Some real fine parenting right there.

453
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,420
Look, all I'm saying is, maybe\NI'm not the asshole, all right?

454
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,800
In case you forgot what he looks like.

455
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,140
He's kinda cute, hmm?

456
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,270
Maybe I'll trade you in\Nfor the younger model?

457
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,410
Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

458
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,230
You, uh, notice anything...

459
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,650
odd about him the last few weeks?

460
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,990
No, we're fixin' to go fishing\Ndown the Etowah next Sunday.

461
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,200
I mean, he was lookin'\Nforward to it. I know that.

462
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,490
He got any enemies you might know about?

463
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,660
I mean, people who might\Nnot want him around?

464
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,750
The exes didn't like him\Nmuch. That's for sure, but...

465
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,290
nah.

466
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,130
- When was the last time you saw him?\N- Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

467
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,470
- Just you and the boys?\N- Yep.

468
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,630
Me and Henry and...

469
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,470
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

470
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,600
No kid did this.

471
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,600
Kid?

472
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,480
What are you talking about?

473
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:00,480
Yeah. At lunch, uh, there\Nwas this boy that, uh...

474
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,320
I mean, he was trying to steal\Nfood out of Benny's kitchen.

475
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,780
Can you imagine that?

476
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,780
This kid...

477
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,540
what'd he look like?

478
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, he was about yea\Nhigh. You know, tiny like.

479
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,760
I didn't get a good look at him,\Nthough. He was back in the kitchen.

480
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,250
He look like this?

481
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,720
Oh, no, that's... That's\NLonnie's missin' kid.

482
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,840
No. This was a different kid.

483
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,390
This one had really short hair.

484
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,550
I mean, it was buzzed\Nnearly down to the scalp.

485
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,270
Yeah, well, let's... You know,\Nlet's forget about the haircut.

486
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,440
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

487
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,900
could it be Lonnie's kid?

488
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,940
Well, I... I didn't\Nget a good look at him.

489
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,900
About the right height, though.

490
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,650
I mean, could've been.

491
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,410
Yeah, that's...

492
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,490
Could've been.

493
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,710
Because I don't want to go by myself.

494
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,960
Barb... Barb, it's not rocket science.

495
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,420
You just tell your parents you're\Ngonna stay at my place afterwards.

496
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,380
No, tell them we're... studying.

497
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,180
Nancy! Dinner!

498
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,970
Coming!

499
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,720
Look, I gotta go. I'll\Nsee you in an hour.

500
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,070
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

501
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,990
Oh, no, I had two bologna\Nsandwiches for lunch.

502
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
I don't know why.

503
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,740
Me, too.

504
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,290
- It's delicious, Mommy.\N- Thank you, sweetie.

505
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,750
So, there's this...

506
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,330
special assembly thing tonight...

507
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,710
for Will at the school field.

508
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,800
Barb's driving.

509
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,050
Why am I just hearing about this?

510
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,970
I thought you knew.

511
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,140
I told you, I don't want you out\Nafter dark until Will is found.

512
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,560
I know, I know, but it'd be\Nsuper weird if I'm not there.

513
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,680
I mean, everyone's going.

514
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,860
Just... be back by 10:00.

515
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,590
Why don't you take the boys, too?

516
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,830
- No! -\NMmm-mmm.

517
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,490
Don't you think you\Nshould be there? For Will?

518
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,790
Sorry. Spasm.

519
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,920
Oh...

520
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,210
It's okay, Holly.

521
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,130
- It's just a loud noise.\N- Nice.

522
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,130
Will!

523
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,430
Better come out, buddy.\NWill, where are ya?

524
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,650
Hey, you think Earl really saw Will?

525
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,700
I mean, what's he doin'\Nwith a shaved head?

526
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,360
And stealing food from Benny?

527
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,120
Tell you what, when\Nwe find him, we'll ask.

528
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,830
Can't ask a corpse questions.

529
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,700
Hold up!

530
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,250
You got something?

531
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,540
- Hey, what do you got?\N- Not sure.

532
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,550
Maybe nothing.

533
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,550
I found this. In there.

534
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,430
No way a kid crawls through there.

535
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,180
I don't know...

536
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,640
a scared enough one might.

537
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,100
His brother said he was good at hiding.

538
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
El?

539
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,980
No adults. Just us and some meatloaf.

540
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,570
Don't worry. They won't\Ntell anyone about you.

541
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,070
They promise. Right?

542
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,700
We never would've upset you\Nif we knew you had superpowers.

543
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,080
Ow!

544
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,790
What Dustin is trying to say is that\Nthey were just scared... earlier.

545
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,920
That's all.

546
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,920
We just wanted to find our friend.

547
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,550
"Friend"?

548
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,510
Yeah, friend. Will?

549
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,890
What is "friend"?

550
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,390
Is she serious?

551
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,480
Um, a friend...

552
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,310
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

553
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,520
You lend them your cool stuff,\Nlike comic books and trading cards.

554
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,900
And they never break a promise.

555
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,900
- Especially when there's spit.\N- Spit?

556
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,740
A spit swear means...\Nyou never break your word.

557
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,240
It's a bond.

558
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,990
That's super important,\Nbecause friends...

559
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,330
they tell each other things.

560
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,160
Things that parents don't know.

561
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,050
- Barbara, pull over.\N- What?

562
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,420
Pull over!

563
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,010
What are we doing here?

564
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,680
His house is three blocks away.

565
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,220
We can't park in the driveway.

566
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,350
Are you serious?

567
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,630
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

568
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,350
This is so stupid. I'm\Njust gonna drop you off.

569
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,270
Calm down, Barb. Come on.

570
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,900
You promised that\Nyou'd go. You're coming.

571
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,240
We're gonna have a great time.

572
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,860
He just wants to get in your pants.

573
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,570
No, he doesn't.

574
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,950
Nance... seriously.

575
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,120
He invited you to his house.

576
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,120
His parents aren't home.

577
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,460
Come on, you are not this stupid.

578
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,540
Tommy H. And Carol are gonna be there.

579
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,710
Tommy and Carol have been having\Nsex since, like, seventh grade.

580
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,670
It'll probably just\Nbe, like, a big orgy.

581
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,720
- Gross.\N- I'm serious!

582
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,090
All right, well...

583
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,350
you can be, like, my\Nguardian. All right?

584
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,890
Make sure I don't get drunk\Nand do anything stupid.

585
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
Ugh.

586
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,520
Is that a new bra?

587
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,320
No.

588
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,750
Barb, chill.

589
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,040
I'm chill.

590
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,510
Hello, ladies.

591
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,080
What are you doing?

592
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,590
It's freezing.

593
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,840
You ever feel cursed?

594
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,350
You know, the last person to\Ngo missing here was in, uh...

595
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,730
the summer of '23.

596
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,690
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

597
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,450
When'd the last person freeze to death?

598
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,160
Hey, come back inside.

599
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,250
Warm me up. Just...

600
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,460
Just give me a minute out here.

601
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,900
What's the weirdo doing?

602
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,990
El?

603
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,680
Will.

604
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
Superpowers.

605
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,400
Did you see him? On Mirkwood?

606
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,020
Do you know where he is?

607
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,620
I don't understand.

608
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,710
Hiding.

609
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,460
Will is hiding?

610
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,800
From the bad men?

611
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,390
Then from who?

612
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,580
Where are you?

613
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,940
One! Two!

614
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,700
- Three!\N- Stop it, Tommy, no! Don't!

615
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,450
You're such an asshole, Tommy.

616
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,380
Is that supposed to impress me?

617
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,260
- You're not?\N- You are a cliché, you do realize that?

618
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,390
You are a cliché.

619
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,890
What with your... your\Ngrades and your band practice.

620
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,390
I'm so not in band.

621
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,400
Okay, party girl. Why don't you\Njust, uh, show us how it's done, then?

622
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Okay.

623
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,730
- You gotta make a little hole right in...\N- I got it.

624
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,970
Yeah, she's smart, you douche!

625
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,580
Chug, chug, chug.

626
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,120
Chug. Chug. Chug.

627
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,930
Barb, you wanna try?

628
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,310
What? No.

629
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,640
No, I don't want to. Thanks.

630
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,850
- Come on.\N- Yeah...

631
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,270
- Come on. Yeah.\N- Nance, I don't want to.

632
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,060
- It's fun! Just give it a...\N- Nance...

633
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,810
Just... Just give it a shot.

634
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,070
Okay.

635
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,780
So you just...

636
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,540
- Gnarly.\N- Are you okay?

637
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,260
- Yeah.\N- Barb, you're bleeding.

638
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,130
I'm fine. Where's your bathroom?

639
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,800
Oh, it's... It's, uh, down\Npast the kitchen, to the left.

640
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,460
Okay. Thanks.

641
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,970
Oh.

642
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,980
Oh, my, God! What the hell, Tommy?

643
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,070
No!

644
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,610
Whoo!

645
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,820
Hello?

646
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,610
Hello.

647
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,530
Who is this?

648
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,870
Will?

649
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,080
Will, it's me.

650
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,920
Talk to me.

651
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,380
I'm here.

652
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,340
Just tell me where you are, honey.

653
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,380
I can hear you. Please.

654
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,050
Mom?

655
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,510
Will!

656
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,220
Yes, it's me. It's me.

657
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,600
Where are you? Where are\Nyou? Just talk to me...

658
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,310
Oh, no, no!

659
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,440
No!

660
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,030
No!

661
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,820
Oh, no! No, no...

662
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,990
No!

663
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,960
No!

664
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:08,850
Jonathan?

665
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,480
What...

666
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,220
Will...

667
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,980
Will...

668
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,780
Will, is that you?

669
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,430
Oh, my God.

670
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,720
Oh, God...

671
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,810
Oh, my God...

672
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,900
I'm freezing.

673
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,280
Hmm... well, I hear his\Nmom's room has a fireplace.

674
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,000
- Are you kidding?\N- Oh, yeah?

675
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,030
Okay, well, you know, you\Nare cleaning the sheets.

676
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,370
- You all right?\N- Yeah.

677
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,120
Yeah? Come on, let's\Nget you some dry clothes.

678
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,960
Nance!

679
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,380
Nancy.

680
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,090
Where are you going?

681
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,220
Nowhere.

682
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,130
Just... upstairs.

683
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,840
To change.

684
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,680
I... fell in the pool.

685
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,310
Why don't you go ahead and go home.

686
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,770
I'll just... I'll get\Na ride or something.

687
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,230
Nance...

688
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,690
Barb...

689
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,360
I'm fine.

690
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,860
This isn't you.

691
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,610
I'm fine.

692
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,280
Just... go ahead and go home, okay?

693
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,430
Thanks.

694
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,770
Um...

695
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,480
some privacy, maybe?

696
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,070
Oh...

697
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,780
Yeah, right. Sorry.

698
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,570
Steve?

699
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:07,760
Damn.

700
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,340
Shut up.
