00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,570
That is not your decision.

185
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,120
They're spending entirely too much\Ntime together.

186
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,420
You agree with me about that, right?

187
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,370
Well, I mean, they're just kissing, right?

188
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,170
Yeah, but it is constant.

189
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,550
It is constant.

190
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,420
Okay? That is not normal,

191
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,050
that is not healthy.

192
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,770
You can't just force them apart.

193
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,050
I mean,\Nthey're not little kids anymore, Hop.

194
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,300
They're teenagers.

195
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,900
If you order them around like a cop,\Nthen they're gonna rebel.

196
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,320
It's just what they do.

197
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,900
So what, I'm just supposed to\Nlet them do whatever they want?

198
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,070
No, I didn't say that.\NI think you should... talk to them.

199
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,480
No. No. 'Cause talking doesn't work.

200
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,150
Not yelling. Not ordering.

201
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,870
But talk to them.

202
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,370
You know, like a heart-to-heart.

203
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,370
A heart-to-heart?

204
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,120
What is that?

205
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,800
You sit them down and you talk to them,\Nlike you're their friend.

206
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,620
I find if you talk to them\Nlike you're on their level,

207
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,220
then they really start to listen.

208
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,750
And then, you know,\Nyou could start to create some boundaries.

209
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,300
- Boundaries.\N- Yeah, but,

210
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,220
Hop, it's really important\Nthat no matter how they respond,

211
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,470
you stay calm.

212
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,800
You cannot lose your temper.

213
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,850
Uh...

214
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,270
Maybe you could do it for me?

215
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,520
No.

216
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,920
Yeah, you could. Yeah, you could.\NYou come over after work.

217
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,450
- Yes.\N- No.

218
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,120
It only works if it comes from you.

219
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,870
But...

220
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,450
- But?\N- Maybe I can help you...

221
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,080
find the right words.

222
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,130
♪ Ooh, whoa! ♪

223
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,550
♪ Some days won't end ever\NAnd some days pass on by ♪

224
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,300
♪ I'll be workin' here forever... ♪

225
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,970
- Thanks, hon.\N- For you.

226
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
For you.

227
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,320
- Thanks.\N- Welcome.

228
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,600
Oh, no, no, no, no! Nancy!

229
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,450
Sorry.

230
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,530
- How 'bout a piece on Iran?\N- I want something local.

231
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,000
I hear there's a beauty pageant\Nat the fair this year.

232
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,620
Yeah, I'm looking for above the fold here,\NBruce.

233
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,580
Then clearly you haven't seen\NLucy Lebrock,

234
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,000
because I'm not sure she'll fit\Nabove the fold!

235
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,300
Fellas!

236
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,620
In six hours, we go to print.\NI need something real.

237
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,050
Oh, I think they're real.

238
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,220
What about Starcourt?

239
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,430
I... I was just...

240
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
thinking...

241
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,270
I mean, I know everyone\Nloves the mall, but...

242
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,770
how many small businesses have closed\Nsince it opened?

243
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,900
Like, five on Main, at least.

244
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,070
It's changing the fabric of our town

245
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,320
- in a way...\N- "The Death of Small-Town America."

246
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,320
I like it.

247
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,700
I like it a lot.

248
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,920
But I think I've got something\Neven spicier.

249
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,300
It's about the missing mustard\Non my hamburger.

250
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,000
You think you can follow the clues

251
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,820
and solve the case\Nof the missing condiment, Nancy Drew?

252
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Sorry.

253
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,880
Look out, Phil,\Nshe might be after your job!

254
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,330
Ow, ow, ow. Ow.

255
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,730
Better?

256
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,180
Still stings.

257
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,930
Is that a new zit?

258
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,330
What is wrong with you?

259
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,280
I was just asking!

260
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,630
I call it... the Forever Clock.

261
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,630
All right? Powered by wind.\NVery useful in the apocalypse.

262
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Then, I give you...

263
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,880
the Slammer.

264
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,230
Pretty neat, huh?

265
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,380
But this...

266
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,670
this is my masterpiece.

267
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,680
I would like you to meet...

268
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,530
Cerebro.

269
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
What exactly are we looking at here?

270
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,980
An unassembled one-of-a-kind\Nbattery-powered radio tower.

271
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,080
So, it's a... a ham radio.

272
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,580
The Cadillac of ham radios.

273
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
This baby carries\Na crystal-clear connection

274
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,780
over vast distances.

275
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,830
I'm talking North Pole to South.

276
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,680
I can talk to my girlfriend\Nwhenever and wherever I choose.

277
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,630
Girlfriend?

278
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,480
Wait, so her name is Suzie?

279
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,480
Suzie with a "z." She's from Utah.

280
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,880
Girls go to science camp?

281
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,230
- Suzie does. She's a genius.\N- Is she cute?

282
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,430
Think Phoebe Cates, only hotter.

283
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,930
- What's going on?\N- Going to talk to Dustin's girlfriend.

284
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,380
Girlfriend?

285
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Alrighty, one scoop of chocolate.\NThat's a buck-twenty-five.

286
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,580
Anything else?

287
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,380
Ooh, Purdue.

288
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,580
- Fancy.\N- Yeah, I'm excited.

289
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,680
Yeah, you know, I considered it,

290
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,930
Purdue, but then I was like,\Nyou know what?

291
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,030
I really think I need some real-life\Nexperience, you know,

292
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,430
before I hit college,\Nsee what it feels like.

293
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,930
Kinda like, uh, I don't know,

294
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,580
see what it's like to earn\Na working-man's wage, you know? Uh...

295
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,130
Oh, I'm sorry.

296
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,630
- I think that's, like, really important.\N- Yeah, totally.

297
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,430
Yeah, anyway, this was, like, so fun.

298
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,380
We should kind of like, you know,\NI don't know,

299
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,780
maybe hang out this weekend or...

300
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,580
Oh, sorry about that. Uh...

301
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,380
I don't know. Maybe next weekend or...

302
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,230
Yeah, I'm busy.

303
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,530
Oh, that's cool. I'm...

304
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,330
I'm working here next weekend, so...

305
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,680
the following weekend's better for me.

306
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,730
No. I'm sorry, I can't.

307
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,030
Okay. Thanks.

308
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,330
I...

309
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,730
This is... my first day here.

310
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,280
And another one bites the dust.

311
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,780
You are oh-for-six, Popeye.

312
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,380
Yeah, yeah, I can count.

313
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,230
You know that means you suck.

314
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,780
Yep, I can read, too.

315
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,030
Since when?

316
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,680
It's this stupid hat.

317
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,280
I am telling you,\Nit is totally blowing my best feature.

318
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,780
Yeah, company policy is a real drag.

319
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,680
You know, it's a crazy idea,\Nbut have you considered...

320
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,280
telling the truth?

321
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,330
Oh, you mean,\Nthat I couldn't even get into Tech

322
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,680
and my douchebag dad's\Ntrying to teach me a lesson,

323
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,530
I make three bucks an hour,\Nand I have no future? That truth?

324
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,880
Hey, twelve o'clock.

325
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,580
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Okay... Uh...

326
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,980
I'm going in. Okay?

327
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
And you know what?

328
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,780
- Screw company policy.\N- Oh, my God, you're a whole new man.

329
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,230
Right? Ooh.

330
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,430
Ahoy, ladies! Didn't see you there.

331
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,380
Would you guys like to set sail\Non this ocean of flavor with me?

332
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,630
I'll be your captain.

333
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,130
I'm Steve Harrington.

334
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,430
Oh, God.

335
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,780
Can I get you guys a little taste\Nof the Cherries Jubilee?

336
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,280
No? Anybody?

337
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,830
Banana Boat? Four people, four spoons?

338
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,380
Share it in the booth?\NAnybody? It's hot out there.

339
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,480
I know this is\Na difficult conversation to have...

340
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,530
but I hope you know that I...\Ncare about you very much.

341
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,030
- And I know that you...\N- Eye contact.

342
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,530
And I know that you...

343
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,380
both care about each other very much.

344
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,880
This does not sound like me at all.

345
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,830
Just keep going. Come on.

346
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,080
Which is why I think it's important\Nto establish these boundaries...

347
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,980
moving forward...

348
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,830
No looking. You know this.

349
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,080
Come on.

350
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,730
...so we can build an environment...

351
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,180
uh...

352
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,280
where we...

353
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,280
all feel comfortable

354
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,480
and trusted

355
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,330
and open...

356
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,830
"Share our feelings..."

357
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,480
...to sharing our feelings...\NThis isn't gonna work.

358
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,330
Um, it's not gonna work.\NIt's not gonna work.

359
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,580
Yes, it will! I promise.

360
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,930

You're crazy!

544
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,250
Crazy?

545
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,950
You want to see real crazy?

546
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,750
You disrespect me again.

547
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,750
Okay?

548
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,950
Here's what's gonna happen.

549
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,850
I'm gonna drive you home.

550
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,300
And I'm gonna speak...

551
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,750
and you're going to listen.

552
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,800
And then, maybe...

553
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,200
maybe by the end of it,\Nmaybe if you're lucky, maybe...

554
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,900
I will continue

555
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:41,900
to allow you to date my daughter.

556
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,800
Nod if you understand!

557
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,550

558
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,100
Suzie! This is Dustin. Do you copy? Over.

559
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,300
Suzie, this is your Dustin.\NDo you copy? Over.

560
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:14,450
- Suzie...\N- Dustin, come on! She's not there.

561
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,100
She's there, all right? She'll pick up.

562
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,800
- Maybe Cerebro doesn't work.\N- Or maybe Suzie doesn't exist.

563
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,800
She exists!

564
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,200
She's a genius\Nand she's hotter than Phoebe Cates?

565
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,600
No girl is that perfect.

566
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Is that so?

567
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,750
I mean...

568
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,050

00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,850
In your special... your own special way.

571
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,700
Relax, I was teasing.

572
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm obviously perfect\Nand Dustin's obviously lying.

573
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,750
Come on, Don Juan.

Um... it's late.
