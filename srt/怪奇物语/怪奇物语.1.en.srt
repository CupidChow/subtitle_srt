1
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,300
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

2
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,050
- Move it.\N- Let's get out of here!

3
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,150
Headed down Poplar, toward Main.

4
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,090
- Get 'em off of us, Mick!\N- I'm working on it!

5
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,750
- The alley. To your right.\N- Okay.

6
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,350
Shit!

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,850
Shit! Shit! Shit!

8
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,800
Shit!

9
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,120
Okay. Okay.

10
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,670
- Son of a bitch! We got more!\N- Oh, shit!

11
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,820
They're headed down 7th.

12
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,620
Do something, Kali. Do something!

13
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,920
Next right. There's a tunnel. Take it.

14
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,690
We got these bastards now!

15
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,870
Boom.

16
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,620
Holy shit!

17
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,250
Shit! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,700
What the hell is wrong with you,\NAdams? The hell are you doing?

19
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,950
Adams! Come on. What\Nthe hell? Why'd you stop?

20
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,320
Adams! Adams!

21
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,050
Adams, I'm talkin' to you!

22
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,000
Adams! Adams!

23
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,700
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

24
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,420
A police chase rocked downtown\NPittsburgh earlier this evening...

25
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,170
- Another stupid penny!\N- Dusty, watch it! You almost hit Mews.

26
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,300
- Can I please check under your cushions?\N- Dusty.

27
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,170
Mom, please? It's an emergency!

28
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,770
Who's your buddy? Who's your buddy?

29
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,350
Love you, Mom.

30
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,720
Lucas, you copy? I've got four\Nquarters. What's your haul?

31
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,740
Take your puny haul\Nand multiply it by five.

32
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,820
- How?\N- While you were scrounging around

33
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,370
like a homeless bum, I mowed\NOld Man Humphrey's lawn.

34
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,870
Old Man Humphrey's got that kinda cash?

35
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,820
- Just call Mike already.\N- You call Mike.

36
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,870
I have to go take a shower from\Ndoing real work, like a man.

37
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,040
Over and out.

38
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,590
Mike, do you copy? Mike, do you copy?

39
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,050
Yeah. Yeah, I copy.

40
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,420
- What are you doing on this channel?\N- Nothing.

41
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,920
Lucas and I have six bucks total.

42
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,390
- What's your haul?\N- Shit! I don't know yet.

43
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,390
- What do you mean you don't know yet?\N- Hold on. Call Will.

44
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,650
What the hell are you doing?

45
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,820
I'll pay you back!

46
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,120
- Bye!\N- Mike!

47
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,040
- Mike! Get back here!\N- Hey. No running in the house.

48
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,700
What is going on?

49
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,200
Mike! Mike!

50
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,920
Asshole!

51
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,700
- Hey!\N- Okay. So, I'll pick you up in two hours.

52
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,120
- That's 9:00 on the dot, okay?\N- Okay.

53
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,990
If anything happens, if\Nyou need to come home,

54
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,290
just ask them to use their\Nphone and call home. Okay?

55
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,820
- Don't...\N- Don't walk or bike home. I know.

56
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,120
- Okay, but, sweetie...\N- Mom, I have to go.

57
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,450
Have fun.

58
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,350
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

59
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,890
Oh, Jesus! I'm in unchartered\Nterritory here, guys.

60
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,620
- Down! Down! Down!\N- I'm going! I'm going!

61
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,870
I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!

62
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,100
Okay. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

63
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,550
No. No. No!

64
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,720
No! No! No! I hate this\Noverpriced bullshit!

65
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,900
Son of a bitch! Piece of shit!

66
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,450
You're not nimble enough.\NBut you'll get there one day.

67
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,750
But until then, Princess\NDaphne is still mine.

68
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,100
Whatever. I'm still tops\Non Centipede and Dig Dug.

69
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,320
You sure about that?

70
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,970
Sure about what?

71
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,550
You're kidding me. No, no, no.

72
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,970
Move! Move! No, no, no,\Nno, no. Hey, no! No! No!

73
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,300
- 751,300 points!\N- That's impossible.

74
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,950
- Who is Mad Max?\N- Better than you.

75
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,850
- Is it you?\N- You know I despise Dig Dug.

76
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,800
- Then who is it?\N- Yeah, spill it, Keith.

77
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,100
You want information, then\NI need something in return.

78
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,100
No, no, no. No way. You're\Nnot getting a date with her.

79
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,900
Mike, come on. Just get him the date.

80
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,750
I'm not prostituting my sister!

81
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,400
- But it's for a good cause.\N- No, don't get him the date. Know what?

82
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,300
He's gonna spread his nasty-ass\Nrash to your whole family.

83
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,850
Acne isn't a rash and it isn't\Ncontagious, you prepubescent wastoid.

84
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,050
Oh, I'm a wastoid? She\Nwouldn't go on a date with you.

85
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,550
You make, like, what? $2.50 an hour?

86
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,500
- Nice perm.\N- Gonna make fun of my hair?

87
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,850
Hey. Hey, guys, do you see the...

88
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,000
Will! Are you okay?

89
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,050
Yeah. I just...

90
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,200
- I needed some air.\N- Come on. You're up on Dig Dug.

91
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
Let's take that top score back, huh?

92
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,100
Good morning, Jim.

93
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,550
- Jim. Hold on a second. We need to talk.\N- Get away from me.

94
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,850
Okay, no... I think you\Nreally wanna hear this.

95
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,150
- Get away from me.\N- Trust me. I only want five minutes!

96
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,700
Yeah, I want a date with Bo\NDerek. We all want things.

97
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,550
This isn't a laughing matter, Jim.

98
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,200
This is serious, okay?

99
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I really got something\Nhere. I'm telling you!

100
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
- Hey. Mornin', Chief.\N- Morning.

101
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,750
Morning, Murray.

102
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,400
Got any proof on your\Nbutt-probin' aliens yet, Murray?

103
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,800
I believe there was, and may still be,

104
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,750
a Russian spy presence in Hawkins.

105
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,300
Russian spies!

106
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,350
Are the spies in\Ncahoots with the aliens?

107
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,950
Or how do they fit\Nin here? I'm confused.

108
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,850
I'm talking multiple reports\Nnow. Multiple reports, okay?

109
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,540
Of a Russian child in Hawkins.

110
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,620
- A child? What are you talking about?\N- A girl who may have psionic abilities.

111
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,120
- "Psionic"?\N- Psychic.

112
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,290
What about that girl that\Nmade that kid pee himself?

113
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,240
- A prank.\N- What girl?

114
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,620
Wasn't a prank.

115
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,490
You got five minutes. Not a second more.

116
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,670
I talked to a Big Buy ex-employee

117
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,390
who said some little girl\Nshattered the door with her mind.

118
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,340
I heard that story.

119
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,720
Did you hear the one about the fat man\Nwith the beard who climbs down chimneys?

120
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,290
Then last month, a co-worker\Nof Ted Wheeler's claims

121
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,840
some Russian girl with a shaved\Nhead was hiding in his basement.

122
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,170
Ted now denies this.

123
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,810
- Oh, wow. That's a surprise.\N- But it connects.

124
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,310
- Enlighten me.\N- This girl,

125
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,970
she's some kind of a\NRussian weapon, right?

126
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,110
Barbara sees this girl,\Ntries to help her, perhaps.

127
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,070
But before she can, the\NRussians find them, take them...

128
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,190
Wait. You're telling me Barbara\NHolland was kidnapped by Russian spies.

129
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,820
- Kidnapped. Killed.\N- Killed?

130
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,320
- Don't you get it, Jim?\N- No.

131
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,460
This has potentially\Ninternational implications.

132
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,090
I'm talking a full-on Russian\Ninvasion right here in Hawkins.

133
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,260
Do you have any proof of this girl?\NI mean, has anybody seen her recently?

134
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,470
These are separate...

135
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,760
Excuse me. Sorry.

136
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,970
- Okay.\N- Hello?

137
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,670
Merrill called, wants you\Nto check out his pumpkins.

138
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,840
- Says they've been contaminated...\N- All right.

139
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,860
By his vengeful neighbor,\NEugene. You're welcome.

140
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,020
I'm sorry. I really hate\Nto do this, but I gotta run.

141
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,320
- It's an emergency.\N- You gave me five minutes.

142
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,190
Yeah, listen, you know what? I\Nliked your alien theory a lot better.

143
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,860
And you want my advice?

144
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,020
Why don't you stop bleeding those\Npeople dry and go home? All right?

145
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,960
- I am not bleeding anyone... dry.\N- Listen to me. Go home.

146
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,590
It's crap, I know.

147
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,220
No, it's not crap.

148
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,340
- It's not good.\N- It's going to be.

149
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,170
Just... It needs some reorganizing.

150
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,090
- Can I mark on it?\N- Yeah, I guess.

151
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,810
So, in the first paragraph,

152
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,890
you used the basketball\Ngame versus Northern

153
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,610
as a metaphor for your\Nlife, which is great.

154
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,790
But then, around here,

155
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,270
you start talking about your\Ngranddad's experiences in the war.

156
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,660
And I... I don't see\Nhow they're connected.

157
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,070
It connects because...

158
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,490
because, you know, we both won.

159
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,970
- Do you think I should start from scratch?\N- No. I mean...

160
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,920
When's the deadline?

161
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,840
It's tomorrow for early application.

162
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,170
Can you come and help me tonight?

163
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,370
We have our dinner tonight, remember?

164
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,020
- Oh, my God!\N- We already canceled last week.

165
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,470
- You don't have to go. Just work on this.\N- No, no, no. What's the point?

166
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,890
- Hey, calm down.\N- I'm calm. I'm calm.

167
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,610
I'm just being honest.\NYou know, I mean...

168
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,320
- I'll end up working for my dad anyway.\N- That's not true.

169
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,190
I don't know, Nance. Is\Nthat such a bad thing?

170
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,910
There's insurance and benefits\Nand all that adult stuff.

171
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,420
And if I took it, you know, I could\Nbe around for your senior year.

172
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,620
- Steve...\N- Just to look after you a little bit.

173
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,720
Make sure you don't forget\Nabout this pretty face.

174
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,590
Nance, I'm serious.

175
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,070
- I love you.\N- I love you, too.

176
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,220
Who is that?

177
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,970
I have no idea.

178
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,970
But would you check out that ass?

179
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,370
Just look at it go.

180
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,070
Meet the human brain.

181
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,470
I know. I know, it\Ndoesn't look like much.

182
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,420
A little gross even,\Nright? But consider this.

183
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,970
There are a hundred billion cells\Ninside of this miracle of evolution.

184
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,470
All working as one.

185
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,270
No, no, I did not\Nmisspeak. I did not stutter.

186
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,670
A hundred billion.

187
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,020
Ah, this must be our new student.

188
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,620
Indeed. All yours.

189
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,020
All right. Hold up. You\Ndon't get away that easy.

190
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,620
Come on up. Don't be shy.

191
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,670
Dustin, drum roll.

192
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,970
Class, please welcome, all\Nthe way from sunny California,

193
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,920
the latest passenger to join us\Non our curiosity voyage, Maxine.

194
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,220
- It's Max.\N- Sorry?

195
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,920
Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max.

196
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,770
- Mad Max.\N- Well, all aboard, Max.

197
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,120
- Hey, there.\N- Hey.

198
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,670
Do you have these in any other\Ncolors? I'm not a big fan of orange.

199
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,120
Hmm...

200
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,320
I'll have to check in back.

201
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,420
Oh, shit!

202
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,020
- You're gonna get me fired.\N- That's my master plan.

203
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,720
Get you fired so I can hire you\Nand we won't have to hide back here.

204
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,870
Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work.

205
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,770
I know. I'm sorry. I can't\Nstop thinking about you.

206
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,270
- It's crazy. I feel like a teenager.\N- Me, too.

207
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,820
You know, in high school,\Nyou didn't know who I was.

208
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,770
Come on.

209
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,770
Bob, I have to get back to work.

210
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,070
Okay.

211
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,320
Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies,

212
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,520
and I'll see you\Ntonight for movie night.

213
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,870
Jonathan's night to pick?

214
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,120
- Yes.\N- Okay.

215
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,170
- Okay. Okay.\N- Okay.

216
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,370
Hey, look, a green one.

217
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,370
Tell Jonathan not to pick anything\Nscary. I hate scary movies.

218
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,160
You're saying this was fine yesterday?

219
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,240
Fine?

220
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,210
These were prize winners,\NChief. You should've seen 'em.

221
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,660
For the life of me, I couldn't\Nfigure out what happened.

222
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,890
And then I remembered... Eugene.

223
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,180
What about him?

224
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,840
He's been complaining about me to\Njust about anyone who'll listen.

225
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,590
Why's that?

226
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,810
Well, he started this\N"Pick Your Pumpkin" thing.

227
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,440
Acted like it was trademarked.

228
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,640
I said, "Hire yourself a damn\Nlawyer. See how far that gets you."

229
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,060
You're telling me that nice old Eugene

230
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,360
came out here after dark and\Ndoused your field with poison?

231
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,560
Not Eugene himself.

232
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,610
- I'm thinking one of his field hands.\N- Uh-huh.

233
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,160
Listen, Chief, I don't go throwing\Naround accusations lightly. You know me.

234
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,540
This happening the day before\NHalloween, when sales are peaking?

235
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,130
That's a hell of a coincidence.

236
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,380
Hell of a coincidence.

237
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,930
You got somebody working on that field?

238
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,930
Yeah, screw you, too.

239
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,260
Hey. Be there.

240
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,440
- Hey, Nancy.\N- Hey! Thanks.

241
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,560
- Oh, could I get one more?\N- Yeah, sure.

242
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,030
You're coming to this.

243
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,940
"Come and get sheet faced."

244
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,410
No, I'm not.

245
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:49,240
I can't let you sit all alone\NHalloween. That's just not acceptable.

246
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,960
Well, you can relax.\NI'm not gonna be alone.

247
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,790
I'm going trick-or-treating with Will.

248
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,590
- All night?\N- Yeah.

249
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,210
No, no way. You're\Ngonna be home by 8:00,

250
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,930
listening to the Talking Heads\Nand reading Vonnegut or something.

251
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,560
Sounds like a nice night.

252
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,910
Jonathan, just come. I mean, who knows,

253
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,010
you might even, like, meet someone.

254
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,990
- Oh, my God! Take those stupid things off.\N- I missed you.

255
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,310
- It's been like an hour.\N- Tell me about it.

256
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,960
Okay. Okay, okay. God.

257
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
Sorry.

258
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,880
- There's no way that's Mad Max.\N- Yeah. Girls don't play video games.

259
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,460
And even if they did, you can't\Nget 750,000 points on Dig Dug.

260
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,710
- It's impossible.\N- But her name is Max.

261
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,590
- So what?\N- So, how many Maxes do you know?

262
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,890
- I don't know.\N- Zero. That's how many.

263
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,140
She shows up at school

264
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,090
the day after someone with her\Nsame name breaks our top score.

265
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,040
- I mean, you kidding me?\N- Exactly. So she's gotta be Mad Max.

266
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,460
And plus she skateboards,\Nso she's pretty awesome.

267
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,010
Awesome? You haven't\Neven spoken a word to her.

268
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,940
I don't have to. I mean, look at\Nher. Shit, I've lost the target.

269
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,490
Oh! There.

270
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,340
Got it. There we go.

271
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,590
"Stop spying on me, creeps."

272
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,890
Well, shit.

273
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,910
William Byers.

274
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,640
Your mother's here.

275
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,940
You guys think he's okay?

276
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,290
He's always weird when he has to go in.

277
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,940
I don't know. He's quiet today.

278
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,940
He's always quiet.

279
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,590
You feeling any better?

280
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,390
Will?

281
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,390
Huh?

282
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,840
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

283
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,690
Hey. What did we talk about, huh?\NYou've got to stop it with the sorries.

284
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,090
Sorry. I mean, yeah, I know.

285
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,940
And listen, you know, there's\Nnothing to be nervous about, you know.

286
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,290
Just tell 'em what you felt\Nlast night and what you saw.

287
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,340
Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole\Ntime. So it's gonna be okay. Okay?

288
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
Okay.

289
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,090
- Hey, buddy.\N- Hey.

290
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,640
Hey.

291
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,940
Sir Will, how are you?

292
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,740
Mom. Pop.

293
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,440
Let's take a look, see\Nwhat's going on here.

294
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,110
I see you shaved off a\Npound since we saw you last.

295
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,950
Must be making room for\Nall that Halloween candy.

296
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,260
What's your favorite candy?

297
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,780
Desert island candy,\Nif you had to pick one?

298
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,330
- I don't know.\N- Come on.

299
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,330
Life or death situation,\Nwhat would you pick?

300
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,100
- I guess... Reese's Pieces.\N- Reese's Pieces.

301
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,530
Good call. Good call.

302
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,900
I'm more of a Mounds guy,

303
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,410
but I gotta say, peanut butter and\Nchocolate, come on, hard to beat that.

304
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,330
All right, tell me\Nwhat's going on with you.

305
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,010
Tell me about this episode you had.

306
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Well, my friends were there\Nand then they just weren't,

307
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,700
and I was back there again.

308
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,950
In the Upside Down?

309
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,360
All right, so what happened next?

310
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:15,160
I heard this noise, and so I\Nwent outside, and it was worse.

311
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,410
How was it worse?

312
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,230
There was this storm.

313
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,950
Okay. So how did you feel\Nwhen you saw the storm?

314
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
I felt...

315
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,010
frozen.

316
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,260
- Heart racing?\N- Just frozen.

317
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,330
Frozen, cold frozen?\NFrozen to the touch?

318
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,430
No. Like how you feel\Nwhen you're scared,

319
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,880
and you can't breathe\Nor talk or do anything.

320
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,900
I felt... felt this evil,\Nlike it was looking at me.

321
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,730
It was evil?

322
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,030
Well... What do you\Nthink the evil wanted?

323
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,360
To kill.

324
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,830
To kill you?

325
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,280
Not me.

326
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,960
Everyone else.

327
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
All right, I'm gonna be honest with you.

328
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,310
It's probably gonna get\Nworse before it gets better.

329
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,930
Worse? He's already had\Ntwo episodes this month.

330
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,560
He'll likely have more\Nbefore the month is out.

331
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,350
It's called the Anniversary Effect.\NAnd we've seen this with soldiers.

332
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,860
The anniversary of an event\Nbrings back traumatic memories.

333
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,560
Sort of opens up the neurological\Nfloodgates, so to speak.

334
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,280
So what does this mean for the kid?

335
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,230
He's gonna have more\Nepisodes, nightmares?

336
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,250
Yeah, that. Maybe some\Npersonality changes.

337
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,810
He might get irritable.\NHe might lash out.

338
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,500
What do we do when that happens?

339
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,960
Okay. Well, from what we know\Nabout post-traumatic stress...

340
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,830
And we're still learning,\Nokay? Just treat him normally.

341
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,430
Be patient with him.\NDon't pressure him to talk.

342
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,930
Just let him lead the way.

343
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,230
I'm sorry, what you're saying\Nis it's gonna get worse and worse

344
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,510
and we're just supposed to\Npretend it's not happening?

345
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,260
It sounds counterintuitive, I know.

346
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,650
But I assure you that is really\Nthe best thing you can do for him.

347
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,530
Listen. I understand what you\Nwent through last year. I get it.

348
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:27,580
But those people are\Ngone. They're gone. Okay?

349
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,380
So if we're gonna get through this,

350
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,610
I just... I need you to\Nrealize I'm on your side.

351
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,210
I need you to trust me.

352
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,180
"Trust me"?

353
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,260
- Are you kidding me?\N- Yeah, I know.

354
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,960
But, you know, university gives\Nout a degree, this guy's got it.

355
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,930
And look, that post-traumatic stuff\Nhe's talking about, that stuff is real.

356
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,630
He's gonna be okay. All right?

357
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,960
How's Bob the Brain?

358
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,210
Don't call him that.

359
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,710
Sorry. Old habit.

360
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,310
He's good. We're good.

361
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,460
Good. I'm happy for you.

362
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,680
Really. Hey...

363
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,680
Things get worse, you call me first.

364
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,580
You call me.

365
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,910
Okay.

366
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,960
They're ready for you, sir.

367
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,160
- Patty.\N- Sam.

368
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,510
Afternoon, sir.

369
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,860
- Looks like another hot one today, huh?\N- Never gets old, sir.

370
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,910
Still no sign?

371
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,060
Jack shit.

372
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,560
Oh! Damn it. My mom's gonna murder me.

373
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,260
So go home. I'll radio if she comes.

374
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,860
Oh, yeah, nice try. You just want me

375
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,560
out of here so you can make your move.

376
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,560
- Oh, 'cause you're such a threat.\N- That's right.

377
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,110
She will not be able\Nto resist these pearls.

378
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,660
- Ten o'clock. Ten o'clock.\N- What?

379
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,510
- They're arguing. They're arguing.\N- Oh, my God.

380
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,910
I see that. I don't even\Nknow why you need those.

381
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,260
God. You're so stupid.

382
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,260
She's incredible.

383
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,310
She's...

384
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,460
Mad Max.

385
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,210
After dinner, I want you to pick\Nout your toys for the yard sale.

386
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,060
- Fine.\N- Two boxes' worth.

387
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,760
- Two boxes?\N- You heard me.

388
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,660
I'm fine with you giving away a couple,

389
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,810
but the other ones have way\Ntoo much emotional value.

390
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,460
- Emotional value?\N- They're hunks of plastic, Michael.

391
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,960
You already took away my Atari.

392
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,610
Didn't wanna lose more toys, you\Nshouldn't have stolen from Nancy.

393
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,910
I didn't steal. I borrowed.

394
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,810
Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr.\NKowalski last week either, right?

395
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,460
Or plagiarize that essay? Or\Ngraffiti the bathroom stall?

396
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,260
Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.

397
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,910
So if your friend jumps off a\Ncliff, you're gonna jump, too?

398
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,820
We know you've had a hard year,\NMichael. But we've been patient.

399
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,600
This isn't strike one. This\Nisn't even strike three.

400
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,230
It's strike 20. You're\Non the bench, son.

401
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,080
And if it'd been my coach, you'd\Nbe lucky to still be on the team.

402
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,170
Two boxes. Two.

403
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,780
Okay. Ready?

404
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,250
Yeah.

405
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,050
Okay.

406
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,600
I'm so sorry I didn't get to cook.

407
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,600
I was gonna make that baked\Nziti you guys like so much,

408
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,980
but I just forgot about the\Ntime, and before you know it,

409
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,650
"Oh, my God, it's five o'clock."

410
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,600
- It's fine. It's great.\N- Right. I love KFC.

411
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,530
So, I noticed a "For Sale"\Nsign out in your yard.

412
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,150
Is that the neighbors', or...

413
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,670
- You wanna tell them?\N- Go ahead.

414
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,230
We hired a man named Murray Bauman.

415
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,000
Have either of you heard of him?

416
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,130
- No.\N- No, I don't think so.

417
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,630
He was an investigative journalist\Nfor the Chicago Sun-Times.

418
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,130
He's pretty well known.

419
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,680
Anyway, he's freelance now,\Nand he agreed to take the case.

420
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,150
That's... That's great.

421
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,820
No, that's really...\NThat's great, right?

422
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,350
Um, what exactly does that mean?

423
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,320
Means he's gonna do what that\Nlazy son of a bitch Jim Hop...

424
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,650
Sorry.

425
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,370
What the Hawkins police\Nhaven't been capable of doing.

426
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,300
Means we have a real\Ndetective on the case.

427
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,300
It means...

428
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,300
we're going to find our Barb.

429
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,970
If anyone can find her, it's this man.

430
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,470
He already has leads. By God,\Nhe's worth every last penny.

431
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,550
Is that why you're selling the house?

432
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,820
Don't worry about us,\Nsweetie. We're fine.

433
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,270
More than fine.

434
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,100
For the first time in a\Nlong time, we're hopeful.

435
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,200
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

436
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,880
- It's finger-lickin' good.\N- Mmm.

437
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,150
El, are you there? El?

438
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,700
It's me. It's Mike.

439
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,450
It's day 352, 7:40 p.m.

440
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,050
I'm still here.

441
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,530
If you're out there, say\Nsomething. Or give me a sign.

442
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,280
I won't even say anything. Just...\NI wanna know if you're okay.

443
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,430
I'm so stupid.

444
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,380
Mike.

445
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,880
- Mike?\N- Hello, is that you?

446
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,080
Yeah, it's me, Dustin. What're\Nyou doing on this channel again?

447
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,580
I've been trying to reach you all\Nday. We were right. Max is Mad Max.

448
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,030
- Yeah, I'm busy.\N- But...

449
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,680
- What do we do now?\N- We stick to the plan.

450
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,730
Mike's not gonna like it.

451
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,980
Last time I checked, our\Nparty is not a dictatorship.

452
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,930
- It's a democracy.\N- What if Max says no?

453
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,830
How can Max say no to these?

454
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,430
I told you to stop that.

455
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,080
- I'll see you tomorrow.\N- Later.

456
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,430
Mews!

457
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,380
Mews.

458
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,580
- Stop. Stop!\N- What?

459
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,780
Come on, you gotta get used\Nto it. This is the future.

460
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,280
Well, put the future down\Nand get me a clean bowl.

461
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,380
Hey, bud. I didn't know what\Nyou'd like, so I got a variety.

462
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,430
- Take your pick.\N- Whatever you want.

463
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,580
All right.

464
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,380
What are you working on?

465
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,930
Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy?

466
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,330
- Me.\N- Did someone call you that?

467
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,680
Hey. You can talk to\Nme. You know that, right?

468
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,480
Whatever happened. Will,\Ncome on, talk to me.

469
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,530
- Stop treating me like that.\N- What? Like what?

470
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,280
Like everyone else. Like\Nthere's something wrong with me.

471
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,830
What are you talking about?

472
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,180
Mom, Dustin, Lucas. Everyone.

473
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,330
They all treat me like I'm gonna break.

474
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,880
Like I'm a baby. Like I\Ncan't handle things on my own.

475
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,330
It doesn't help. It just makes\Nme feel like more of a freak.

476
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,480
- You're not a freak.\N- Yeah, I am.

477
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,380
I am.

478
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,430
You know what? You're right.

479
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,330
You are a freak.

480
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,740
- What?\N- No, I'm serious. You're a freak.

481
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,870
But what? Do you wanna be normal?

482
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,450
Do you wanna be just like everyone else?

483
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,650
Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak.

484
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,870
Is that why you don't have any friends?

485
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,150
I have friends, Will.

486
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,290
Then why are you always\Nhanging out with me?

487
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,050
Because you're my\Nbest friend, all right?

488
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,700
And I would rather be best friends with

489
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,220
Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody.

490
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,550
You know what I mean?

491
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,750
Okay, look...

492
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,350
Who would you rather be friends\Nwith? Bowie or Kenny Rogers?

493
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,640
Ugh.

494
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,800
Exactly. It's no contest.

495
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,150
The thing is, nobody normal

496
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,600
ever accomplished anything\Nmeaningful in this world.

497
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,270
- You got it?\N- Well...

498
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,950
- some people like Kenny Rogers.\N- Kenny Rogers.

499
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,570
I love Kenny Rogers.

500
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,150
- What's so funny?\N- Nothing.

501
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,420
Mr. Mom.  Perfect!

502
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,450
Where's Mommy keep the extra diapers?

503
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,140
Hey! Cowards.

504
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,470
Hey.

505
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,190
It's okay. Let it go.

506
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,570
Probably just a crank call.

507
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,740
- Okay.\N- Holy mackerel!

508
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,870
- Let it go.\N- Aw, man!

509
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,200
Hey, what'd we talk about?

510
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,450
No signal.

511
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,700
- What?\N- No signal.

512
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,000
It's 8-1-5. You're late.

513
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,900
Yeah, I lost track of time.\NI'll signal next time, all right?

514
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,600
Uh, and it's 8:15. It's not 8-1-5.

515
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,150
Eight-fifteen.

516
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,650
Now, what did we talk about?

517
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,800
Dinner first, then dessert. Always.

518
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,800
That's a rule.

519
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,900
Yeah?

520
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,250
Yes.
