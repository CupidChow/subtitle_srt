1
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Something is coming.\NSomething hungry for blood.

2
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,270
A shadow grows on the wall behind\Nyou, swallowing you in darkness.

3
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,310
- It is almost here.\N- What is it?

4
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,730
What if it's the Demogorgon?

5
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,860
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed\Nif it's the Demogorgon.

6
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,990
It's not the Demogorgon.

7
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,320
An army of troglodytes\Ncharge into the chamber!

8
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,530
- Troglodytes?\N- Told ya.

9
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,430
Wait a minute.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,040
Did you hear that?

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,540
That... that sound?

12
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,290
Boom... boom...

13
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,130
Boom!

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,110
That didn't come from the\Ntroglodytes. No, that...

15
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,880
That came from something else.

16
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,300
The Demogorgon!

17
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,850
- We're in deep shit.\N- Will, your action!

18
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,220
- I don't know!\N- Fireball him!

19
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,600
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

20
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,520
Too risky. Cast a protection spell.

21
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,150
- Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!\N- Cast Protection.

22
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,940
The Demogorgon is tired of\Nyour silly human bickering!

23
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,820
It stomps towards you.

24
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,900
- Boom!\N- Fireball him!

25
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,280
- Another stomp, boom!\N- Cast Protection.

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,200
He roars in anger!

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,780
Fireball!

28
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,490
- Oh, shit!\N- Where'd it go?

29
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,290
- Where is it?\N- I don't know!

30
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,910
- Is it a 13?\N- I don't know!

31
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,160
- Where is it?\N- Oh, my God!

32
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,830
- Mike!\N- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,000
- Mike!\N- Can you find it yet?

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,170
No, I can't find it!

35
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,920
- Mike!\N- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,800
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,010
You mean the end? Fifteen after.

38
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,280
- Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!\N- Why do we have to go?

39
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,050
- Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!\N- It's a school night, Michael.

40
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,600
I just put Holly to bed.\NYou can finish next weekend.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,230
- But that'll ruin the flow!\N- Michael...

42
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm serious, Mom.

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,100
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

44
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,290
How was I supposed to know\Nit was gonna take ten hours?

45
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,270
You've been playing for ten hours?

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,200
- Dad, don't you think that 20 more...\N- I think you should listen to your mother.

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,760
Dang dumb piece of junk.

48
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,750
Oh, I got it!

49
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,720
- Does the seven count?\N- It was a seven?

50
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,930
Did Mike see it? Then it doesn't count.

51
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,710
Yo, hey, guys.

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,690
- Does anyone want this?\N- No.

53
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,320
Yeah.

54
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,700
No, I don't think...

55
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,390
Yeah, he's cute.

56
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,810
Barb, no, I don't think so.

57
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,370
- Barb, you're not...\N- Hey, Nancy.

58
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,610
There's a slice left if you want it.

59
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,050
- Sausage and pepperoni!\N- Hold on.

60
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,830
- There's something wrong with your sister.\N- What are you talking about?

61
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,710
- She's got a stick up her butt.\N- Yeah.

62
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,290
It's because she's been dating\Nthat douchebag, Steve Harrington.

63
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,130
Yeah, she's turning into a real jerk.

64
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,550
She's always been a real jerk.

65
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,510
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

66
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,210
Like that time she dressed up as\Nan elf for our Elder tree campaign.

67
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,280
Four years ago!

68
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,920
- Just saying.\N- Later.

69
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,430
- It was a seven.\N- Huh?

70
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,280
The roll, it was a seven.

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,580
The Demogorgon, it got me.

72
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,620
See you tomorrow.

73
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,310
- Good night, ladies.\N- Kiss your mom 'night for me.

74
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,710
Race you back to my\Nplace? Winner gets a comic.

75
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,480
- Any comic?\N- Yeah.

76
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,470
Hey! Hey!

77
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,530
I didn't say "go"!

78
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,600
Get back here!

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,810
I'm gonna kill you!

80
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,330
I'll take your X-Men 134!

81
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,170
Son of a bitch.

82
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,590
Mom?

83
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,230
Jonathan? Mom?

84
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,860
Hello? Hello?

85
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,650
And that's it for News\NCenter this morning.

86
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,070
Thanks for joining us.

87
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,450
Let's hand off now to\NLiz at the news desk.

88
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,950
All right, thank you, Donna.

89
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,120
Turning now to local news,

90
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,620
we're getting reports of surges and\Npower outages all across the county.

91
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,670
Last night, hundreds of homes\Nin East Hawkins were affected,

92
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,130
leaving many residents in the dark.

93
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,340
The cause of the\Noutage is still unknown.

94
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,630
We reached out to Roane\NCounty Water and Electric,

95
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,260
and a spokesperson says\Nthat they are confident

96
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,930
power will be restored\Nto all remaining homes

97
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,550
within the next several hours.

98
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,310
Mmm.

99
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,950
In other news, you might\Nwanna stay home tonight

100
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,330
or at least pack an umbrella.

101
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,830
We turn to everybody's favorite\Nmorning weather guy, Charles.

102
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,340
Where the hell are they?

103
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,840
- Jonathan?\N- Check the couch!

104
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,060
Ugh, I did.

105
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,650
Oh... Got them.

106
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,100
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

107
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,010
- Yeah, see you later.\N- Where's Will?

108
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,180
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

109
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,390
He's probably still sleeping.

110
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,600
- Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!\N- Mom, I'm making breakfast.

111
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,520
I told you this a thousand times.

112
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,250
Will! Come on, honey.\NIt's time to get up.

113
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,990
- He came home last night, right?\N- He's not in his room?

114
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,370
- Did he come home or not?\N- I don't know.

115
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,700
- You don't know?\N- No.

116
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,830
I got home late. I was working.

117
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,960
You were working?

118
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Eric asked if I could\Ncover. I said yeah.

119
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,660
I just thought we could\Nuse the extra cash.

120
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,300
- Jonathan, we've talked about this.\N- I know, I know.

121
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

122
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,900
Mom, it's not a big deal. Look,\Nhe was at the Wheelers' all day.

123
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,650
- I'm sure he just stayed over.\N- I can't believe you.

124
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,990
I can't believe you sometimes.

125
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,520
That's disgusting.

126
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,810
- You're disgusting!\N- Hello?

127
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,650
Hi, Karen. It's Joyce.

128
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,780
- Oh, Joyce, hi.\N- What the hell, Mike?

129
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,030
- Hey!\N- Quiet!

130
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,820
- Language.\N- Are you kidding?

131
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,280
Was that Will I heard back there?

132
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,870
Will? No, no, no, it's just Mike.

133
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,370
Will didn't spend the night?

134
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,870
No, he left here a\Nlittle bit after 8:00.

135
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,290
Why? He's not home?

136
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,210
Um, you know what? I think he\Njust left early for... for school.

137
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,310
- Thank you so much. Bye.\N- Okay. Bye.

138
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,150
That's weird. I don't see him.

139
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,780
I'm telling you, his mom's right.

140
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,700
He probably just went\Nto class early again.

141
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,400
Yeah, he's always paranoid Gursky's\Ngonna give him another pop quiz.

142
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,420
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

143
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,620
Step right up and get your\Ntickets for the freak show.

144
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,350
Who do you think would make\Nmore money in a freak show?

145
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,020
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

146
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,590
I'd go with Toothless.

147
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,140
I told you a million times,\Nmy teeth are coming in.

148
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,970
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

149
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,060
"I told you a million times."

150
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,200
Do the arm thing.

151
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,330
Do it, freak!

152
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,920
God, it gets me every time.

153
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,080
- Assholes.\N- I think it's kinda cool.

154
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,330
It's like you have\Nsuperpowers or something.

155
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,290
Like Mr. Fantastic.

156
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,640
Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it.

157
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,760
So, did he call?

158
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,390
Keep your voice down.

159
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,060
Did he?

160
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,910
I told you, it's not like that.

161
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,250
Okay, I mean, yes, he\Nlikes me, but not like that.

162
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,250
We just...

163
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,860
made out a couple times.

164
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,320
"We just... made out a couple times."

165
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,740
Nance, seriously,

166
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,910
you're gonna be so cool\Nnow, it's ridiculous.

167
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,410
No, I'm not.

168
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,160
You better still hang out\Nwith me, that's all I'm saying.

169
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,040
If you become friends\Nwith Tommy H. or Carol...

170
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,420
Oh, that's gross!

171
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,690
Okay, I'm telling you,\Nit was a one-time...

172
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,610
Two-time thing.

173
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,740
You were saying?

174
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,610
- Steve...\N- Mmm-hmm?

175
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,360
- I have to go.\N- In a minute.

176
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,110
Steve. I really, like...

177
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,030
Seriously, I have to go.

178
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,490
Wait, wait, wait. Let's...

179
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,450
Come on, let's do\Nsomething tonight, yeah?

180
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,450
Uh... No, I can't. I have\Nto study for Kaminsky's test.

181
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,790
Oh, come on. What's\Nyour GPA again? 3.999...

182
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,580
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

183
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,840
- Well, then, just let me help.\N- You failed chem.

184
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,920
- C-minus.\N- Well, in that case...

185
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,340
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

186
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,380
- Are you crazy? My mom would not...\N- I'll climb through your window.

187
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,690
She won't even know I'm there.\NI'm stealthy, like a ninja.

188
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,970
You are crazy.

189
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,960
Wait, wait, wait. Just...\NOkay, forget about that.

190
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,270
We can just...

191
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,270
We can just, like, chill in my car.

192
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,310
We can find a nice quiet\Nplace to park, and...

193
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,820
Steve... I have to study.

194
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,610
I'm not kidding.

195
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, why do you think I\Nwant it to be nice and quiet?

196
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,740
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

197
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,310
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

198
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,520
To study.

199
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,020
Good of you to show.

200
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,770
Oh, hey, morning, Flo.\NMorning, everybody.

201
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,520
- Hey, Chief.\N- Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

202
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,610
- Oh, yeah?\N- Yeah.

203
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,240
Well, I looked better than your\Nwife when I left her this morning.

204
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,950
While you were drinking or sleeping,

205
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,990
or whatever it is you deemed\Nso necessary on Monday morning,

206
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,080
Phil Larson called.

207
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,830
Said some kids are stealing the\Ngnomes out of his garden again.

208
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,370
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

209
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,710
Well, I'll tell you what,\NI'm gonna get right on that.

210
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,330
On a more pressing matter,

211
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,460
Joyce Byers can't find\Nher son this morning.

212
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,300
Mmm. Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

213
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,590
- Just give me a minute.\N- Joyce is very upset.

214
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,550
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

215
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,970
Mornings are for coffee\Nand contemplation.

216
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,950
- Chief, she's already in your...\N- Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

217
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,200
I have been waiting here\Nover an hour, Hopper.

218
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,870
And I apologize again.

219
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,330
I'm going out of my mind!

220
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,000
Look, boy his age, he's probably\Njust playing hookie, okay?

221
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,080
No, not my Will. He's not like that.

222
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,710
- He wouldn't do that.\N- Well, you never know.

223
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,500
I mean, my mom thought\NI was on the debate team,

224
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
when really I was just\Nscrewing Chrissy Carpenter

225
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,260
in the back of my\Ndad's Oldsmobile, so...

226
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,970
Look, he's not like you,\NHopper. He's not like me.

227
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,550
He's not like... most.

228
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,510
He has a couple of friends, but,\Nyou know, the kids, they're mean.

229
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,430
They make fun of him.\NThey call him names.

230
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,560
- They laugh at him, his clothes...\N- His clothes?

231
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,600
- What's wrong with his clothes?\N- I don't know.

232
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,980
- Does that matter?\N- Maybe.

233
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,110
Look, he's... He's a sensitive kid.

234
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,900
Lonnie... Lonnie used\Nto say he was queer.

235
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,320
Called him a fag.

236
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,340
- Is he?\N- He's missing is what he is.

237
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,210
When was the last time\Nyou heard from Lonnie?

238
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,670
Uh, last I heard, he was in\NIndianapolis. That was about a year ago.

239
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,630
- But he has nothing to do with this.\N- Why don't you give me his number?

240
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,980
You know, Hopper, he has nothing\Nto do with this. Trust me.

241
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,760
Joyce, 99 out of 100\Ntimes, kid goes missing,

242
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,970
the kid is with a parent or relative.

243
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,560
What about the other time?

244
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,000
- What?\N- You said, "99 out of 100."

245
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,100
- What about the other time, the one?\N- Joyce.

246
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,310
The one!

247
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,230
Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?

248
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,070
You wanna know the worst\Nthing that's ever happened here

249
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,240
in the four years\NI've been working here?

250
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,620
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

251
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,700
It was when an owl attacked\NEleanor Gillespie's head

252
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,490
because it thought that\Nher hair was a nest.

253
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,240
Okay, fine. I will call Lonnie.

254
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,040
He will talk to me before he talks to...

255
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,100
- What, a pig?\N- A cop!

256
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,170
Just find my son, Hop.

257
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,150
Find him!

258
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,910
Dr. Brenner.

259
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,520
This way, gentlemen.

260
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,440
The entire east wing will\Nbe evacuated within the hour.

261
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,380
We've sealed off this area\Nfollowing quarantine protocol.

262
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,180
- This is where it came from?\N- Yes.

263
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,280
And the girl?

264
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,030
She can't have gone far.

265
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,010
All right, and one more.

266
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,870
Hey, Ben. What do you\Nthink about that, uh...

267
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,490
Hey, I don't know. I don't know.

268
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,910
I don't know, 37 points\Nper game average...

269
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,010
- Thirty-seven now, but...\N- Mr. Basket.

270
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,360
Hey!

271
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,590
Come here!

272
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,630
Hey, come here!

273
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,350
You think you can steal from me, boy?

274
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,020
What in the hell?

275
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,380
Remember, finish chapter 12

276
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,260
and answer 12.3 on the\Ndifference between an experiment

277
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,470
and other forms of\Nscience investigation.

278
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,430
This will be on the test, which\Nwill cover chapters 10 through 12.

279
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,580
It will be multiple choice\Nwith an essay section.

280
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,600
So, did it come?

281
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,060
Sorry, boys.

282
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,040
I hate to be the bearer\Nof bad news, but...

283
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,170
it came.

284
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,740
Yes!

285
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,620
The Heathkit ham shack.

286
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,440
- Whoa.\N- Ain't she a beaut?

287
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,290
I bet you can talk to\NNew York on this thing.

288
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,540
Think bigger.

289
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,620
- California?\N- Bigger.

290
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,100
Australia?

291
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,630
Oh, man!

292
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,590
When Will sees this, he's\Ntotally gonna blow his shit.

293
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,760
Lucas!

294
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,230
Sorry.

295
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,180
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

296
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,990
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

297
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,730
What are you doing?

298
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,980
Hello, this is Dustin,

299
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,060
and this is the secretary and\Ntreasurer of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

300
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,320
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

301
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,340
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may\NI borrow Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

302
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,870
Okay, okay, okay.

303
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,930
One at a time, all right? You.

304
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,630
- You said he takes what?\N- Mirkwood.

305
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,300
- Mirkwood?\N- Yeah.

306
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,880
- Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?\N- I have not. That sounds made up to me.

307
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,760
No, it's from Lord of the Rings.

308
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,720
- Well, The Hobbit.\N- It doesn't matter.

309
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,640
- He asked!\N- "He asked!"

310
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,330
- Shut up, guys!\N- Hey, hey, hey!

311
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,350
- What'd I just say?\N- Shut up.

312
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,730
One at a damn time. You.

313
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,030
Mirkwood, it's a real road. It's\Njust the name that's made up.

314
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,630
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

315
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,590
- Yeah, all right, I think I know that...\N- We can show you, if you want.

316
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,870
I said that I know it!

317
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,490
- We can help look.\N- Yeah.

318
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,490
No.

319
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,710
No. After school, you\Nare all to go home.

320
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,000
Immediately.

321
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,880
That means no biking around looking\Nfor your friend, no investigating,

322
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,040
no nonsense.

323
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,090
This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.

324
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,970
- The Hobbit.\N- Shut up!

325
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,430
- Hey!\N- Stop it!

326
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,660
Do I make myself clear?

327
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,420
Do I make myself... clear?

328
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,210
- Yes, sir.\N- Yeah.

329
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,750
Ring-a-ding-ding!

330
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,540
Anybody home?

331
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,250
Password?

332
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,310
Uh, Rada...

333
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,130
Radaga... Radagast?

334
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,630
Yeah. You may enter.

335
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,200
Thank you, sir.

336
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,810
So, guess what?

337
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,350
I got off early and...

338
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,100
Ta-da! Poltergeist.

339
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,810
I... I thought I wasn't\Nallowed to see it.

340
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,280
I changed my mind.

341
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,070
As long as you don't have\Nnightmares for a week.

342
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,650
No, I won't. I don't get\Nscared like that anymore.

343
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,740
Oh, yeah?

344
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,490
Not even of clowns?

345
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,660
No.

346
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,120
What about my witch?

347
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,620
- No. Mom...\N- Ooh...

348
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,540
- I'm not five anymore.\N- But Will Byers...

349
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,240
- I'm going to cook you up in my...\N- Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

350
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,550
Will?

351
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,230
- Will?\N- Will?

352
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,030
Will?

353
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,570
- Will?\N- Will!

354
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,350
- Will!\N- Will?

355
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,980
Will!

356
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,750
Where are you?

357
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,340
Geez.

358
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,970
Your parents forget to feed you?

359
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,470
Is that why you ran away?

360
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,140
They, uh...

361
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,310
They hurt you?

362
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,880
You went to the\Nhospital, you got scared,

363
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,660
you ran off, you wound\Nup here, is that it?

364
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,910
All right.

365
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,120
I'll give this back, all right? And\Nyou can have as much as you want.

366
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,190
All right? Maybe even some ice cream.

367
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,650
But you gotta answer a few of\Nmy questions first, all right?

368
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,710
We got a deal?

369
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,320
All right, let's start with\Nthe easy stuff. All right?

370
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,790
My name's Benny. Benny Hammond.

371
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,580
See? Like this. Here.

372
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,580
I got you. Don't worry. It's okay.

373
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,150
Nice to meet you, yeah. And you are?

374
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,530
Eleven?

375
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,870
What's that mean?

376
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,490
What's it mean?

377
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,810
- No.\N- Well, I'll be damned.

378
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,610
She speaks.

379
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,380
"No"? No, what?

380
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,150
All right. I guess no more food, then.

381
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,420
Eleven.

382
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,840
Yeah.

383
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,720
What's it mean?

384
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,890
Eleven.

385
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,750
All right, then.

386
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,590
Here you go.

387
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,440
Take it easy, take it easy.

388
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,430
Yeah, look, all I know is\Nthat she's scared to death.

389
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,640
Yeah, I think maybe\Nshe's been abused or...

390
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,360
kidnapped or something.

391
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,430
Yeah, it'd be great if\Nsomeone would come by.

392
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,980
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph\NLane. Yeah, Randolph.

393
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,650
Will Byers?

394
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,820
Will!

395
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,310
Will Byers?

396
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,310
Come on, kid!

397
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,670
Will?

398
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,590
Hey! I got something.

399
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,560
- That his bike?\N- Yeah, he must have crashed.

400
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,570
You think he got hurt in the fall?

401
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,880
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

402
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Bike like this is like\Na Cadillac to these kids.

403
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,610
He would've walked it home.

404
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,560
... get off work if I win.

405
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,310
Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...

406
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,190
... but we will cover whatever\Nthe damages are to your property.

407
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,050
- It's just, um...\N- That's for sure.

408
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,450
Is Lonnie there?

409
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,090
- Lonnie isn't here right now.\N- Can you please...

410
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,050
- I told you, Lonnie's not here.\N- Who is this?

411
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,870
- His girlfriend, Cynthia.\N- Cynthia.

412
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,670
- Who the hell is this?\N- Cynthia, this is Joyce.

413
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,500
- Who?\N- Lonnie's ex-wife.

414
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,750
- I really need to speak to him...\N- Lonnie's not here.

415
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,710
- Can you please put... No!\N- Why don't you call back later?

416
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,880
No, not later. Now!

417
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,140
Can...

418
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,640
- Bitch!\N- Mom.

419
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,180
- What?\N- You have to stay calm.

420
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,340
Hey, you've reached Lonnie.

421
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,630
Leave a message and I'll\Nholler right back at ya.

422
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,110
Lonnie, some teenager\Njust hung up on me.

423
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,700
Will is... is missing.\NI don't know where he is.

424
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,950
I need...

425
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,620
I just need you to call\Nme back, please, just...

426
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,040
Damn it! Damn it!

427
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,790
Mom?

428
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,900
What?

429
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,110
Cops.

430
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,500
- It was just lying there?\N- Yeah. Cal?

431
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,070
- Did it have any blood on it, or...\N- No, no, no, no, no...

432
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,660
Phil?

433
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,180
If you found the bike out\Nthere, why are you here?

434
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,100
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?\N- Yeah.

435
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,520
So...

436
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,620
maybe he came home.

437
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,750
You think I didn't check my own house?

438
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,650
I'm not saying that.

439
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,300
- Has this always been here?\N- What? I don't know.

440
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,240
Probably. I mean, I have\Ntwo boys. Look at this place.

441
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,010
You're not sure?

442
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,000
Hey.

443
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,360
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

444
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,970
Nothing, he's probably\Njust hungry. Come on.

445
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,570
- Hey!\N- Jesus!

446
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,240
What are you, deaf?\NI've been calling you.

447
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,800
What's going on?

448
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,080
Hello?

449
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,250
- Are you sure you're okay, Chief?\N- Listen, I want you to call Flo.

450
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,190
I want to get a search\Nparty together, all right?

451
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,880
All the volunteers she can\Nmuster. Bring flashlights, too.

452
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,270
Hey, you think we got a problem here?

453
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,170
We should be out there right now.\NWe should be helping look for him.

454
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,020
We've been over this,\NMike. The chief says...

455
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,600
- I don't care what the chief said.\N- Michael!

456
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,470
We have to do something.\NWill can be in danger.

457
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,650
More reason to stay put.

458
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,790
- Mom!\N- End of discussion.

459
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,910
So... me and Barbara are gonna\Nstudy at her house tonight.

460
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,410
- That's cool, right?\N- No, not cool.

461
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,750
What? Why not?

462
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,040
Why do you think? Am I\Nspeaking Chinese in this house?

463
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,170
Until we know Will is\Nokay, no one leaves.

464
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,040
- This is such bullshit.\N- Language.

465
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,550
So we're under house arrest?

466
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,550
Just because Mike's friend got\Nlost on the way home from...

467
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,930
- Wait, this is Will's fault?\N- Nancy, take that back.

468
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,550
- No!\N- You're just pissed off

469
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,610
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

470
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,470
- Steve?\N- Who is Steve?

471
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,980
- Her new boyfriend.\N- You are such a douchebag, Mike!

472
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,870
Language!

473
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,960
Nancy, come back.

474
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,030
Come back!

475
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,550
It's okay. It's okay, Holly.\NHere, have some juice, okay?

476
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,280
You see, Michael?

477
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,660
- You see what happens?\N- What happens when what?

478
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:24,330
I'm the only one acting normal here!\NI'm the only one that cares about Will!

479
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,460
That is really unfair, son.

480
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,770
We care.

481
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,440
- Mike!\N- Let him go.

482
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,570
I hope you're enjoying\Nyour chicken, Ted.

483
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,860
What did I do?

484
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,780
Hey! What'd I do?

485
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,860
- Will!\N- Will Byers!

486
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,980
Will!

487
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,900
Will, we're here for you, bud!

488
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,990
He's a good student.

489
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,490
- What?\N- Will. He's a good student.

490
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,220
Great one, actually.

491
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,620
I don't think we've met. Scott Clarke.

492
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,000
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.\NEarth and biology.

493
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,090
I always had a distaste for science.

494
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,130
Well, maybe you had a bad teacher.

495
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,550
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff was a piece of work.

496
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,260
Ratliff? You bet.

497
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,510
She's still kicking\Naround, believe it or not.

498
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:26,410
Oh, I believe it. Mummies\Nnever die, so they tell me.

499
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,530
Sarah, my daughter...

500
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,060
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...\NShe always understood all that stuff.

501
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,610
I always figured there was\Nenough going on down here,

502
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,460
I never needed to look elsewhere.

503
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,740
Your daughter, what grade is she?

504
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,620
- Maybe I'll get her in my class.\N- No, she, uh...

505
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,240
She lives with her mom in the city.

506
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,810
Thanks for coming out, Teach.\NWe really appreciate it.

507
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,880
- She died a few years back.\N- Sorry?

508
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,230
His kid.

509
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,230
Lucas, do you copy? It's Mike.

510
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,150
- Lucas?\N- Hey, it's Lucas.

511
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,230
I know it's you.

512
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,480
And say "over" when you're done talking\Nso I know when you're done. Over.

513
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,190
I'm done. Over.

514
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,700
I'm worried about Will. Over.

515
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,840
Yeah.

516
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
This is crazy. Over.

517
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,300
I was thinking...

518
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,620
Will could've cast Protection\Nlast night, but he didn't.

519
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,710
He cast Fireball.

520
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,550

521
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:43,340
My point is... he could've\Nplayed it safe, but he didn't.

522
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,300
He put himself in\Ndanger to help the party.

523
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,530
Over.

524
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,740
Meet me in ten. Over and out.

525
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,950
What are you doing here?

526
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,330
I told you on the phone,\NI'm under house arrest now.

527
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,850
- I figured we'd just study here.\N- No. No way.

528
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,180
Oh, come on. I can't have\Nyou failing this test.

529
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,060
So just... bear with me.

530
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,120
What'd I tell you?

You know, smile?

535
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,010
All right. You just sit tight.

536
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,490
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to\Ngo away real quick, all right?

537
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

538
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,980
- Hey, can I help you?\N- Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

539
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,450
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid\Nwe're closed for the evening, too.

540
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,160
- So try back tomorrow morning.\N- Connie Frazier. Social Services.

541
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,120
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.\NI didn't expect you so soon.

542
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,040
- That's a heck of a drive.\N- Not too bad this time of night.

543
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,420
Hey, listen, I... I haven't\Ntold her that you're coming yet.

544
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,420
I didn't want her running off\Nagain. She's a tad skittish.

545
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,150
- Children I work with usually are.\N- Right, right.

546
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,550
- So, where is she?\N- Right. She's in the kitchen.

547
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,470
- Come on up. I'll introduce you.\N- Thank you.

548
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,340
Sorry again for trying\Nto turn you away there.

549
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,770

Hey, guys. You feel that?

553
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,020
- I think maybe we should go back.\N- No.

554
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,730
We're not going back. Just stay close.

555
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,960
Come on.

556
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:51,420
Just stay on channel six.\NDon't do anything stupid.
