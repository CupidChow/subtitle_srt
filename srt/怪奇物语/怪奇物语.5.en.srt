1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,870
Hey, you reached Jim.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,900
I'm probably doing something\Nincredible right now,

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,220
and I can't...

4
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,350
It's like... It's like I feel what\Nthe shadow monster's feeling.

5
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,320
See what he's seeing.

6
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,200
Like in the Upside Down?

7
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,070
Some of him is there.

8
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,070
But some of him is here, too.

9
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,340
- Here, like, in this house?\N- In this house and...

10
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,420
in me.

11
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,340
It's like... It's like he's reaching\Ninto Hawkins more and more.

12
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,350
And the more he spreads, the\Nmore connected to him I feel.

13
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,520
And the more you see these now-memories.

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,300
At first I just felt it\Nin the back of my head.

15
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,970
I didn't even really know it was there.

16
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,050
It's like when you have a dream

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,600
and you can't remember it\Nunless you think really hard.

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,650
It was like that.

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,940
But know it's like...

20
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,650
Now I remember. I remember all the time.

21
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,400
Maybe...

22
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,350
- Maybe that's good.\N- Good?

23
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,000
Just think about it, Will.

24
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,090
You're like a spy now. A superspy.

25
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,590
Spying on the shadow monster.

26
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,590
If you know what he's\Nseeing and feeling...

27
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,200
maybe that's how we can stop him.

28
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,050
Maybe all of this is\Nhappening for a reason.

29
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,740
- You really think so?\N- Yeah. Yeah, I really do.

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,800
What if he figures out\Nwe're spying on him?

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,550
- What if he spies back?\N- He won't.

32
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,420
How do you know?

33
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,420
We won't let him.

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Ugh!

35
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,870
Ugh!

36
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,960
- Hey.\N- Hey. Did you get 'em?

37
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Yeah.

38
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,460
We'd like a... uh, a room.

39
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,960
We got those.

40
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,660
You want a single or a double?

41
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,830
Double.

42
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,710
Nance...

43
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,090
- Uh, on or off?\N- Hmm.

44
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,810
- What?\N- Nothing. Just...

45
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,760
déjà vu.

46
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,440
Yeah.

47
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,390
Don't you think it's weird?

48
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,140
What?

49
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,990
How we only seem to hang out\Nwhen the world's about to end?

50
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,310
It's not going to end.

51
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,240
Feels like it.

52
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,210
Still have yours?

53
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,910
- Yeah.\N- Mmm...

54
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,040
Yeah, mine's bigger.

55
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,890
- Congratulations.\N- Thanks.

56
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,640
What happened?

57
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
What do you mean?

58
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
To us?

59
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,290
After everything, you just...

60
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,240
disappeared.

61
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,740
Yeah, Will needed me.

62
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,140
And Steve...

63
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,790
I waited.

64
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah, like, only a month.

65
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,590
I want them off.

66
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,740
Will, what's wrong?

67
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,040
Mom?

68
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,190
Mom?

69
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,840
- Mom?\N- Yeah?

70
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,990
- I saw him.\N- You saw who, baby?

71
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,190
Hopper.

72
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,960
I think he's in trouble.

73
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,490
I think he's going to die.

74
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,510
Shit!

75
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,160
- That's enough, Erica.\N- Uh-uh.

76
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,410
- Dad?\N- Mmm-hmm?

77
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,880
When Mom's mad at you, how\Ndo you make her not mad?

78
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,330
Hmm. That's a great question.\NHow do you, hon?

79
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,500
First, I apologize.

80
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,850
Then, I get your mother\Nwhatever she wants.

81
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,350
Even when she's wrong?

82
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,150
She's never wrong, son.

83
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,180
That's right.

84
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,650
- Not hungry?\N- Not really.

85
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,350
Where you goin'?

86
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,530
To hang out with Dustin.

87
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,000
Sorry.

88
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,180
Mews!

89
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,210
Mewsy!

90
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,260
Mews!

91
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,850
Mewsy!

92
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,180
Dusty, baby, you're sure\Nshe's not in your room?

93
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,700
Uh-huh.

94
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,840
If you'd like to make a call...

95
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,310
Thank you so much, Mr. McCorkle.\NThank you so much.

96
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,310
You are a true lifesaver.

97
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,500
All right, this was great.

98
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,500
Thank you. All right. Have a good one.

99
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,700
Bye-bye, now. All right. You, too.

100
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,750
All right, great news.

101
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,110
They found her?

102
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,380
No. But they saw her\Nwandering around Loch Nora.

103
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,630
How did the poor baby get\Nall the way out there?

104
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,350
I don't know. Lost, I guess. But\Nthey're gonna look for her.

105
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,680
And I'll stay here, just\Nin case they call again.

106
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,600
And you're gonna go help look?\NYeah? Yeah?

107
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,400
Give me hug. Give me a hug. Go get her.

108
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,710
- You're gonna find her.\N- Okay.

109
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,400
- We can find her.\N- We can find her.

110
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,100
I love you.

111
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,730
- I love you.\N- I love you.

112
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,200
- I love you.\N- All right, go.

113
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,810
All right.

114
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,430
All right, Dart. Breakfast time.

115
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,430
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\NOh, my God. Oh, my God.

116
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,350
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

117
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,200
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

118
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.\NShit. Shit. Shit.

119
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,300
Come on. Come on, I know you're hungry.

120
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

121
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Yes.

122
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,900
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

123
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,550
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

124
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,050
Shit!

125
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,350
I'm sorry. You ate my cat.

126
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,000
All right. I think this is it.

127
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,300
Five-one-five Larrabee, right?

128
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Yes.

129
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,300
Five-fifteen.

130
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,100
All right, "Five-fifteen." Sure.

131
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,450
Thank you.

132
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,300
Hey.

133
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,200
You apologize to your mama, yeah? Huh?

134
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,850
Must be scared half to death.

135
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,500
How long's it been?

136
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,150
Long time.

137
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,000
Go away! I'm not interested!

138
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,100
Look, I don't want your\NThin Mints, all right, kid?

139
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,700
- Thin Mints?\N- Or your religious mumbo jumbo.

140
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,200
Whatever you're selling,\NI ain't buying, okay?

141
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,270
I want to see Mama.

142
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,620
Name a way you occupy your time

143
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,880
when you're having a boring day at work.

144
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,620
- Drink coffee.\N- "Drink coffee," said Mike.

145
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,950
Yeah! Five answers will beat it, Lynn.

146
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,780
Visit with other employees.

147
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,200
- "Visit with other employees."\N- Rainbow.

148
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,080
- Three to the right. Four to the left.\N- Mama?

149
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,370
Breathe. Sunflower.

150
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,530
Rainbow.

151
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,130
- Three to the right. Four to the left.\N- Mama, can you hear me?

152
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,580
Four-fifty. Breathe.

153
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,380
Sunflower.

154
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,130
Rainbow.

155
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,380
Mama? It's me...

156
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Jane.

157
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,570
I'm here now.

158
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,730
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow. Four-fifty.

159
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,120
Breathe. Sunflower.

160
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,700
- What's wrong with Mama?\N- Rainbow.

161
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,580
Four-fifty.

162
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,720
Are you positive this\Nis the right place?

163
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,920
"3833." Yeah.

164
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,850
All right.

165
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,220
Look at the camera.

166
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,470
- The camera.\N- What camera?

167
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,520
Not the loudspeaker.\NAbove you, to the right.

168
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,880
Nancy Wheeler. Jonathan Byers.

169
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,420
You two are a long way from home.

170
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,200
Well...

171
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,230
I hope you didn't come all this\Nway to tell me about the bear

172
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,420
in the Harrington kid's backyard.

173
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,920
I've heard that one already.

174
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,580
Take a look. Go ahead, don't be shy.

175
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,520
I followed up on 200 tips,

176
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,900
most bogus, but that's how\Nthese things always go, okay?

177
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,430
I know every last step\NBarbara took that day,

178
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,400
every last person she talked to.

179
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,800
The answer to what happened

180
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,430
to your friend, it's up here somewhere.

181
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,370
I assure you that. I just\Ngotta connect the right dots.

182
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,870
Timeline's wrong.

183
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm sorry?

184
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,780
Your timeline is wrong.

185
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,970
And the girl with the buzzed hair,

186
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,770
she's not Russian. She's\Nfrom Hawkins Lab.

187
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,570
Her name was Eleven.

188
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,870
You might wanna sit down for this.

189
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,770
If you're not out in an hour...

190
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,300
Walking home. Yeah, yeah, I know.

191
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Hey! Watch the attitude, shitbird.

192
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,570
Sorry about that, Road Warrior.

193
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,270
What happened?

194
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,920
Short circuit in the motherboard.\NA real bummer.

195
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,450
But fret not. I got another machine\Nup and running in the back.

196
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,420
Hold these.

197
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,570
You better get me that\Ndate now, Sinclair.

198
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,320
I told you I would.

199
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,770
And keep things PG in here, all right?

200
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,470
What is this shit, stalker?

201
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,120
Sorry. I just needed a safe place.

202
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,320
A safe place to what? Be creepy?

203
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,120
Listen. I'm gonna tell you the truth

204
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,120
about everything that\Nhappened last year.

205
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,770
But if anyone finds out,\Nyou could be arrested.

206
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,920
Possibly killed.

207
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,620
- Killed?\N- I need to know.

208
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,670
Do you accept the risk?

209
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,820
- Oh, my God! This... this is so stupid.\N- Do you accept the risk?

210
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Yeah.

211
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,070
Sure. Fine.

212
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,970
I accept the risk.

213
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,870
Let's hear it.

214
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,420
Last year...

215
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,720
Will didn't get lost in the woods.

216
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,020
He got lost somewhere else.

217
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,870
Hey, is this where you saw him?

218
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,620
Is this where you saw Hopper?

219
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,520
I think so. Yeah.

220
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,620
Okay.

221
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,670
Here!

222
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,770
Okay, so... so Hopper is here?

223
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,970
Yeah. Now we just need to find\Nout where here is, right?

224
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,120
Right.

225
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,720
Did he say anything? I\Nmean, before he left?

226
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,970
Uh, some... something about vines?

227
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,770
Hopper.

228
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,120
Surprise.

229
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,370
I would've called, but you\Nsaid not to clog up the line.

230
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,270
You know, I... We're fine,\Nwe don't need anything.

231
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,220
When I was sick as a kid, and I\Nwas sick all the time as a kid,

232
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,470
nothing made me feel better than\Nfocusing on these brain teasers.

233
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,970
Those are great. Ah...

234
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,270
I could teach him how to play.

235
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,620
You know, he's sleeping.

236
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Okay.

237
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,520
I could wait with you?

238
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,470
Listen, it's just not a good time.

239
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,350
But, um, you know what?\NI'll call you, okay?

240
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,990
Thank you.

241
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,050
- You sure?\N- Yeah.

242
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,890
Well, have him call me. They don't\Ncall me Bob the Brain for nothing.

243
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,790
Bob!

244
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
That's my name.

245
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Huh.

246
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,890
Hmm.

247
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,800
- You drew all these yourself?\N- Mmm-hmm.

248
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,090
- Why, exactly?\N- I... I told you the rules.

249
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,720
- No questions, okay?\N- Yeah.

250
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,800
We... we just need you to\Nhelp us figure out what...

251
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,850
Bob? Bob?

252
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,850
Over here.

253
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,100
Where... where this is.

254
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,290
That's the objective. Find the X.

255
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,950
Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure?

256
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,840
Bob, no questions.

257
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
Okay.

258
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,950
Let me talk to you for a second.\NHang on, guys.

259
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,550
Joyce, you can talk to me.\NYou know that, right?

260
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,750
Yeah. What's the problem, exactly?

261
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,970
What's the problem?

262
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,220
Joyce, Will doesn't look well.

263
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,750
You don't look well.

264
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,890
What's going on?

265
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,690
Nothing. Nothing.

266
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,790
Is this an episode? Is this\None of Will's episodes?

267
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,940
No. No! No.

268
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,900
I'm sorry. I just... I don't...

269
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,150
see how any of this is\Ngood for Will, or for you.

270
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,050
And even if I wanted to play along,

271
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,650
I mean, how could I figure anything out

272
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,550
if I don't understand the\Ncontext of the game?

273
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,590
- Or...\N- What?

274
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,590
- What is it?\N- I know that shape.

275
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,700
It's Lovers' Lake.

276
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,950
It's Lovers' Lake. I get it.

277
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,300
Okay, I get. That's Lake Jordan.

278
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,190
And if that's Lake Jordan,\Nthen you can probably find...

279
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,100
Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry.

280
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,770
And if you just follow it naturally...

281
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,690
it moves to...

282
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,020
the Eno River.

283
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,400
And there it is. That's\Nthe Eno, do you see it?

284
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,790
Okay, so the lines aren't roads.

285
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,540
But they act like roads.

286
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,240
And they act like roads 'cause\Nwhen you follow 'em, you'll see...

287
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,090
they don't go over water.

288
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,090
And that's the giveaway.\NThat's the giveaway. Ha!

289
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,600
Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle,

290
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,420
it's a map.

291
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,340
It's a map of Hawkins.

292
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,640
Right, Will?

293
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,640
Does anybody copy?

294
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,100
Look, if anybody copies, this is\NJim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief...

295
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,290
Guys, this is Dustin again.

296
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,690
Does anyone copy? This is a code red.\NI repeat, a code red!

297
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,190
I really need someone to pick up here.

298
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,590
Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red.

299
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,590
Code red!

300
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,590
All right, it's Dustin again.

301
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,090
Seriously, I have a code red.

302
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,440
Could you please shut up?

303
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,290
Erica? Erica, is Lucas there?

304
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,390
- Where is he?\N- Don’t know. Don't care.

305
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,590
Is he with Mike?

306
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,240
Like I said, I don't\Nknow and I don't care.

307
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,490
Please tell him it's super important.

308
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,140
Please tell him that I have a code...

309
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,290
Code red?

310
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,590
- Yep, code red. Exactly.\N- Mmm-hmm.

311
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,840
I got a code for you instead.

312
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,190
It's called code shut-your-mouth.

313
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
Erica?

314
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,440
I just need a little help\Nunderstanding, sweetie, okay?

315
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,840
Can you tell me where you came from?

316
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,490
Where you've been all this time?

317
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,390
A policeman and a woman came\Nlooking for you last year.

318
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,840
Did they find you?

319
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,440
She won't get better...

320
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,740
will she?

321
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,440
They don't think so, no.

322
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,540
But she's not in any pain.

323
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,090
She's just stuck, they think.

324
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,290
Like in a dream.

325
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,790
A long dream.

326
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,290
A good dream?

327
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,890
I hope so.

328
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,890
Is it the same dream?

329
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,890
We don't know.

330
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,440
Sometimes she says different words.

331
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,040
But usually those.

332
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,940
She always believed that\Nyou were out there.

333
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,990
She always believed that\Nyou'd come home one day.

334
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
Home?

335
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,390
Yeah, home.

336
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Pretty.

337
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,520
I can get you a real bed, and\Nyou can stay here with me

338
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,610
if you want.

339
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,410
How's that sound?

340
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,520
I wanna help you, but...

341
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,560
to really do that, I need\Nyou to talk to me, okay?

342
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,920
Doesn't have to be now.\NDoesn't have to be today.

343
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,260
But when you're ready.

344
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,170
Okay?

345
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,310
Okay.

346
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,560
Oh, yeah, that.

347
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,440
That happens sometimes.

348
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,690
Old house, bad wiring...

349
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,160
Or if you ask my crazy\Naunt Shirley, it's...

350
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
haunted.

351
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,090
Sweetie, really, it's just the wiring.

352
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,170
No.

353
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,490
It's Mama.

354
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,270
Sunflower. Rainbow.

355
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,870
Three to the right. Four to the left.

356
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,870
I don't understand.

357
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,010
Four-fifty.

358
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,170
She knows I'm here.

359
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,720
She wants to talk.

360
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,690
Rainbow.

361
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,660
All right.

362
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,410
All right. I'm 3.6\Ninches, what do you got?

363
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,370
I'm not sure. Mrs. Byers?

364
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,570
Hold on.

365
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,910
Twenty-one feet, four inches.

366
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,610
What about Tippecanoe to Danford Creek?

367
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,420
Danford? Where's Danford?

368
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,510
Dining room.

369
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,560
Sixteen feet, ten inches.

370
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,920
What about Danford to Jordan?

371
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,770
Oh, come on. This has gotta be enough.

372
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,390
It's not. It's... it's really not.

373
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,720
Okay. Can't you figure it out?

374
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,970
Well, it's hard.

375
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,460
The ratio isn't exactly one-to-one.

376
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,120
I mean, if you're twisting my arm,

377
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,560
and you are twisting my arm,

378
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,490
I would say that the X is...

379
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,960
maybe a half mile southeast of Danford?

380
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,460
Thank you. Thank you.

381
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,340
What? Are we... we really going?

382
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,840
I don't know, Cath.

383
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,410
Maybe if it was Margaret Thatcher,\Nthat'd be another story.

384
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,010
Just a second, Cath.

385
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,390
Ted, can you get that please?

386
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,340
Sorry.

387
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
I got it.

388
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,440
Your line has been busy for\Nover two hours, Mr. Wheeler.

389
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,660
- Do you realize this?\N- Oh, I do realize.

390
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,440
- Is Mike home?\N- No.

391
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,910
No? Well, where the hell is he?

392
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,960
Karen, where's our son?

393
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,210
Will's!

394
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,520
- Will's.\N- No one's picking up there.

395
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,270
Nancy. What about Nancy?

396
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,270
Karen, where's Nancy?

397
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,360
- Ally's!\N- Ally's.

398
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,810
Our children don't live here anymore.\NYou didn't know that?

399
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,220
- Seriously?\N- Am I done here?

400
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,170
Son of a bitch. You're really\Nno help at all, you know that?

401
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,020
Hey! Language.

402
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,870
Listen...

403
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
I've been thinking...

404
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,420
I love you. I'm sorry.

405
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,420
I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?

406
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Steve.

407
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,720
Are those for Mr. or Mrs. Wheeler?

408
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,370
- No.\N- Good.

409
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,620
- Hey. What the hell? Hey!\N- Nancy isn't home.

410
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,220
- Where is she?\N- Doesn't matter.

411
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,270
We have bigger problems\Nthan your love life.

412
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,470
Do you still have that bat?

413
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,770
- Bat? What bat?\N- The one with the nails?

414
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,920
- Why?\N- I'll explain it on the way.

415
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,820
- Now?\N- Now!

416
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,370
Son of a bitch!

417
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,570
Wait. Wait. No, no! No! No!

418
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,470
And that was the last\Nwe ever saw of her.

419
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,520
After that, she was just gone.

420
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,370
I can't believe it's been that long.\NFeels like yesterday.

421
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,140
Yeah. I mean, I bet.

422
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,590
- Wow.\N- It's crazy.

423
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,440
I know.

424
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,990
It's crazy, but...

425
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,190
I really liked it.

426
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,940
- Liked it?\N- Yeah.

427
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,840
- Well, I mean, I had a few issues.\N- Issues?

428
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,640
I felt it was a little\Nderivative in parts.

429
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,990
What are you talking about?

430
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,010
I just wish it had a\Nlittle more originality.

431
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,640
- That's all.\N- You don't believe me?

432
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,890
Lucas, come on, seriously? How\Ngullible do you think I am?

433
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,140
Why would I make this up?

434
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,230
I don't know. To impress\Nme or something?

435
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,730
Or you're just, like, insane.

436
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,880
I tell you all of this. I\Nmean, top-secret stuff.

437
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,690
Risking my life. And\Nthis is how you react?

438
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,380
Risking your life?

439
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,240
- Oh, so this is funny to you?\N- Yeah. I mean...

440
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
kind of funny.

441
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,630
Stupid, but funny.

442
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,710
Where are you going?

443
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,740
Story time's over, isn't it?

444
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,730
What's wrong with you? I\Ngave you what you wanted.

445
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,230
I wanted to be a part of the\Ngroup, not a part of some joke.

446
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,530
It's not a joke.

447
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,310
You did a good job, okay?

448
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,280
You can go tell the others\NI believed your lies

449
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,190
if it gets you experience\Npoints or whatever.

450
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
We have a lot of rules in our party,

451
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,530
but the most important\Nis, "Friends don't lie."

452
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,610
Never ever. No matter what.

453
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,690
Is that right?

454
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,130
Then how do you explain this?

455
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,040
I had to do that. To protect you.

456
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,380
To protect me from who, exactly?

457
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,790
The big bad government\Nbaddies from Hawkins Lab?

458
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Lower your voice.

459
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,010
Maybe it was to protect me from the\NDemogorgon from another dimension?

460
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,730
- Max, I'm serious, shut up!\N- Oh, no, no!

461
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,840
You know what it was? It was Eleven.\NThe girl...

462
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,540
Stop talking.

463
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,890
You're going to get us killed.

464
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,310
Do you understand?

465
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,360
You're serious?

466
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,360
I really wish I wasn't.

467
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,530
Prove it.

468
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,940
I can't.

469
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,880
So what? I'm supposed to just trust you?

470
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,230
Yes.

471
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,210
Shit. I gotta go. Um...

472
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,680
Don't follow me out. Okay?

473
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,290
Do you believe me?

474
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,530
The hell I tell you?

475
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,130
I'm not late.

476
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,690
You know what I'm talking about.

477
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,360
Oh, Lucas?

478
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,330
So he has a name now, huh?

479
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,530
It's a small town, okay?\NWe weren't hanging out.

480
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,830
Hmm. Well, you know what\Nhappens when you lie.

481
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,030
I'm not lying.

482
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,990
What if they try to replicate that?

483
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,690
The more attention we\Nbring to ourselves,

484
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,040
the more people like the\NHollands who know the truth,

485
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,040
the more likely that scenario becomes.

486
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,810
You see why I have to stop the\Ntruth from spreading, too.

487
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,440
Just the same as those weeds there.

488
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,740
By whatever means necessary.

489
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,360
So, is it enough?

490
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,860
The tape recording, is it enough?

491
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,430
Is it incriminating?

492
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,930
- What are you doing?\N- Thinking.

493
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,030
With vodka?

494
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,930
It's a central nervous\Nsystem depressant.

495
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,510
So yes, with vodka.

496
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,810
Music? Really?

497
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,860
Yes. It helps me...

498
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,880
What? Think?

499
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,460
How long is this gonna take?

500
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,380
Longer if you keep talking.

501
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,060
Is the tape incriminating or not?\NIt's a simple question.

502
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,410
There's nothing simple about it.

503
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,310
Nothing simple about\Nanything you've told me.

504
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,660
You don't believe us, do you?

505
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,710
I believe you, but\Nthat's not the problem.

506
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,160
You don't need me to believe you.\NYou need them to believe you.

507
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,560
- Them?\N- Them.

508
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,760
With a capital "T."

509
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,910
Your priest, your postman, your teacher,

510
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,510
the world at large.

511
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,360
They won't believe any of this.

512
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,410
That's why we made the tape.

513
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,610
Oh. That's easy to bury. Easy.

514
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,010
He admits it. You heard it.\NHe admits culpability.

515
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,860
You're being naive, Nancy!

516
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
Those people...

517
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,760
They're not wired like me and you, okay?

518
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,910
They don't spend their lives

519
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,310
trying to get a look at\Nwhat's behind the curtain.

520
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,160
They like the curtain.

521
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,510
It provides them stability,\Ncomfort, definition.

522
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,610
This...

523
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,660
this would open the curtain,

524
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,310
and open the curtain\Nbehind that curtain, okay?

525
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,060
So the minute someone with an ounce\Nof authority calls bullshit,

526
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,510
everyone will nod their heads and say,

527
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,910
"See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit."

528
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,460
That is, if you even get\Ntheir attention at all.

529
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,360
You're saying we did all\Nof this for nothing?

530
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,660
I'm saying, I'm thinking.

531
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,210
Ooh!

532
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,010
This is ridiculous.

533
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,460
- That's it. That's it!\N- What's it?

534
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,610
It's just too strong. Too strong.

535
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Better.

536
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,010
Perfect.

537
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,410
We water it down.

538
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:57,410
- Precisely.\N- Wait. What?

539
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,460
Your story. We moderate it.

540
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,160
Just like this drink here.

541
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,210
We make it more tolerable.

542
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,810
Perhaps Barbara was exposed\Nto some dangerous toxins.

543
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,460
A leak from the lab. Like Three\NMile Island or something.

544
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,360
Something scary but familiar.

545
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:26,010
Close enough that it hits the\Nman right where it hurts.

546
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,760
And those assholes that killed Barb...

547
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,160
They'll go down.

548
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,760
All right, what are we looking at?

549
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,210
This was some of the\Nsoil we took yesterday.

550
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,610
Okay. So what is your concern?

551
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,610
Well, we didn't find any\Nsigns of contamination.

552
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,350
Uh, nothing hazardous other\Nthan some pesticides.

553
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,760
Well, it's a farm.

554
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,430
Right, right. Exactly. But...

555
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:25,850
Like this?

556
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
Yes.

557
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,260
It's okay if I sit here, right?

558
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,450
Yes.

559
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,850
And I won't mess it up or anything?

560
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,200
- No.\N- Okay.

561
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,650
If you talk to Terry, will you tell her

562
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,480
that I love her very much?

563
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,810
And that I'm sorry that\NI didn't believe...

564
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,280
- Stop talking.\N- Okay, sorry.

565
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:56,200
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

566
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,080
Three to the right. Four to the left.

567
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Four-fifty.

568
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,350
Breathe.

569
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,960
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

570
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Three to the right. Four to the left.\NFour-fifty.

571
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,680
- Breathe.\N- Mama?

572
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,760
- Sunflower. Rainbow.\N- Mama, it's me...

573
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,700
Three to the right. Four to the left.

574
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,230
- Four-fifty.\N- Jane.

575
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,610
Breathe. Sunflower.

576
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,810
I'm here now.

577
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,110
Four-fifty.

578
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:32,950
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

579
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,200
I'm home.

580
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,860
No.

581
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,660
Mama!

582
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,850
Mama! Mama!

583
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,350
- Oh, my baby!\N- What do I do?

584
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,710
- Mama, what do I do? Help me!\N- Breathe. Breathe.

585
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,730
Just breathe. Breathe.\NJust breathe, all right?

586
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:02,980
They're on their way.

587
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,560
- They're on their way, okay?\N- Okay.

588
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,450
Stay with us, darling. Stay with us.

589
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,050
Hey, there.

590
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,110
Jane?

591
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,530
- Where's Jane?\N- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

592
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,780
No, I saw her.

593
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,110
- No, no, she wasn't breathing.\N- She was crying.

594
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,110
- No.\N- I heard it. He was there.

595
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,550
- Who was there?\N- He took her.

596
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,660
Don't take it out! Terry!

597
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,110
- Terry!\N- No! No!

598
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,150
Please don't!

599
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,030
Three to the right. Four to the left.

600
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,230
Ma'am, can I see your badge?

601
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,830
Stay back. Stay back!

602
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,280
Jane? Jane?

603
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,630
Jane... No!

604
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:07,230
No! No! She's my child! No!

605
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,230
She's my child!

606
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:14,280
No! No.

607
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,880
No.

608
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,180
No. No. No.

609
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,530
Ah!

610
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:26,980
Four-fifty.

611
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,630
Breathe. They're on their way.

612
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,480
Stay with us, darling.

613
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,430
Sunflower.

614
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,180
Three to the right. Four to the left.

615
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,030
- Rainbow. Four-fifty.\N- Breathe.

616
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,080
Sunflower. Rainbow.

617
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,230
Jane... No!

618
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,680
- Four-fifty.\N- Breathe.

619
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,230
- Three to the right. Four to the left.\N- Breathe.

620
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,080
- Sunflower. Rainbow.\N- Breathe.

621
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,430
- Three to the right. Four to the left.\N- Breathe.

622
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,130
Four-fifty. Sunflower. Rainbow.

623
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:13,580
Sunflower. Rainbow. Three to the right.\NFour to the left.

624
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,580
Four-fifty. Breathe. Sunflower.

625
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,230
There's nothing. There's nothing here.

626
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,530
- Are... Are we close?\N- We're in the vicinity.

627
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,830
What's that mean, the vicinity?

628
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,180
It means we're close. I don't know.\NIt's not precise.

629
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,280
But we did all that work.

630
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,280
I told you, the scale\Nratio is not exactly

631
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,980
one-to-one. We needed to take...

632
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,680
- Turn right.\N- What?

633
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,330
- I saw him.\N- Where?

634
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,680
Not here. In my now-memories.

635
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,030
- In your what?\N- Turn right!

636
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:52,730
Are you okay?

637
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,780
Superspy.

638
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,980
What's Jim doing here? Joyce?

639
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,730
Boys, I need you to stay here.

640
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,680
No. Mom, Mom, Mom, it's not safe.

641
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,630
That's why I need you to stay here!\NStay here!

642
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,980
Hopper!

643
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,730
Hey, be careful.

644
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,330
Just going down the hole.

645
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,530
Vines.

646
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:19,030
Give me that.

647
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,280
- The shovel?\N- Yes, give me the shovel.

648
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,680
I need you to help me get down there.

649
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:38,780
- Joyce, what are you talking about?\N- Bob! Now!

650
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:52,680
Hopper!

651
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,480
Hopper!

652
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,900
Hopper!

653
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,370
Joyce, what is going on?

654
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,280
- Where are we?\N- Bob, are you okay?

655
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,980
Tunnels. Is this Will's map?

656
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,070
Hopper!

657
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,780
Are we in Will's map?

658
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:11,420
Hopper! Hopper!

659
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,220
We're in Will's map.

660
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,720
Hopper!

661
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,500
We're actually inside of Will's map.

662
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,580
Hopper!

663
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,280
How did he know all this?

664
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:27,330
Bob!

665
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,350
Over here!

666
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,880
It's his.

667
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,770
He's gotta be this way.

668
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,370
Come on.

669
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,980
Hopper!

670
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,700
Do you see anything? I mean,\Nin your now-memories?

671
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,270
Hopper!

672
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,220
Hopper!

673
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,980
What?

674
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,070
This is...

675
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,400
Oh! It's his arm.

676
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:33,920
It's choking him.

677
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,180
Knife.

678
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,970
- Knife?\N- It's over there.

679
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,370
Okay.

680
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,130
Hands!

681
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:45,020
Hands!

682
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,080
Cut it...

683
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,880
Bastard!

684
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,550
Oh, my God. Hopper, are you okay?

685
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,670
- Joyce.\N- Are you okay? Are you okay?

686
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,070
- Hey, Bob.\N- Hey, Jim.

687
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,400
Oh, God!

688
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,500
Go! Go! Go! Clear the area!

689
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,570
- Go!\N- Wait.

690
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,870
Move, now!

691
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,300
Will? Will, you okay?

692
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,370
Will, what's wrong?
