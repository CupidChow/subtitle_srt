1
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,060
Thanks.

2
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,720
No.

3
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,140
Hands up. Hands up!

4
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,810
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

6
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,770
Look, Dr. Brenner asked\Nfor me specifically. Okay?

7
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,240
How else do you think I got in here?

8
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,900
What's your name again?

9
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,690
It's Jim Hopper.

10
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,490
Chief Jim Hopper.

11
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,470
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper...

12
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,510
Come again?

13
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,750
Hey...

14
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,350
you mind if I borrow this one?

15
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,720
Drink.

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,120
It'll calm your nerves.

17
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,450
Help you think straight, yeah?

18
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,090
I don't know what to do.

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,920
I know. I know.

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,590
This whole time...

21
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,910
I... I could... I could feel him.

22
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,310
He was...

23
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,380
He was so close. He\Nwas... he was right there.

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,210
I knew he was alive.

25
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,090
Our hands... our hands\Nwere almost touching.

26
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,200
Now it's like I... uh...

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,490
God, it's like I can't feel him anymore.

28
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,600
- Don't look at me like that.\N- Like what?

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,730
Like how everybody is looking at me.

30
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,750
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.\N- Hey.

31
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,690
You're not gonna like this,

32
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,420
but I think you need to seriously\Nconsider the possibility that all this...

33
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,780
It's in your head.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,290
- You remember your Aunt Darlene?\N- No.

35
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,330
No, this is not that.

36
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,960
I mean, when something\Nlike this happens,

37
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,100
your mind makes up stuff\Nfor you to cope, you know?

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,310
I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral\Ntomorrow for our little boy

39
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,330
and you're saying his body is fake.

40
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,820
He's in the wall.

41
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,490
I mean, how do you explain that?

42
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,900
It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,690
At least go talk to a shrink or...

44
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,820
- What about Pastor Charles or someone...\N- I don't... Well, they can't help.

45
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,800
Joyce, you just told me...

46
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,130
that Will is gone.

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,180
What else is there to do?

48
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,730
Hey.

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,490
Will?

50
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,950
Will?

51
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,620
Will?

52
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,790
Will?

53
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,590
What was Will saying?

54
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,900
Like home... Like home...

55
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,780
but dark?

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,110
And empty.

57
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,640
Empty and cold. Wait, did he say cold?

58
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,810
I don't know. The stupid\Nradio kept going in and out.

59
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,360
It's like riddles in the dark.

60
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,280
Like home. Like his house?

61
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,610
Or maybe like Hawkins.

62
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,240
Upside down.

63
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,570
- What'd she say?\N- Upside down.

64
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,220
- What?\N- Upside down.

65
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,080
When El showed us where Will was,\Nshe flipped the board over, remember?

66
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,120
Upside down.

67
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,830
Dark. Empty.

68
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,250
Do you understand what\Nhe's talking about?

69
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,250
- No.\N- Guys, come on, think about it.

70
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,380
When El took us to find Will,\Nshe took us to his house, right?

71
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,260
Yeah. And he wasn't there.

72
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,050
But what if he was there?

73
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,100
What if we just couldn't see him?

74
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,160
What if he was on the other side?

75
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,410
What if this is Hawkins and...

76
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,060
this is where Will is?

77
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,770
The Upside Down.

78
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,580
Like the Vale of Shadows.

79
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,960
Will?

80
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,550
Will?

81
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,930
Will?

82
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,610
I see him! Hey! Stop!

83
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,560
"The Vale of Shadows

84
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,920
is a dimension that is a dark\Nreflection or echo of our world.

85
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,950
It is a place of decay and death."

86
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,370
Will?

87
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,350
"A plane out of phase.\NA place of monsters.

88
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,170
It is right next to you,\Nand you don't even see it."

89
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,650
Will?

90
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,800
Will?

91
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,900
An alternate dimension.

92
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
But... how... how do we get there?

93
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,930
You cast Shadow Walk.

94
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,310
In real life, dummy.

95
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,410
We can't shadow walk, but...

96
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,790
maybe she can.

97
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,250
Do you know how we get\Nthere? To the Upside Down?

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, my God!

99
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,900
What the hell?

100
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,520
Hey!

101
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,610
Hey! Hey!

102
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,350
Hey, kid.

103
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,220
What's going on?

104
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,390
Your dad's, uh, gonna stay\Nhere tonight. On the couch.

105
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,520
Yeah, I'm here as long\Nas you need me, okay?

106
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,420
How are you holding up?

107
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,150
What happened?

108
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,880
- Don't worry about that.\N- Mom...

109
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,580
that thing you saw\Nbefore, did it come back?

110
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,370
Jonathan, that's enough.

111
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,870
Can we talk?

112
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,140
Alone?

113
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,170
- You need to leave.\N- Look, I know you're upset.

114
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,840
We all are.

115
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,010
But you need to listen to me.\NYour mother is sick. Really sick.

116
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,590
Yeah. Well, you being here,

117
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,890
you're just making\Nthings worse, like always.

118
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,010
- Worse?\N- Yeah!

119
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,060
She took down that wall with an ax.

120
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,400
She said that Will was inside\Nand that he's talking to her.

121
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,810
Yeah. Maybe he was.

122
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,650
This isn't some kind of joke.

123
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,730
Your mom was half frozen\Nto death when I got here.

124
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,190
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

125
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,530
You come in here and you start\Nfeeding into her hallucinations

126
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,150
or whatever the hell\Nyou want to call it,

127
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,930
you're gonna push her\Nright over the edge.

128
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,840
You hear me?

129
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,200
Look, I'm on your side.

130
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm here to help.

131
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm gonna make things better\Naround here for all of us.

132
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,410
Thank God you're here.

133
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,520
Do me a favor. At the\Nfuneral tomorrow, just behave.

134
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,320
If not for me, for your mother.

135
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,780
Take that down. It's inappropriate.

136
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,650
- Good.\N- Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

137
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,460
Ah... there. It's supposed\Nto be a little tight.

138
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,620
Looks good.

139
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,090
Here we go.

140
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,180
You look nice, sweetie.

141
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,500
Anything else?

142
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,460
You can borrow my\Nblack heels if you want.

143
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,380
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

144
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,770
I'm fine. Thanks.

145
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,470
Ugh.

146
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,050
Come on. Time to go.

147
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,780
Come on.

148
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,730
"Fear not, for I am with you.

149
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,500
Be not dismayed, for I am your God.

150
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,440
I will strengthen you.

151
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,700
Yes, I will help you.

152
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,470
I will uphold you with\Nmy righteous right hand."

153
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,930
It's times like these that\Nour faith is challenged.

154
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,560
How, if He is truly benevolent...

155
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,900
could God take from us\Nsomeone so young, so innocent?

156
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,820
It would be easy to\Nturn away from God...

157
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,140
but we must remember that nothing,

158
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,850
not even tragedy, can\Nseparate us from His love.

159
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,930
We are here today to find\Ncomfort in the truth of scripture,

160
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,270
and to surround Will and his family...

161
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,160
Just wait till we\Ntell Will that Jennifer

162
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,690
Hayes was crying at his funeral.

163
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,910
- I'm so, so sorry.\N- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

164
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,080
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

165
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,220
I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

166
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,480
Take care, all right? Thanks.

167
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,060
Thanks for coming out.

168
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,120
I see Will the Wise is back.

169
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,730
What's that shooting out of his cane?

170
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,230
Fireballs.

171
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,610
I couldn't find the red crayon,\Nso that's why it's green.

172
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,730
Oh, well...

173
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,860
if he's so wise, why\Ndoes he need fireballs?

174
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,170
Why can't he just, you\Nknow, outsmart the bad guys?

175
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,870
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

176
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,250
But... sometimes the\Nbad guys are smart, too.

177
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,350
You know?

178
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,870
Yeah.

179
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,920
So he needs the fireballs?

180
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,800
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

181
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,300
All right. Well, I don't\Nknow who's been raising you,

182
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,800
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

183
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
because it looks like\Nhe's shooting cabbages.

184
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,540
Will! Will, it's us! Are you there?

185
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,040
Can you hear us? We're here!

186
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,420
Hello? Mom?

187
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,320
- Why can't he hear us?\N- I don't know!

188
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,740
Mom, it's coming!

189
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,010
She was there.

190
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,640
This is where we know\Nfor sure it's been, right?

191
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,190
- So, that's...\N- Steve's house.

192
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,810
And that's the woods where\Nthey found Will's bike and...

193
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,980
that's my house.

194
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,940
- It's all so close.\N- Yeah. Exactly.

195
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,400
I mean, it's all within\Na mile or something.

196
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,800
Whatever this thing is,\Nit's... it's not traveling far.

197
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,800
You want to go out there.

198
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,660
We might not find anything.

199
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,100
I found something.

200
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,980
And if we do see it...

201
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,070
then what?

202
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,900
We kill it.

203
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,200
- What are you doing?\N- Just give me a second.

204
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,360
Are you serious?

205
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,840
What? You want to find this thing\Nand take another photo? Yell at it?

206
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,080
This is a terrible idea.

207
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,710
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

208
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,710
What? You can tell someone, but\Nthey're not gonna believe you.

209
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,790
You know that.

210
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,130
Your mom would.

211
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,710
- She's been through enough.\N- She deserves to know.

212
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,170
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

213
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,650
when this thing is dead.

214
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,260
I don't know what in\Nthe world caused it.

215
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,520
- Let's take a look, huh?\N- Yeah.

216
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,270
Mr. Clarke says he's never\Nseen anything like it.

217
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,410
Mr. Clarke?

218
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,400
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

219
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,610
That right?

220
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,090
Apparently, some of the less\Nathletic types go nuts for this stuff.

221
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,690
Mr. Clarke?

222
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,420
Oh, hey, there.

223
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,610
How are you boys holding up?

224
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,820
We're... in... mourning.

225
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,660
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

226
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,040
We were wondering if\Nyou had time to talk?

227
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,290
- We have some questions.\N- A lot of questions.

228
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,290
So, you know how in Cosmos, Carl\NSagan talks about other dimensions?

229
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,500
Like, beyond our world?

230
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,090
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

231
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,250
Right, theoretically.

232
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,920
So, theoretically,\Nhow do we travel there?

233
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,270
You guys have been thinking about

234
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,530
Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds\NInterpretation, haven't you?

235
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,100
Well, basically, there\Nare parallel universes.

236
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,600
Just like our world,

237
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,160
but just infinite variations of it.

238
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,580
Which means there's a world out there

239
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,410
where none of this tragic\Nstuff ever happened.

240
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,320
Yeah, that's not what\Nwe're talking about.

241
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,940
- Oh.\N- We were thinking of more

242
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,810
of an evil dimension,\Nlike the Vale of Shadows.

243
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,200
You know the Vale of Shadows?

244
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,780
An echo of the Material Plane,\Nwhere necrotic and shadow magic...

245
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,780
Yeah, exactly.

246
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,250
If that did exist, a place\Nlike the Vale of Shadows,

247
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,660
how would we travel there?

248
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,640
- Theoretically.\N- Well...

249
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,190
Picture... an acrobat...

250
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,630
standing on a tightrope.

251
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,340
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

252
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,890
And our dimension has rules.

253
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,830
You can move forwards, or backwards.

254
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,890
But, what if...

255
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,110
right next to our\Nacrobat, there is a flea?

256
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,320
Now, the flea can also travel back\Nand forth, just like the acrobat.

257
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,690
- Right?\N- Right.

258
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,070
Here's where things\Nget really interesting.

259
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,450
The flea can also travel this way...

260
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,660
along the side of the rope.

261
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,390
He can even go...

262
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,540
underneath the rope.

263
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,830
- Upside down.\N- Exactly.

264
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,170
But we're not the\Nflea, we're the acrobat.

265
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,500
In this metaphor,\Nyes, we're the acrobat.

266
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,170
So we can't go upside down?

267
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,590
No.

268
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,430
Well, is there any way for the\Nacrobat to get to the Upside Down?

269
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,100
Well... you'd have to create\Na massive amount of energy.

270
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,970
More than humans are currently\Ncapable of creating, mind you,

271
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,350
to open up some kind of\Ntear in time and space,

272
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,660
and then...

273
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,900
you create a doorway.

274
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,650
- Like a gate?\N- Sure. Like a gate.

275
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,530
- But again, this is all...\N- Theoretical.

276
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,080
But... but what if this\Ngate already existed?

277
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,580
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

278
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,960
It would disrupt gravity,

279
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,000
the magnetic field, our environment.

280
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,520
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

281
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,300
Science is neat.

282
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,150
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

283
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,790
Whoa.

284
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,380
Hey, Chief!

285
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,090
- Hello? Whoa!\N- Hey!

286
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,370
- Jesus, Chief. You all right?\N- What are you doing here?

287
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,140
- We tried calling, but...\N- Yeah, the phone's dead.

288
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,620
Hey, so Bev Mooney came\Nin this morning all upset.

289
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,380
Said that Dale and Henry\Nwent hunting yesterday...

290
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,640
and they didn't come back home.

291
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,200
She thought they were on another\Nbinger, but she's not so sure now.

292
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,390
I think this whole Will Byers\Nthing has everybody on edge.

293
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,100
- Where was this?\N- It was at the station.

294
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
No, no. Where did Henry\Nand Dale go hunting?

295
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,080
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

296
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,640
Mirkwood.

297
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,000
What?

298
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,810
Okay.

299
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,630
You go back to the station. I'll\Ntake care of this, all right?

300
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,360
- Are you sure?\N- Yeah, leave it.

301
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,910
- Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.\N- What?

302
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,910
Barbara Holland's car.\NSeems she ran away after all.

303
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,540
Staties found it late last\Nnight at a bus station.

304
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,680
Funny, right? They keep\Ndoing our job for us.

305
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,560
Yeah. It's funny.

306
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,680
Is he off his meds again?

307
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,390
He's been spending too\Nmuch time with Joyce Byers.

308
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,740
That's what I think.

309
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,860
What are you doing?

310
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,570
What does it look like I'm doing?

311
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,230
You want to freeze to death all winter?

312
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,410
- I told you not to take these down.\N- They were in the way, babe.

313
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,890
How long are you gonna keep\Nthose up? I mean, really?

314
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,210
You know, it's a shame what\Nthey've done to this family.

315
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,090
- What?\N- The Sattler Company.

316
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,880
I went to the quarry\Non the way over here.

317
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,960
I just wanted to look around, you know?

318
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,570
Couldn't believe it. I\Njust couldn't believe it.

319
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,240
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

320
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,370
Ought to be held\Naccountable if you ask me.

321
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,230
It would take a lot of energy\Nto build a gate like this.

322
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,660
But that's got to be what happened.

323
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,530
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?\N- Right.

324
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,510
What we want to know is, do\Nyou know where the gate is?

325
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,340
Then how do you know\Nabout the Upside Down?

326
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,380
Dustin, what are you doing? Dustin?

327
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,730
- Dustin!\N- Dustin!

328
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,720
- I... I need to see your compasses.\N- What?

329
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,110
Your compasses. All of\Nyour compasses, right now!

330
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,180
What's exciting about this?

331
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,770
- Well, they're all facing north, right?\N- Yeah, so?

332
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,750
- Well, that's not true north.\N- What do you mean?

333
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,900
I mean exactly what I just\Nsaid. That's not true north.

334
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,340
Are you both seriously this dense?

335
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,530
The sun rises in the east,\Nand it sets in the west. Right?

336
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,990
Which means that's true north.

337
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,980
So what you're saying is\Nthe compasses are broken.

338
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,330
Do you even understand\Nhow a compass works?

339
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,670
- Do you see a battery pack on this?\N- No.

340
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,750
No, you don't. Because\Nit doesn't need one.

341
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,630
The needle's naturally drawn to\Nthe Earth's magnetic North Pole.

342
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,130
So what's wrong with them?

343
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,220
Well, that's what I couldn't\Nfigure out, but then I remembered.

344
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,500
You can change the direction\Nof a compass with a magnet.

345
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,960
If there's the presence of a\Nmore powerful magnetic field,

346
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,600
the needle deflects to that power.

347
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,350
And then I remembered\Nwhat Mr. Clarke said.

348
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,100
The gate would have so much power...

349
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,810
It could disrupt the\Nelectromagnetic field.

350
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,900
Exactly.

351
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,360
Meaning, if we follow\Nthe compasses' north...

352
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,420
They should lead us to the gate.

353
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,960
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

354
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,310
- What are you doing here?\N- What are you doing?

355
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,970
- Nothing.\N- I hope that's not meant for me.

356
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,430
What? No.

357
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,570
Oh, no, I was just...

358
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,410
- thinking about joining softball.\N- Oh.

359
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,350
Well, uh...

360
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,770
listen, I'm really sorry.

361
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,620
I mean, even before you threatened\Nme with the baseball bat.

362
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,440
Okay.

363
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,030
I panicked and...

364
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,910
- I mean, I was a total dick.\N- Yeah, you were.

365
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,620
Did you get in trouble\Nwith your parents?

366
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,950
Totally, but...

367
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,210
you know, who cares? Screw 'em.

368
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,140
Any news about Barbara?

369
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,190
- Parents heard from her? Or...\N- No.

370
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,340
Hey, listen.

371
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,430
Why don't we, uh, why don't we\Ncatch a movie tonight, you know?

372
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,180
Just kinda pretend everything's\Nnormal for a few hours.

373
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,070
All The Right Moves is still playing.

374
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,560
You know, with your lover\Nboy from Risky Business?

375
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,690
Yeah, I know.

376
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,830
You know, Carol thinks I\Nactually kinda look like him.

377
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,270
What do you think? Huh?

378
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,510
I just, I... I don't think I can.

379
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,040
I've been really busy with\Nthis whole funeral thing and...

380
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,250
with my brother.

381
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,040
It's been really hard on him.

382
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,770
Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah, yeah.

383
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,230
So...

384
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,990
I should go.

385
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,150
Sorry.

386
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,870
I'll call you later. Is that okay?

387
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,620
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

388
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,780
- You were here for the money!\N- No!

389
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,380
The money! Admit it!

390
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,020
You aren't here 'cause of Will. You\Nnever cared about him. You never did!

391
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,380
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral\Ntoday. Do we have to do this right now?

392
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,010
- I can't believe I fell for this.\N- I'm here to help, Joyce.

393
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,350
- To help?\N- We could use that money for good.

394
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,100
Oh, like maybe to pay off your debts?

395
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,520
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!

396
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,730
- Oh, don't do that.\N- Do what?

397
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,820
- Lie to me!\N- I'm not lying to you!

398
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,280
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?

399
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,400
- Huh?\N- What?

400
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,070
Where does Jonathan\Nwant to go to college?

401
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,070
We get that money, anywhere\Nhe damn well pleases!

402
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,910
NYU, Lonnie!

403
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,540
He's wanted to go to NYU\Nsince he was six years old!

404
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,910
So then he goes to NYU!

405
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,180
Get out.

406
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,730
Get out!

407
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,790
You need me here, Joyce.

408
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,510
Oh, brother, I have not\Nneeded you for a long time!

409
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,900
Oh, no? Look what happened.

410
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,140
Oh, don't you dare.

411
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,680
- At least I was here!\N- Oh, come on, Joyce.

412
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,640
Just look around at this place.

413
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,100
All your Christmas lights.

414
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,270
What the hell am I supposed to think?\NYou're such a great mom? You're a mess!

415
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,570
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm\Ncrazy. Maybe I'm out of my mind!

416
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:13,660
But, God help me, I will keep\Nthese lights up until the day I die

417
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,470
if I think there's a chance\Nthat Will's still out there!

418
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,470
Now, get out!

419
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,640
Get out of my house!

420
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,780
You're supposed to hit the cans, right?

421
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,980
No, actually, you see the\Nspaces in between the cans?

422
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,940
I'm aiming for those.

423
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,080
Ah.

424
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,900
You ever shot a gun before?

425
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,880
Have you met my parents?

426
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,840
Yeah, I haven't shot\None since I was ten.

427
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,330
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.

428
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,160
He made me kill a rabbit.

429
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,040
- A rabbit?\N- Yeah.

430
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,850
I guess he thought it would make\Nme into more of a man or something.

431
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,250
I cried for a week.

432
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,500
Jesus.

433
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,840
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

434
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,220
I meant your dad.

435
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,530
Yeah.

436
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,560
I guess he and my mother loved\Neach other at some point, but...

437
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,990
I wasn't around for that part.

438
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,540
Um, yeah.

439
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,080
Just, uh, point and shoot.

440
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,030
I don't think my parents\Never loved each other.

441
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,070
They must've married for some reason.

442
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,550
My mom was young.

443
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,990
My dad was older,

444
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,180
but he had a cushy job,\Nmoney, came from a good family.

445
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,550
So they bought a nice house\Nat the end of the cul-de-sac...

446
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,610
and started their nuclear family.

447
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,510
Screw that.

448
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,780
Yeah.

449
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,410
Screw that.

450
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,920
- Hello?\N- Hey.

451
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,490
Jim?

452
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,320
Yeah.

453
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,080
Why are you calling me here?\NI told you not to call me.

454
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,790
I know, I know, I know.\NI just wanted to...

455
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,270
I just wanted to hear\Nyour voice and, uh...

456
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,480
I just wanted to say that, um...

457
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,360
even after everything\Nthat happened, I don't...

458
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,100
I don't regret any of it.

459
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,080
And those seven years, they\Nwere... everything to me.

460
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,620
Have you been drinking?

461
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,410
No.

462
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,650
No.

463
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,860
Honey, hey...

464
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,030
Hey, it's okay... it's okay.

465
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,740
You know what, actually, I\Nhave been drinking, I'm sorry.

466
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,200
Jim, I can't...

467
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,370
Just take care of yourself, okay?

468
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,830
Say hi to Bill for me.

469
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,220
Are you sure...

470
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,090
How much further?

471
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,260
I don't know. These only\Ntell direction, not distance.

472
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,530
You really need to learn\Nmore about compasses.

473
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,080
I'm just saying.

474
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,580
How do we know when we get to the gate?

475
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,350
Uh, I think a portal to another\Ndimension is gonna be pretty obvious.

476
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,860
Do you think she's acting weird?

477
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,530
You're asking if the\Nweirdo is acting weird?

478
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,740
I mean, weirder than normal?

479
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,450
I don't know. Who cares?

480
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,740
How far, Papa?

481
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,090
Farther than we've ever gone before.

482
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,470
- The bath?\N- Yes.

483
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,100
Yes, the bath.

484
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,890
Is that okay?

485
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,190
Okay.

486
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,410
Mike.

487
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,850
Yeah?

488
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,480
Turn back.

489
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,100
What? Why?

490
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,270
I'm tired.

491
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,170
Look, I'm sure we're almost there.\NJust hold on a little longer, okay?

492
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,980
You never said what I was saying.

493
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,420
What?

494
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,630
Yesterday.

495
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,260
You said I was saying something\Nand that's why you took my picture.

496
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,530
Oh, uh...

497
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,700
I don't know.

498
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,370
My guess...

499
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,560
I saw this girl, you know,\Ntrying to be someone else.

500
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,110
But for that moment...

501
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,650
it was like you were alone,\Nor you thought you were.

502
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,130
And, you know, you\Ncould just be yourself.

503
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,910
That is such bullshit.

504
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,390
What?

505
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,080
I am not trying to be someone else.

506
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,670
Just because I'm dating Steve\Nand you don't like him...

507
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,380
You know what? Forget it. I just\Nthought it was a good picture.

508
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,470
He's actually a good guy.

509
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,650
Okay.

510
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,030
Yesterday, with the camera...

511
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,140
He's not like that at all.

512
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,520
He was just being protective.

513
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,450
Yeah, that's one word for it.

514
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,360
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

515
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,940
No, I... I never said that.

516
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,380
He had every right to be pissed...

517
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,510
Okay, all right. Does that\Nmean I have to like him?

518
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,860
No.

519
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,030
Listen, don't take it\Nso personally, okay?

520
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,010
I don't like most people.\NHe's in the vast majority.

521
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,080
You know, I was actually starting\Nto think that you were okay.

522
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,000
- Yeah?\N- Yeah.

523
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,170
Yeah, I was thinking, "Jonathan Byers,

524
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,460
maybe he's not the pretentious\Ncreep everyone says he is."

525
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,550
Well, I was just starting\Nto think you were okay.

526
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,510
- Oh.\N- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

527
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,510
she's not just another suburban\Ngirl who thinks she's rebelling

528
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,520
by doing exactly what every\Nother suburban girl does...

529
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,230
until that phase passes and they\Nmarry some boring one-time jock

530
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,480
who now works sales,

531
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,500
and they live out a perfectly boring\Nlittle life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

532
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,820
Exactly like their parents, who\Nthey thought were so depressing,

533
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,920
but now, hey, they get it."

534
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,120
Go away, Lonnie.

535
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,150
Seriously!

536
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,060
I am gonna murd...

537
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,950
What? What?

538
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,120
Oh, Jesus.

539
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,620
Oh, no.

540
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,500
"Oh, no"? What's, "Oh, no"?

541
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,040
- We're headed back home.\N- What?

542
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,380
- Are you sure?\N- Yeah, I'm sure.

543
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,800
Setting sun, right there.\NWe looped right back around.

544
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,420
And you're just realizing this now?

545
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,430
- Why is this all on me?\N- Because you're the compass genius!

546
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,010
What do yours say?

547
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,640
North.

548
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,180
Makes no damn sense.

549
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,230
Maybe the gate moved.

550
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,190
No, I don't think it's the gate.

551
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,110
I think it's something else\Nscrewing with the compasses.

552
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,940
Maybe it's something here.

553
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,440
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

554
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,200
It's not a magnet.

555
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
She's been acting weirder than normal.

556
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,180
If she can slam doors with her mind,\Nshe can definitely screw up a compass.

557
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,240
Why would she do that?

558
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,290
Because she's trying\Nto sabotage our mission.

559
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,720
Because she's a traitor!

560
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,770
Lucas, what are you doing?

561
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,670
You did it, didn't you?

562
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,550
You don't want us to reach the gate.

563
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,470
You don't want us to find Will.

564
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,870
Lucas, come on, seriously,

565
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,250
- just leave her alone!\N- Admit it.

566
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,790
- No.\N- Admit it!

567
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,810
- Fresh blood. I knew it.\N- Lucas, come on!

568
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,980
I saw her wiping her nose on the\Ntracks! She was using her powers!

569
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,870
Bull! That's old blood. Right, El?

570
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,040
Right, El?

571
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,710
It's... not...

572
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,340
it's not safe.

573
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,890
Okay.

574
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,570
Should be okay, I mean...

575
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,640
I can't guarantee it,\Nbut it should be okay.

576
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,390
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

577
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,690
They bugged my place.

578
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,110
- What?\N- They bugged my place.

579
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,670
They put a microphone in the light.

580
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,990
It's because I'm on to\Nthem and they know it.

581
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,780
- I don't know...\N- Who?

582
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,450
I thought they might\Nbe watching you, too.

583
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,580
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,\NDepartment of Energy... I don't know.

584
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,830
You gotta explain this\Nto me, 'cause I am not...

585
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,980
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

586
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,440
What?

587
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,440
It wasn't him.

588
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,340
What?

589
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,570
Will's body, it was a fake.

590
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,240
You were right.

591
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,920
This whole time, you were right.

592
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,030
What did I tell you? She's been\Nplaying us from the beginning!

593
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,330
That's not true. She\Nhelped us find Will!

594
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,410
Find Will?

595
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,740
Find Will?

596
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,210
Where is he, then? Huh? I don't see him.

597
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,960
- Yeah, you know what I mean.\N- No, I actually don't.

598
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,290
Just think about it, Mike.

599
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,050
She could've just told us where\Nthe Upside Down was right away,

600
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,210
but she didn't.

601
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,260
She just made us run around\Nlike headless chickens.

602
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,970
- All right, calm down!\N- No!

603
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,850
She used us, all of us!

604
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,310
She helped just enough so\Nshe could get what she wants.

605
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,600
Food and a bed.

606
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,890
- She's like a stray dog.\N- Screw you, Lucas!

607
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,980
No! Screw you, Mike. You're blind...

608
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,360
blind because you like that a\Ngirl's not grossed out by you.

609
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,920
But wake up, man! Wake the hell up!

610
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,030
She knows where Will is,

611
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,900
and now she's just letting\Nhim die in the Upside Down.

612
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,450
- Shut up!\N- For all we know, it's her fault.

613
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,580
Shut up.

614
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,120
We're looking for some stupid monster...

615
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,430
but did you ever stop to think\Nthat maybe she's the monster?

616
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,830
I said shut up!

617
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,340
- Stop!\N- Knock it off, you idiots.

618
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,760
- Stop it!\N- Mike, get off!

619
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,800
Stop it!

620
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,280
Jesus!

621
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,140
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, are you all right?

622
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,980
- Lucas.\N- Lucas, come on!

623
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,150
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.\N- Come on, Lucas!

624
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,920
Why would you do that?

625
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,720
- Come on.\N- What's wrong with you?

626
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,670
What is wrong with you?

627
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,830
What is that?

628
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,250
I have no idea.

629
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,140
Help! Help!

630
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,130
Come on, wake up. Come on!

631
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,070
Lucas... Lucas, come on!

632
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,240
Lucas.

633
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,410
Lucas, you okay?

634
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,560
Lucas... Lucas, how many\Nfingers am I holding up?

635
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,020
Lucas, how many fingers?

636
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,110
- Let me see your head.\N- Get off of me!

637
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,610
Just... Lucas. Lucas, let me see.

638
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,000
Get off of me!

639
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,130
- Lucas, come on.\N- Let him go.

640
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,430
Man, let him go.

641
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,750
Where is El?

642
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,980
El?

643
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,400
- El!\N- Eleven!

644
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,320
El!

645
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,410
- Eleven!\N- El!

646
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,700
Eleven!

647
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,040
What, are you tired?

648
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,580
Shut up.

649
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:26,730
What?

650
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,840
I heard something.

651
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,210
Oh, God.

652
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,680
It's been hit by a car.

653
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,360
We can't just leave it.

654
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,460
I'll do it.

655
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,000
- I thought you said...\N- I'm not nine anymore.

656
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,220
What was that?

657
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,150
Where'd it go?

658
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,320
I don't know.

659
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,360
Do you see any more blood?

660
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,910
No.

661
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,750
Jonathan?

662
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,220
Nancy!

663
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,270
Nancy?

664
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,900
Nancy?

665
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,520
Nancy, where are you?

666
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,280
Nancy!

667
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,820
Nancy!
