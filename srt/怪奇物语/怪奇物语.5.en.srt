1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,010
Shit! Shit!

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,220
We're going down! We're going down!

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,890
Yeah, no shit, Harrington!

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,230
Why don't these buttons work?!

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,020
Press the button!

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,650
What do you think I'm doing?!

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,020
Come on, press something!\NJust press the button!

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,480
Push it!

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,950
Oh!

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,030
My groin.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,410
It fell on my groin.

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,620
Dustin!

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,240
Get this off of me!

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
I can't move.

15
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,290
Is everyone okay?

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,120
Yeah, I'm great, now that I know that\NRussians can't design elevators!

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,000
I think we've clearly established\Nthat those buttons don't work.

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,650
They're buttons.\NThey have to do something.

19
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,140
Yeah, if we had a keycard.

20
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,050
- A what?\N- It's an electronic lock.

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,370
Same as the loading dock door.\NIf we don't have a keycard,

22
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,470
- it won't operate, meaning...\N- We're stuck in here.

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Yeah.

24
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,940
Just so you nerds are aware,

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,020
I'm supposed to be spending the night\Nat Tina's,

26
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,150
and Tina always covers for me.

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,320
But if I'm not home\Nfor Uncle Jack's party tomorrow

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,370
and my mom finds out\Nyou three are responsible,

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,340
she's gonna hunt you down, one by one,\Nand slit your throat.

30
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,370
I don't care about Tina!

31
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,540
Or Uncle Jack's party!

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,090
Your mom's not gonna be able to find us\Nif we're dead in a Russian elevator!

33
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,290
Hey.

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,970
What if we climbed out?

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,940
What were you saying about climbing?

36
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,940
Looks like somebody's home.

37
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,370
Did you hear that?

38
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,440
Where's that coming from?

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,220
It's below us.

40
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,970
Hey, dipshits!

41
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,940
Hawkins PD. Hands in the air.

42
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,940
Don't make me say it again!

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
English.

44
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,870
You speak English?

45
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,940
I can't understand you!

46
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,440
I can't understand you.

47
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,440
No understand!

48
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,120
Hopper!

49
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,090
Don't move!

50
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,270
Drop the gun.

51
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,890
Drop it!

52
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,770
You understand what I'm saying, big guy?

53
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,770
Drop the weapon.

54
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,970
Or what?

55
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,890
You going to shoot?

56
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,940
Good.

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,690
So you do understand\Nwhat I'm saying, huh?

58
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,910
And, yeah,

59
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,190
you don't put that thing away,\NI'm gonna blow some daylight

60
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,960
into that thick skull of yours.

61
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
No.

62
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,870
You won't do that.

63
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,670
Why's that?

64
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,590
Because you are policeman.

65
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,670
Policemen have rules.

66
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Oh, yeah?

67
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,290
Wanna test that theory?

68
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,340
I'm gonna count to three.

69
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,060
One,

70
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,890
two,

71
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,340
three!

72
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,010
Hopper!

73
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,560
Oh, shit.

74
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Go!

75
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,360
Move, Joyce!

76
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,690
- Oh, God.\N- Come on, Smirnoff.

77
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,490
You're coming with us!

78
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,540
Go, go, go!

79
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,240
Let's go! Let's go!

80
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,240
Move it, Smirnoff! Move it!

81
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
Run!

82
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,860
Joyce! Drive!

83
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,640
- Come on, Joyce! Quit screwin' around!\N- Are you kidding me?

84
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,990
- Shit!\N- Go!

85
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,070
Joyce, drive.

86
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,440
- I'm trying!\N- Joyce, please, drive!

87
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,370
Drive!

88
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,990
Get us outta here!

89
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,520
Oh, God!

90
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,020
Hang on!

91
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,520
Still think it was our government?

92
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,210
God, shut up!

93
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,980
- Hello?\N- Jonathan.

94
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,850
Do you realize what time it is?

95
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,150
Listen to me, okay?

96
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,730
It's 6:00 a.m. and, uh, I had a late night\Nwith Fagin and the gang, so...

97
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,050
- I'm at the hospital with Driscoll.\N- What?

98
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,650
She's been sedated for a few hours\Nand the doctors are still running tests.

99
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,150
Nancy, please tell me you're joking.

100
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,950
It's not a joke.\NAnd, yes, I know I'm insane

101
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,500
and irrational and out of touch,\Nbut can you save your lecture,

102
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,700
because I really don't give a shit\Nright now. I just...

103
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,130
I need you to put me on the phone

104
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,050
with your brother.

105
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,750
- What?\N- Jonathan...

106
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Please.

107
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,830
Uh...

108
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,050
He's not even here.

109
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,130
Where is he?

110
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,850
Is he safe?

111
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,500
Why wouldn't he be safe?

112
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,250
Nancy?

113
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,550
Why wouldn't he be safe?

114
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,750
Son of a bitch.

115
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,980
Son of a bitch!

116
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,950
Okay, a magnet? Magnets?

117
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,080
- Do you know "magnet"? Magnet?\N- Magnit.

118
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,330
Yes, magnit.

119
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,100
Okay, so, uh, magnit...

120
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,750
on my... my fridge,

121
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,250
my icebox, and then they...

122
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,030
they fell.

123
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,000
They demagnetized, stopped working.\NUh, do you understand?

124
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,900
Da.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,800
Okay, so is that because of the machines\Nthat you're working on?

126
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
- Machina.\N- Machina, machina, yes.

127
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,050
Da, da, machina.

128
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,000
- Machina, machina!\N- Yes, machina...

129
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,000
Vroom, vroom.

130
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,850
Oh, not... not the car.

131
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,250
The machines at Hess Farm where...

132
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,730
- where we kidnapped you...\N- Joyce, please!

133
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,780
You're givin' me a headache, both of you!

134
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,600
Hold on, please. One minute.

135
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Hey.

136
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,450
I am making progress.

137
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,900
- Progress.\N- Yeah.

138
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,580
What have you learned, huh?\NYou learned that Smirnoff over there...

139
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,980
- Alexei.\N- Smirnoff is Russian

140
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,600
and works for Starcourt,

141
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,900
two things we already knew.

142
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,830
Thought we knew.

143
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,780
But now we know-know,\Nbecause I've confirmed them.

144
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
You're welcome.

145
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,450
Yeah? Why don't you confirm\Nwhether this baby'll start, huh?

146
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,500
- Keep it in park, please.\N- Yeah, duh!

147
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,700
You do... do something useful.

148
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,700
You do something useful.

149
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,230
It's not working.

150
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,100
Try it again.

151
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,800
Shit.

152
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,650
Hey. Hey.

153
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,730
Stop, stop!

154
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,900
Shut up, Smirnoff!

155
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,450
Aw, come on! D'you hear me?

156
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,950
I said shut your damn...

157
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,750
Shit!

158
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,950
Oh, Jesus.

159
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,400
Whoa!

160
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,750
Stop.

161
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,550
I thought this friend of yours\Nlived in Illinois.

162
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,980
He's not really a friend.\NHe's more like an acquaintance.

163
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,250
Oh? Okay, well...

164
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,050
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\NKeep up, keep up, keep up.

165
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,430
Easy.

166
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,730
Okay, so this acquaintance...

167
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,480
- lives in Illinois? Correct?\N- Yeah, yeah.

168
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,450
So we're walking to Illinois?

169
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,450
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.

170
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,880
You know, I figure we'll get there\Nby, like, Friday evening.

171
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,130
I hope that works for your schedule.\NJesus Christ, Joyce.

172
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,800
- We're not walking to Illinois, okay?\N- Well, then what are we doing?

173
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,830
I don't know, okay?

174
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,050
I will... I will figure something out.

175
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,150
Isn't there someone in Indiana\Nwho speaks Russian that...

176
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,250
You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.

177
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,180
I'm all ears.

178
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,250
I'm all ears!

179
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,200
I mean, fine.

180
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Just saying.

181
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Gah!

182
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Ugh!

183
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,250
Gah!

184
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Damn it.

185
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,700
I found him.

186
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
Where is he?

187
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,150
Woods.

188
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,600
Woods?

189
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
He's with... Will's mom.

190
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,380
My... My mom?

191
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,200
What are they doing?

192
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,080
Ill... annoy.

193
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,250
They're going to Ill-annoy.

194
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,100
Mike! Breakfast!

195
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,430
Not now, Mom!

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,130
Illinois? Illinois, like the state?

197
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,850
The state of Illinois?

198
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,180
Ill-annoy.

199
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,430
Does it still hurt?

200
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,900
Only when I talk.

201
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,600
Well, it's a good thing\Nyou're not Mike, then.

202
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,480
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."\NAnd you'd be in constant pain.

203
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,780
Something's not right.\NI can't get Hopper off my back all summer,

204
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,500
now all of a sudden,\Nhe's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois?

205
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,050
And Dustin's MIA, too?

206
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,000
I mean, this can't be a coincidence.

207
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,130
What does it matter?

208
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,430
The bottom line is, they're not here.

209
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,430
- It's up to us.\N- Up to us to do what exactly?

210
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,050
Find Billy and stop him.

211
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,880
Okay, yeah,\Nthat's a really nice sentiment,

212
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,300
but even if El could find him again,\Nand that's a pretty big if, then what?

213
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,150
We burn the shit out of him\Nand make sure he doesn't escape this time.

214
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,930
- Okay, then what?\N- Then we win.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,550
No, see, that's the problem.

216
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,550
We don't. We don't win.

217
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,380
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before\Nand he just came right back.

218
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,230
We don't just have to stop Billy,\Nwe have to stop the Mind Flayer.

219
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,200
- How in the hell do we do that?\N- I don't know.

220
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,350
Maybe El does.

221
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,900
What are they still doing in there?

222
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,750
I don't know.

223
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,130
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.

224
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,150
Why?

225
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,700
- I mean, I don't know.\N- They're conspiring against me.

226
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,500
- That's what you're concerned about now?\N- It's not my main concern.

227
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,850
- It's just a sub-concern.\N- I thought it was already over.

228
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,050
It's not over, okay?\NWe're just taking a break.

229
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,680
She said she dumped your ass.

230
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,900
- That doesn't sound like a break.\N- It wasn't!

231
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,850
You guys do realize we can still hear\Neverything you're saying, right?

232
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,730
Conspiring.

233
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I told you, they're conspiring.

234
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,400
Not now, Mom!

235
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,150
Mike, open the door.

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,330
Code red, I repeat, code red.

237
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,700
Does anyone copy?

238
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,380
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.

239
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,050
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.\NDoes anyone copy?

240
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,830
We are innocent children\Nand we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.

241
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,930
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins,\Nand if we are found,

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
they will torture and kill us.

243
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,720
Hey.

244
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,080
Gotta take it easy on that thing.\NGonna drain the battery.

245
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,730
- The mall just opened.\N- So?

246
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,270
So someone could be in range.

247
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,100
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop\Nis gonna rappel down here

248
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,180
and save the day?

249
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,950
All right, why are you such a cranky pants

250
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,850
after getting to spend the night\Nwith Robin?

251
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,700
Shh! Jesus Christ.

252
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,030
Will you just give up\Non your creepy dream already?

253
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,580
I heard you guys talking all night.

254
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,780
We were trying to figure out a way\Nto open up the door

255
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,450
while you children were sleeping.

256
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,870
After eight hours,

257
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,250
we're still exactly nowhere, which is,

258
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,250
you know, probably just a little bit\Nof the reason why I'm feeling just...

259
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,080
a tad cranky.

260
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,170
What are you doing?

261
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,320
What does it look like I'm doing?\NI'm taking a leak. Look away.

262
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,380
Look away!

263
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,850
Can you redirect your stream, please?

264
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Ugh.

265
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,100
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful!

266
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,480
We don't even know what that is.

267
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,080
Exactly. It could be useful.

268
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,530
Useful how?

269
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,870
We can survive down here a long time\Nwithout food,

270
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,080
but if the human body doesn't get water,\Nit will die.

271
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,450
I hate to break it to you,

272
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,300
but this is not water.

273
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,800
No, but it's a liquid,

274
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,670
and if it comes down to me\Ndrinking that shit

275
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,080
or dying of thirst,

276
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,220
I drink.

277
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
We've got company.

278
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
You smell that?

279
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
What?

280
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,750
Piss.

281
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
Let's go.

282
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,950
- Go. Go, go, go, go, go.\N- I'm going!

283
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,800
Henderson. Go, go.

284
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,030
Come on, Steve, let's go!

285
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,680
- Jesus Christ.\N- Ooh!

286
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,230
You still wanna drink that?

287
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,450
Holy mother of God.

288
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,030
Well...

289
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,150
hope you guys are in good shape.

290
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,080
Looking at you, roast beef.

291
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,030
Let's go, come on.

292
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,450
Why me?

293
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,880
It was the same thing,

294
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,980
the exact same thing\Nthat happened to Will last year.

295
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,550
And look at this.\NLook at the body temperatures.

296
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,520
He likes it cold.

297
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,520
Okay, so this crazy old woman\Nwho was eating fertilizer...

298
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,400
- Mrs. Driscoll.\N- Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll.

299
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,120
- What time was this attack?\N- Last night.

300
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,570
Right, but what time last night?

301
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,650
- Around 9:00.\N- You waited all night to call?

302
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,830
I was waiting for the doctors\Nto run some tests.

303
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,950
You weren't there?

304
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,320
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

305
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,280
Hallelujah!

306
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,370
Ooh.

307
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,620
Um, so, wha... what time was your...\Nsauna test?

308
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,750
Around 9:00.

309
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,920
Well, that proves it.\NThat proves my theory.

310
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,380
She's flayed, just like Billy.

311
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,800
- Flayed?\N- The Mind Flayer. He flays people.

312
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Takes over their mind.

313
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,170
Once they do that,\Nthey basically become him.

314
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,830
- If there are two flayed...\N- We have to assume there are more.

315
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,000
Heather.

316
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,380
Billy was doing something to her.

317
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,520
She was scared.

318
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,480
She was screaming.

319
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,150
Bad screams.

320
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,670
- What's a good scream?\N- Max said...

321
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,650
- Doesn't matter.\N- I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather?

322
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,230
- She's a lifeguard at the pool.\N- Heather Holloway?

323
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,530
Tom.

324
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,750
Seriously?

325
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,420
Welcome to my world.

326
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,200
Seat belts.

327
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,730
- Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close?\N- What?

328
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,150
Can you not walk so close to me?\NYou stink.

329
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,820
I get it, I get it. You're upset, right?

330
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,600
'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car?

331
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,950
Yeah, with me in it.

332
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,400
Well, I just want to remind you\Nof something, Joyce.

333
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,830
- I am not a mechanic.\N- Yeah, clearly.

334
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,630
That's why you should've listened\Nto Alexei.

335
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,030
Oh, right, yeah.\NYour new boyfriend, right?

336
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,450
Yes. Every man I talk to from now on\Nhas to be my boyfriend.

337
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,750
Yeah, he reminds me a bit\Nof a Russian Scott Clarke.

338
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,880
Oh, here we go.

339
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,170
Maybe you should go on a date.\NI don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's?

340
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,970
- Whoa.\N- What?

341
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,050
He's running.

342
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,470
You son of a bitch!

343
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,480
Hey! Smirnoff!

344
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,880
Get back here!

345
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,270
Hey! C'mere!

346
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,650
Hey, c'mere!

347
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,080
You all gonna pay for those?

348
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,730
So, what are you,\Nsome kinda bounty hunter?

349
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,900
I'm a cop.

350
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,480
I'm undercover.

351
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,670
Oh, hey, Karen, it's Joyce.

352
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,580
Yeah, I... I'm just checking on Will.

353
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,050
At the movies?

354
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,720
Just keep your mouth shut, all right?

355
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,470
All right, all right, hop in.\NCome on, get in.

356
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,720
- Hey!\N- Hey!

357
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,520
You "hey!" You "hey!"

358
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,870
This is a police emergency, all right?

359
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,050
I need to commandeer your vehicle.

360
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,520
What?

361
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,820
As long as there's a... a...

362
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,170
What is your name, sir?

363
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,700
- Todd.\N- Todd?

364
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,950
- Yeah.\N- Todd.

365
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,620
- Todd.\N- Todd...

366
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,620
listen to me.

367
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,200
That man in there,

368
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,820
I know he doesn't look it,

369
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,770
but he is one of the most dangerous men\Nin the world.

370
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,500
He's, uh...

371
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,000
- murdered many children.\N- What?

372
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,750
Yeah, he's a true psychopath.\NI tracked him over two state lines.

373
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,000
Hey, what's going on?

374
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,600
Ah, Detective Byers.

375
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,550
Uh...

376
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,870
this is Todd.

377
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,850
He's agreed to... lend us his vehicle\Nto transport our dangerous criminal.

378
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,520
Oh, yes, he... very dangerous, uh,

379
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,470
forger... er.

380
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,400
Yeah. Uh, child murderer.

381
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,400
- Child murderer?\N- We should really get going.

382
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,670
Hey, how do I get my car back?

383
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,470
- You just call the station.\N- What station?

384
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,120
Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd!

385
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Hey, what station?

386
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,950
You're doing the right thing!

387
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,000
Hey, what the... Hey!

388
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Dude!

389
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,670
I mean, you have to admit,\Nas a feat of engineering alone,

390
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,050
this is impressive.

391
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,200
What are you talking about?\NIt's a total fire hazard.

392
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,720
There's no stairs, there's no exit,

393
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,970
there's just an elevator\Nthat drops you halfway to hell.

394
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,850
They're Commies.

395
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,300
You don't pay people, they cut corners.

396
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,750
To be fair to our Russian comrades,

397
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,100
I don't think this tunnel was designed\Nfor walking.

398
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,170
Think about it,\Nthey developed the perfect system

399
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,370
for transporting that cargo.

400
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,420
It all comes into the mall\Nlike any old delivery.

401
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,120
And then they load it up onto those trucks\Nand nobody's the wiser.

402
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,620
You think\Nthey built this whole mall

403
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,870
so they could transport\Nthat green poison?

404
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,400
I very seriously doubt\Nit's something as boring as poison.

405
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,720
It's gotta be much more valuable,\Nlike promethium or something.

406
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,020
What the hell is promethium?

407
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,570
It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make\NCyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.

408
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,550
You're all so nerdy,\Nit makes me physically ill.

409
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,300
No, no, no.\NNo, don't lump me in with them.

410
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,370
I'm not a nerd, all right?

411
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,120
Why so sensitive, Harrington?

412
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,270
Afraid of losing cool points\Nto a ten-year-old child?

413
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,920
No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit\Nabout Prometheus.

414
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,850
Promethium.

415
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,420
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure,\Nbut whatever. All I'm saying is,

416
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
it's probably being used\Nto make something.

417
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,850
Or power something.

418
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,820
- Like a nuclear weapon?\N- Totally.

419
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,970
Walking towards a nuclear weapon.\NThat's great.

420
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,400
- That'd be great.\N- But if they're building something,

421
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,520
why here?

422
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,970
I mean, Hawkins. Seriously. Of all places.

423
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,320
At the very best, we're a toilet stop\Non your way to Disneyland,

424
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,620
but maybe that's it.\NMaybe it's our very...

425
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,220
- You think the Russians know?\N- About...

426
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,520
- They could.\N- So it's connected?

427
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,750
- Maybe.\N- How?

428
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,250
I don't know, but it's...

429
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Possible.

430
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,650
I'm sorry, is there something you'd\Nlike to share with the class?

431
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,170
Walkie.

432
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,220
"A trip to China sounds nice.

433
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,420
If you tread lightly."

434
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,900
It's the code.

435
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,400
- Wherever that broadcast is coming from...\N- It's close.

436
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,370
And if there's one thing we know\Nabout that signal...

437
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,970
It can reach the surface.

438
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Let's go.

439
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,770
Tom?

440
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,770
Heather?

441
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,270
Jesus, it's freezing.

442
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,320
Do you guys smell that?

443
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,300
Oh.

444
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,050
Oh, God.

445
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,120
More chemicals.

446
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,770
You think they're guzzling this shit?

447
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,400
Yeah, either that or they just went on\Na hell of a cleaning spree.

448
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,520
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals.

449
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,850
- Did you?\N- No.

450
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,600
This is something new.

451
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,850
Mr. Clarke, fifth grade. Posit.

452
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,720
What happens\Nwhen you mix chemicals together?

453
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,520
You create a new substance.

454
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,850
- What if they're making something?\N- In themselves?

455
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,100
I mean, come on,\Nif you drink this crap, it'll kill you.

456
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,520
Yeah, if you're human.

457
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,970
Blood.

458
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Yesterday,

459
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,420
Tom had a bandage on his forehead.

460
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,470
He was attacked.

461
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,650
Call 91...

462
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,420
They must have tied them.

463
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,020
They must have taken them somewhere.

464
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Mrs. Driscoll.

465
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,700
She kept saying...

466
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,670
"I have to go back."

467
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,070
What if the flaying,

468
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,120
it's taking place somewhere else?

469
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,370
There must be a place\Nwhere all this started, right?

470
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,340
A source.

471
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,300
Somewhere he didn't want me to see.

472
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,920
If we can find the source,\Nthen maybe we can stop him.

473
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,920
Or at least stop it from spreading

474
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,790
or doing whatever the hell he's doing\Nwith those chemicals.

475
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,150
How do we find it?

476
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,720
Mrs. Driscoll.

477
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,720
If she wants to go back so badly,\Nwhy don't we let her?

478
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,690
...this guy comes up to me,

479
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,500
I'm just pumping gas over here,

480
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,750
and he... Hey, whoa!

481
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,320
Don't cross me right now!

482
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,800
Busy day?

483
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,050
You could say that.

484
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,140
Some psycho stole that dude's car.

485
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,420
What else?

486
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,970
- What?\N- What else did he say?

487
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,920
This psycho?

488
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,070
No offense, but I already\Nwent over all this with the cops.

489
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,350
I'm not a cop.

490
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,650
Yeah, no shit, Khrushchev.

491
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,470
Oh, shit!

492
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,190
Don't look at them.

493
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,690
At me.

494
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,770
Tell me

495
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,270
about this psycho.

496
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,820
Come on, let's go.

497
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,000
Move it.

498
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,450
I thought you said this guy\Nwas a journalist.

499
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,420
Yeah, he, uh... he was.

500
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,090
Was?

501
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,220
Look at the camera.

502
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,800
The camera, above you to the right.

503
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,650
Identify yourselves.

504
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,270
Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers,

505
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,350
Smirnoff.

506
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,070
- Alexei.\N- Alexei.

507
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,320
Surname.

508
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,020
I don't know.

509
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,400
Family name!

510
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,490
Yeah, I know. I told... I don't know, okay?

511
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,990
Open the damn door!

512
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,870
Hopper.

513
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,950
It's all right. Don't worry.

514
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,290
He's a little bit eccentric, but...

515
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,090
he's completely harmless.

516
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,450
Name.

517
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,800
Get that out of my face,

518
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,050
you bald American pig.

519
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,140
I may be bald,

520
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,800
but you're the one in handcuffs,

521
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,220
Soviet scum.

522
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
Hi, Jim.

523
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,020
Wait.

524
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,750
Watch it.

525
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,220
Silence, scum.

526
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
- How long is this gonna take, because I...\N- No.

527
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,470
- No.\N- No.

528
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,670
No, you do not get to question me.

529
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,520
You have dragged an enemy of the state\Ninto my home

530
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,690
as carelessly as a child drags in shit\Non his shoe.

531
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,820
I will search him until I am satisfied.

532
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,520
Jim. C'mere.

533
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,820
Just c'mere.\NI need to talk to you.

534
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Yeah, what?

535
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,540
- What?\N- This is not gonna work.

536
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,820
- What do you mean?\N- He's not eccentric, he's certifiable.

537
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,450
- Glass houses, Joyce.\N- What?

538
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,370
- You know, pot calling the kettle black.\N- Oh, come on.

539
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,170
- Excuse me!\N- What?

540
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,750
Do me a favor\Nand move your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.

541
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,590
- Oh, oh, this?\N- No, no, no.

542
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,970
Not a lovers' quarrel, pal.

543
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,170
Spare me!

544
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,670
What is your problem?

545
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,470
Please, stop talking!

546
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,220
No! We have had a very long day.

547
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,350
We have been shot at,\Nnearly blown up,

548
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,400
walked God knows how many miles\Nin a hundred degree heat,

549
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,820
stole a car,

550
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,520
all while being chased\Nby this gigantic... psychopath,

551
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,070
all so we could bring him to you.

552
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,490
Because somehow, you're the closest person\Nwho speaks Russian,

553
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,750
which I can't believe.

554
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,370
But that doesn't matter because,\Nunfortunately, we're here.

555
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,750
So, if you don't mind,

556
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,000
put that thing away,

557
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,670
stop behaving like a jackass,\Nand ask him what he's doing

558
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,720
that's making my magnets fall off\Nmy damn fridge!

559
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,640
Please.

560
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,070
Okay, clear.

561
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,400
Clear, come on, let's go.

562
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,820
Okay, that was close.

563
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,520
- Too close.\N- Relax.

564
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,540
All right? Relax. Nobody saw...

565
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,720
Shit.

566
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,120
Jesus!

567
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
- Red Dawn.\N- I saw it.

568
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,470
- First floor, northwest.\N- Saw what?

569
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,550
The comms room.

570
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,920
You saw the comms room?

571
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,850
Correct.

572
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,150
- Are you sure?\N- Positive. The door was open for a second,

573
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,220
and I saw a bunch of lights\Nand machines and shit in there.

574
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,020
That could be a hundred different things.

575
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,100
I'll take those odds.

576
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,870
All right.

577
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,950
We're gonna move fast,\Nwe're gonna stay low.

578
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
- Okay?\N- Okay.

579
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,920
Shh!

580
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Move it.

581
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,690
Let's go.

582
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
Sh, sh. Come on.

583
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,950
Tread lightly!

584
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,120
Tread lightly!

585
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,540
Who are you?

586
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,450
Silver cat... Silver cat.

587
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,090
I don't understand.

588
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,800
China?

589
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,350
Dude!

590
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
You did it!

591
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,040
You won a fight!

592
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,150
Jeez...

593
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,220
- What are you doing?\N- Getting us our ticket out of here.

594
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,950
You want to walk all the way back?

595
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,640
Well, we can hang out for a little bit,\Nrelax, have a picnic maybe.

596
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,090
Have a picnic?\NWe came here for the radio.

597
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,770
This plan is way better.\NIf I knew Steve could knock out a Russian,

598
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,440
that would've been our plan\Nin the first place.

599
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,750
- ...but I guess you're...\N- Guys.

600
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,240
There's something up there.

601
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,990
Let's go.

602
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,370
Holy shit.

603
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,400
No, that is not mean.

604
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,020
That is honest.

605
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,570
She won't find out.

606
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,550
See, you're the only one who gon' tell...\NWhoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me!

607
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,050
Where do you think you're going?

608
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Oh, um...

609
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,800
I was just going to visit\Nmy grandma again.

610
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,100
And... And this...

611
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,220
this is my family.

612
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,120
- Extended.\N- I don't care who they are.

613
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,920
You know the rules.\NTwo visitors at a time.

614
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,300
- Yeah, but...\N- Two!

615
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,100
Girl, this child has lost her mind.

616
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,570
She brought a whole zoo in here.

617
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
You know,

618
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,000
those things that I said yesterday, I...

619
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,770
I didn't mean them.

620
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,620
- I know.\N- I don't think you're like those assholes.

621
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,450
At all.

622
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,500
I never have. I...

623
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,050
- I was just...\N- Angry?

624
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,470
Which I still don't get.

625
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,270
I mean, I was just completely, utterly,

626
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,520
mortifyingly...

627
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,970
wrong.

628
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,600
Don't let that go to your head.

629
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,770
I won't.

630
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,370
I just look forward to you\Nnever doubting me again.

631
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,170
Oh, come on, you piece of shit!

632
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,420
Thanks.

633
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,900
Dude, I think that was it.

634
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,770
That was what?

635
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,370
The olive branch.

636
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,770
The what?

637
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,750
Oh, my God.

638
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,500
You're hopeless.

639
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,770
Okay,

640
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,750
I'll distract Max,

641
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,200
get you an opening.

642
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,300
And then talk to her. All right?

643
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,570
Where is she?

644
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,170
I don't know.

645
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,370
- Are you sure this is the right room?\N- Yeah.

646
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,050
She's gone home.

647
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,770
We were hoping you might come back.

648
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,050
Whose blood is that?

649
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,600
Tom, whatever you've done, it's not you.

650
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,520
He's making you do this.

651
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,700
Go!

652
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,950
Owie.

653
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,370
Go, go, go!

654
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,750
Run!

655
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,420
Yeah!

656
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,220
- Got it, two in a row.\N- That was good, that was good.

657
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,220
- Best three in a row now.\N- Hey.

658
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,870
Hi.

659
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:39,070
Does your species like M&M's?

660
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,400
I like the new look, by the way.\NIt's cool.

661
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,570
Thanks.

662
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,620
Run!

663
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,220
This way, this way!

664
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,600
Nancy!

665
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,170
Hello? Hello?!

666
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,270
Here.

667
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,200
It's ringing.

668
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,650
I don't care how good her pie is.

669
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,000
No, I don't want her in my damn house.

670
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,370
Come on, pick up!

671
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,870
Nancy?

672
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,520
Hi there.

673
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,470
I'm here for you, Nancy Drew.

674
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,650
No!

675
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,870
Jonathan!

676
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,170
- You bitch.\N- Nancy!

677
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,360
Run!

678
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,410
Help! Help!

679
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
Help!

680
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,020
Is anyone here?!

681
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,070
Nancy.

682
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,520
Nancy!

683
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,370
Where are you going?

684
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,270
Yoo-hoo.

685
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,210
Nancy Drew, where are you?

686
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,920
Nancy.

687
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,770
Marco...

688
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,320
Marco...

689
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,320
Polo!

690
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,410
Huh?

691
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,890
Go... to... hell!
