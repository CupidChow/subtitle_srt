1
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,930
This the wall she was\Ntalking about, Chief?

2
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,110
A trooper found something in the, uh...

3
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,990
water that's at the quarry.

4
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,330
Our working theory\Nright now is that Will...

5
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,960
crashed his bike, he... made his\Nway over the quarry and, uh...

6
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,000
accidentally fell in.

7
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,460
The earth must have given way.

8
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,630
Joyce?

9
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,100
Joyce?

10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,850
Do you understand what I'm saying?

11
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,140
No.

12
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,350
Whoever you found...

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,940
is not my boy.

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,860
- It's not Will.\N- Joyce.

15
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,110
No, you don't understand.

16
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,940
I talked to him...

17
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,450
a half hour ago.

18
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,620
He was... He was here.

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,990
He was... He was talking with these.

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
- Talking?\N- Uh-huh.

21
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,120
One blink for yes, two for no.

22
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,710
And... And, uh...

23
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,670
And then I made this\Nso he could talk to me.

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,090
'Cause he was hiding...

25
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,260
from that... that thing.

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,780
The thing that came out of the wall?

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,270
- The thing that chased you?\N- Yeah.

28
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,310
- Yeah.\N- Mom, come on, please.

29
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,430
- You've gotta stop this.\N- No, maybe he's...

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,810
It's after him!

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,850
He's in danger. We\Nhave to find him! We...

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,380
What exactly was this thing?

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,920
It was some kind of animal, you said?

34
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,900
Uh, no, it was...

35
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,240
It was almost... human,\Nbut it wasn't. It...

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,370
It had these long arms\Nand... it didn't have a face.

37
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,370
It didn't have a face?

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,870
- Joyce.\N- It didn't have a face...

39
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,250
Joyce, listen to me.

40
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,790
Listen to me.

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,960
After Sarah...

42
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,970
I saw her, too.

43
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,130
And I heard her.

44
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,010
I didn't know what was real.

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,270
And then I figured out\Nthat it was in my mind.

46
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,390
And I had to pack all that away.

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,690
Otherwise, I was gonna\Nfall down a hole...

48
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,560
that I couldn't get out of.

49
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,480
No, you're... you're\Ntalking about grief.

50
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,820
This is different.

51
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,370
- I'm just saying that you...\N- No, I know what you're saying, Hop.

52
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,660
I swear to you, I know what I saw.

53
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,000
And I'm not crazy.

54
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,920
I'm not saying that you're crazy.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
No... You are.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,630
And I understand, but...

57
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,130
God, I...

58
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,800
I need you to believe me.

59
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,930
Please.

60
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,890
Please.

61
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,970
Listen...

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,350
I think you should go to the morgue\Ntomorrow and see him for yourself.

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,310
It'll give you the\Nanswers that you need.

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,770
- But tonight...\N- Oh, God.

65
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,530
... I want you to try to\Nget some sleep, if you can.

66
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,900
Byers' body was found in\Nthe water of this quarry

67
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,070
by state police earlier this evening.

68
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,900
It was discovered by state trooper\NDavid O'Bannon, just after dark.

69
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,910
The state police are\Nmounting an investigation

70
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,870
to determine Byers' cause of death,

71
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,330
but an initial inquiry...

72
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,370
Should I go down and talk to Michael?

73
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,210
Give him time.

74
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,040
He'll come to us when he's ready.

75
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,560
Can you please stop that?

76
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,320
Are you deaf?

77
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,570
I thought we were friends, you know?

78
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,490
But friends tell each other the truth.

79
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,300
And they definitely\Ndon't lie to each other.

80
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,120
You made me think Will was okay,\Nthat he was still out there,

81
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,170
but he wasn't. He wasn't!

82
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,250
Maybe you thought you were\Nhelping, but you weren't.

83
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,550
You hurt me. Do you understand?

84
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,880
What you did sucks.

85
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,640
Lucas was right about you.

86
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,640
All along.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,130
Over.

95
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,720
Will, are you there?

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,680
Will!

97
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,640
Was that...

98
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,770
Was it...

99
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,730
Will.

100
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,410
Mom...

101
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,710
Mom!

102
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,210
Mom! Wake up.

103
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,340
What... what time is it?

104
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,090
It's almost 8:00. We have to go.

105
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,510
Go where? Where?

106
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,760
To see Will.

107
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,140
Michael?

108
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,060
Hi, honey. How are you feeling?

109
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,730
I, uh...

110
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,690
I don't think I can go to school today.

111
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,490
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.

112
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,820
I need to drop off Nance, then I'm\Ngonna check in on Barb's parents.

113
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,240
Why don't you grab a book or\Nsomething and come with me?

114
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,370
We can stop by the video\Nstore on the way back,

115
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,790
pick out whatever you\Nwant. Even R-rated.

116
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,620
I think I just want to stay home today.

117
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,170
I mean, if that's okay?

118
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,550
Well, are you sure you're gonna\Nbe all right here by yourself?

119
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,090
I think so.

120
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,050
Okay.

121
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,470
But if you need anything,\Ncall Dad at work.

122
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,430
- Okay.\N- Okay.

123
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,390
Bye.

124
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,980
Bye, sweetie.

125
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,820
Lucas, do you copy?

126
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,110
Lucas, come on, I know you're there!

127
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,910
This is urgent. I'm serious.

128
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,330
I'm not gonna stop until you answer.

129
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,830
Lucas.

130
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,370
Lucas!

131
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,250
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas...

132
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,630
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,\NLucas, Lucas, Lucas...

133
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,170
Go away, Mike.

134
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,260
I'm not in the mood,\Nall right? Over and out.

135
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,720
No, not "out."

136
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,260
I'm not messing around,\Nokay? This is about Will.

137
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,260
- Over.\N- What about Will?

138
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,760
You mean about his funeral? Over.

139
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,020
No, not his funeral.

140
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,600
- Screw his funeral!\N- What?

141
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,980
Just get over here\Nstat. And bring Dustin.

142
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,350
Over and out.

143
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,480
What's taking so long?

144
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,660
Well, everything's been a bit\Nchaotic around here without Gary.

145
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,620
Without Gary?

146
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,790
- Where's Gary?\N- Well, I thought you knew.

147
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,250
Those men from State, they...\Nthey sent Gary home last night.

148
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,710
So who did the autopsy?

149
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,880
Someone from State.

150
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,870
He has a birth mark on his right arm.

151
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,660
Can you show that to me, please?

152
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,370
How's your mom doing?

153
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,050
I don't know.

154
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,510
How long's this stuff been going\Non? With the lights and, uh...

155
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,800
Will and the thing in the wall?

156
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,770
Since the first phone call, I guess.

157
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,440
You know, she's had anxiety problems...

158
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,730
in the past.

159
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,730
But this...

160
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,450
I don't know.

161
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,240
I'm worried it could be...

162
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,250
Ugh, I don't know.

163
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,130
She'll be okay.

164
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,550
We'll be okay.

165
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,300
My mom...

166
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,020
she's tough.

167
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,600
Yeah, she is.

168
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,520
Hey.

169
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,310
She is.

170
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,530
Ma'am!

171
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,210
- Ma'am, I need you to sign!\N- I don't...

172
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,030
I don't know what you think that thing\Nis in there, but that is not my son!

173
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,870
- Joyce, wait a second.\N- No!

174
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,080
- Mom!\N- Ma'am, I... Ma'am!

175
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,380
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.\NYou went back to my house?

176
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,840
To look for Barb.

177
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,010
Yeah, okay, but why\Ndidn't you just talk to me?

178
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,720
That's crazy.

179
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,640
I don't know, I... I was scared.

180
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,350
You seriously think\Nyou saw a guy in a mask

181
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,100
just hanging out in my yard?

182
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,930
I don't think it was a mask.

183
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,810
But he had no face?

184
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,810
I don't know!

185
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,770
I don't know, I just...

186
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,440
I have a terrible feeling about this.

187
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,570
Oh, this is bad.

188
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,200
This is really bad.

189
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,320
What?

190
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,280
The cops...

191
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,120
they're gonna want to\Ntalk to all of us now.

192
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,710
Tommy, Carol, everybody\Nwho was at the party.

193
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,750
- So?\N- My parents are gonna murder me!

194
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,790
Are you serious right now?

195
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,960
You don't understand. My\Ndad's a grade-A asshole.

196
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,550
Barb is missing! And you're\Nworried about your dad?

197
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,970
Okay, just... When you\Ntalk to the cops, just...

198
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,970
don't mention the beers.

199
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,850
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

200
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,060
and Barbara's got nothing\Nto do with it, okay?

201
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,100
I can't believe you right now.

202
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,190
- I can't believe you.\N- Nancy.

203
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,190
Nancy, wait!

204
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,110
Nancy!

205
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,370
- Mom, will you get in?\N- No, I...

206
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,580
I need to think. Just go on home.

207
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,620
Mom, will you just get in, please?

208
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,920
Mom.

209
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,750
Mom!

210
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,210
Mom.

211
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,680
- Stop.\N- Just go home, Jonathan.

212
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,510
No, this is not an okay\Ntime for you to shut down.

213
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,010
- Shut down? What...\N- We have to deal with this, Mom.

214
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,810
We have to deal with the funeral!

215
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,350
The funeral?

216
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,350
For... for who?\NFor that thing back there?

217
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,480
Okay, let me get this straight.

218
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,730
Will, that's not his body,\Nbecause he's in the lights, right?

219
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,650
And there's a monster in the wall?

220
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,240
Do you even hear yourself?

221
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,240
I know it sounds crazy.

222
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,660
I sound crazy!

223
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,540
- Yeah.\N- You think I don't know that?

224
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,790
It is crazy!

225
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,710
But I heard him, Jonathan.

226
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,460
He talked to me!

227
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,380
Will is... is calling to me!

228
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,340
And he's out there, and he's\Nalone, and he's scared, and I...

229
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,380
I don't care if anyone believes me!

230
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,050
I am not gonna stop looking for him\Nuntil I find him and bring him home.

231
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,220
I am going to bring him home!

232
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,100
Yeah, well, while you're\Ntalking to the lights,

233
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,690
the rest of us are\Nhaving a funeral for Will!

234
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,820
I'm not letting him sit in\Nthat freezer another day!

235
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,240
All right, show's over.

236
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,280
What?

237
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,380
We keep losing the signal,\Nbut you heard it, right?

238
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,880
Yeah, I heard a baby.

239
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,010
What?

240
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,890
Mike, you obviously\Ntapped into a baby monitor.

241
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,610
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

242
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,430
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

243
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,810
- That was Will!\N- Mike...

244
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,100
Lucas, you don't understand.\NHe spoke last night.

245
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,400
Words!

246
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,230
He was singing that weird song\Nhe loves. Even El heard him!

247
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,530
Oh, well, if the weirdo\Nheard him, then I guess...

248
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,250
Are you sure you're\Non the right channel?

249
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,530
I don't think it's about that.

250
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,840
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

251
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,450
- Like... like Professor X.\N- Yeah.

252
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,200
Are you actually believing this crap?

253
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,160
I don't know, I mean...

254
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,080
Do you remember when Will fell\Noff his bike and broke his finger?

255
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,380
He sounded a lot like that.

256
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,510
Did you guys not see what I saw?

257
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,840
They pulled Will's\Nbody out of the water.

258
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,470
He's dead!

259
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,270
Well, maybe it's his ghost.\NMaybe he's haunting us.

260
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,230
- It's not his ghost.\N- So how do you know that?

261
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,990
- I just do!\N- Then what was in that water?

262
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,940
I don't know!

263
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,230
All I know is Will is alive.

264
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,770
Will is alive!

265
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,190
He's out there somewhere.

266
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,900
All we have to do is find him.

267
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,030
This isn't gonna work.

268
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,000
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

269
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,080
- Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.\N- Yeah.

270
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,210
The Heathkit's at school.

271
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,550
There is no way we're gonna get the\Nweirdo in there without anyone noticing.

272
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,510
I mean... look at her.

273
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,590
Wow.

274
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,720
- She looks...\N- Pretty.

275
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,140
Good.

276
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,520
You look pretty good.

277
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,040
Pretty.

278
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,000
Good.

279
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,880
Clear.

280
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,510
- You boys hear me all right in there?\N- Loud and clear, Shepard.

281
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,300
Good luck in there, son.

282
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,370
"The brown current ran swiftly\Nout of the heart of darkness,

283
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,450
bearing us down towards the sea

284
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,290
with twice the speed\Nof our upward progress.

285
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,040
And Kurtz's life was\Nrunning swiftly, too... "

286
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,590
Nancy Wheeler?

287
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,550
If you'll come with me, please?

288
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,970
This argument you and Barbara had?

289
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,680
What exactly was it about?

290
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,890
It wasn't really an argument.

291
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,850
Barb just wanted to leave.

292
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,070
I didn't, so, I...

293
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,690
I told her to just go home.

294
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,900
Then what?

295
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,700
Then I went upstairs to\Nput on some dry clothes.

296
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,660
And the next day, you went back and...

297
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,160
saw a bear, you're thinking?

298
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,880
I don't know what it was, but...

299
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,170
I think...

300
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,260
I think maybe it took Barb.

301
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,630
- You need to check behind Steve's house...\N- We did.

302
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,050
There's nothing there.

303
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,810
- There's no sign of a bear.\N- And no car.

304
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,060
- What?\N- Look.

305
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,390
We figure that Barbara\Ncame back last night

306
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,600
and then she took off,\Nwent somewhere else.

307
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,860
Has she ever talked to\Nyou about running off?

308
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,400
Leaving town, maybe?

309
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,610
No.

310
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,900
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

311
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,360
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact\Nthat you were spending time with this boy?

312
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,660
Uh, Steve Harrington?

313
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,370
What? No!

314
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,620
Maybe she was jealous because\Nshe saw you go up to Steve's room?

315
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,790
It wasn't like that.

316
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,000
Like what?

317
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,960
Steve and me, we're...\Nwe're just friends.

318
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,790
We... we just talked.

319
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,920
Now was this before or after\Nyou changed out of your clothes?

320
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,150
So, Gary, tell me about these\Ntroopers that brought in Will.

321
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,180
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

322
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,520
They're all Staties?

323
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Yes, sir.

324
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,730
Never seen that many troopers\Ncome with a body before.

325
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,610
They told you that they were gonna\Ntake care of the autopsy, huh?

326
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,610
Yeah. Claimed\Njurisdiction. Kicked me out.

327
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,700
Well, it all seemed a bit over\Nthe top to me, considering...

328
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,620
Considering what?

329
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,830
Considering this was Will\NByers and not John F. Kennedy.

330
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,460
- Thanks for stopping by, Gary.\N- Sure thing.

331
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,090
... let the people know that,\Nuh, the troopers are on duty

332
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,720
and you should be safe, because we\Nthink this is just an isolated incident.

333
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,640
State trooper David O'Bannon,\Nthank you so much for your help.

334
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,830
- Thank you, sir.\N- Back to you...

335
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,870
Okay, remember, if\Nanyone sees us, look sad.

336
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,620
Attention students,

337
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,380
there will be an assembly to honor\NWill Byers in the gymnasium now.

338
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,300
Do not go to fourth period.

339
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,550
It's locked.

340
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,800
- What?\N- Hey, do you think you can open it?

341
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,590
With your powers?

342
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,140
Boys?

343
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Hey.

344
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,810
Assembly's about to start.

345
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,640
We know. We're just, you know...

346
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,520
Upset.

347
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,960
Yeah, definitely upset.

348
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,440
We need some alone time.

349
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,690
- To cry.\N- Yeah, listen...

350
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,030
I get it. I do.

351
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,110
I know how hard this is, but\Nlet's just be there for Will, huh?

352
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,610
And then...

353
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,620
the Heathkit is all yours\Nfor the rest of the day.

354
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,120
What do you say?

355
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,710
I don't believe we've\Nmet. What's your name?

356
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,460
- Eleven...\N- Eleanor! She's my, uh...

357
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,630
- Cousin.\N- Second cousin.

358
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,920
She's here for Will's funeral.

359
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,260
Ah, well, welcome to\NHawkins Middle, Eleanor.

360
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,380
I wish you were here\Nunder better circumstances.

361
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,510
Thank you.

362
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,180
Uh, where are you from exactly?

363
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,640
Bad place...

364
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,430
- Sweden!\N- I have a lot of Swedish family.

365
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,000
- She hates it there.\N- Cold!

366
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,610
Subzero.

367
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,150
- Shall we?\N- Yep!

368
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,940
At times like these...

369
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,860
it is important that we\Ncome together as a community.

370
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,160
We come...

371
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,660
Abort.

372
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,250
We come together to heal...

373
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,880
we come together to grieve...

374
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,920
- You lied to the police!\N- I didn't lie!

375
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,260
How naive do you think I am?

376
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,470
You and Steve were just talking?

377
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,800
We slept together!

378
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,140
Is that what you want to\Nknow? It doesn't matter!

379
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,560
- It does matter!\N- No! It is all bullshit!

380
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,850
It has nothing to do with\NBarb and she's missing.

381
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,900
And something terrible\Nhappened to her. I know it.

382
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,820
I know it!

383
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,940
And no one is listening to me!

384
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,570
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.

385
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,360
- I'm listening to you...\N- No! You're not!

386
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,450
Nancy... Nancy!

387
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,240
Just leave me alone!

388
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,880
Try him again.

389
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,590
Shepard, come in. Confirm comm.

390
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,270
Shepard, come in. Confirm comm.

391
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,690
This is Shepard. Confirming, over.

392
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,560
Shepard. Where are you?

393
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,070
Can you describe to us\Nwhat it is you see? Over.

394
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,530
It's low visibility.\NI'm about 1 klick south of the rift.

395
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,320
Everything's still here, but\Nit's all eroding. It's covered in--

396
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,120
Shepard? Do you copy?

397
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,370
Shepard? Can you hear me?

398
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,080
There's something else...\NThere's something else in here!

399
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,960
Reel him in.

400
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,090
- Reel him back in!\N- Get him in.

401
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,550
Come on, come on! Faster!

402
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,240
There's something else in here!

403
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
Pull me out! Pull me out, pull me out!

404
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,560
Pull me out! Pull me out!

405
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,120
- Shepard, come in. Over.\N- Comms are down, sir.

406
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,790
Shepard, come in! Over.

407
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,160
Will Byers' death is\Nan unimaginable tragedy.

408
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,710
Will was an exceptional student\Nand a wonderful friend to all of us.

409
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:21,290
It's impossible to express the hole\Nhis loss will leave in our community.

410
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,670
I'd like to introduce\Nyou to Sandy Sloane.

411
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,430
She's a local grief counselor\Nfrom the church over in Jonesboro.

412
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,140
But before she comes up here,

413
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,390
I just want those of you who are having\Ntrouble dealing with this tragic loss...

414
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,640
Look at these fakers.

415
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
They probably didn't even\Nknow his name till today.

416
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,190
What?

417
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,980
Who is interested in\Nthis? This is so stupid.

418
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,530
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

419
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,780
Oh, he was such a great student.

420
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,160
Oh, he's going to leave\Na hole in the community.

421
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,830
Mouth breather.

422
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,010
Hey! Hey!

423
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,350
Hey, Troy!

424
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,600
Hey, Troy!

425
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,640
You... you think this is funny?

426
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,140
What'd you say, Wheeler?

427
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,770
I saw you guys laughing over there.

428
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,980
And I think that's a real\Nmessed up thing to do.

429
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,110
Didn't you listen to\Nthe counselor, Wheeler?

430
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,820
Grief shows itself in funny ways.

431
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,910
Besides, what's there\Nto be sad about, anyway?

432
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,950
Will's in fairyland now, right?

433
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,000
Flying around with all\Nthe other little fairies.

434
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,580
All happy and gay!

435
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,180
You're dead, Wheeler!

436
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,970
Dead!

437
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,690
Dude, Troy peed himself.

438
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,540
Holy shit!

439
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,130
Hey! What's going on here?

440
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,290
Oh.

441
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,460
Mike! Let's go!

442
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,520
It's made of soft wood\Nwith a crepe interior.

443
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,020
Uh, now, I... I don't\Nknow what your budget is,

444
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,780
but over here, we... we\Nhave copper and bronze.

445
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,490
Can you just give me a second?

446
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,620
Of course.

447
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,670
Hey.

448
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,460
Hey.

449
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,010
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.

450
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,630
I just...

451
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,180
Can we talk for a second?

452
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,440
It looks like it could be some\Nkind of perspective distortion,

453
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,560
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

454
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,190
I don't know.

455
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,480
It's weird.

456
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,200
And you're sure you didn't\Nsee anyone else out there?

457
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,070
No.

458
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,620
And she was there one\Nsecond and then, um...

459
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,250
gone.

460
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,960
I figured she bolted.

461
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,380
The cops think that she ran away.

462
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,380
But they don't know Barb.

463
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,050
And I went back to Steve's...

464
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,800
and I thought I...

465
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,680
saw something.

466
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,060
Some...

467
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,310
weird man or...

468
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,810
I don't know what it was.

469
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,190
I'm sorry.

470
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,200
I... I shouldn't have\Ncome here today. I'm...

471
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,120
I'm so sorry.

472
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,580
What'd he look like?

473
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,290
What?

474
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,620
This man you saw in the woods.

475
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,670
What'd he look like?

476
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,670
I don't know.

477
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,470
It was almost like he...

478
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,590
he didn't have...

479
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,510
Didn't have a face?

480
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,600
How did you know that?

481
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,280
Aw, come on!

482
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,700
Another, please.

483
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,750
And another for my, uh, friend here.

484
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,790
Oh, thanks, man. Appreciate it.

485
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,460
Yeah, that's all right.\NI'm, uh... I'm celebrating.

486
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,420
My daughter, she won\Nthe spelling bee today.

487
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Is that right?

488
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,340
Yeah, that's right.

489
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,720
"Odontalgia."

490
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,680
That was the word.

491
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,600
You know what it means?

492
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,140
It's a fancy name for a toothache.

493
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,110
Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart.\NDon't know where she gets it from.

494
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,490
I've been tryin' to\Nfigure that out for years.

495
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,280
Your daughter, she got a name?

496
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,160
What?

497
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,790
Your daughter? What's her name?

498
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,540
Sarah.

499
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,040
Her name's Sarah.

500
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,550
To Sarah.

501
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,730
I recognize you.

502
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,060
Are you famous or somethin'?

503
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,440
Uh, you might have seen me on TV,\NI, uh... I found that Byers boy.

504
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,610
So, you on that case or what?

505
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,360
I just saw him on patrol, you know?

506
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,570
Dumb luck.

507
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,450
So that quarry, that's, uh...

508
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,950
that's state-run, where\Nthey found the boy, huh?

509
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,370
Yeah.

510
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,750
Yeah, well, that's funny.

511
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,090
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact\Nthat it's run by the Sattler Company.

512
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:45,010
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got a\Ncouple operational quarries up in Roane.

513
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,470
- Is that right?\N- Yeah.

514
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,600
That's right.

515
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,850
So why are you lying to me, man?

516
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,270
What's your problem, bud?

517
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,980
I don't have a problem.

518
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,530
I'm just a concerned citizen.

519
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,780
Yeah?

520
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,530
Well, stick your nose someplace else.

521
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,910
The kid is dead.

522
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,160
End of story.

523
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,120
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.

524
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,670
Okay...

525
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,720
Let's try this one more time.

526
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Who told you to be out there?

527
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,640
What were you doing out there?

528
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,140
I don't know! I don't know. They...

529
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:35,480
they just told me to call it in\Nand not let anybody get too close.

530
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,190
Get close to what?

531
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,520
The body.

532
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,190
Who do you work for?

533
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,740
The NSA? Hawkins Lab?

534
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,660
Who is that?

535
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,660
- You're gonna get us both killed.\N- Who is that?

536
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,120
Hey! Hey!

537
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,720
Come on! Come on!

538
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,560
Talk to me!

539
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,940
I know you're here!

540
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,820
Come on.

541
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,820
- Now what?\N- She'll find him.

542
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,030
Right, El?

543
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,170
Eleven?

544
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,800
Are you listening?

545
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,680
That man before you...

546
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,440
I need you to find him.

547
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,190
- Hurt him?\N- No.

548
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,860
No, I don't want you to hurt him.

549
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,490
I want you to listen to him.

550
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,870
- Listen?\N- Yes.

551
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:24,380
I want you to listen to what he\Nsays and repeat his words back to me.

552
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,970
Just like we used to with\Nthose old nursery rhymes.

553
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,470
Do you remember?

554
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,220
Hmm?

555
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,430
Do you think you can do that for me?

556
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,180
- Mmm-hmm.\N- Good.

557
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,120
Begin.

558
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Amulet.

559
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Frigid.

560
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,920
Evolve.

561
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,090
Airplane.

562
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,340
Eleven?

563
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,090
Repeat the words.

564
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,850
Apricot.

565
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,020
Peninsula.

566
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,850
Game.

567
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,400
Enchantment.

568
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,480
Mouse.

569
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,820
Balloon.

570
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,650
She's doing it.

571
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,450
- She's finding him!\N- This is crazy.

572
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,320
Calm down. She just closed her eyes.

573
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,740
Holy...

574
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,880
What is that?

575
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,810
Mom?

576
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,810
Will?

577
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,320
Mom?

578
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,690
No way!

579
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,570
- Mom...\N- Will!

580
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,700
Please...

581
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,110
Will!

582
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,120
Will!

583
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,240
Will...

584
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,700
Will!

585
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,120
- Mom!\N- Will!

586
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,630
I'm here! I'm here!

587
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,920
- Oh, God...\N- Mom!

588
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,960
- Will!\N- Will, it's us! Are you there?

589
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,420
Can you hear us? We're here!

590
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,510
Hello? Mom?

591
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,630
Why can't he hear us?

592
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,930
I don't know!

593
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,800
Baby...

594
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,680
- Mom?\N- Oh, God. Will!

595
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,770
Mom!

596
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,810
Oh, thank God.

597
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,690
Baby...

598
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,810
Will...

599
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,020
Mom...

600
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,440
Mom, it's coming!

601
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,740
Tell me where you are!\NHow do I get to you?

602
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,320
It's like home, but it's so dark...

603
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,280
It's so dark and empty. And it's cold!

604
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,580
Mom? Mom!

605
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,960
Listen to me! I swear I'm\Ngonna get to you, okay?

606
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,870
But right now, I need you to hide.

607
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,330
Mom, please!

608
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,000
No, no, listen! Listen, I...

609
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,050
I will find you, but\Nyou have to run now!

610
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,470
Run! Run!

611
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,690
- El, are you okay?\N- Oh!

612
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,750
Can you move?

613
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,170
Here, help her up.

614
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,330
This way!

615
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,300
And you're...

616
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,710
Brightening. Enlarging.

617
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,920
Hmm.

618
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,050
Did your mom say anything else?

619
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:48,180
Like, um, where it\Nmight have gone to, or...

620
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,690
No, just that it came out of the wall.

621
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,100
How long does this take?

622
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,240
Not long.

623
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,120
Have you been...

624
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,040
doing this a while?

625
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,710
What?

626
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,040
Photography?

627
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,750
Yeah.

628
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:19,840
I guess I'd rather observe\Npeople than, you know...

629
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,970
Talk to them.

630
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,010
I know. It's weird.

631
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,100
No!

632
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,310
No, it is.

633
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,890
It's just, sometimes...

634
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,600
people don't really say\Nwhat they're really thinking.

635
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,440
But you capture the right moment...

636
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,690
it says more.

637
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,150
What was I saying?

638
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,780
What?

639
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,160
When you took my picture.

640
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,490
I shouldn't have taken that.

641
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,700
I'm, uh...

642
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,330
I'm sorry.

643
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,710
It's just...

644
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,330
That's it.

645
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,380
That's what I saw.

646
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,840
My mom...

647
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,890
I thought she was crazy

648
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,720
'cause she said...

649
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,560
that's not Will's body. That he's alive.

650
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,310
- And if he's alive...\N- Then Barbara.

651
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,370
- Hey, Patty!\N- Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

652
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,960
- Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.\N- Oh.

653
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,750
I'll just be a minute.

654
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:46,930
Hey, I love that book.\NIt's a nasty mutt.

655
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,050
Hey, you can't be back here.

656
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,860
Yeah, I just got off\Nthe line with O'Bannon.

657
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,770
He said that he needs to\Nsee you at the station.

658
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,930
- It's some emergency...\N- What the hell are you talking about?

659
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,140
I don't work with O'Bannon.

660
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,020
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

661
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,020
Okay.

662
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,830
Babe...

663
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,250
Jesus, the hell happened?

664
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,960
Lonnie.
