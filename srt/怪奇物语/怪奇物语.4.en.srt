1
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,140
I'm sorry,\NI did not quite catch your name.

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,020
What happened?

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Help me.

4
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,120
No!

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
Which one?

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,470
I don't know.

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,620
Hey, there's nothing to worry about\Nanymore, okay?

8
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,570
It doesn't make sense.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,520
What doesn't make sense?

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,070
Heather.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,970
The blood.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,870
The ice.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,870
Heather had a fever, so she took\Na cold bath, but she's better now.

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,870
That has to be it.

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,870
I don't know where that blood\Ncame from, but...

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,520
we saw her.

17
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,470
We both saw her. She's totally fine.

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
What about Billy?

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
What about him?

20
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,470
He seemed wrong.

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,070
Wrong is kind of like\Nhis default.

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,820
But it's nice to know he's not a murderer,\Nbecause that would've totally sucked.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Who... is that?

24
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,670
See, this is why you can't just\Nhang out with Mike all the time.

25
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,020
This is Wonder Woman.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,670
AKA Princess Diana.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,020
She's from Paradise Island,\Nwhich is, like, this hidden island

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,170
where there are only\Nwomen Amazon warriors.

29
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,570
Let me go! Let me go!

30
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,970
Doris, we need you to stay calm for us,\Nokay?

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,820
- Stay calm.\N- I have to go back!

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,720
I have to go back!

33
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,970
I have to go back!

34
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,120
I have to go back!

35
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,470
Okay, so,

36
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,070
you two want to explain to me\Nwhat in the name of Jesus

37
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,420
just happened here?

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Tom!

39
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,470
Hi, Daddy.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Heather...

41
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,370
sweetie...

42
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,920
whatever this is,\Nwhatever he's got you into,

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,870
you don't have to do this.

44
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,620
You can stop this.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,270
There is no stopping it, Daddy.

46
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,170
You'll see.

47
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,270
No.

48
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,520
Heather, please! Heather!

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,770
Try not to move.

50
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,070
No.

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
No.

52
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,670
Heather!

53
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,770
Heather!

54
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,920
Jesus Christ.

55
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
No.

56
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
No...

57
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,950
Hey, careful.

58
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,100
Careful.

59
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,800
Here.

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Hey.

61
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Joyce.

62
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,350
Oh.

63
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,250
Here, here, here.

64
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,650
It's okay.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,300
That's it. Got it?

66
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,900
- Here.\N- How long have I been out?

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,900
A while.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,950
You've been drifting in and out.

69
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,950
Yeah, but how did I get here?

70
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,050
Slowly.

71
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,540
- What's the last thing you remember?\N- Some thug attacked me.

72
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,620
- Hey, you need to rest.\N- No, I'm fine.

73
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,710
- No, you're not fine, Hop...\N- I'm fine. I'm fine.

74
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,120
Um...

75
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,790
- Where are my clothes?\N- Uh...

76
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,560
Uh...

77
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,220
They were soaked.

78
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,270
I mean, did you recognize him?

79
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,720
- Who?\N- The thug.

80
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,740
Well, I didn't get a good look.

81
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,720
Well, I mean,\Nhe's gotta be government, right?

82
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,490
Yeah, but if he's government,\Nwhat's he doing slinking around?

83
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,210
W-Why is he running?

84
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,210
You know,\Nwhy didn't we find anything down there?

85
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,370
Let's ask him.

86
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
What is that?

87
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,460
His license plate.

88
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,370
- What are the dashes?\N- Well, they're blanks.

89
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,010
There was...\NI think it was either an H or a P

90
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,620
with the part rubbed off.

91
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,710
And there was definitely a Y.

92
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,790
For sure.

93
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,010
And that, I think, was a B,\Nbut it could've been an eight.

94
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,140
And that... Wait...

95
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,970
I think you should stick to sales.

96
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,310
Can't you run a search or something?

97
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,720
I just think you have to lower\Nyour expectations.

98
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,390
I mean, this is a state government agency.

99
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,140
Gonna take weeks\Nbefore they find a match.

100
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,160
- Weeks?\N- If we're lucky.

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,060
And, I mean,

102
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,360
what are the odds that this guy

103
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,690
registers a car in his own name?

104
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,070
It wasn't a car.

105
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,910
Uh, what are you wearing?

106
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,090
What do you mean it wasn't a car?

107
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,620
Do you copy?

108
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,090
This is a code red.

109
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,210
I repeat, this is a code red.

110
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,310
Max. Do you copy?

111
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,010
This is a code red.

112
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,970
Shut...

113
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,060
up.

114
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,110
She turned it off.

115
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,660
You've got to be kidding me.

116
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,290
I'm sleeping. Go away.

117
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,210
This is Mike. Do not hang up.

118
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,040
Something happened, something bad.

119
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Our very lives can be at stake.

120
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,660
- What are you talking about?\N- Just come over to my house.

121
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,040
We'll explain everything.

122
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,260
- What?\N- Hurry.

123
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,760
What did he say?

124
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,590
Try Dustin again.

125
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,590
He's not answering.

126
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,470
So, try him again.

127
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,590
Dustin, do you copy?

128
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,260
I repeat, this is a code red.

129
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,820
That keycard opens the door,\Nbut unfortunately,

130
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,860
the Russian with this keycard\Nalso has a massive gun.

131
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Whatever's in this room,\Nwhatever's in those boxes,

132
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,740
they really don't want anybody finding it.

133
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
But there's gotta be a way in.

134
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,340
Well, you know...

135
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,670
I could just take him out.

136
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,890
- Take who out?\N- The Russian guard.

137
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,890
What? I sneak up behind him,

138
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,010
I knock him out, and I take his keycard.\NIt's easy.

139
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,310
Did you not hear the part\Nabout the massive gun?

140
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,810
Yes, Dustin, I did.

141
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,720
And that's why I would be sneaking.

142
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,640
Ah.

143
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,520
Well, please, tell me this,\Nand be honest,

144
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,990
have you ever actually... won a fight?

145
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,360
Okay, that was one time...

146
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,940
Twice. Jonathan. Year prior?

147
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,240
Listen, that doesn't count.

148
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,960
Why wouldn't it? Because it looks\Nlike he beat the shit out of you.

149
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,840
- It was...\N- You got a fat lip, crooked nose,

150
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,420
- swollen eye, a lot of blood...\N- ...things that all added up...

151
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,790
That just might work.

152
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,210
Robin.

153
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,370
Hey, Robin!\NHey, what... what are you doing?

154
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,140
- I need cash.\N- Well, half of that's mine.

155
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,190
- Where're you going?\N- To find a way into that room,

156
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,210
a safe way.

157
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,170
And, in the meantime,\Nsling ice cream,

158
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,560
behave, and don't get beat up.

159
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,920
I'll be back in a jiff.

160
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,340
Oh, dude.

161
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,860
Come on, man, not my scooper.

162
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,110
If he gets us\Nthe layout by noon, we can.

163
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,440
Okay, I'll let him know.

164
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,090
Dunno if they'll go through with it,\Nbut I just thought you should know.

165
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,210
Nancy.

166
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,640
Jonathan.

167
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,310
I've worked at this paper\Nfor twenty-five years.

168
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,140
Twenty-five...

169
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,970
years.

170
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,170
Now, we're a small-town paper,

171
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,110
but we have something\Nthe big papers don't have:

172
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,610
trust.

173
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,610
- The trust of our community.\N- Tom, if you just...

174
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,810
Do you know how I built that trust?\NBy placing my faith in something

175
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,020
the two of you don't seem to value\Na whole lot:

176
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,410
facts.

177
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
Facts.

178
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,790
So, while we're here,\Nlet's go over the facts.

179
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,210
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order\Nto stop pursuing this story.

180
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,460
Two: you falsely identified yourselves\Nas reporters,

181
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,890
repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.

182
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,840
Three: you broke into her home,\Ncommitting trespass.

183
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,890
Four: she almost died en route\Nto the hospital.

184
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,890
She would've died if we hadn't shown up!

185
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,470
Whatever disease that rat had\Nclearly passed to her...

186
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,940
Five!\NMrs. Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.

187
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,640
You didn't know that, did you?

188
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
Now...

189
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,910
disease-carrying rats?

190
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,990
The second coming of the plague?\NDoes this sound credible to you,

191
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,010
or perhaps does this sound more like\Nthe delusions of a very sick old lady?

192
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,740
- I didn't know that.\N- Her family's furious.

193
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,840
So furious, in fact,\Nthey've threatened litigation.

194
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,090
- Litigation?\N- That's crazy.

195
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,410
For once, we agree.

196
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,120
This is crazy.

197
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,890
In fact, in my entire professional career,

198
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,790
I've never dealt with anything\Nquite like it.

199
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
But hopefully,

200
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,140
hopefully, you've learned\Nsomething valuable here.

201
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,420
You've learned...

202
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,440
how in the workplace,

203
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,140
in the real world,

204
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,440
there are consequences to your actions.

205
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Which brings me to my sixth and final...

206
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,770
fact.

207
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
You're fired.

208
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,910
Both of you.

209
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,570
I didn't think it was anything\Nat first.

210
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,790
I mean, I think I just didn't want\Nto believe it.

211
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,120
The first time I felt it\Nwas at Day of the Dead.

212
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,010
- Power went out that night, too.\N- And then I felt it again

213
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,010
at the field near the Nelson farm\Nthe next day.

214
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,140
Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers.

215
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,510
Will!

216
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,970
What does it feel like?

217
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,810
It's almost like...

218
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,690
You know when you drop\Non a roller coaster?

219
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,810
- Sure.\N- Yeah.

220
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,910
- No.\N- It's like...

221
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,240
everything inside your body

222
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,820
is just sinking all at once, but...

223
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,820
this is worse.

224
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,910
Your body...

225
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,070
it goes cold and... and you can't breathe.

226
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,160
I've felt it before,

227
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,290
whenever he was close.

228
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,340
Whenever who was close?

229
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,010
The Mind Flayer.

230
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,560
Go away!

231
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,890
Go away!

232
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,220
I closed the gate.

233
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,560
I know, but...

234
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,260
what if he never left?

235
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,020
What if we locked him out here with us?

236
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,190
This is him.

237
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,110
All of him.

238
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,910
But, that day on the field,

239
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,570
a part of him attached itself to me.

240
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,370
My mom got it out of me...

241
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,970
Get the hell out of my son!

242
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,620
...and Eleven closed the gate.

243
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,020
But the part that was still in me,\Nwhat if it's still in our world?

244
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,120
In Hawkins.

245
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,570
I don't understand.\NThe Demodogs died when El closed the gate.

246
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,420
If the brain dies, the body dies.

247
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,870
We can't take any chances.

248
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,170
We need to assume the worst.

249
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,820
The Mind Flayer's back.

250
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,620
Yeah. And if he is,

251
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,820
he'd want to attach himself\Nto someone again.

252
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,920
A new me.

253
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,070
A new host.

254
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,720
How can you tell if someone is a host?

255
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,220
Hey, is he in?

256
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,120
- Yes, he's busy at the moment, but...\N- Great.

257
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,470
Excuse me.

258
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,820
You should sit down.

259
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,520
...wouldn't listen...

260
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,670
Uh...

261
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,920
Tony, hold on.

262
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,170
Let me, uh...

263
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,920
I might have to...\NLet me call you back. Okay.

264
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,220
Thanks.

265
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,570
- Jim.\N- I know, I know.

266
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,720
You're busy.\NI'm gonna make this fast, I promise.

267
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
Is there...

268
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,120
some kind of problem?

269
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,220
Yeah. You might say that.

270
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,520
Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy.

271
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,920
The name of a guy.

272
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,670
Yeah, I think you might know this guy.

273
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,420
- Okay.\N- He was here the other day.

274
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,670
Rides a motorcycle.

275
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,970
Big build, square jaw, dark hair.

276
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,220
He's probably military, maybe ex-military?

277
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,520
Is this ringing... any bells?

278
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,270
Uh...

279
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,570
I don't think so.

280
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,770
Really?

281
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,770
'Cause it was just two days ago.

282
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,120
This was right before I saw you.

283
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,170
Oh!

284
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,470
- You know what?\N- What?

285
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,870
Could be the maintenance guy.

286
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,970
- Maintenance.\N- Yeah. I can't remember his name.

287
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,570
Oh, God... Uh...

288
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,620
Gary or John or something.

289
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,420
Candice will have his name on file.

290
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,320
We've had trouble with the plumbing.\NClogged toilets and...

291
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,570
sinks with minds of their own.

292
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,370
You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry?

293
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,420
Excuse me?

294
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,120
This guy, when I saw him,\Nhe was coming out of your office.

295
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,670
Okay, well, I don't remember that.

296
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,170
I shake a lot of hands, you know?

297
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,620
Do you remember when I caught you\Npassed out in the hideaway

298
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,370
with all that powder all over your nose?

299
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,470
- You remember?\N- Jim, come on, now.

300
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,220
Do you remember when my boys\Nfound you and Candice going at it

301
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,520
like a couple of bunnies\Nin the back of your Cadillac?

302
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,820
Do you remember that?

303
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,820
Does your wife remember that?

304
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,170
You, uh...

305
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,570
You really wanna play this game?

306
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,620
Huh?

307
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,170
Not a game, Lar.

308
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,420
Okay.

309
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,870
Those pills you used to swallow\Nlike candy.

310
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,670
I can't recall,\Ndid you have a prescription for those?

311
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Or how about drinking on duty?

312
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Yeah.

313
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,220
We have some real fun stories about that.

314
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
One call to Tom at the Post...

315
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,920
and you're done, buddy.

316
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,970
You're gone.

317
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,870
Oh, and, please,

318
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,520
don't give me that dead daughter\Nsob story,

319
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,620
'cause I just don't care.

320
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,620
Now, if you don't mind,

321
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,420
I really am rather busy.

322
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,020
Operating directors...

323
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,320
Damn it!

324
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,220
My nose! You broke my goddamn nose!

325
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,070
And your friend almost killed me\Nlast night,

326
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,870
so I'd say we're still not even.

327
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,970
Larry?

328
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,020
- Let's cut the crap, Larry!\N- Larry!

329
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,820
- Who is this guy? Government? Military?\N- You're making a big mistake.

330
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Who is he?

331
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,420
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

332
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,470
Larry!

333
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,870
Who you calling? The police?

334
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,320
That is a nice ring you got there, Larry.

335
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,820
Are you insane?

336
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
I don't know.

337
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,270
Let's find out.

338
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,120
Okay, okay, okay.\NBe cool, be cool.

339
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,770
I don't know his name, I swear.

340
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,720
Ah, ah, ah!

341
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,170
But you know him.

342
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,370
He... He gives me things sometimes.

343
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,520
What kind of things?

344
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,170
Money. Presents. Aah! Gifts.

345
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,470
Who is this guy, Santa Claus?

346
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,620
Starcourt. Starcourt.\NHe works for Starcourt.

347
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,970
- The mall?\N- Yes, yes.

348
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,220
Yeah, right.

349
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,270
Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt.

350
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,370
They... They own the mall.

351
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,870
They want to expand to East Hawkins.\NThey needed property, some land.

352
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,620
Some people didn't want to sell,\Nso I leaned on them a little. That's all.

353
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I swear, that's all.

354
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,220
- Why do they want this land?\N- I don't know!

355
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,220
You have records of these purchases,\Nthese, uh...

356
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,170
these land purchases?

357
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,770
You don't want to mess with these people,\NJim.

358
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,170
I think you should worry about yourself\Nright now, Larry, not about me.

359
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,620
The records.

360
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,220
Where are they?

361
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,270
Larry?

362
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,720
He just bumped his head.

363
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,020
Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar?

364
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,020
Have a nice day.

365
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
Larry!

366
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,170
It's bullshit.

367
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,670
So, according to Tom,\NDriscoll's just a schizophrenic?

368
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,870
And that rat is just a rat?

369
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,070
And it's all, what, some big coincidence?

370
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,670
You know what I think?

371
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,370
I think Tom was on drugs.

372
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,870
- What?\N- Did you see him?

373
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,620
He was sweating like crazy.

374
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,770
And his palms were clammy.

375
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,420
He looked awful.

376
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,870
- Oh, is this funny to you?\N- No.

377
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,670
No, it's just kind of incredible.

378
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,920
Incredible?

379
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,820
Yeah, incredible how you just continue\Nto convince yourself.

380
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,170
What's that supposed to mean?

381
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,170
I told you over and over\Nto drop this story.

382
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,270
That it was a bad idea.

383
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,670
But you refused, and now, I'm screwed.

384
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,020
It's a summer job.\NYour life is hardly over.

385
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,270
I don't live in a two-story house\Non Maple Street.

386
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,870
My dad doesn't earn six figures.

387
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,370
Hell, he isn't even around.

388
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,120
God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine.

389
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Mortgage, college tuition.

390
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,170
You know, they're real things, Nancy.

391
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,820
Things that you don't care about,\Nonly because you don't have to.

392
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,520
- I didn't realize I lived in a bubble!\N- Well, you do!

393
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,080
You want everything handed to you\Non a silver platter.

394
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,530
I mean, we were interns, Nancy!

395
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,040
Interns!

396
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,790
What did you expect, that you would make\Nstar reporter in a month?

397
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,210
Crack the big case?

398
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,760
You sound just like them.\NYou realize that, right?

399
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,340
Just like Bruce and those assholes...

400
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,510
Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs.

401
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,380
Is that what that was?\NThat was humiliating.

402
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,810
Humiliating.

403
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,430
Yeah, the real world sucks.

404
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,810
Deal with it like the rest of us.

405
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,980
You don't know what it's like.

406
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,030
Neither do you.

407
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,990
Well, then, I guess we just don't\Nunderstand each other anymore.

408
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,530
Yeah, I guess not.

409
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,930
Hey, you're home early.

410
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,130
Yeah. Light day.

411
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,890
It is fascinating\Nwhat 20 bucks will get you

412
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,530
at the County Recorder's Office.

413
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,110
Starcourt Mall.

414
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,230
The complete blueprints.

415
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,530
Not bad.

416
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,230
So, this is us, Scoops,

417
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,160
and this is where we want to get.

418
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,690
I mean, I don't really see a way in.

419
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,690
There's not,

420
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,580
if you're talking exclusively about doors.

421
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,410
Air ducts.

422
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,530
Exactly.

423
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,410
Turns out, this secret room needs air\Njust like any old room.

424
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,130
And these air ducts

425
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,460
lead all the way...

426
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,310
here.

427
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,930
Flashlight.

428
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,060
Thank you.

429
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,530
Yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know\Nif you can fit in here. It's, like...

430
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,080
super tight.

431
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
I'll fit.

432
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,030
Trust me. No collar bones, remember?

433
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,210
Uh, excuse me?

434
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,380
Oh, he's, uh...\NYeah, he's got some disease.

435
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
Chry, uh... It's chrydo, um...

436
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,380
Something. Yeah, I dunno.

437
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,530
He's missing bones and stuff.\NHe can bend like Gumbo.

438
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,080
You mean Gumby.

439
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,710
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo.

440
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,760
- Steve, just shut up and push me!\N- Okay.

441
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,630
I'll push ya.

442
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,060
- Not my feet, dumbass. Push my ass.\N- What?

443
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,730
Touch my butt! I don't care!

444
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,110
- Come on! Harder! Push harder!\N- I'm pushing!

445
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,810
- You're playing with my legs.\N- I'm not playing, I have terrible footing.

446
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,810
- Come on!\N- I'm gonna just shove you, ready?

447
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,690
- Just shove me?\N- One, two...

448
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,530
- Shit.\N- That work?

449
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,280
- One more time.\N- Ahoy, sailors! All hands on deck!

450
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Ahoy!

451
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,830
Come on.

452
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,160
Get over here\Nand serve me some samples.

453
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,040
I don't know.\NHe looks pretty normal to me.

454
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,830
Normal? How many times\Nhave you seen him with a shirt on?

455
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,080
I mean, it's a little weird.

456
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
More than a little.

457
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,130
He was in a tub with ice.\NThe Mind Flayer likes it cold.

458
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,560
- Plus everything else...\N- But he's lounging at the pool,

459
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,840
which is, like,\Nthe least Mind Flayer thing ever.

460
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,430
Not necessarily.

461
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,980
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.

462
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,730
He only used me when he needed me.

463
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,890
It's like... like you're dormant.

464
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,910
And then, when he needs you,

465
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,190
you're activated.

466
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,360
Okay, so we just...

467
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,910
wait until he gets activated.

468
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,410
No. What if he hurts someone?

469
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,490
Or kills someone.

470
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,030
We can't take that chance.

471
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,130
We need to find out if he's the host.

472
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,880
- Where are you going?\N- I have an idea. Boys only.

473
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,880
- Seriously?\N- Just trust me on this one.

474
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,680
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes,\Nuntil everyone leaves,

475
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,760
and we somehow get him\Nto come from here and...

476
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,360
get him into here.

477
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,610
- Hey, shut the door!\N- Hey, come on, kid, shut it!

478
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,910
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

479
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,480
And look, the controls are right here.\NIt's perfect.

480
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,530
- Will it get hot enough?\N- 220 degrees.

481
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
We just have to figure out\Nhow to get him in here.

482
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,630
- Then we lock him in...\N- Heat him up...

483
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,990
No matter what happens, we'll know.

484
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
We'll know for sure.

485
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Hmm...

486
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,380
- Yeah, I don't know.\N- You don't know if you can fit?

487
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,180
Oh, I can fit.\NI just don't know if I want to.

488
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,510
Are you claustrophobic?

489
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,560
I don't have phobias.

490
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,030
- Okay, well, what's the problem?\N- The problem is,

491
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,110
I still haven't heard what's in this

492
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,860
for Erica.

493
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,360
More fudge, please.

494
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,330
Go on.

495
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,830
All right.

496
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,430
You see this?\NThis is the route you're gonna take.

497
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,240
Then we just wait till the last delivery\Ngoes out tonight.

498
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,010
Then you knock out the grate,\Njump down, open the door.

499
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,980
- Then you find out what's in those boxes?\N- Exactly.

500
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,980
Mm-hmm.

501
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,760
And you say this guard is armed.

502
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,430
Yes, but he won't be there.

503
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,480
- And booby traps?\N- Booby traps?

504
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,910
- Lasers, spikes in the wall?\N- What?

505
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,190
You know what this half-baked plan\Nof yours sounds like to me?

506
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,360
Child endangerment.

507
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,460
We'll be in radio contact with you\Nthe whole time...

508
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,830
Ah, ah, ah!

509
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,330
Child endangerment.

510
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,280
Erica? Hi. Uh...

511
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,080
We think these Russians\Nwant to do harm to our country.

512
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,790
Great harm. Don't you love your country?

513
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,510
You can't spell "America" without "Erica."

514
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,010
Uh, yeah, yeah.

515
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,730
Oddly, that's, uh, totally true.

516
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,730
So, so, don't do this for us.

517
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,180
Do it for your country.

518
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,560
Do it for your fellow man.

519
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,190
Do this for America... Erica.

520
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,910
Ooh!

521
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,530
I just got the chills.

522
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,480
Oh, yeah, from this float,

523
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,780
not your speech.

524
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,830
Know what I love most about this country?

525
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,960
Capitalism.

526
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,960
- Do you know what capitalism is?\N- Yeah.

527
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,380
- Yeah.\N- It means this is a free market system.

528
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,630
Which means people get paid\Nfor their services,

529
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,430
depending on how valuable\Ntheir contributions are.

530
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,930
And it seems to me,

531
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,960
my ability to fit into that little vent

532
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,630
is very, very valuable to you all.

533
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,010
So, you want my help?

534
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,840
This USS Butterscotch

535
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,980
better be the first of many.

536
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,280
And I'm talking free ice cream

537
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,730
for life.

538
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,830
Wow, I love the place, Lar.

539
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,280
Hey, you shoot that fella yourself?

540
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,830
That's... That's not real.

541
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,130
No shit!

542
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
All right, so...

543
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,180
what exactly are we looking at?

544
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,610
Land deeds, transfers of property.

545
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,110
So your buddies at Starcourt,

546
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,640
they suddenly start buying up\Nall this property.

547
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,530
- They tell you why?\N- I already told you,

548
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,780
they don't tell me anything.

549
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,480
They're just using you, I get it.

550
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,780
What I don't get

551
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,280
is why you have a bunch of land deeds

552
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,880
in a safe in your bedroom.

553
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,280
These people, Jim,

554
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,890
they're bad news.

555
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,590
So, what, this is blackmail?

556
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,840
- Protection.\N- Protection.

557
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,690
Hold on a second.

558
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,690
Hey, what is it?

559
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,090
Hess Farm, Henry's place,

560
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,290
Bullocks...

561
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,740
Look, they're all here.

562
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,990
They're all in Southeast Hawkins,\Nright near Jordan Lake.

563
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,890
And what else is near Jordan Lake?

564
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,540
The power plant.

565
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,590
Four nights ago,\Nthere was a huge power outage,

566
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,740
- and the next day...\N- Your magnets fell.

567
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine

568
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,340
would take a massive amount of power\Nto run.

569
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,540
- Yeah.\N- So, what if this machine

570
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,290
that we've been talking about\Nreally does exist,

571
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,240
and the reason that we didn't find it\Nat the lab

572
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,490
is because it isn't at the lab,\Nit's at one of these properties.

573
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,590
Um...

574
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,690
I want you to... forget about sales.

575
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,840
I want you to come work for me\Nat the Hawkins PD.

576
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,790
And have to look at your face every day?\NI don't think so.

577
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,390
Larry!

578
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,490
Hey!

579
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,440
Hey, where do you think you're going, pal?

580
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,940
Nancy?

581
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,040
Nance?

582
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,290
Maybe Jonathan's right.

583
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,640
To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him.

584
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,490
I wasn't thinking about anyone, really.

585
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
I just...

586
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,790
I wanted to be right.

587
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,190
- I wanted to be right so badly.\N- And were you?

588
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,940
I thought so.

589
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,240
But maybe I just...

590
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,940
don't want to admit that I'm wrong,

591
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,440
- because if I'm wrong, then...\N- You're what everyone thinks you are.

592
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,240
Just a kid who has no idea\Nwhat she's doing.

593
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,840
It's not easy out there, Nance.

594
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,940
I know.

595
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,390
People are always saying you can't.

596
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,690
That you shouldn't.

597
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,090
That you're not...

598
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,790
smart enough, not good enough.

599
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,740
This world, it...

600
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,540
it beats you up again and again\Nuntil eventually, I...

601
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,240
Most people, they just...

602
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,540
they just stop trying.

603
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,490
But you're not like that.

604
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,090
You're a fighter.

605
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,240
You always have been.

606
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,040
I honestly don't know\Nwhere you get it from.

607
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,490
Dad.

608
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,440
I think you were swapped in the hospital,\Nto tell you the truth.

609
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
No.

610
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,790
I get it from you, Mom.

611
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,490
I get it from you.

612
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,740
Well, wherever you get it from,

613
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,590
I'm proud of you.

614
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,290
Proud of me for getting fired?

615
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,590
That you stood up for yourself.

616
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,690
That you stood up to those...

617
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,790
shitheads.

618
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,690
Mom!

619
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,540
Yes, those shitheads.

620
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,190
And if you believe in this story...

621
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,990
Look at me, Nancy.

622
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
...finish it.

623
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,190
Then go sell it to The Indianapolis Star\Nor whatever and...

624
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,440
I mean, can you imagine their faces

625
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,340
when they read a story\Nabout their own town

626
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,240
in a big paper like that?

627
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,240
That would be...

628
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,040
pretty amazing.

629
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,940
So, why not?

630
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,590
Why not?

631
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,990
Finish it.

632
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
Uh, Will?

633
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,240
Um, you know, about yesterday...

634
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,290
It's fine, Lucas.

635
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,890
You don't have to say anything.

636
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,990
I know, but it's just...

637
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,490
It was a really cool campaign.

638
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,490
- And Mike and I, we should've never...\N- I don't care anymore, Lucas.

639
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,590
I really don't.

640
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,590
We have bigger things to worry about now.

641
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,690
This should hold him.

642
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,090
Hey, I found the breakers.

643
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,090
Whoa, that thing is super creepy.

644
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,290
Let me see it.

645
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,340
I think this'll work. Right, buddy?

646
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,690
Right, Mike.

647
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,540
Hey, El...

648
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,390
I just wanted to say...

649
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,390
You know when I said Nana was sick?

650
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,790
She wasn't. I lied.

651
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,090
- I know.\N- Right, right, right. No, I just...

652
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,640
think it was important for you\Nto know the context.

653
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,940
Hopper, he went all crazy on me,

654
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
telling me I'm spending\Nway too much time with you.

655
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,890
He made me lie. I mean,

656
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,140
you're the most important thing to me\Nin the world.

657
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,490
What if he's right?

658
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,190
- What?\N- Hop.

659
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,490
No, no, no, no.

660
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,990
He's just some angry old man\Nwho hates joy.

661
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,790
But if I only see you,

662
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,590
and I'm a different species than you,

663
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,830
then I should be with my species more.

664
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,280
What are you talking about?

665
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,800
Did you spy on me?

666
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,710
- That's totally against the rules.\N- I make my own rules.

667
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,550
- Mike, are you there?\N- Yeah!

668
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,550
- Where are you guys?\N- I'm coming. Just...

669
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,850
hold on a second.

670
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Shit!

671
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,130
God, I hope it's not you.

672
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,100
I really hope it's not you.

673
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,750
Erica, do you copy?

674
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,580
Mm-hmm. I copy.

675
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,300
- You nerds in position or what?\N- Yeah, we're in position.

676
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,460
It's all quiet here,\Nso you've got the green light.

677
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,180
Green light, roger that.

678
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,680
Commence Operation Child Endangerment.

679
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,760
Can we maybe not call it that?

680
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,260
See you on the other side.

681
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,350
Nerds.

682
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,200
Winnie!

683
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,950
Winnie, is that you?

684
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,700
- Larry?\N- Winnie, upstairs in the bedroom!

685
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Baby.

686
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,380
Oh, my God, baby, what happened?

687
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,580
Get me a phone.

688
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,630
- Baby...\N- Get me a goddamn phone!

689
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,230
Anything?

690
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,980
No.

691
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,030
This place is dead.

692
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,610
All right, where to next?

693
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Hess Farm.

694
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,680
All right, nerds.

695
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,800
I'm there.

696
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,430
Do you... Do you see anything?

697
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,380
Yeah, I see those boring boxes\Nyou're so excited about.

698
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,150
- Any guards?\N- Negative.

699
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,350
- Booby traps?\N- If I could see them,

700
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,180
they'd be pretty shit traps,

701
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,480
- wouldn't they?\N- Thank you for that.

702
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,110
I'm in.

703
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,080
Oh, God.

704
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,280
Free ice cream

705
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,950
for life.

706
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,130
Pool's closed.

707
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,450
Hey.

708
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,630
Do you hear me?

709
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,130
Pool is closed!

710
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,010
Billy!

711
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,480
Who's there?

712
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,030
Billy!

713
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,400
Who's there?

714
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,280
Billy!

715
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,830
Billy!

716
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,530
You think this is funny, huh?

717
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,330
Billy.

718
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,700
Come and find me.

719
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,880
I find you, it is your funeral.

720
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,000
Come and get me. Come on!

721
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,330
Billy!

722
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,850

00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,550
Max.

730
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,300
Do it.

731
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,950
Hi.

732
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,080
Uh, I'm here to see Doris Driscoll.

733
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,080
I think she was admitted last night.

734
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Name and relation?

735
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,700
Uh... Nancy...

736
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,410
Driscoll.

737
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,250
I'm...

738
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,430
Nancy Driscoll.

739
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
Her... granddaughter.

740
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,100
That's definitely not Chinese food.

741
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,610
Uh, maybe you guys should, you know,\Nstand back.

742
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,650

743
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,860
- Just step back, okay?\N- No.

744
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,780
- Step back. Seriously.\N- No! No!

745
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,950
If you die, I die.

746
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Okay.

747
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,850
What the hell?

748
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,430
What is that?

749
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,310
Was that just me, or did the room move?

750
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,810
Booby traps.

751
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,450
You know what?\NLet's just grab that and go.

752
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,030

Just press the damn button, nerd.

754
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,360

Out of the way\Nso she can push the button...

758
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,010
- Would you stop?\N- I'm trying.

759
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,110
Would you let me just do it?\NWould you stop?

760
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,710
Just open the door!

761
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,110

You think this is funny?

766
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,310
You kids think this is some kind of\Nsick prank, huh?

00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,660
You little shits think this is funny?

768
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,660
What is this?

769
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,010
Open the door.

770
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,960
Open the door!

771
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,060
Open the door!

I promise you, it's not my fault.

What's not your fault, Billy?

779

I've done things, Max. Really...

780
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,160
bad things.

781
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,710
I didn't mean to.

782
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,510
He made me do it.

783
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,610
Who made you do it?

784
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,260
I don't know, it's like a shadow.

785
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,310
Like a giant shadow.

00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,260
