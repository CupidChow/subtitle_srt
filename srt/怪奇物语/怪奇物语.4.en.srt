1
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,200
Will!

2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,300
Will!

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,900
- Dustin!\N- Mrs. Byers?

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,700
What's going on? Where's Will?

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,950
The field!

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,800
Will. I just found him like this!

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,450
I think he's having another episode!

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,650
Will! Will! Will!

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,400
Sweetie, wake up! It's Mom!

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,950
Will!

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,700
Will, wake up!

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,000
Can you hear me?

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,200
Will, please, just wake up.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,250
Please, wake up!

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,950
It's Mom!

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,700
It's me!

17
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,470
Okay, that totally freaked me out.

18
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,020
Did that not freak you guys out?

19
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,570
- Two episodes in two days.\N- It's getting worse.

20
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,320
You think it's True Sight?

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,620
What's True Sight?

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,470
It's nothing.

23
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,170
I can't remember.

24
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,820
I need you to try.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,420
I... I was on the field\Nand... and then it...

26
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,970
it all just went blank,\Nand... and then you were there.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,570
Will, I need you to tell me the truth.

28
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,420
I am.

29
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,320
This shape, I saw it on the\Nvideo tape from Halloween night.

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,680
It's the same shape\Nas... as your drawing.

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,530
These episodes that you're\Nhaving, I think Dr. Owens is wrong.

32
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,930
I think they're real.

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,090
But... but I can't help you if\NI don't know what's going on.

34
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,040
So, you have to talk to me. Please.

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,690
No more secrets, okay?

36
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,280
Okay.

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,990
Did... did you see this\Nthing again on the field?

38
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,240
Yes.

39
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,880
What... what is it?

40
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,010
I don't know.

41
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,340
It's almost more like a feeling.

42
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,030
Like the one you had\Nthat night at the arcade?

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,530
Yes.

44
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,530
What does it want?

45
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,330
I don't know.

46
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,580
It came for me, and...

47
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,660
Go away!

48
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,930
And I tried. I tried to make it go away.

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,710
But it got me, Mom.

50
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,090
Well, what does that mean?

51
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,510
I felt it... everywhere.

52
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,380
Everywhere.

53
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,260
I... I still feel it.

54
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,930
I just want this to be over.

55
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,480
It's okay. It's okay. Hey.

56
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,940
Listen. Look, look at me.

57
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,390
I will never, ever let anything\Nbad happen to you ever again.

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,140
Whatever's going on in you,\Nwe're gonna fix it. I will fix it.

59
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,560
I promise. I'm here.

60
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,290
"Friends don't lie." Isn't\Nthat your bullshit saying?

61
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,990
Hey, hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me!

62
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,630
Where'd you go on your\Nlittle field trip, huh?

63
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,540
Where?

64
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,930
Did you go see Mike?

65
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,930
He didn't see me.

66
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,910
Yeah, well, that mother and her

67
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,480
daughter did and they called the cops.

68
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,780
Now, did anyone else see you?

69
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,690
Anyone at all?

70
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,530
Come on, I need you to think!

71
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,610
Nobody saw me!

72
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,580
You put us in danger.

73
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,030
You realize that, right?

74
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,160
You promised...

75
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,280
I go!

76
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,910
And I never leave!

77
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,290
Nothing ever happens!

78
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,630
Yeah! Nothing happens and you stay safe!

79
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,680
You lie!

80
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,630
I don't lie! I protect\Nand I feed and I teach!

81
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,090
And all I ask of you is that\Nyou follow three simple rules.

82
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,180
Three rules. And you know what?

83
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,390
You can't even do that!

84
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,540
You're grounded.

85
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,830
You know what that means?

86
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,610
It means no Eggos...

87
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,330
And no TV for a week.

88
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,960
All right, knock it off. Let go.

89
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,180
Okay.

90
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,760
Two weeks.

91
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,390
Let go!

92
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,140
- A month!\N- No!

93
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,290
Well, congratulations.

94
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,440
You just graduated from no TV\Nfor a month to no TV at all!

95
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,740
No!

96
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,490
No! No. No!

97
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,090
You have got to understand that there\Nare consequences to your actions.

98
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,140
You are like Papa!

99
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,340
Really?

100
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,140
I'm like that psychotic son of a bitch?

101
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,290
Wow! All right. You\Nwanna go back in the lab?

102
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,840
One phone call. I can make that happen.

103
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,440
I hate you.

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Yeah, well, I'm not so\Ncrazy about you, either.

105
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,340
You know why? 'Cause you're a brat.

106
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,640
You know what that word means?

107
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,790
How about that be your\Nword for the day, huh? Brat.

108
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,890
Why don't we look it up? B-R-A-T.

109
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,940
Brat.

110
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?

111
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,990
Hey!

112
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,240
Hey!

113
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,540
Hey! Hey!

114
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,240
Open this door!

115
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Open the damn door!

116
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,940
You wanna go out in the world?

117
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,590
You better grow up!

118
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,490
Grow the hell up!

119
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,240
Mom?

120
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,740
Will?

121
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,540
Hello?

122
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,790
Do you like those grapes, Holly?

123
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,990
Hey, Mom, I was thinking about\Nstaying the night at Stacey's tonight?

124
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,690
We were gonna have a girl's night.

125
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,490
Romantic comedies, do\Nour nails, gossip...

126
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,390
Sure! That sounds like fun.

127
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,190
Toast? No?

128
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,480
- Hey.\N- Hey.

129
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,060
Did you see your mom?

130
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,750
No, she was sleeping. But I left a note.

131
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,500
You don't have to do this, you know.

132
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,360
Stop saying that.

133
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,760
- Hawkins Police.\N- Flo, it's Joyce again.

134
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,850
Oh, hi, Joyce. Listen,\NI gave him your message...

135
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,630
- He's still not there?\N- No, but...

136
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,400
Did he get any of my messages\Nfrom yesterday? Did you give...

137
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,930
- Yes, do you wanna talk to...\N- No, no, I need Hopper.

138
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,450
Just tell him to call me the\Nsecond he gets in. Please.

139
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,150
- Thank you.\N- Bye.

140
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,810
Hey. How you feeling, sleepyhead?

141
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,310
- Any better?\N- Mmm-mmm.

142
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,660
Same as last night? Still weird?

143
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,830
Yeah.

144
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,500
All right.

145
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,750
Hmm.

146
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,250
Okay, let me see.

147
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,050
Is it a fever?

148
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,310
No. Uh, actually, it's cold.

149
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,680
Do you feel cold?

150
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,400
No. Just a little out of it.

151
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,810
Like I haven't really woken up yet.

152
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,280
You promised no doctor.

153
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,250
And I meant it. No doctor.

154
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,000
You know what?

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,500
I'm gonna run you a nice\Nbath and it'll warm you up

156
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,160
and hopefully get you feeling better.

157
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,210
How's that sound? Okay.

158
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,930
Morning, Dart.

159
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,680
Got you some breakfast.

160
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,060
Your favorite.

161
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,260
I gotta go to school,

162
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,450
but I'll be back soon. Sound good?

163
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,800
Stop being a baby and do it already!

164
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,260
This is so disgusting.\NIs this really necessary?

165
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,180
What the hell's going on?

166
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,310
What do you think?\NWe're looking for Dart.

167
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,010
- Jesus!\N- Oh!

168
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,810
Ugh!

169
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,650
Well, well, well.

170
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,010
Look who finally decided to show up.

171
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,860
After I drew the short\Nstraw. Real convenient.

172
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,860
You stink!

173
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Hi, Max.

174
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,410
Hi.

175
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,950
- Where's Will?\N- He'll be here.

176
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,080
Are you just gonna stand there?

177
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,410
Or you gonna help?

178
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,850
All living things, from complex mammals

179
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,010
to single-celled organisms,\Ninstinctively respond to danger.

180
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,150
Expose a bacterium to a toxic\Nchemical, and it will flee.

181
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,730
Or deploy some other defense mechanism.

182
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,230
We're very much the same.

183
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,700
When we encounter danger,\Nour hearts start pounding.

184
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,910
Our palms start to sweat.

185
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:23,250
These are the signs of the physical\Nand emotional state we call...

186
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,710
fear.

187
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,350
Hey, you reached Jim.

188
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,310
I'm probably doing something\Nincredible right now and I can't...

189
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,410
Mom.

190
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,210
Yeah, sweetie, what is it?

191
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,460
It's too hot.

192
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,860
I... I can cool it\Ndown a little bit, baby,

193
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,060
- but we gotta get your body temp back up.\N- No.

194
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,860
What?

195
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,910
He likes it cold.

196
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,410
Hey, kid.

197
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,910
Listen, um...

198
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,860
about last night, I, uh...

199
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,260
I want this place cleaned\Nup by the time I get back

200
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,560
and then maybe I'll\Nconsider fixing the TV.

201
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,760
You hear me?

202
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,760
Come in, Hop.

203
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,560
Come in, Hop.

204
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,810
Come in, Hop.

205
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,710
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way in,

206
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,460
and, yes, I do know what time it is.

207
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,060
Joyce Byers has called eight\Ntimes already this morning.

208
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,660
Eight times.

209
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,010
For my sake, please deal with her!

210
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,860
Let's go. Pass it up now. Get open!

211
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,410
All right! All right, all right!

212
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,860
King Steve. King Steve, everyone.

213
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,760
I like it. Playing tough today.

214
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,560
Jesus! Do you ever\Nstop talking? Come on!

215
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
What?

216
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,360
You afraid the coach is gonna\Nbench you now that I'm here? Huh?

217
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,860
You were moving your feet.

218
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,110
Plant them next time, draw a charge.

219
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,260
Don't sweat it, Harrington.

220
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,060
Today's just not your day, man.

221
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,060
Yeah. Not your week.

222
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,760
You and the princess\Nbreak up for one day,

223
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,630
she's running off with\Nthe freak's brother.

224
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,600
Oh, shit. You don't know.

225
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,850
Jonathan and the princess skipped\Nyesterday. Still haven't shown.

226
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,900
But that must just be\Na coincidence, right?

227
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,780
Don't take it too hard, man.

228
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,030
A pretty boy like you has\Ngot nothing to worry about.

229
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,700
Plenty of bitches in the sea.

230
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,170
Am I right?

231
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,530
I'll be sure to leave you some.

232
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,350
It's 15 past.

233
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,880
Yeah, I know.

234
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,620
Just give him time.

235
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,570
That guy. There.

236
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,950
- What?\N- He just... just talked to himself.

237
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,750
Duck, duck, duck,

238
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,580
duck, duck...

239
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,230
Duck, duck, duck...

240
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,180
Duck, duck, duck...

241
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,980
Duck...

242
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,370
Duck, duck...

243
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,920
Goose!

244
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,370
I think we should go.

245
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,620
Trouble with your car, miss? I can\Ngive you two a lift if you like.

246
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,870
Jonathan.

247
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,580
You sure you don't need that ride?

248
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,070
Hello?

249
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,530
Leave it open.

250
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,070
Where the hell have you been?

251
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,420
I overslept. What the hell's\Ngoing on? It's freezing.

252
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,080
Hey! Knock, knock.

253
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,530
We have a visitor.

254
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,420
So this thing, this shadow thing.

255
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,180
You told your mom it likes it\Nlike this. It likes it cold?

256
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,180
Yeah.

257
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,430
How do you know that?

258
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,180
I just know.

259
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Does he talk to you?

260
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,480
No. It's like...

261
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,230
I don't have to think.

262
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,920
I just know things now.

263
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,620
Things I never did before.

264
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,420
And, uh...

265
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,580
what else do you know?

266
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,920
It's hard to explain.

267
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,470
It's like old memories\Nin the back of my head,

268
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,680
only... they're not my memories.

269
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,530
Okay.

270
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,130
I mean, I don't think they're\Nold memories at all. They're...

271
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,730
they're now-memories,\Nhappening all at once, now.

272
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,030
Can you describe these now-memories?

273
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,680
I don't know. It's...\Nit's hard to explain.

274
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,830
I know it's hard but can\Nyou just... Can you try?

275
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,480
For us?

276
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,030
It's like...

277
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,130
They're growing and spreading...

278
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,630
killing.

279
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,380
The memories?

280
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,780
I don't know.

281
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,180
Oh!

282
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,980
- I'm sorry.\N- No, no, no. It's okay, sweetie.

283
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,580
Hey, hey, sweetie...

284
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,830
what if you didn't have to use words?

285
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,830
Hey, you've reached the\NByers. We're sorry...

286
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,980
Anything?

287
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,630
We need to talk. AV room. Right now.

288
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,030
Party members only.

289
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,280
Come on, Mike.

290
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,980
No! This is non-negotiable.

291
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,930
- Sorry, Max.\N- Sorry.

292
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,580
Will didn't want me to tell anyone,

293
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,080
but on Halloween night he saw\Na sort of shadow in the sky.

294
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,080
A shadow?

295
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,780
What kind of shadow?

296
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,530
I don't know. But it scared him.

297
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,380
And if Will really has True Sight...

298
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,680
I mean, if he can really\Nsee into the Upside Down,

299
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
maybe he saw that\Nshadow again yesterday.

300
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,280
- So that's why he was frozen like that?\N- Maybe.

301
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,380
Can it hurt him?

302
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,230
I mean, if this shadow\Nthing isn't from our world...

303
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,980
I'm not sure. Dustin?

304
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,430
Well, if you're in another plane,

305
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,330
you can't interact\Nwith the material plane,

306
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,530
so theoretically, no,\Nthe shadow can't hurt him.

307
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,230
Yeah, if that's even what's happening.

308
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,880
This isn't D & D. This is real life.

309
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,980
So what do we do?

310
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,780
We acquire more knowledge.

311
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,330
I'll go to Will's after\Nschool. See what's going on.

312
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,730
You guys stay here and find Dart.

313
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,530
Dart? What's he gotta do with this?

314
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,130
Will heard him in the Upside Down.

315
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,630
I don't know how yet, but he's\Ngotta be connected to all this.

316
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,730
He's gotta be.

317
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,970
If we find Dart, maybe\Nwe can solve this thing.

318
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,390
Maybe we can help Will.

319
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,450
Hey! Hey, assholes!

320
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,000
Let us out of here!

321
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,050
Oh!

322
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,100
Not very pleasant in here, is it?

323
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,390
Sorry about that. Hospitality's\Nnot our strong suit.

324
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,300
You know, scientists and all.

325
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,490
Yeah. Okay.

326
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,540
You up for a little walk?

327
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm assuming you're behind me.

328
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,340
"Men of science have made\Nabundant mistakes of every kind."

329
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,900
George Sarton said that.

330
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,840
You guys know who George Sarton\Nis? Doesn't really matter.

331
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,390
The point is, mistakes\Nhave been made. Yes.

332
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,750
- Mistakes?\N- Yes.

333
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,950
You killed Barbara.

334
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,890
Abundant mistakes, but, the men\Ninvolved with those mistakes,

335
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,890
the ones responsible for what happened\Nto your brother and Miss Holland's death,

336
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,690
they're gone. They're gone,\Nand for better for worse,

337
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,850
I'm the schmuck they brought\Nin to make things better.

338
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,100
But I can't make things\Nbetter without your help.

339
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,800
You mean without us shutting up?

340
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,190
She's tough, this one. You\Nguys been together long?

341
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,950
- We're not together.\N- Wanna see what really killed your friend?

342
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,490
Teddy, I brought you an audience\Ntoday. I hope you don't mind.

343
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,700
More the merrier, sir.

344
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,700
I'd call it one hell of a mistake.

345
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,200
Wouldn't you?

346
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:48,750
See, the thing is, we can't\Nseem to erase our mistake...

347
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,750
but we can stop it from spreading.

348
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,270
Like, it's like pulling weeds.

349
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,550
But imagine for a moment\Nif a foreign state,

350
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,040
let's say, the Soviets... If\Nthey heard about our mistake...

351
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,290
do you think they would\Neven consider that a mistake?

352
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,570
What if they tried to replicate that?

353
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,040
The more attention we bring\Nto ourselves, the more...

354
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,500
the more people like the\NHollands know the truth,

355
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,700
the more likely that scenario becomes.

356
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,550
You see why I have to stop\Nthe truth from spreading, too.

357
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,450
Just, same as those weeds there.

358
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,850
By whatever means necessary.

359
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,150
So, we understand each\Nother now, don't we?

360
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,650
This is more of the same.

361
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,900
Oh, it's nothing. It's just scribbles.

362
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,750
Wait!

363
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,150
- What? What?\N- Wait.

364
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,500
- Wait. These black lines, see?\N- What?

365
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,300
Look, they connect.

366
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,350
They connect.

367
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,750
Does this mean anything to you?

368
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,350
No.

369
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,250
I mean, is it some\Nsort of maze or a road?

370
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,100
I mean, it's sort of forking and\Nbranching like... like lightning.

371
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,350
You think it's that storm?

372
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,000
No, the storm he drew was\Ncompletely different. He used red.

373
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,100
And this is all blue and it\Nhas some weird dirt color.

374
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,000
I mean, maybe it's roots.

375
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,650
'Cause remember, he was\Nsaying it was spreading and...

376
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,950
Killing.

377
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,550
He said they were killing.

378
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,000
Vines.

379
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,500
He's drawing vines.

380
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,350
Hey, Max. Have you seen Dustin?\NWe're supposed to meet after class.

381
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,300
Max!

382
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,950
Hey, Max! Hey, where you going? Come\Non! We've gotta go look for Dart.

383
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,340
Yeah, good luck with that.

384
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,610
What is wrong with you?

385
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,420
What is wrong with me?\NWhat's wrong with you?

386
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,610
- I don't understand.\N- No! I don't understand!

387
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,560
You guys act like you\Nwant me to be your friend

388
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,110
but then you treat me like garbage!

389
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,910
- That's not true!\N- Yes, it is!

390
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,270
You go and hide in the AV Club,

391
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,660
keeping secrets like we're\Nin second grade or something.

392
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,160
You know, I thought you\Nguys wanted me in your party.

393
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,570
- We do. But it's...\N- But what?

394
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,820
There... there are just things.

395
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,320
Things we can't tell you, all\Nright? For your own safety.

396
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,120
- My own safety?\N- Yes!

397
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,540
- Because I'm a girl?\N- What? No!

398
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,340
Did you keep secrets from El?

399
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,420
How do you know about El?

400
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,840
Did you?

401
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,140
That was different. Trust me. Okay?

402
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,220
That was just... just different.

403
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,220
Okay. You know what? Forget it, okay?

404
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,660
I don't wanna be in your\Nstupid party anyway. I'm out.

405
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,810
Have a nice life.

406
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,910
- Max!\N- You still stink, by the way!

407
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,960
Oh, shit!

408
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,960
That kid you were talking to, who is he?

409
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,510
He's no one.

410
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,560
- No one?\N- This kid from my class.

411
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,070
Why was he talking to you?

412
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,910
It was just about a\Nstupid class assignment.

413
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,740
- Then why're you so upset?\N- I'm not!

414
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,740
He causing you trouble?

415
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,660
Why do you care?

416
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,820
Because, Max, you're a piece of shit,

417
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,040
but we're family now\Nwhether we like it or not,

418
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,870
meaning I'm stuck looking out for you.

419
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,270
- What would I ever do without...\N- Hey!

420
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,060
This is serious shit, okay?

421
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,670
I'm older than you.

422
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,060
And something you learn

423
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,820
is that there are a\Ncertain type of people

424
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,420
in this world that you stay away from,

425
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,140
and that kid, Max...

426
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,060
That kid is one of them.

427
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,020
You stay away from him, you hear me?

428
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,910
Stay away.

429
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,540
"Ives.

430
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,370
Terry."

431
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,110
Jane.

432
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,370
Papa.

433
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,670
...President Reagan's...

434
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,520
Three to the right. Four to the left.

435
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,870
Rainbow.

436
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,170
Three to the right. Four to the left.

437
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,670
Rainbow.

438
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,570
Three to the right. Four to the left.

439
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,370
Four-fifty...

440
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,470
Jane.

441
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,070
Mama?

442
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,570
Mama!

443
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,070
Mama?

444
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,170
Mama!

445
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,870
Mama!

446
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,670
Mama...

447
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,790
Mama!

448
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,230
Hello?

449
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,360
Will!

450
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,030
Mrs. Byers?

451
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,140
- Hey.\N- Hey, Mike.

452
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,890
- Is Will here?\N- You know what?

453
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,360
Now is not a really good time.

454
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,530
Is he okay?

455
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,580
Yeah. You know, he's... he's\Njust not feeling real well.

456
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,710
He's laying down, so I'll\Ntell him you stopped by, okay?

457
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,040
It's about the shadow monster, isn't it?

458
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,230
Have a nice day.

459
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,340
Doesn't really matter. The point\Nis, mistakes have been made.

460
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,590
- Yes.\N- Mistakes?

461
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,390
The men involved with those mistakes,

462
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,640
the ones responsible for\Nwhat happened to your brother

463
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,140
and Miss Holland's\Ndeath, they're gone...

464
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,780
the ones responsible for\Nwhat happened to your brother

465
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,230
and Miss Holland's death, they're gone.

466
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,240
You still wanna do this?

467
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,130
Let's burn that lab to the ground.

468
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,430
Mew-mew, dinner!

469
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,680
Where are you? Mew-mew!

470
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,590
- Hey, Dusty!\N- Hi, hey. Hey, Mom.

471
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,090
- Everything okay?\N- Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah.

472
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,780
Dart, I've gotta talk to you, buddy.

473
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,360
It's about my friend, Will.

474
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,240
I think...

475
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,040
What the hell?

476
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,260
Dart?

477
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,290
Oh, Jesus.
