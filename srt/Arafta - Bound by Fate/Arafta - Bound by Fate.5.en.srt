1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,160
Your son is a murderer.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,440
And your daughter did
arrenged marriage for money.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,360
The guy who kept the video to blackmail,
instead of giving it to the police

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,400
tries to teach me morals?

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,120
It's your vulgarity against my justice.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,160
You are short-tempered, right?

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,200
You were on that day too.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,240
What did that poor girl do to make you mad?

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,720
She didn't get,

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,800
that it was over and she needed to shut up.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,600
So I punished her for it.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm so sick of your lies!
You will never fool me again.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,879
From now on, I won't do
what you want me to do.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,320
I'll do what's right.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,160
I detonated a grenade right
in the lap of the Yıldırım family.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,000
There's no way they'll
get out of this unscathed.

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,360
You've lost your way, son.
You forgot your purpose.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,040
It's like there's a
different Ateş in front of me.

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,160
Where is the Tahir who
was flaming with vengeance?

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,680
What Murat did is inexcusable. But turning
him in will not bring that girl back.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,640
I, however, will have lost a child.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,440
That girl had a family too, mom. Her dad...

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,160
Mercan, don't do this, I'm begging you.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,240
You wouldn't turn you brother in?

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,120
I don't understand how you
could've done something like this.

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,480
How is it a person fears her
own brother, her own family?

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm scared of you.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,520
I'm afraid of what you're capable of.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,040
He's not our son, but a monster!

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,680
I should turn him in and see
to it myself that he is punished.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,400
We're going to fake his death
and make it look like an accident.

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,000
Then, we'll smuggle him out of
the country with a fake passport.

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,560
I need your connections to do this.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,199
This is ridiculuous.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,000
We're just waiting around
for Mercan to make up her mind.

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,200
This girl has made Ateş
soft. She's confusing him.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
The Ateş I know would
have pulled the trigger

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,680
on the Yıldırım family long ago.

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,800
Did you find the footage?

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,040
I found it.

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,840
We'll show them now.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,280
Are you satisfied? This
is all because of you.

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,800
You couldn't just get
on that boat and leave.

44
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,000
If you had left, so would Nezir
and there would be no video in sight.

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,600
Who could have leaked that footage?

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,520
My entire plan fell through.

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,960
The only person I can think of is Nezir.

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,280
Find Murat, Haydar.

49
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,520
You're going to be the death of me.

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,840
You'll manage to do what my enemies
failed to do. Congrats, well done!

51
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,360
It's him. He did this. Had
he not posted that video,

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,160
none of this would've happened.

53
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,880
You did this.

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,960
You can't enough of watching us suffer.

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,480
Stop your whining.

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,800
I posted that video.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,960
If my son gets so much as
a scratch, I'll kill you.

58
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
Get away from her! Let go!

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,560
Look! Look at your mother!
Look how uncivil you are!

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,160
If you weren't so stubborn, you'd
see that you're slowing both of us down.

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,120
You still haven't figured
out your word means nothing?

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Let go.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
We know about your plan to
smuggle Murat of the country.

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,600
Tell me where he is.

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,720
It's true. We're doing
this out of love for him.

66
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,840
Murat, I know you're in there.

67
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Come out already.

68
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,920
Just come out and I'll help you.

69
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,000
Murat!

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,760
Walk out like a man.

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,080
My life ended because of you
and you still dare to speak!

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,320
Stop, don't hit him! Don't!

73
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,120
They both have Haydar's
blood running in their veins.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,560
They're bad seeds, Ateş.

75
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,760
They'll never run out of favors.

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,880
Don't have any expectations.

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
Wrap this up, so we can go.

78
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
My name is Tahir.

79
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm here to avenge my sister.

80
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,360
I wanted you to die knowing this.

81
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
Murat.

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
My son.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,600
You're gone.

84
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,120
Murat.

85
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,960
Nermin. Nermin. Come on.

86
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,840
Come on love.

87
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,759
Haydar.

88
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,280
It's okay.

89
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,160
Why, brother?

90
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,040
My condolences.

91
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,880
God bless you.

92
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,800
God bless you.

93
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,160
It's okay.

94
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,759
I'm so sorry.

95
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
My condolences.

96
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,800
I know that it's not easy.
Just know that you're not alone.

97
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,200
My condolences.

98
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,440
Thank you Nezir. God bless you.

99
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm sick of you being around.

100
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,840
You fulfilled your duty. You may leave.

101
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,800
We’ll see who leaves when the time comes.

102
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,280
What kind of a man are you? Do you really
have to show dominance on a day like this?

103
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
My condolences.

104
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,760
Well, he was your son after all. No
matter how awful he was, losing him hurts.

105
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,760
But at least you have a consolation.

106
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,520
You're rid of a bad man.

107
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Get out of here. -Nermin.

108
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,160
Nermin.

109
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,160
Heartless woman.

110
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,320
You don't respect our
grief, at least be quiet.

111
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,800
Show a little understanding.

112
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
It's okay.

113
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,680
Why are you even here?

114
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,720
You have him killed and
still show up at his funeral?

115
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,320
The words come from the pain.

116
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,680
Let's go.

117
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Aren’t you going to put her in place?

118
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,400
This is neither the place nor the time.

119
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
My condolences, Haydar.

120
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,640
Thank you. God bless you.

121
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,720
Sorry, I couldn’t make it. I’m very
sad. I haven't seen Murat for a long time.

122
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,440
But I knew him as a
child. He left so early.

123
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,640
We can punish the one who did
this. We have our men inside.

124
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,640
With a single word, they’ll
take down the scoundrel.

125
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,880
No need. If necessary,
I’ll handle it myself.

126
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,960
I don't understand the ones who stepped in for no
reason. They’re the ones who should be punished.

127
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,440
Who are you talking about?

128
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,320
Never mind, thanks for
coming out of courtesy.

129
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,320
I know you’re hurting a
lot, but we need to talk soon.

130
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,480
What is it?

131
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,440
It's very important.

132
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,760
I'll be waiting.

133
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,400
Keep an eye on our people, Cemal.

134
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,159
I have a few places to visit.

135
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Don't worry, brother.

136
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,800
Be safe.

137
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,880
The kid passed away without
ever knowing his parents.

138
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,800
What do you mean he passed
away without knowing his parents?

139
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,880
Mom, are you hiding something from us?

140
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:24,280
I was just saying... He didn’t really get to
live, he died so young. That’s what I meant.

141
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,360
The burial must be done already.

142
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,840
Will anyone come for the mourning, mom?

143
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
I don't think so, dear.

144
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,760
Still, people love gossip.
Some will come just to eavesdrop.

145
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,280
What’s left for them to know?

146
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,360
Everyone watched the video online.
The murder is all over the news channels.

147
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,840
He killed the poor girl and
shamelessly walked around.

148
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,680
God rest his soul. The guilt is on him now.

149
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,320
The guilt is on him?

150
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,520
I see, it’s an idiom again.

151
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,360
I can’t believe Ms. Müzeyyen. She
should at least stay silent out of respect.

152
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:17,359
She's the mother-in-law. Okay, we get
it, there are money matters… But this much?

153
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,520
They’re all full of hatred, like enemies.

154
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
I don’t get it either.

155
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,519
If you hate each other, why
did you move into the mansion?

156
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,800
Right?

157
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,840
Somehow, it’s always
quiet whenever I arrive.

158
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,520
God give me patience.

159
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,480
They’ll be coming from the
cemetery now. I’ll move the cars.

160
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,200
That's why I'm here. Ms.
Müzeyyen asked you to make halva.

161
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,280
You're right. I forgot. Çiçek, get up dear.

162
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,560
Let me go help Malik.

163
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,080
Bring the pot.

164
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Welcome, big brother.

165
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,480
Same to you.

166
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,880
May god save you.

167
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,280
Thank you, thank you.

168
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,280
Do you need anything?

169
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
No.

170
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,759
Why did you hide my
daughter’s killer from me?

171
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,120
I wasn't sure, big brother.

172
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,280
I needed evidence.

173
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,480
And I found it.

174
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,040
Just as I was about to take him to justice…

175
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,320
Why did you do it? Why did you ruin yourself?
He was going to pay for what he did anyway.

176
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,920
Yes.

177
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,560
But I wanted to bring justice with
my own hands, not in a courtroom.

178
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,600
If I live long enough to get out...

179
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,720
I’ll visit her grave
with my head held high.

180
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,840
Betül and I are at peace now.

181
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,680
I'll get you out of here, I promise.

182
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,920
No Ateş.

183
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:01,640
I’ll serve the sentence I deserve. Sometimes
freedom is found even between these walls.

184
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,320
He was terrified of cemeteries.

185
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,120
And we left him there all alone.

186
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,920
You couldn’t protect him, Haydar.

187
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,840
You couldn’t protect my son.

188
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,000
We buried him so young.

189
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,040
When the time comes, everyone
will pay for what they did.

190
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,120
Müzeyyen is just as guilty as Mümtaz.

191
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,360
She didn’t just leak the footage
online, she even gave him our home address.

192
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,880
She has to feel the pain of losing a child.
Otherwise she’ll never understand mine.

193
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,480
Patience. Patience, Nermin.

194
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,840
Everything has its time.

195
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,920
But I have no patience.

196
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,720
How will mom get through this pain, Demet?

197
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,440
You know, my brother
was the light of her life.

198
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,640
And you lost your brother. You
can’t carry everyone’s pain.

199
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,640
They’re my family. Of course I’ll
share their pain and support them.

200
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,720
You married a man you
don’t love, because of them.

201
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,680
You’re literally living in hell.

202
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,600
For God’s sake, think about yourself too.

203
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,000
I can’t find peace until
I get my family out of this.

204
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,360
It’s not the time to think about myself.

205
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,800
After all, they’re in this situation
because of what my brother did.

206
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,320
We can go if you're ready Demet.

207
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,400
Okay.

208
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,640
You’re here again?

209
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,200
The Yıldırım family has been close to us for many years.
I’m not going to ask your permission to visit them.

210
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,200
You will ask me.

211
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,600
Objection rejected. Get lost.

212
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,880
Enough. Quit fighting like kids.

213
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,880
Can't you see Mercan?

214
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,120
Especially you.

215
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,720
Demet.

216
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,240
Please.

217
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,640
I’ll come later.

218
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,840
Okay, e-mail them to me.
I will check them later.

219
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,320
You can’t be this pushy.

220
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,400
Yes, Mr. Nezir?

221
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,160
How many times have I
called? Why don't you answer?

222
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,280
I’ve been busy, so I couldn't answer.

223
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,960
Have you done what I asked?

224
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,400
I haven’t been able to access
those informations yet, Mr. Nezir.

225
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,920
Yaşar.

226
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,800
Get them done as soon as possible.
We don’t have time to waste.

227
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,080
I need to go. I hung up.

228
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,720
He is always up to something.

229
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,240
Excuse me?

230
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:34,240
You’ll give the reports only to me. Especially when Yaşar asks
you for something, you won't do it and tell me instead, okay?

231
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,639
Okay, but why?

232
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,639
And rule number 5, you won't ask me why.

233
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,759
Okay Ms. Zahide.

234
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,040
Good job.

235
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,960
Burak.

236
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,880
Hey. Look at me. Hey.

237
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,960
This is a mourning house. You can’t throw
people out who come to offer condolences.

238
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,400
This is my house, I can
throw out whoever I want.

239
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,080
You keep playing word games,
and it’s getting annoying.

240
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,319
I’m tired of you blaming me
with every word and every look.

241
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Aren’t you doing the same?

242
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
You’re the one who blamed me and my family at
the funeral for having your brother murdered.

243
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,839
Is it a lie? My brother was going to turn himself
in, and face his punishment. And now because of you…

244
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,680
Your brother is responsible
for his own death.

245
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,720
And Nezir, whom you stood up for after
I kicked him out, isn’t innocent either.

246
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,000
As long as we’re married,
you’ll act worthy of our name.

247
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,800
I don’t want to see your ex-fiancé around.

248
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,640
After the divorce, I
don’t care what you do.

249
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,360
You can’t walk into people’s
lives and play with them like this.

250
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,480
I treat everyone as they deserve.

251
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,360
You’re just trying to look
big in your little world.

252
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,720
Even if it’s small, I
have a world that’s mine.

253
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,800
But the people in your
big world are quite small.

254
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,720
Now, I'm your whole world.

255
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,440
Small, but happy.

256
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,760
Brother.

257
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,240
Brother.

258
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,320
I swear, I’ll make each
and every one of you pay.

259
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,720
I’ll make you suffer so much,
you’ll beg me to die, Haydar.

260
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,040
What’s in that room? What
are you hiding in there?

261
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,560
What could you be hiding here?

262
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,120
I like halva so much.

263
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,640
Thank you, I'm on a diet.

264
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,840
Leave Aslı’s plate to me as well, Çiçek.

265
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,760
Isn’t that shameful, Ms. Müzeyyen?

266
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,360
What’s the problem? It’s
tradition to eat the deceased’s halva.

267
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,680
What’s so shameful about that?

268
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,560
I’ll tear this woman apart.

269
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,960
Easy.

270
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,560
Don’t get me in trouble now.

271
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,040
I hope that halva is
the last thing you eat.

272
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,400
Enough. He got what was coming to
him. We’re not grieving for your son.

273
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,400
Mother Müzeyyen.

274
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,200
They have no respect even for the dead.

275
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,400
He's gone now. Let him rest in peace.

276
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,560
Wasn’t taking his life enough?

277
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,120
Nermin.

278
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I promise.

279
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:52,920
I’ll make them pay for what they did. Haydar Yıldırım
may have fallen, but he’s not dead. I promise.

280
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
I won’t leave it to you, Haydar.

281
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,400
I swear I’ll make that
woman feel the same pain.

282
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,200
Nermin.

283
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,600
Don't call me Nermin,
don't. Stay out of it.

284
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,400
Ms. Müzeyyen literally
drove the woman crazy.

285
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,320
You should’ve seen Mrs.
Nermin, she flew at her.

286
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,240
If they hadn’t held her back,
she would’ve torn her apart.

287
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,200
Mom?

288
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Aren't you listening?

289
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,800
No dear, I was lost in thought.

290
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,760
You seem really upset over Mr. Murat.

291
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Yeah, I am upset.

292
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,080
That’s fate. It just draws its path.

293
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,960
If he had stayed, maybe that boy
wouldn’t have ended up like this at all.

294
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
What does that mean?

295
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,040
Don’t mind me. I’m just talking.

296
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,240
If he had behaved properly, none of this
chaos would’ve happened. That’s what I mean.

297
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,640
The real chaos will break out
when they find out what Ms. Aslı did.

298
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,960
Clear everything, Zehra.
Move it to the storage.

299
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,040
What are you doing here?

300
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,360
I'll use here as a hobby room.

301
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,880
Zehra, put them back now.

302
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Keep going.

303
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,800
Get out. Get the hell out.

304
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,280
Mind your business, girl. This is
my house, I take any room I want.

305
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,880
Move.

306
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,280
What the hell are you doing?

307
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,280
That’s enough.

308
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,360
What kind of people are you? What’s
your goal? Are you here to drive us crazy?

309
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,520
Are you trying to force us to mourn?

310
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,880
Your brother dug his own grave.

311
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,480
What’s going on? We can hear you outside.

312
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,880
Your sister's trying to take my
brother’s room like it’s the only one.

313
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Your sister?

314
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,360
At least leave us the room and memories.

315
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,040
Couldn't you wait Aslı? Was this the time?

316
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,640
Mother Müzeyyen and you are
making my job harder, not easier.

317
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,800
Where is she going now?

318
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Malik.

319
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
How’s the citizenship process going?

320
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,960
So-so.

321
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,040
Let’s get you married to someone
here, your process will speed up.

322
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,160
No way. I’ll only...

323
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,439
Marry the woman I love.

324
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Hey.

325
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,600
Thanks sister.

326
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,480
Thank you.

327
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,439
Isn't mom here?

328
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,160
No, she's still in the mansion.

329
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,960
She was kind of strange today.

330
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Well, she was upset.

331
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,080
Go inside. Malik and I are talking.

332
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,320
Well, I can join you too.

333
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
Go.

334
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,600
Good night.

335
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,920
You too.

336
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Malik.

337
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,160
‘'The woman I love,
’' huh? Is there someone?

338
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,400
Probably, there isn't. You’re
here even on your day off.

339
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,360
If there was, we'd know, right?

340
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,960
Instead of advising me, why
don’t you get married, Berat?

341
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,840
Don’t the older ones marry first here?

342
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,320
You're right.

343
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,520
Well, Çiçek can't marry before me.

344
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,240
Actually, she’ll end up staying single too.

345
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,480
And I'm here even on my
day off. Who can I meet?

346
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,640
Your heart is burning now.

347
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,160
I understand you the most.

348
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,199
Are you sure he went after Mercan?

349
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm sure. Mr. Ateş went
after her in a hurry.

350
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,760
Alright. Keep your eyes open.

351
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,880
Don’t worry, Ms. Aslı. Not just Mrs.
Mercan but everyone in the kitchen too…

352
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,680
Cut it out, Zehra. Go on.

353
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,480
Why are you here so late?

354
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,800
Don’t say you waited
for me because you care.

355
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,360
No need to worry.

356
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,240
Don’t forget I know where and when you are.

357
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,200
You seem tired, go upstairs.

358
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,000
No.

359
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,440
Don’t argue with me.

360
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,600
You can't win.

361
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,880
I’m really exhausted.

362
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,920
Understand me for once.

363
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,440
I don’t want to go into that
room, nor do I want to sleep with you.

364
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,280
Are you really this cruel?

365
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,360
You fooled me.

366
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:59,040
Mr. Ateş? I was going to check
Mrs. Mercan, Çiçek saw her sleeping.

367
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,600
Mrs. Mercan has been through a lot.

368
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,720
Murat was a little brother that needs to
be protected by her, not his big brother.

369
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,040
Take this.

370
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,760
Put it on her.

371
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,320
Sure, Mr. Ateş.

372
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,280
Good night.

373
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,080
Well, he seems harsh, but he
actually takes care of his wife.

374
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,640
We got up at the crack of dawn.
What’s so special about today?

375
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,000
Don’t complain! Ms. Müzeyyen
said she wants a perfect breakfast.

376
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,680
And the perfect breakfast is fried liver?

377
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,680
She’s the one paying us, what can we do?

378
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,520
Way to start the morning.

379
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,960
The funeral just ended, and she’s acting
like it’s a celebration. What a shame.

380
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,240
Çiçek.

381
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,920
Go on, go on.

382
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,880
Okay, okay, I'm going.

383
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Are you going to let me?

384
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,160
I'll change, if you excuse me.

385
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,480
Don't test me.

386
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,200
Mother of god. Look at that.

387
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,440
I found my way here smelling. I'm so lucky.

388
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,640
Only you could make such a beautiful table.

389
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,920
What do they know about a
fine table? Food is culture.

390
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,080
Well you are right mom. Aslı, let's eat.

391
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,400
Gives you energy in the morning.

392
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:50,040
Mom what's the occasion? You usually make
breakfasts like this only on holidays. Why today?

393
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,960
Well today is kind of
a holiday for us, son.

394
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,200
Where's Ateş?

395
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,120
He's busy, he'll come later.

396
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,160
Won't you come in? It smells good.

397
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,480
Let Ms. Binnaz prepare
breakfast for you outside.

398
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,520
I’ll come by if you’re available.

399
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,680
Mom, thank you for your effort.
I’m going to see Ateş. Excuse me.

400
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
Hope you enjoyed it.

401
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,440
Çiçek, have you talked to Malik?

402
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
You were going to set us up.

403
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,880
Look.

404
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,640
I’m being patient, not responding.
Don’t test me. What do you think I am?

405
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,799
Don’t yell, everyone will hear.

406
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,160
I don't care who hears.

407
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,880
Don't shout.

408
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:11,600
Then watch your mouth.

409
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:19,800
If you’re that eager, ask Ms. Müzeyyen to find
you a husband! Shame on you. Who says such thing?

410
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,400
And don't involve me in
your dirty stuff again.

411
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
What's the matter with her?

412
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,960
Why didn't you come to office Haydar?

413
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,200
It’s nice to be out in the open. I
haven’t been able to stay anywhere lately.

414
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,600
The house also has turned
into an all-women’s bath.

415
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,000
Anyway, let’s talk about
the business you mentioned.

416
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,880
It's a good business. Just like the
old days, easy and plenty of money.

417
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,840
Enough to get you out of
the tight spot you’re in.

418
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,080
Say so?

419
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,680
Is it risky?

420
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,120
Who gets money without risk?

421
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,920
So it's dangerous, huh?

422
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,360
I’m not sure, Şahin.
Everyone knows what’s going on.

423
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:21,960
I can’t just dive in like
the old days. I need to think.

424
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:27,560
I can’t wait too long, Haydar. If you
don’t accept, I’ll talk to someone else.

425
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,680
Fine, wait for my word. I’ll call you.

426
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,120
Don't be so quick.

427
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,400
Ateş Karahan sends his regards.

428
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,360
And my regards to him.

429
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,880
Brother said “Tell him not to betray me
just because he and Haydar go way back.”

430
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,040
Alright.

431
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,840
When it comes to money, I
don’t even recognize my father.

432
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,160
Old friends’ sentimentality isn’t for me.

433
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,000
You'll get the rest when the job is done.

434
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,440
Alright.

435
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,120
There’s nothing here.

436
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,120
Who are they?

437
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,960
What’s their connection?

438
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,920
What are you doing here, little mouse?

439
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,200
Lost your way, little girl?

440
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,919
What are you doing here?

441
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,800
Answer me.

442
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,000
Why did you come into this room?

443
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,920
To understand my "little
world" or something?

444
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,560
I don't have to explain
myself to you. I live here.

445
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,200
I'll go into whatever room I please.

446
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,560
That's not the answer to my question.
Tell me what you're doing here.

447
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,919
How did you get the key?

448
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,920
You picked it out of my pocket, right?

449
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,720
So, now you're a thief as well.

450
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,920
I warned you about coming into this room.

451
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,359
I was looking for something.

452
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,680
This was the only room I hadn't checked.

453
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,280
Do you think I'm stupid?

454
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,760
What do you have behind you?

455
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,560
Move out of my way.

456
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,880
I'm not finished yet.

457
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,120
Don't you ever, ever
go into this room again.

458
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,840
"Şefkat Orphanage."

459
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,960
He grew up in an orphanage?

460
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,560
Did you clear the room?

461
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,480
Not yet, we'll get it done.

462
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,120
What's taking you so long?
Why don't you hurry up?

463
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,000
Get on with it already.

464
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,480
Yes, ma'am.

465
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,960
The Yıldırım family is one member down.

466
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,200
It's time to get rid of the rest.

467
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,080
I hate their guts.

468
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,880
I can't stand to see their faces,
let alone live under the same room.

469
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:01,720
I feel the same way. Especially
that devil in an angel's cloak.

470
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,640
I can't stand her.

471
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:09,960
She's fighting a losing battle.
She's trying in vain to change the fate,

472
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,640
But she can't change
her own nor her family's.

473
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,799
Where are you going this time?

474
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,399
The cafe by the coast, right?

475
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,120
Yes, I know that place.

476
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,360
I'm on my way, I'll be there soon.

477
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,040
What's the hurry? You got somewhere to be?

478
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,400
That's none of your business.

479
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,120
You're my wife.

480
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,240
Is it not natural that I'd like
to know where my wife is going?

481
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,799
Just as you said, sadly, I'm
your wife, not your servant.

482
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,480
I don't have to report
my every move to you.

483
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,000
But you keep making the wrong moves.

484
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,960
Like stealing a key and
entering a room you're not

485
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,960
supposed to go into,
unbeknownst to your husband.

486
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,280
What are you trying to do?

487
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,440
I'm trying to uncover your
past that you keep like a secret.

488
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,280
Okay? Are you satisfied?

489
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,680
Husband.

490
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,599
I'll leave no stone unturned.

491
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,600
I'll find out what your hiding
behind that veil of mystery.

492
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,279
Who you are, what you
are, what you want from us;

493
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,000
I'll uncover everything.

494
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,880
Okay, then. We'll go together.

495
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,280
If you want to know this badly,
you'll have all the answers.

496
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,720
Go on.

497
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,600
Mr. Nezir.

498
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,920
Welcome, Mr. Nezir.

499
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,399
I heard some rumors,
something about Şahin doing

500
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,040
business with the Yılmaz
Conglomerate but I couldn't verify.

501
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,560
I thought you might know.

502
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,760
I'm sorry but I don't.

503
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,840
You don't know, huh?

504
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,119
Mr. Nezir, I've already
told you everything I know

505
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,239
out of respect for Ms.
Mercan. I've risked my job and

506
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,120
gave you all the files,
there's nothing more I can do.

507
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,400
They're watching my every
move, I'm going to get caught.

508
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:04,960
If a word gets out,
about the things we talked,

509
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,080
you giving me the files, I'll
make you regret opening your mouth.

510
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,840
You'll beg me to kill you.

511
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,679
Is that clear, buddy?

512
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,680
Uh-huh.

513
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,200
Mom?

514
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,240
Is there something wrong, you seem down?

515
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,160
It's Ms. Aslı. She's coming down on me

516
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,240
about clearing out Mr. Murat's room again.

517
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,840
She scolded me like a
child. It's humiliating.

518
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,800
What a brat.

519
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,920
She keeps saying she needs
an arts and crafts room.

520
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,480
It's not like the room will grow legs!

521
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,440
And I can't bring myself to clear the room,

522
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,320
while the family is still grieving.

523
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,280
I'm still shaken up myself.

524
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,880
I understand, mom. But we're only servants.

525
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,279
They'll kick us out if we
don't follow their orders.

526
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,560
Yeah, you're right.

527
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,360
There's no getting around
it, we have to clear the room.

528
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,720
There's no getting around, alright.

529
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,040
We're already swamped, now we
have to deal with Murat's stuff.

530
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,440
Malik is helping me even
though it's his free time.

531
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,640
It's no big deal, don't even mention it.

532
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,279
Take a breather first, you'll do it later.

533
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,040
No, we can't. We need to get
it done today, Ms. Aslı's orders.

534
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah, she told me, too.
God give me patience.

535
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,919
We've had no peace since they've arrived.

536
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,480
I came down here because I'm starving.

537
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,320
If it were up to Malik, we wouldn't
have come down until we finished.

538
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,880
There's some pastry over there.

539
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,560
I just want to get it over with.

540
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,160
Looks good.

541
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Here you go. Thanks.

542
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,800
I'll take these. Let's go eat over there.

543
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,040
Çiçek, could you bring us some tea?

544
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,040
Okay, Berat.

545
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:20,200
See you later.

546
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,919
I just checked, Mr. Murat's
room remains as it was.

547
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,800
Go clear out the room instead
of chitchatting all day.

548
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,880
Chitchatting?
Yes.

549
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,240
We're chitchatting?
Yes.

550
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,200
Berat and Malik just
left, they'll get it done.

551
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,280
Okay, good. Tell them to hurry up,

552
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,520
Ms. Aslı is getting impatient.

553
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,920
What a freak.

554
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,199
God give me patience.

555
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,960
Çiçek, dear, make me a
coffee, I'm exhausted.

556
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,440
Yeah, coffee sounds good.

557
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,120
Hello, Ms. Aysel, right?

558
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,160
Yes.

559
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,640
Ateş? I can't believe
my eyes, it's really you.

560
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,280
You remember?

561
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:37,080
How could I forget these eyes?
I'd recognize them from a mile away.

562
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,800
Come and sit.

563
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,320
You don't have any more
information on Şahin?

564
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,880
Yeah, I know. He's an old bird.

565
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,480
So you think he'll do business?

566
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,839
Okay, okay. Let me know
if you hear anything else.

567
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,320
Bye.

568
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:48,120
Hello, Şahin? I've thought
about your offer and I accept.

569
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,160
Are you sure, Haydar? I'm warning
you again that this is no joke.

570
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,720
Can you really do this?

571
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,039
Şahin, I've been around
the block quite a few times.

572
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,160
Don try to outshine the master.

573
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,280
I'll call you about the contract.

574
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,280
Okay, then.

575
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,880
We have a deal.

576
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,680
It's been a while.

577
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,720
The last time we saw each
other was at the charity event

578
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,040
we held for orphan children
seven years ago, right?

579
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,520
We'd raised a lot of money, thanks to you.

580
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,680
I'm not even going to mention
the large donation you made.

581
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,600
Thank you.

582
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,360
Thank you.

583
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:53,479
You insisted on seeing me so
much that I've grown curious.

584
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,760
What's the story of this chance meeting?

585
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,680
Don't be shy. Ask ahead.

586
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,320
What do you see in this photograph?

587
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,560
I see children who had to learn of

588
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,040
the atrocities of life way too early.

589
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,680
Ateş, look. That's you.

590
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,760
You've changed so much.

591
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,120
I remember the day you came to
the orphanage like it was yesterday.

592
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:12,199
You had such intense
anger in your eyes and a

593
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,880
deep pain a child of that age
should not have experienced.

594
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,320
You were so closed off.

595
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,880
You didn't even eat or speak for days.

596
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,080
It was not an easy task
to bring you back to life.

597
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,840
"There's something
about you that puzzles me.

598
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,999
Sometimes, I see
compassion in your eyes that

599
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,879
you can't stop from seeping through.

600
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,199
And I think to myself, 'There
is a good person behind that mask'

601
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,519
And then, you go back to your cruel ways.

602
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,639
You stop being good. I really don't get it.

603
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,039
It's as if there is
something, a reason that

604
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:20,080
keeps you from being
good, makes you cruel."

605
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,840
Yaşar, send me the information
on the upcoming shipments.

606
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,680
But Mr. Haydar, I don't have access
to theshipment schedule anymore.

607
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,816
Ms. Zahide is in charge of it now.

608
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,520
She's very hard on her assistant too.

609
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,840
There's no way I can
access that information.

610
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,560
Yaşar, just do what I
tell you. Send it now.

611
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,560
Okay, sir. I'll ask around. If I
find anything, I'll send it to you.

612
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,400
Tell Ms. Zahide that Mercan
is asking for the information.

613
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,560
Do not mention my name.

614
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,240
Okay but... Does Ms. Mercan have

615
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,640
any information on this?

616
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,760
Leave that to me, you do what I told you.

617
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,000
Yes, sir.

618
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,600
I have to get on top of this.

619
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,880
Is Ms. Zahide around?

620
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,720
Her name alone is enough
to make you jump, right?

621
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,319
She grinds my gears too.

622
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,080
That's not it. I'm just a klutz.

623
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,600
That much is obvious. I can tell.

624
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,760
What do you want?

625
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,160
I just want to say I find your
demeanor very admirable, Ms. Zahide.

626
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,280
I need the shipment schedule.

627
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,600
And why is that?

628
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,320
I've made contact with aliens,
they were asking for them.

629
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,720
Ms. Mercan wants to check the last
arrangements, what else could it be?

630
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,480
I'm on direct orders from Mr. Ateş.

631
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,960
I can't give you the schedule
without consulting him.

632
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,280
You don't have to be so sweet all the time.

633
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,800
Have a nice day.

634
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,280
Sorry about your head. Thanks.

635
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:28,000
Burak, focus. If he ever asks you
for the schedule, don't give it to him

636
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,960
and come tell me afterwards.

637
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:30,680
Okay.

638
01:11:30,681 --> 01:11:31,880
Are we clear? Yes.

639
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,000
Good job.

640
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,440
Thank you for the ride.

641
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,720
Aren't you forgetting something?

642
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,320
I hope I managed to satisfy your curiosity.

643
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,760
Yes, I found what I was looking for.

644
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,040
Why didn't you tell me?

645
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,640
Why would I?

646
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,840
It's stuck.

647
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,960
Leave it to me.

648
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,160
I'll do it.

649
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,480
I told you to leave it.

650
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,920
There's no need. I told you I'll get it.

651
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,840
Why isn't it coming off?

652
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,480
Don't be a pain. Just let me.

653
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,800
It's stuck. This happens sometimes.

654
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,880
I understand its temperament.

655
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,200
Nermin.

656
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:48,239
I thought a lot about
the job offer Şahin made.

657
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:53,360
I decided it's a good
idea. I accepted his offer.

658
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,320
We'll hopefully get rid of
Ateş Karahan and his posse soon.

659
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,199
What good will that do?

660
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,840
It won't bring back my Murat.

661
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,680
Nermin, get it together please.
It's no use dredging up the past.

662
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,400
We're basically freeloaders here.

663
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,359
I'm doing everything in my
power to better our situation.

664
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,800
I'm working for our family, for us.

665
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:26,040
How will you do this, when
that no good woman's son is

666
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,120
circling us like a vulture?

667
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,079
I have a plan.

668
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,840
Don't you worry, I'll
do what needs to be done.

669
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,120
What's up, bro?

670
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,520
I'm good.

671
01:15:01,521 --> 01:15:04,160
How did it go? Did my
picture come in handy?

672
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,440
It did.

673
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,880
Ms. Aysel told your life
story as if it were mine.

674
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,319
Did little miss buy it?

675
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,799
She seemed to buy it.

676
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,760
But we need to be careful.

677
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,399
We owe one to Ms. Aysel.

678
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,480
She's so kind to agree to play our game.

679
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,360
I actually owe her everything.

680
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,200
She was like a mother to me
for years in that orphanage.

681
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,680
Don't let my mom hear
that, she'd get so jealous.

682
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,520
Any news on Haydar?

683
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,519
It's going well. Şahin
called, Haydar bought our bait.

684
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,640
He'll go into an illegitimate
business, just like old days.

685
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,760
After that, he'll go into a prison cell.

686
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,400
So, it's downhill from here for him.

687
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,240
I'm going to visit the
graveyard. We'll talk later.

688
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,959
Like I said, he lived at an orphanage

689
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,080
for a while before the year 2005.

690
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,680
That's why they're not in any
records and I can't find their origins.

691
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:30,080
I suppose. But I'll keep
looking, I don't trust him at all.

692
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,800
I'm sure he's hiding something.

693
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,120
I'm not sitting idly by either, dear.

694
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,040
We received an amazing opportunity.

695
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,880
We'll get rid of the
Karahan family and start over.

696
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,240
But I need your help for this.

697
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,280
What's this opportunity, dad?

698
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,840
Şahin, my old partner.

699
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,760
He's proposing to make
shipments through our company.

700
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,760
Dad, please don't do anything wrong.

701
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,000
No, dear.

702
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:57,600
It's legal, completely in
line with the regulations.

703
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,879
But if I sign the papers,
Ateş will get suspicious, he'll

704
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:05,320
block our business. That's
why we need your signature.

705
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,599
I don't like to move
in the shadows like this.

706
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,760
Is this Şahin even trustworthy?

707
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,960
Dear, do you not trust your dad?

708
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,680
That's not the point.

709
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,840
You misunderstood me.

710
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,600
I just want to make sure
we're making the right moves.

711
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,040
Dear, please. Let's not
miss this opportunity.

712
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,680
This is my company to begin with,

713
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,840
I'm making shipments
thorugh my own company.

714
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,840
That Ateş doesn't have to know everything.

715
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:39,480
I want to get rid of the Karahan
family as well. Even more than you do.

716
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,240
But not like this.

717
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:10,320
After school, your dad will
take you to an amusement park.

718
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:15,840
Yay! We'll go on the swings
and get chocolate too, right?

719
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,519
Of course, we'll do whatever you want.

720
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,719
We'll get chocolate too?

721
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:19,720
Sure, son.
Yay.

722
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,160
But it's time for school now, come on.

723
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,480
Have a nice day.

724
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,360
We could never forget about that day.

725
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,200
Eylül would always ask...

726
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,080
What if mom and dad went to our school?

727
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,680
What if they're waiting for us there?

728
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,720
I couldn't tell her
you died in an accident.

729
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,520
I just kept comforting her with fairytales.

730
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,120
I comforted myself too with those tales.

731
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,200
It was hard to accept.

732
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,880
Haydar had to bury his son.

733
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,440
That was not a part of the plan.

734
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,600
But everyone has their own destiny.

735
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,480
I'm keeping my promise to you.

736
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,079
I'm making them pay.

737
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:06,080
Each and every one responsible
for my sister's death.

738
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,320
Rest in peace.

739
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,480
Good evening, Mr. Haydar.

740
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,280
Ms. Binnaz.

741
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,320
Yes, Mr. Haydar?

742
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,840
Nermin will... get over it soon.

743
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,040
She'll get better, don't you worry.

744
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:50,600
But the issues of the past
that weren't spoken, would

745
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,640
not get brought up now, to
avoid upsetting her, right?

746
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,080
Don't worry, Mr. Haydar.

747
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,040
You remember me saying I'll
take it to the grave, right?

748
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,840
I won't say a word, sir.

749
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,080
Good.

750
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,040
You heathens!

751
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,039
Do you have no mercy!?

752
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,600
Do you not have any
respect even for grief!?

753
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,679
Get out of here!

754
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,560
Get out!

755
01:28:13,561 --> 01:28:17,840
I'm not going anywhere!
Who are you to kick me out?

756
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,599
Get out.

757
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,560
I'm not going. What are you going to do,

758
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,639
drag me out?

759
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,360
I'll do that if I have to. Get out of here.

760
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,879
This is our house. Who
are you to kick us out?

761
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,280
You should be grateful
we haven't kicked you out.

762
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:43,000
If you're grieving, do it respectfully.

763
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,480
Leave us alone.

764
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,159
Why are we leaving? She's
the one that needs to go.

765
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,280
Aslı.

766
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,759
Get out of this room.
I told you to get out.

767
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:08,800
Go, leave!

768
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,799
I'm not proud of what my brother did.

769
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,320
But he's dead now.

770
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,199
We just held the funeral.

771
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,439
Even the most evil person on earth
doesn't deserve this disrespect,

772
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,520
do you hear me?

773
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,160
I would never let that happen.

774
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,200
Never!
Enough.

775
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,840
Enough! Get a grip.

776
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,760
Get your hands off me!

777
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,560
Listen to me. You're
going to hurt yourself.

778
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,359
I don't care what happens to me.

779
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,080
I'm so sick of living like this.

780
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,560
Let go!

781
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:59,080
I can't stand this inhumanity,
this cruelty any longer.

782
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,600
I can't stand this wickedness anymore.

783
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:02,720
I've had enough.

784
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,840
You screamed your heart out.

785
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,920
Do you feel better, at least?

786
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:05,840
Don't get me wrong. I'm not
asking out of concern for you.

787
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,040
I just don't want another incident at home.

788
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,560
Loud noises irritate me.

789
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,600
I wouldn't expect anything to the contrary.

790
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,879
Good.

791
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:23,840
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this.

792
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,520
Sometimes, I wonder...

793
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,120
But I can't find an answer.

794
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:34,760
Why would a person do this to himself?

795
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,800
Why, for instance, marry
someone he doesn't want?

796
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,920
Why would he torment his wife,

797
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,719
pretend to be a good person at first

798
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:51,280
and then tell her he doesn't
care about her as if to taunt her?

799
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,960
Why do you act this way?

800
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,159
Who are you really?

801
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,160
What kind of a person are you?

802
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:07,360
Even if you don't answer my
questions, I'll find out eventually.

803
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:25,000
You won't be able to find
anything, until I get my revenge.

804
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,000
Slow down! We're not in a famine.

805
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,640
What can I say, mom, I'm starving.

806
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,640
Why didn't Malik come with you?

807
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,840
The food is getting cold.

808
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,600
Why don't you join us, Zehra?

809
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,640
I'll eat alone later. You
guys enjoy your breakfast.

810
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,159
You finally managed to show
up. I saved a plate for you,

811
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,439
eat it before it gets cold.

812
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,120
You did? Thanks, I was starving.

813
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:10,239
Now that I think about it, why
bother making a separate breakfast?

814
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,520
I should join you.

815
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:14,399
Çiçek, could you pass me a knife?

816
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,040
You didn't give any knives.

817
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,039
You could've sat there...

818
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,240
Give me a knife, would you?

819
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:22,680
Whatever.

820
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,600
Malik, here you go. Eat up.

821
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,320
Thank you.

822
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:26,359
Here you go.

823
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,880
Thank you, Berat.

824
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,240
Thanks.

825
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,720
Single life is hard, right?

826
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,800
He's away from home, doesn't have anyone.

827
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,520
His wife will do it for
him when he gets married.

828
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:43,640
God give me patience...

829
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,840
He won't have to go around hungry.

830
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,600
So, tell me Malik.

831
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,560
Anyone catch your eye?

832
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,360
Yes, there's someone.

833
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,400
What?

834
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,840
Malik,

835
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:20,040
I didn't know you were such a flirt.

836
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,160
You didn't let that on at
all the other night, either.

837
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,600
How could you not tell me
that you were seeing someone?

838
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,080
I have so much to do, I
should get back to work.

839
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,560
You can run but you
can't hide! What a stud!

840
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,360
Who would've thought?

841
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,520
I never would have guessed, wow!

842
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,160
Enjoy your food, dear.

843
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,320
Eat up, Zehra.

844
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:50,760
Eat some egg too.

845
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,360
Eat up Zehra, don't be shy.

846
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:05,519
You shot my husband, killed my baby.

847
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,840
I won't show any mercy to you either.

848
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,280
Good morning, mom.

849
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:19,920
What a feast! Enjoy your breakfast, mom.

850
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,880
Good morning, dear. Join me.

851
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,880
Yeah, I'll join you.

852
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,880
I wouldn't want to see those people anyway.

853
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,960
You saw how she caused a
scene last night, right?

854
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,320
And she dares to threaten me, what a brat.

855
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,840
I'll make her pay for those
threats, don't pay any mind to that.

856
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:39,936
I didn't want to drag
it out in front of Ateş,

857
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,200
but I won't let it slide. Don't worry.

858
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,159
She only has evil in her heart.

859
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:48,440
She's Haydar's daughter, it's
not like she could be an angel.

860
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,679
I hope this period is over soon,

861
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,920
and we can be rid of them.

862
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:59,680
Time will pass fast,
don't you pay mind to her.

863
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:00,880
I'll handle it.

864
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:04,440
Come in.

865
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,280
Wow, you're throwing a feast!

866
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:12,240
Why didn't you call me, I'm
starting to feel left out.

867
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,080
Join us, son.

868
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,760
Hello, is this Mr. Ahmet?

869
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:40,120
My name is Mercan Yıldırım.

870
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:43,240
You used to work as a janitor
in Şefkat Orphanage, right?

871
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:47,440
I'm inquiring about a child.
When did you work there?

872
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,239
I worked there up until
I retired five years ago.

873
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,040
Why do you want to know?

874
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:56,600
A boy named Ateş used to live
there, do you remember him?

875
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,760
Ateş? I don't remember any Ateş.

876
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,999
Ateş is a rare name.

877
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,120
Are you sure you don't remember?

878
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,520
This is a really personal inquiry.

879
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,640
Could you think harder?

880
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:13,280
So many children stayed
there throughout the years,

881
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:16,799
it really was a safe haven for children.
I have pictures of all the children,

882
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,400
we would take them at events.

883
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:21,319
I'd maybe remember him
if I looked through those.

884
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,960
"Ateş, look. That's you."

885
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,960
I need to see those pictures.

886
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,439
Maybe Ateş is in one of them,
you'll remember if I point him out.

887
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,679
Sure, if it's so important to you.

888
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,560
Could we meet up now?

889
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,880
Okay. Where exactly is that cafe?

890
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,560
Hold on.

891
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,680
I'm writing it down.

892
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:04,280
Thank you so much. I'll be
there as soon as possible.

893
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:57,160
Zehra? Could you come over for a second?

894
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,839
Yes, Ms. Aslı?

895
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,200
Can you make me some coffee?

896
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,679
I need a little pick-me-up.

897
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,360
Right away, Ms. Aslı.

898
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:17,200
I'll look through my wish list for

899
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,000
my arts and crafts room in the mean time.

900
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,800
Quit whatever you're doing
and make Ms. Aslı some coffee.

901
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,600
Brat.

902
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,920
Did you want something, Ms. Mercan?

903
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,759
I'm just getting some
water before I go out.

904
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,320
I would've brought it to you.

905
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,880
You're busy, I'll get it.

906
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,560
Okay.

907
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,000
Hello?

908
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:22,920
Çiçek, dear?

909
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,880
I'm busy, mom!

910
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,360
Çiçek?

911
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:31,200
Okay, I'm coming!

912
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,080
This is for you, my dear son.

913
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,880
I know you're hiding something.

914
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,800
I'll find out what that is.

915
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,080
What are you doing?

916
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,480
Where are you going this time?

917
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,880
You're keeping track of my
every move, I've had enough!

918
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,000
I don't have to tell you.

919
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:42,160
You do.

920
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,720
And you will.

921
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,400
I won't!

922
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:48,719
I am not your servant,

923
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,680
I'll go wherever I want whenever I want.

924
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,879
Get out of my way.

925
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,920
I won't.

926
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:03,040
I know you're up to something. Where are
you sneaking off to, what are you after?

927
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:06,399
I said I don't have to report to you.

928
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,000
Get out of my way, leave me alone!

929
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:11,000
Aslı!

930
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:27,120
Aslı. Aslı, what happened to you?

931
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,240
Ateş. Ateş help.

932
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:32,440
Ateş, help.

933
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,440
Aslı, my dear.

934
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:37,240
Help.

935
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,120
Help. Ateş. Ateş.

936
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,920
What happened to you?

937
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,600
What happened?

938
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,080
It's divine justice.

939
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,760
Aslı.

940
01:43:55,360 --> 01:44:00,520
When I arrived, she fainted. Please help.

941
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,960
Let's go to the hospital.

942
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:07,680
Aslı.

943
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:13,280
Get out of my way.

944
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:32,880
Watch her head.

945
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
My daughter.

946
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,440
Aslı.

947
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,320
Ateş hurry up. Hurry up.

948
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,120
Oh god.

949
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,640
What happened to this girl?

950
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,400
I didn't understand.

951
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:03,000
We never have a day without incidents.

952
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,400
I haven't seen Mr. Ateş like this.

953
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:07,240
They grew up together.

954
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,840
Mrs. Müzeyyen was devastated too.

955
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,280
You called her heartless.

956
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,320
Can a mother be heartless?

957
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:17,960
I don't know about it.

958
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:21,120
They did everything they could
for Mrs. Mercan after the funeral.

959
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,240
Look how she took care.

960
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,960
That is humanity.

961
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,240
God bless her.

962
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,840
Sit here darling, sit.

963
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,760
Drink it, calm down a little bit.

964
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:58,080
Does she have any illness?

965
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,320
No, she suddenly.

966
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,280
Nothing happens to her, right?

967
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,040
God bless her.

968
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,760
Don't be upset.

969
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,080
Come on, drink it.

970
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,080
Come on, drink it. Come on.

971
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,200
Doctor.

972
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:30,400
Where is the doctor.

973
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:36,920
Aslı.

974
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,320
God, please help her.

975
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,160
Save her.

976
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:57,680
Save her please.

977
01:46:57,681 --> 01:46:59,481
We're in charge from
now on. Please allow us.

978
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:07,440
If anything happens to
Aslı, I can't live Ateş.

979
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,480
I will die.

980
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,520
Nothing will happen.

981
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,040
Aslı is strong mother
Müzeyyen. Don't worry.

982
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:21,120
That won't happen.

983
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,840
God, please save her.

984
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:56,520
The bag was here.

985
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:58,840
Where did they put?

986
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,160
Perhaps it was belong to Çiçek or Binnaz.

987
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,240
It's divine justice.

988
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,040
If you are happy with other's pain

989
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,520
the other's will give you pain.

990
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:16,880
Let's see Müzeyyen.

991
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,520
Now cry.

992
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:21,640
Where is this bag.

993
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:28,160
I was looking for you in this
mansion, what are you doing here?

994
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,520
One of my earrings had fallen
out, and you were looking for it.

995
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:36,680
There's a lot going on in the
mansion, is that your problem?

996
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,080
Yes, the earing.

997
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:41,240
You think that I'll be sorry for those?

998
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,280
My son dies, Haydar.

999
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,680
My pain is enough for me.

1000
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:51,256
If they're looking for someone to share
their problems, let them find someone else.

1001
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:53,720
I didn't exactly mourn
that annoying girl either.

1002
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:55,560
But if they see us like this

1003
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:57,240
pretend like you are sad.

1004
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,280
They're grudging.

1005
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:01,520
Let's not have any
problems with this either.

1006
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,160
Why were you looking for me?

1007
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:05,720
Did you see Mercan?

1008
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:06,800
Yes, I saw.

1009
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:09,200
She went with them to hospital.

1010
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,080
Those who show mercy to their enemies
will be laughed at by their enemies.

1011
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,880
Why are you looking for her?

1012
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,960
Nothing. Company things.

1013
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:25,600
Never mind.

1014
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,040
Where is this bag?

1015
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:17,960
She'll be fine, don't worry.

1016
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:21,320
She is young and healthy.

1017
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:23,680
And.

1018
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,080
She never gives up.

1019
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:31,520
In fact, we came to hospital immediately.

1020
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,040
This is important too.

1021
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,800
Are you that merciful?

1022
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:36,760
Or are you playing a different game?

1023
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:40,800
Aslı is important for me.

1024
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:44,600
If anything happens to
her, I'll burn the world.

1025
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,880
Aslı.

1026
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:50,480
Brother.

1027
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,960
Where is Aslı, is she okay?

1028
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:53,960
They took her to the emergency room.

1029
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,160
God, please nothing happens to her.

1030
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:00,640
I can't resist.

1031
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,240
Doctor's are doing what is needed.

1032
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:04,840
Don't worry.

1033
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,640
Are you relatives of Ms. Aslı?

1034
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,720
We are.

1035
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,160
She was poisoned.

1036
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,000
We did what needs to be done.

1037
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:21,880
There's nothing to worry about.

1038
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,720
No life-threatening condition.

1039
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:30,080
She's doing quite well.

1040
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:32,200
Thank god.

1041
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:33,880
Thank god.

1042
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:38,960
What kind of poisoning is this?

1043
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:40,160
What poisoned her?

1044
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:41,760
We did some tests.

1045
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:44,680
We did the test, we'll talk
again when the results come out.

1046
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Thank you god.

1047
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,280
Get out.

1048
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:07,600
Get out!

1049
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,160
I'm not going anywhere.

1050
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:11,400
Who are you kicking out and from where?

1051
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,080
You'll go.

1052
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:14,480
I'm not going.

1053
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:15,520
What will you do?

1054
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:17,080
Are you going to force me out?

1055
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,720
If there is need, I'll do it. Get out!

1056
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,680
What are you doing here?

1057
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:29,720
How dare you come here?

1058
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:31,160
Did you have fun?

1059
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:32,856
-Mother Müzeyyen. -Did you have fun?

1060
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:33,880
Get out!

1061
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,200
Don't.

1062
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:36,320
You are being unfair.

1063
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:39,240
Don't talk and drive me crazy.

1064
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,839
I said you to get out.

1065
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:41,840
Mother!

1066
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,240
This isn't the place.

1067
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,480
I don't want to see her, she should go.

1068
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:53,920
Let's go.

1069
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:55,640
Otherwise she won't calm down.

1070
01:52:58,720 --> 01:52:59,720
I.

1071
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:02,200
I came here for any need.

1072
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,200
I didn't think about anything.

1073
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,160
I didn't deserve this.

1074
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:07,480
Okay, stop it.

1075
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:09,480
As you see, there is no need.

1076
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:10,360
Walk.

1077
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:11,800
You're rude.

1078
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,480
You should go.

1079
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,880
I.

1080
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:34,600
I just wanted to help.

1081
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,600
As a human.

1082
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:38,360
Like anyone else.

1083
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,200
In such situations, nothing makes sense.

1084
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,760
You can go. You don't have to be here.

1085
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,560
And, the doctor said she'll be fine.

1086
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,680
What kind of poisoning is this?

1087
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:48,760
Caused of what?

1088
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,320
It's hard to say something.

1089
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:52,320
The symptoms seemed suspicious to me.

1090
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,280
We have to wait for the results.

1091
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:56,560
Now I should go.

1092
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,240
Malik.

1093
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,440
The items that we talked before.

1094
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:24,000
Yes.

1095
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,200
They're here, take care of them.

1096
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:27,840
Okay.

1097
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:31,800
Mom.

1098
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,960
Ms. Aslı was poisoned.

1099
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:37,000
I heard when they're talking on the phone.

1100
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:38,800
What poison is this?

1101
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,760
Did something she ate make her sick?

1102
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,760
I won't put anything rotten in the food.

1103
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,240
I don't know I heard this.

1104
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:53,600
What if they pin the blame on us?

1105
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:58,360
Müzeyyen hangs us in the
garden as a warning to the world.

1106
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:02,840
No.

1107
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,480
Everyone ate the same things.

1108
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,400
If something happened to her
it must be for another reason.

1109
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Of course.

1110
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:15,160
It's true.

1111
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:26,760
Did you poison Ms. Aslı?

1112
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,720
Nonsense.

1113
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,880
Why should we poison the poor girl?

1114
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:36,960
Pray that Ms. Aslı hasn't ended up
in the hospital because of your food.

1115
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:39,440
No, that's impossible.

1116
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:41,680
We all eat the food cooked in the kitchen.

1117
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,960
I don't know what you eat or don't eat.

1118
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:48,680
Stop talking and make a
chicken broth for Ms. Aslı.

1119
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:50,360
She can eat when she'll come.

1120
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,240
She's like an enemy to us.

1121
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:01,120
Why are they so angry? I don't understand.

1122
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,040
We didn't understand too.

1123
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:11,560
I shall go and take the items.

1124
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,600
Everyone bullies those they can.

1125
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,360
Hello.

1126
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:44,720
Hello.

1127
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:46,376
I'm Mercan, we have talked on the phone.

1128
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,480
Welcome, sit here.

1129
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:48,920
Thank you.

1130
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:52,960
Did you bring the photos?

1131
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:54,240
Yes.

1132
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:57,240
I looked at all the photos until morning.

1133
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:58,640
I looked for.

1134
01:57:59,000 --> 01:57:59,280
But.

1135
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:01,360
I couldn't remember anyone named Ateş.

1136
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:04,760
How?

1137
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,720
Wasn't Ateş in the orphanage?

1138
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,320
Did he change his name?

1139
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,920
I remembered.

1140
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:14,360
Wouldn't I remember?

1141
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,120
He was the most mischievous
child in the orphanage.

1142
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,360
I was joking with you.

1143
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:21,760
Sorry for that.

1144
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:29,040
I found only this one.

1145
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Did you know?

1146
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:25,520
Look.
Him.

1147
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:27,240
He is Ateş.

1148
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:28,480
Did you remember?

1149
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:30,200
I know.

1150
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:37,440
Thank you very much for your time.

1151
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:39,640
You're welcome.

1152
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:42,760
-Have a good day. -You too.

1153
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:02,520
I'm so sorry. I'm coming with the towel.

1154
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:03,840
I'm coming right now.

1155
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:52,680
What a coincidence.

1156
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:54,520
What are you doing here Mercan?

1157
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,280
Nothing.
I was just walking.

1158
02:01:58,800 --> 02:01:59,960
I know you're being stubborn.

1159
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:01,040
I deserve it.

1160
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:03,360
That plan to kidnap you.

1161
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:07,280
I understand my mistake. Please forgive me.

1162
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:09,840
I did it for your own good

1163
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,520
but wrong is wrong.

1164
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,800
We have a bond, a friendship.
I don't want to lose it.

1165
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,440
You can trust me from
now on, I promise you.

1166
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:26,080
I'm glad you realized your mistake.

1167
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,280
As you said.

1168
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:30,800
Like you said, we're
friends, we have a history.

1169
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,840
But that just makes
your mistake even bigger.

1170
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,376
If you want me to trust you,
you'll really have to work at it

1171
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:38,600
Because it's really hard.

1172
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:40,800
I will.

1173
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:42,800
Give me another chance.

1174
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:48,400
Come on.

1175
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:53,560
I'll drop you home.

1176
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,280
Taxis rarely pass through here.

1177
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:02,320
Come on Mercan.

1178
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:05,000
Without you, how can I
build that trust again?

1179
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:07,680
You need to take a step toward me too.

1180
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:13,120
Okay.

1181
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:07,640
Come.

1182
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,880
Easy.

1183
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:11,080
Be careful.

1184
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:20,880
I have something to do.

1185
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:23,120
Take care of her.

1186
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:28,120
Come Aslı.

1187
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:29,200
Let's not waste time.

1188
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:43,800
Thank you for driving Nezir.

1189
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:47,120
You know that book you gave me once?

1190
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:48,600
I read it.

1191
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:54,320
It was really good.

1192
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:56,480
If you have any other
suggestions, I'll take.

1193
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,840
I'm happy you like it.

1194
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,480
I shall go.

1195
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:08,040
Don't be late for work.

1196
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,680
See you my lady.

1197
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:12,320
I'm always here to help.

1198
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,120
What are you doing with this man?

1199
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:45,480
We ran into the road.

1200
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:46,120
Taxi.

1201
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:47,600
You won't see this man again.

1202
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:49,880
I don't think so.

1203
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,800
I can choose my friends.

1204
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:53,920
But thank you for your interest.

1205
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:55,560
Friend?
What are you talking about?

1206
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:57,800
You're my wife.

1207
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:59,480
You can't have any male friend.

1208
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:00,920
Why not?

1209
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:06,200
Don't test my patience.

1210
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:09,520
You won't see that man
again without my knowledge!

1211
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,040
You love giving orders
to everyone, don't you?

1212
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:19,960
Did they bully you a
lot when you were a child?

1213
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,400
Speak!

1214
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:28,760
Speak you little brat!

1215
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:32,000
I'll make you regret for doing this.

1216
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,520
You.

1217
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:36,960
You make me regret.

1218
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:42,320
You make me regret.

1219
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:44,760
Me.

1220
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:52,160
Make me regret.

1221
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:56,400
Look at that brat.

1222
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:00,360
He make me regret.

1223
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:07,480
When I tell you something I'm not saying it
so we can talk it over and find common ground.

1224
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,000
I'm telling you to do it.

1225
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:11,040
I'm not your slave.

1226
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,240
Call it slavery or whatever you like.

1227
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:16,320
If your surname is Karahan

1228
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:18,880
you have to do what I say.

1229
02:07:19,480 --> 02:07:21,080
You have to do it exactly as instructed.

1230
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:22,840
If I say don't

1231
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:24,160
then don't.
Period.
