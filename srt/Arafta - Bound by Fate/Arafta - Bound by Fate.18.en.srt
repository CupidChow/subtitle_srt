1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,640
Fire!

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,880
-You okay? -Never better.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,960
If you’re hiding something from me...

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,400
I said it’s nothing,
Mother Müzeyyen. I'm fine.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,440
You just won’t die, will you?

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,400
Dad!

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,040
Cemal and Ateş are my sons!

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
If a single hair on their heads is harmed,

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,600
I’ll make whoever’s responsible pay for it.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,400
You botched the job and now
you show up in front of me?

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,640
If it weren’t for Mercan,
it would’ve been done.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,120
Haydar… She can’t know
I’m mixed up in this.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,360
If Ateş keeps pushing,
you’ll have to take the blame.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,840
Sorry, Nezir, but I’m not throwing
myself into the fire for nothing.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Mercan really surprised me.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
She was incredibly brave.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,816
I was surprised too when I
saw her in that warehouse.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,520
Well, that’s the kind of wife
who suits Ateş Karahan, right?

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,840
If it weren’t for Mercan, I
would’ve gotten rid of you long ago.

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,840
You won’t always be this lucky.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,760
Next time, I’ll take your life.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,280
I already knew you and
Nezir were behind it.

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
I planned everything. I did it.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,760
If Mercan hadn’t shown up…

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,560
that woman Müzeyyen would’ve
been praying at your grave by now.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,280
Ever since he came into our
lives, nothing but trouble followed.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
I was taken into custody
for something I didn’t do.

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,240
I was protecting myself.
Protecting my family.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,160
Compared to what he’s done
to us, what I did is nothing.

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,400
If we answer evil with evil,
how are we any different from them?

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,360
I just hope whoever did
this to you suffers worse.

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,000
He will. Don't worry.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,520
Until then, he should enjoy his comfort.

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,160
When Mercan found out, she
took Ateş’s side against me.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,680
Because of that man,

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,160
Haydar Yıldırım’s daughter
stood against her own father.

37
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
His anger seems to have cooled.

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,080
It’s not a radical change.

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,280
Let's say he's more like the lesser evil.

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,160
I’m warning you for the last time.

41
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,440
If you ever try to hurt him again,

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,720
I’ll make you regret being born.

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,640
Ateş was shot, Mom. They didn’t tell us.

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,520
What?! My son was shot?!

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,080
Mercan knows. Everyone knows.

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,320
That girl played us for fools.

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,080
Haydar tested me with my son. Now
I’ll test him with his daughter.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
What are you doing, Mother Müzeyyen?!

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Let me go, Ateş!

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,120
Wherever the Yıldırıms wounded you,
I’ll wound this snake the same way!

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,280
She didn’t hurt me. She
risked her life to save me.

52
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,640
I’m saying this one last time.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,560
Leave her alone.

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,120
She's my wife. Come to your senses.

55
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,480
I can’t stand to see her cry.

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
These…

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Who did this to you?

58
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
This is nothing.

59
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,880
See the scars in my soul.

60
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
What kind of heartlessness is this?

61
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,640
I told you, nothing
about me is your concern.

62
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,680
How can it not concern me?

63
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,280
How can I stay silent after seeing this?

64
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,199
Don’t you think we passed that?

65
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
No.

66
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
We’re still at the same point.

67
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,480
But...

68
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
But, anyone would...

69
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,160
Don’t speak.

70
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,280
You wouldn't understand
even if you wanted to.

71
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,400
Wouldn't see even if you wanted to.

72
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
Wouldn't hear even if you wanted to.

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
So forget about me.

74
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,360
Try telling me.

75
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,280
Maybe I’ll understand.

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,040
How could I tell this much pain?

77
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,360
I thought you only had invisible scars.

78
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,880
It's so much more than that.

79
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,080
What did you go through?

80
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,920
From what bottomless pits...

81
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
What hell did you rise from?

82
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,960
Who did this to you?

83
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Who?

84
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,960
I've just told you everything.

85
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,520
I did it because of Zehra’s
pressure, to protect the people I love.

86
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,360
Malik, please forgive me. Let’s make peace. I
just want us to be happy again, like before.

87
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:29,040
How could you do such a thing, Çiçek? Did we go all
through that just because of some ridiculous threat?

88
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,320
How could you make such a decision without
telling me? I just can't believe it.

89
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
I really can't believe it.

90
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,120
If you were struggling, shouldn’t
you have come to me first, Çiçek?

91
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,200
Do you know what I've been through?

92
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Do you know how much pain I’m in?

93
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,240
When I believed what you said...

94
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,936
Do you know what happened right here?

95
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,760
You're right, you're very
right. But I suffered too.

96
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,559
When Zehra threatened me,
I didn’t know what to do.

97
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,839
You should have known, Çiçek. You
should have known we stand side by side.

98
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,240
Not Zehra, even if we had the whole world
against us, we were going to stand together.

99
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,760
The only thing you had
to do was to trust me.

100
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,640
You can't go like this.

101
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,280
Do you think I didn’t suffer?
Do you think I wasn’t hurt?

102
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,840
Do you know what it's like to say “it’s over”
to the person you love more than your own life?

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,280
When nothing is actually over?

104
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
Malik.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,840
Don’t do this.

106
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Don't you know me?

107
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Don’t you really know me?

108
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Seems like you don't.

109
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,120
You don't trust me.

110
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Without trust, there is no love, Çiçek.

111
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,640
You destroyed everything
at the slightest breeze.

112
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,960
How are we supposed to go on now?

113
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,920
These...

114
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Who did this to you?

115
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,600
What kind of heartlessness is this?

116
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,440
How can I stay silent after seeing this?

117
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Who did this to you?

118
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,680
I will destroy you, Haydar.

119
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,400
Who are you?

120
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,360
It's me.

121
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Are you okay?

122
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
It's nothing. I'm fine.

123
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,320
What you say goes.

124
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
What about the stones?

125
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,160
We don’t have anything yet. We turned
Nezir’s room upside down, but found nothing.

126
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,840
Maybe we underestimated him.

127
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,560
He’s worth exactly what he
weighs: nothing. Don’t worry.

128
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,280
Keep digging.

129
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
Also, what about the movie surprise?

130
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,920
It’s not a surprise.

131
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,640
I mean, it’s just something
for what she did. It’s a gesture.

132
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,840
Like I said, whatever you say goes. Everything is
ready. Just give the signal, and leave me the rest.

133
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,720
Appreciate it.

134
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,080
What happened to you?

135
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,240
You're going to be sick. Come.

136
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,840
Come.

137
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Come.

138
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Would you be very upset?

139
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know, maybe I would.

140
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
You don't hold back your words, as always.

141
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,280
What am I going to do with you?

142
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,440
If you keep acting like this...

143
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,960
You'll bring your own end.

144
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,600
You don't even need an enemy.

145
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
Take care of yourself.

146
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Nothing will happen to me.

147
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,640
I have you.

148
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
You'll save me.

149
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,440
Now I understand why you build
thick walls around yourself.

150
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,880
Your fierceness, your harsh attitudes,
your unwillingness to form bonds...

151
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,680
And, of course, don't
forget about the grumpiness.

152
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,080
It’s all because of your fragility.

153
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,120
They hurt you a lot in the past.

154
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,920
Now, by hurting others...

155
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,600
You are trying to protect Ateş,
maybe even trying to reverse those days.

156
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Last I checked, you didn't
have a psychology degree.

157
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,240
Keep your observations to yourself.

158
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,520
I just care about you...

159
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
What makes you think I care?

160
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,040
Show your mercy to the ones who need it.

161
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,720
Don’t waste it on unnecessary people.

162
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Especially the grumpy ones.

163
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,440
Hello?

164
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,720
Hi, what's up?

165
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,240
What do you want?

166
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,560
I just wanted to check. You
were a bit tense last time.

167
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,840
If you had harmed Ateş, you
would have seen the tension.

168
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,520
So, what do you say? Yes or no?

169
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
To our partnership.

170
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,280
Reluctantly, yes.

171
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:02,320
But if you ever try to hurt Ateş, I won’t waste
time going after you. I’ll shoot you immediately.

172
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,680
I’m not even mentioning
what I’ll do to Mercan.

173
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,240
Okay, I didn't even touch the man.

174
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,280
You couldn't, even if you wanted
to. Watch your step from now on.

175
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,160
Cemal… When did you get here?

176
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,880
Just when you were giving that 'watch your step' lecture to
the poor guy on the phone. Why is your temper flaring up again?

177
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,000
Is it possible to live
in peace in this mansion?

178
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,920
So? Are we not going out?

179
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,040
Ateş and Mercan won’t be going to the company
today. They’ll have guests at the mansion.

180
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,120
Guests?

181
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,960
Who are they?

182
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Who are these guests?

183
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Wait, you’ll understand soon.

184
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,800
You don’t have to wait much longer.

185
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,960
Greetings. -Greetings to you.

186
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,320
Aunt Güllü. -My sweet dear.

187
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,840
Welcome.

188
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,320
Welcome.
- Thank you, thank you my beautiful girl, thanks so much.

189
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,360
My dear girl, my dear...

190
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,800
My beautiful girl.

191
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,360
Why didn’t you tell me before?

192
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,960
He didn’t have time, busy dealing with us.

193
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,320
I lost count of how many
times he called since morning.

194
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,440
When he heard the roof was leaking, he immediately
started repairs and sent a car to pick us up.

195
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,040
Thank you, child.

196
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,280
Our visit was a bit sudden, not
something planned or scheduled.

197
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,520
What’s this? Did Ateş hire new staff?

198
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,679
Aunt Güllü, welcome.

199
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,480
Dear, dear, thank you. -Thank you, child.

200
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Thank you.

201
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,239
I kept you standing from
shock. Let’s go inside, please.

202
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,640
Please. -Thank you, child.

203
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
Please.

204
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,480
Who are they?

205
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,920
How do I know?

206
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,640
Who comes and goes is unclear.

207
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,000
Your girl is really playing
house now, Haydar. What’s going on?

208
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,680
She’s past the age for playing
house. It won’t last long, don’t worry.

209
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,120
Please, come in.

210
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,240
Welcome. -Thank you dear.

211
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,240
No, it's not necessary, please keep them.

212
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,440
Okay, dear.

213
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,040
Thank you.

214
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,520
Your house is very beautiful. Mashallah.

215
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
May God keep you happy here.

216
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,400
May you always live in good days.

217
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Amen. -Amen.

218
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
Please, come this way.

219
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
Please have a seat.

220
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,960
Here?

221
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:32,200
Yes, please.

222
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,440
Are you hungry? Or shall we
serve tea and coffee first?

223
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,200
Don’t flutter around like a
little bird, child, just to serve us.

224
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,360
We were already happy just
seeing you. Right, Durmuş?

225
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,480
That’s right.

226
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
People need each other.

227
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,560
Everything else is just an excuse.

228
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,519
Sit, my child, sit.

229
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,200
Please. -Sit.

230
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,200
Mashallah, you two are one of a kind.

231
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,760
Look at the young man,
he’s been busy all morning.

232
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,680
Nowadays, no one wants
to be of help to anyone.

233
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,120
None.

234
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,800
Everyone’s busy with their own troubles.

235
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,800
But look at you children.

236
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,840
You approach with compassion.

237
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,440
Mashallah. You don’t just care about
yourself, you care about others too.

238
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Bravo, children.

239
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,320
May God reward the beauty of your hearts.

240
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,560
Talking about hearts, I think some
of them were broken before we came.

241
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,280
Let me tell you something.

242
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
Give your hand, dear. And you too.

243
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:43,240
Even if you’re upset with each other, don’t let go of
each other’s hands. Making up will be easier that way.

244
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,960
I’ll better get you some water.

245
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,839
I have to make a business call, I'll be right back.
- Okay, child.

246
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,080
Okay, child.

247
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,920
Looks like a spanner
got between them, Durmuş.

248
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:42,840
It was good we came. If they
help us, we should help them.

249
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,000
They are younger, inexperienced.

250
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,120
Let’s not leave without
reconciling them first.

251
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,080
You’re right, Güllü.
What did Yunus Emre say?

252
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:03,640
“I did not come for the dispute. My work is for love. The
house of the friend is in the hearts. I came to build hearts.”

253
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,200
How beautifully said.

254
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,440
Right...

255
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,400
Good morning.

256
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,760
Zehra, are you okay?

257
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,200
I'm okay, thanks. You are very careful.

258
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,880
You are very kind.

259
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Thank... You're welcome.

260
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,040
Well, well.

261
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Is something up with her?

262
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,720
Or is it me?

263
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
I don't get it.

264
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Whatever.

265
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,240
Good luck.

266
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,040
Thanks.

267
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,840
Why didn’t you tell me
that you paid the loan sharks?

268
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,760
Who? Me? No way.

269
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Man... Don’t stammer, Malik.

270
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,560
I went and found out everything
myself. It's confirmed.

271
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,520
Fine, it was me, I accept it.

272
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,280
How did you find that much money, man?

273
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Well, I had some money saved up in the corner. Forget about it. Weren’t
you the one saying, “Just enjoy the grapes, don’t ask about the vineyard”?

274
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,920
That's not how they say it.

275
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Anyway...

276
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,360
By the way...

277
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,840
What kind of corner is that? A bottomless
pit like a well, with money gushing out?

278
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Friends first.

279
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,880
I mean, I can work and save money again.

280
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,640
But how will I find a friend like you?

281
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,960
Malik, I honestly don’t
know what to say brother.

282
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,280
I'm really embarrassed.

283
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,440
Really...

284
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:20,440
Not at all. Come.

285
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
Man...

286
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,240
No one has ever done something
like this for me before.

287
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
Thank you.

288
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,760
Always, brother.

289
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,240
But I promise.

290
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,640
I will pay it back.

291
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,480
Never mind it. We solved the
problem; that’s what matters.

292
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,240
No, I can't.

293
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes, my pockets might be empty now, but I’ll
pay you back as soon as they’re full. I promise.

294
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,520
Okay, okay, but on one
condition: it stays between us.

295
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,520
Are we good?

296
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
We're good.

297
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,640
Good.

298
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,800
You're actually a real man.
How do you say "man" in Arabic?

299
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
"Zalame."

300
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,040
You're the "Zalame."

301
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,240
You too. -You're a "Zalame."

302
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,400
Got a cloth? Let me help. -Yes, come.

303
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,360
"Zalame." -Stop it.

304
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,479
"Zalame."

305
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,760
Wipe it good.

306
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,279
Don't worry about it.
- I've been washing it for hours.

307
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,880
Don't even worry.

308
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,520
It was really exhausting to find the tickets, I
checked everywhere, and I can't even go to the concert.

309
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,120
I mean, I was working on the reports, yes.

310
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,160
Okay.

311
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,520
Dear Burak.

312
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,600
Let’s complete the last project’s documents
and send them to the departments by tomorrow.

313
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,440
Okay, Ms. Zahide.

314
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,560
I'm hanging up... -Yes, okay.

315
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,079
Please don't forget, you always do.
- Don't worry.

316
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,600
Good day, Ms. Zahide.

317
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,000
You look very elegant again.

318
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,240
Patience...

319
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,200
One day I’ll break my tooth trying to make
her smile. That woman is cold as a fridge.

320
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,880
Hi. Urgent work came up. We won’t be
able to go to the construction site today.

321
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,680
No way.

322
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,120
Okay, we can go another time then.

323
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,880
Let's schedule.

324
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Sure.

325
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,800
What is it, Burak?

326
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,720
Well, Mr. Yaşar, it was important,
so I just kind of got hung up on it.

327
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,720
Sure, yes, I'm sure it's how you say.

328
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,040
Take these tickets now.

329
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,480
Consider it a treat from Yaşar.
Invite the girl to the concert.

330
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,360
What's this?

331
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,040
Ticket.

332
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Won’t it be awkward?

333
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Why would it be? Listen to your brother, I know these matters
pretty well. Women like confidence, so go ahead and invite her.

334
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,560
Say it so?

335
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,160
Go and invite her.

336
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm going?

337
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,160
Go on, you silly.

338
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,840
Are you sure?

339
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,440
Fine, I'm going.

340
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Demet.

341
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,400
Yes?

342
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,840
Would you...

343
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,400
Would you like to go to a concert?

344
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,880
Concert?

345
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,920
Yes, concert.

346
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,960
Which concert?

347
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,400
Burak, you're such a funny guy.

348
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,160
But it's really good.

349
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,720
We would have so much fun
partying, it would be nice.

350
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,640
I think we should go.
Look, I have the tickets.

351
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,880
Let me think, okay?

352
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,480
Demet, we will go crazy,
the place will fire up.

353
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
It's going to be so fun.

354
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Fine.

355
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Come on, they are waiting for
you. What are you doing here?

356
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
The guests are outside.

357
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,480
I have a small matter.
I’ll be there in a bit.

358
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,640
You’ve helped Durmuş and
the others a lot, thank you.

359
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,240
And thank you for inviting
them. It really helped me.

360
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,120
You don't need to thank me.

361
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,440
I didn’t do it for you.

362
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,120
Okay, I take back my thanks.
Don’t let it bother you.

363
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,080
Actually, I came here for something else.

364
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
About what happened at night.

365
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,560
They belong to the night.

366
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
There’s nothing to talk about.

367
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
But I have things to say.

368
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Close the topic now.

369
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,080
Sometimes you don't know where to stop.

370
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
I...

371
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,400
I didn’t mean to invade
your privacy, sorry.

372
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,920
Lately, all the balances
in my life have been shaken.

373
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,240
I realize I was ignorant
of what I thought I knew.

374
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,080
I got hit from the
places I trusted the most.

375
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,960
Now I can’t even tell
what’s right or wrong.

376
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,000
It was...

377
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,280
Wrong to talk to you about that.

378
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
But my intention wasn’t bad.

379
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I just...

380
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,480
Thought that we were both very alone.

381
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Anyway.

382
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,920
I just wanted to say I
didn’t intend to hurt.

383
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,880
Anyway.

384
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,400
Let's not keep the guests waiting.

385
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,600
I thought I’d make the rubber, but
my hand keeps going to the stockinette.

386
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,960
Stockinette is easier.

387
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,880
You'll make it very fast.

388
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,639
Sure, yes. -Very nice.

389
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,039
Just to keep me busy. -Yes, of course.

390
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,200
Here you go.

391
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,240
Thank you.

392
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Thank you, my dear.

393
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,680
Did you break up with your
lover, what’s with that face?

394
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,120
No, I don't have a lover.

395
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,400
No, if she had one, I would know.

396
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,560
If your daughter had a lover,
you wouldn’t have known.

397
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,360
Young ones hide their
hearts from their mother.

398
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,200
But the heart?

399
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,640
It always finds a way to speak.

400
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,760
For instance, look at Ateş and Mercan.

401
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,840
They try to hide it, but
they clearly have a problem.

402
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,080
They are not like how
they were in our house.

403
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,080
It’s as if this big mansion
has gotten between them.

404
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:32,320
But even the highest mountain
is a speck of dust against love.

405
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,000
Let me tell you a story.

406
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,120
Once in Tabriz, there lived
a poor young man named Garip.

407
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,400
He played the saz and sang folk songs.

408
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,920
One day, Garip sees Şahsenem
at the window of the mansion.

409
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:08,360
Their hearts ignite at first sight.
Their love spreads by word of mouth.

410
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:19,840
But Şahsenem’s father does not want to give his daughter
to a poor poet, he betroths her to a wealthy man.

411
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Garip cannot bear what he hears and sets out on a journey.
He will earn a lot of money and return to marry Şahsenem.

412
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:42,200
Months, years pass. One day, news
of Şahsenem’s wedding arrives.

413
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,800
Garip raids the mansion
on the wedding night.

414
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Şahsenem says in front of everyone that she will marry no
one but Garip. The groom goes mad with rage, guns are drawn.

415
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,200
The wedding turns into a bloodbath.

416
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,280
Did they die without uniting?

417
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,600
No power can separate two lovers
whose hearts beat for each other.

418
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:28,160
They have made their love a balm for their wounds.
Whoever stood against them, they overcame. Even death…

419
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,120
They suffered greatly.

420
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,560
But they did not surrender to separation.

421
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,920
Just look at all these romances.
There are so many stories as well.

422
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,240
The coffee is great, my child, thank you.

423
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,840
Enjoy.

424
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,320
So, what do you do other than this?

425
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,200
Well, I do some knitting
when I have free time.

426
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,359
My daughter helps me as well.

427
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,440
Mashallah. Mashallah.

428
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,039
May God bless their lives.

429
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
Amen, amen. -What can I say?

430
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,119
May God never leave anyone alone.

431
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,600
Amen.

432
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:23,240
She’ll have her fate too.

433
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,560
Hopefully, her time will come too.
- Inshallah. Inshallah

434
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,880
Inshallah.

435
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,840
Come on, smile.

436
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,080
Well, I really like this place.

437
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,760
The interior splendor isn’t really
my style, but the greenery here is.

438
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,360
So, Ateş child, how are you?

439
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,160
I’m fine, Uncle Durmuş.

440
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,680
But tell me what’s inside… Not just words.

441
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,120
Nothing important...

442
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,000
Just daily life.

443
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
I understand...

444
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,000
Let me tell you something.

445
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,280
Sometimes the poison of love
is better than its medicine.

446
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,120
Every marriage has arguments
and fights, all of them.

447
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,880
But the one who loves from the heart doesn’t
say “it must be me,” they say “it must be them”

448
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,680
Tell me, do you love from the heart?

449
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,240
Of course, one loves from the heart.

450
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,560
Yes, that’s how it is. It should be so…

451
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,880
It will be, of course.

452
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,760
Even if the tongue cannot speak, what
passes through the heart shows in the eyes.

453
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:08,480
One cannot hide love, anger, or hatred.

454
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:35,360
You and your spouse have a certain state.
You can’t hide it. It shows in your eyes.

455
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:44,400
You both were shining in the
village. What happened? Tell me.

456
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,800
I think I broke his heart, Aunt Güllü.

457
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,680
Girl, what’s easier than that? If
you’ve hurt a heart, soften it first.

458
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:09,960
They say the way to a man’s heart is through the
stomach. Make him something with your own hands.

459
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,400
What does your husband like the most?

460
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:29,480
Well, girl, you know nothing.
Didn't your mother teac you anything?

461
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:37,520
Pray Güllü aunt is here.
I’ll handle your problem.

462
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,480
We’ll handle it, right? -Of course we will.

463
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,040
What a smell... Is that lentil?

464
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,760
I was about to bring it to you.

465
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,560
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

466
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
I know you’re hungry.

467
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,720
I also know you love this soup very much.

468
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,720
Why are you doing this?

469
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,320
Why won’t you let me make it up to you?

470
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,520
Nothing will be the same, Çiçek.

471
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,920
It will either be worse or better.

472
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,440
But it will never be the same.

473
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:53,560
We couldn’t get rid of Ateş. As if that wasn’t
enough, their marriage also started to get strange.

474
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,240
Inviting guests and all…

475
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,080
Nothing will come of that marriage.

476
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,200
When the time comes, Ateş will get the hell out
of our lives. I’m just waiting for that day.

477
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,800
They will eventually divorce.

478
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,960
But what bothers me is something else.

479
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:19,920
You took responsibility for the incident but Ateş still keeps someone
in the mansion, who tried to abduct and kill him. Isn't that strange?

480
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,880
Nothing surprises me about that man anymore.
But don't think that it doesn't bother me.

481
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:33,360
No, that man won’t stay still. He has always done
it. He will do it again. But what will he do?

482
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,720
I said it from the beginning,
that man is dangerous.

483
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:46,040
I already had serious doubts about why he appeared in our lives. But
he’s so cautious, so planned, it’s like he knows every step I will take.

484
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,120
I realize that. I keep
changing my path too.

485
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,760
If I am Haydar, I’ll solve it, Nezir.

486
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,320
But I need to straighten myself a bit.
And that goes through money, you know that.

487
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:18,200
Hello Cemal, what happened with the ingredients for the chocolate cake you were
supposed to get for me? You know Ateş loves it, he’s been craving it for a long time.

488
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,760
No, don’t buy it ready-made.

489
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,600
He doesn't like it, He wants homemade.

490
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,840
No way. Well I have to go now.

491
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,120
Anyway, I'll do it later.

492
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,160
Okay, fine. Bye.

493
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:49,000
What are you looking at, girl? Your husband loves chocolate
cake, didn’t you hear? Come on, quickly to the kitchen, come on.

494
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,720
I think I can.

495
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,240
Inshallah. May God give
you ease. Come on then.

496
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,680
Come on.

497
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,000
Will you laugh like this
when you see Ateş’s reaction?

498
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,320
Well, it turned out a bit
wonky, but I think it tastes good.

499
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,160
- It's surely delicious.
- I'm sure it's good.

500
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,400
You’ve got a good touch, my
girl. I’m sure it turned out great.

501
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,400
What’s this, all tiny and small?

502
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,360
Mercan girl made it.

503
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,160
I wish you had ordered it.

504
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,600
It doesn't look like a cake.

505
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,120
Every part tilts to a different side.

506
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,680
Mrs. Nermin.

507
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:31,560
The taste comes from the love put into it,
not the shape. It's for those who understand.

508
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,920
Those who don’t, only care
about the shape, not what's inside.

509
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,240
I should check on my Durmuş.

510
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,160
What does she think she is?
Shape? What's that nonsense?

511
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,120
If she's a guest, she
should know her manners.

512
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,440
I think she spoke well,
for those who understand.

513
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,720
Do what you want.

514
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,960
It’s the perfect
love-puppy moment, exactly.

515
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,840
If you’re feeling generous,
see your own family too, girl.

516
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,960
Your father is very upset
because you are not speaking to him.

517
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,760
I’m even more upset, mother.

518
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,520
He's your father.

519
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,960
All we have is each other, not anyone else.

520
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,760
Instead of playing house in the
kitchen corners, pull yourself together.

521
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,640
You’re making a cake for
a man who poisons our life.

522
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,520
Not a funny joke at all.

523
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,640
Run all you want.

524
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,960
Stay silent as you want.

525
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,360
But I know, I am in your mind and heart.

526
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,840
I’ve learned my lesson.
Enough Malik, please forgive me.

527
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,360
I will forgive you with my
mouth if it changes anything.

528
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
But with my heart...

529
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,880
Never mind, Çiçek.

530
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,439
You tell me you broke up, then go behind my
back? Just wait till I tell Mrs. Müzeyyen.

531
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,680
Go tell her.

532
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,960
But I'm sure...

533
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:39,680
But I’m sure Mrs. Müzeyyen won’t be as angry about my
relationship as she is about yours with Mrs. Nermin.

534
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,760
What are you saying? There's no such thing.

535
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,160
See?

536
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,239
This, this was...

537
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,440
Shut up.

538
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:02,480
Threats aside, if I ever catch you giving me a sideways
look, you will have to explain this to Mrs. Müzeyyen.

539
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,880
Where is the flour on your face?

540
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,080
Did you expect me to
stay like that forever?

541
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,880
Let it be known, there’s something
called water. It washes everything away.

542
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,280
I'm very curious.

543
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,960
Which food couldn’t you cook?

544
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,160
Seeing my failure would
have made you happy, right?

545
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,800
But you’ll be very disappointed.

546
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,520
I can't wait for it.

547
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,480
Wait a minute.

548
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,120
Our guests came after a long
time, you can't go without a jacket.

549
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,880
I don’t think they value such things.

550
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,160
They probably don’t value
perfume either, but you wore it.

551
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:50,840
Also, the jacket doesn’t make you more
valuable, it only makes you look nicer.

552
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,240
And our guests are people
who deserve this care. Right?

553
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,240
So you think the jacket
makes me look nicer?

554
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,560
No, I said it because our
guests deserve the care.

555
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,800
This is better. Wear this.

556
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,400
Yes.

557
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,040
Seriously, why are you taking
it off like that right away?

558
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,560
You should have noticed me,
I would have turned my back.

559
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,600
Can you help?

560
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,080
Why?

561
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,760
My arm hurts a bit.

562
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,960
My arm hurts a bit.

563
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,120
Can you button it up for me?

564
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,760
Well, I...

565
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,800
It's done.

566
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,120
Hold on.

567
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,280
Don't forget the jacket.

568
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,680
Turn around.

569
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,360
Also, don't forget the handkerchief.

570
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,080
I think this one will be better.

571
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,760
Now it’s done.

572
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,520
Say so?

573
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,800
Give me your hand, child. You too.

574
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,800
No. I mean, yes it's fine.
Anyway, I'm going down.

575
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,640
What am I doing?

576
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,280
What is this, Ateş? Pull yourself together.

577
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:19,680
Indeed, cities have good sides too, but if
you want to breathe, it must be the village.

578
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,880
Exactly.

579
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:29,960
Here, everyone works excessively
and the crowd is overwhelming.

580
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:39,440
The city is a place to run… Who knows what anyone is running for. Stop
one of the runners and ask them, even they don’t know where they’re going.

581
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:50,800
Same from me, Uncle Durmuş. When you go out for
breath, someone comes and says "That breath is mine."

582
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,440
We don’t even know why we
live. One’s soul gets tired.

583
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,320
Do you know what rests the soul best, son?

584
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,600
The most innocent gift
God gives us. A baby.

585
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,880
This mansion also needs that
beautiful gift, huh? What do you say?

586
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,520
A baby is the joy of the home.

587
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,920
A home with children is abundant,
without children it’s like a grave.

588
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:12,480
Bring a baby into this house, and even the coldest
hearts would turn warm. They’d become so soft.

589
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,760
Destiny...

590
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,360
We want it.

591
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,880
May God reward the beauty of your heart.

592
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,080
Amen. -Amen.

593
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,600
Right, my wife?

594
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,480
Of course.

595
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,000
Durmuş, I didn't like them.

596
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:19,359
Those with stingy eyes… You'll
see, they have evil in their minds.

597
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,040
God forbid. God forbid.

598
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,280
Inshallah.

599
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:30,720
Mashallah, your daughter is very well-intentioned,
very lady-like, how well you raised her.

600
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,720
Indeed.

601
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:40,920
Indeed, but sometimes she shows
goodwill to everyone, deserving or not.

602
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,560
It’s clear Zehra didn’t interfere
with the food. No taste, no salt.

603
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,760
There is taste and salt, but no oil.

604
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:02,960
The food isn’t swimming in oil today, maybe
that’s why it didn’t suit your palate.

605
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:12,400
Today in the kitchen we had some work with Mercan, my
daughter. We took over a bit. That might have disturbed things.

606
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:25,040
But is it worth it? Yes it is. Mercan girl prepared
a nice surprise for her husband with her own hands.

607
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,040
What is that surprise?

608
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:44,200
Mercan girl, go and bring
it, let them see the surprise.

609
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,160
Okay.

610
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,080
The horror movie starts soon.

611
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:23,240
I finally got your
favorite cake, look sister.

612
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:50,920
See, sister? I promised. It took a
while but brothers keep their word.

613
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,800
Go on, taste it.

614
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,079
Let go of my sister. Let her go.
- Brother. Brother.

615
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,920
Go away. Go.

616
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,320
Brother. -Let go of my sister.

617
01:11:55,040 --> 01:12:02,000
Eylül. Let her go. Bring
my sister back. Eylül.

618
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,000
Let go of my sister, bring her back.

619
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,960
Eylül.

620
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,320
Let go of my sister, bring her back.

621
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,280
What does this mean?

622
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,920
What happened?

623
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,880
Why?

624
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,360
I'm sorry, I don't know what happened.

625
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:16,080
Girl, you really prepared a surprise for just the
right man. What would he know about surprises?

626
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,600
What did you just do?

627
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,120
Are you going to tell
me what happened? Speak.

628
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,640
Not now.

629
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,960
Not now?

630
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:22,680
Are you aware of what you just did? You don't have the right to
humiliate me in front of everyone. It was very rude to the guests too.

631
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,920
I told you not now.

632
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:38,320
Look, I'm really trying to understand. Did I do something wrong to
you? At least tell me that, because I don't get it. What happened?

633
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,456
Is it about something you experienced in your
childhood? That brought you to this state.

634
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,200
Enough, Mercan.

635
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,640
Enough.

636
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,160
Stop digging my past.

637
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,360
It's none of your concern.

638
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:19,960
What's in your past? Why are you so angry?

639
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,880
Ateş, are you okay?

640
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,640
I'm fine.

641
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,760
Eventhough I don't look like it, I am
fine. Cancel that cinema thing, Cemal.

642
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,119
But everything was ready.

643
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,200
Cemal.

644
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:46,320
Listen to me. You’re angry right now. Let's wait for you to calm down.
I won’t cancel it in the mean time. Think again after you're calm. Okay?

645
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,120
Sorry for what just happened.

646
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,760
Please forgive.

647
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,800
It’s okay, my son, Don’t trouble yourself.

648
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,000
There must be a reason. But you
upset my Mercan girl very much.

649
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,040
Shh, woman, shh.

650
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,759
We’ll talk tomorrow, son. Okay?

651
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,760
Good night.
- Good night, may God give you a peaceful rest.

652
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,200
I keep upsetting her, even
though she has no fault at all.

653
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,320
Malik. Malik, please wait.

654
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:06,920
I know you’re very angry, and you have every right to be. But I was really
scared, not just for myself, but for you too. Mrs. Müzeyyen could have fired you.

655
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:14,160
Believe me Çiçek, I wouldn’t
have cared at all about being fired.

656
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:23,360
Look, I promise. Zehra will never be able to
bother us again. I will never allow it again.

657
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
You could have done it before, Çiçek.

658
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:32,440
But I couldn't, I told you I was scared.

659
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:40,200
Believe me, when I left you, my heart
bled. I thought about you every day.

660
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:48,840
When Zehra blackmailed you, you should have come to
me and told me everything, just like you did now.

661
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,440
I'm sorry.

662
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,920
I have to go.

663
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,360
My mother is waiting.

664
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,240
But we will see each other, right?

665
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,080
See you.

666
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,680
I wonder if he went through
bad things at the orphanage?

667
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,440
Why won’t you tell me the truth?

668
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,520
There’s nothing to tell.

669
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,160
I think there is.

670
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:14,040
The scars on your back,
your reaction to the cake…

671
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,680
You had a hard childhood, didn’t
you? Was it at the orphanage?

672
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:30,160
Look, this isn’t fair. You know everything
about me. But I know nothing about you.

673
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:38,600
I’m trying to reach you but
you keep building walls around you.

674
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,320
I’m not your enemy, I
just want to understand.

675
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,400
You just can't keep quiet.

676
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,360
Leave me alone, and be quiet.

677
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,880
Why are you so cold, so cruel?

678
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,880
Maybe you’re not as strong as you seem.

679
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,280
You’re just trying to protect yourself.

680
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,280
No.

681
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,800
No.

682
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,200
No.

683
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,320
You’re making too much noise.

684
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:56,720
Don’t think you can defeat me, Çiçek. I’ll
hit you from where you least expect it.

685
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,680
Why did you try to ruin
my relationship with Çiçek?

686
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:23,560
You can’t interfere in people’s lives like this. I never
gave you any hope, yet you tried to pull Çiçek away from me.

687
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,520
There can be nothing between us.

688
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,880
I know.

689
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,320
I know.

690
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,400
I realized that I actually
feel nothing for you.

691
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:41,440
What I did was wrong. But I value you, Malik. I was
sincere in what I said before, you’re not like the others.

692
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,439
You deserve someone better than Çiçek.

693
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,480
I decide that, Zehra.

694
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:53,160
In time you’ll understand that I’m
right. But it will be too late by then.

695
01:27:53,400 --> 01:28:01,400
It doesn’t concern you. It doesn't concern you at all.
From now on, you’ll stay away from me and the woman I love.

696
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:14,720
If I don’t make you pay dearly for every word
you’ve said to me, then don’t call me “Zehra.”

697
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,200
Cemal.

698
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,640
Can we talk?

699
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,960
Of course.

700
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:40,080
I know you’re close with Ateş. You’re
one of the people who know him best.

701
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:47,680
It’s obvious he had a difficult
childhood and couldn’t get over it.

702
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:54,040
The way he threw the cake last
night, the wounds on his back…

703
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,520
I...

704
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:00,600
I'm trying to understand
but he won't tell me.

705
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:06,640
Wait Mercan, did I get it right?
You expect me to tell what Ateş didn't?

706
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,560
Mercan. -I mean...

707
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:09,960
No.

708
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:20,040
How about this, Mercan: I’ll act like I never heard the
question, you act like you never asked it, and we drop it.

709
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,960
I don’t want to be misunderstood. I just…

710
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:27,360
If Ateş wanted to tell, he would.
Sorry, I have work I need to take care of.

711
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,920
Cemal is right.

712
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,400
If I wanted to tell, I would.

713
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,640
What do you want to know?

714
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:52,840
That I suffered in pain as
an orphaned, parentless child?

715
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:58,240
Countless children grow up
under harsh conditions like me.

716
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,680
I’m not going to pity myself.

717
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,240
Stop digging into my life already.

718
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,680
I don't intend to stop.

719
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,520
I will definitely learn what you
went through, to understand you.

720
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,800
Good morning, folks.

721
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,880
Good morning. -Good morning.

722
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,440
So, how are you inshallah Mrs. Zahide?

723
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:04,600
Thank you, Yaşar. I’ll be better hopefully if I wake up
to a day where I’m not exposed to your sarcastic remarks.

724
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:09,200
God forbid. If such a day
comes, you'll upset me the most.

725
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,640
How dare you?

726
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,600
Better note it down.

727
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:23,320
So, young ones, how was the
concert? Did you have fun? Tell me.

728
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:27,520
We don’t know how it was.
Because we couldn’t go.

729
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,280
What? Why couldn't you go?

730
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:33,840
Ask Burak.

731
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,800
What did you do? Ditch her? -Good morning.

732
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:45,880
No, I forgot the tickets in my pants pocket and threw
them into the washing machine. They became unusable.

733
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:56,480
Washed the tickets? How could
you do that? You are really clumsy.

734
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,000
What am I to do? She’ll
never talk to me again.

735
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:10,720
It’s not that bad. We’ll find a way to make
her forgive you. We'll find a way, somehow.

736
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:15,560
But first we need to keep you away from
machines, especially the washing ones.

737
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,600
Brother Yaşar, buy me a coffee.

738
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,680
Fine, lead the way.

739
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,320
Good morning. -Good morning.

740
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
Aunt Güllü?

741
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,080
Why are you tiring yourself? Go and rest.

742
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:01,840
I’m not used to being served by
anyone, my girl. I can’t stay idle.

743
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,400
Why do you look so down?

744
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,760
Is it still because of last night?

745
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,760
Whatever I do backfires, Aunt Güllü.

746
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:24,960
You saw it with your own
eyes. There’s nothing I can do.

747
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,640
Ateş is so hard to reach.

748
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:34,320
Come help me, it’ll clear your head.

749
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,040
Let’s knead dough together.

750
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,480
Knead dough? -Yes.

751
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,320
Didn’t your mother teach you?

752
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:52,880
No, she didn’t. She doesn’t know it anyway. When we were in the
village, I kneaded dough with you, but you had prepared everything.

753
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,720
Fine, girl, I'll teach you.

754
01:33:55,960 --> 01:34:03,240
First, adjust the yeast and the sugar.
Let’s see how it rises with your hands.

755
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,600
How much sugar should I put?

756
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,840
In our village they
say; dough is made by eye.

757
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:23,320
If the yeast rises, the marriage rises too. If it doesn’t, the
marriage fades away too. Well, you set it with that in mind.

758
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,920
Let's see.

759
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:37,880
Well done, well done. Tie your hair back.

760
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,760
Let's see.

761
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,000
Now, set it.

762
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,760
Alright, good.

763
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,160
Well done.

764
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,440
Water.

765
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,920
Well done, well done, good.

766
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,080
Alright.

767
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,720
See that?

768
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,560
Well done, well done.

769
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,520
I don’t believe in such things.

770
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,840
I also don’t think the
dough will rise anyway.

771
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,200
It will, it will.

772
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,280
Anyway.

773
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:15,040
If I’m going to pin my hopes
on dough yeast, shame on me.

774
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:45,560
Brother. -Let her go.

775
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,720
Drop. I told you to drop it. -Leave her.

776
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,640
No. Go away.

777
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,800
I'm trying to reach you,
but you keep building walls.

778
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:01,280
I’m not your enemy, I
just want to understand.

779
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,240
If we’re not enemies, then what are we?

780
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:12,120
What you want to understand is my limbo.

781
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:51,160
I was looking for you. You heard my
conversation with Mercan, didn’t you?

782
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:53,720
I heard it.

783
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,120
She won’t give up.

784
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:01,200
It’s normal for her to
be curious. Anyone would be.

785
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:07,200
It's my mistake. I made her curious.

786
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,680
First the scars on my back, then this.

787
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,360
I couldn't keep my composure.

788
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:21,960
We can't change it. Is there
anything I can do for you?

789
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,840
No, thanks.

790
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,560
Why are you upset?

791
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:36,080
I’m upset because we couldn’t find those stones. The men searched
everywhere, but nothing. Nezir could get rid of the stones at any moment.

792
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,320
This is not good.

793
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:42,440
He's making plenty of money from this.

794
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:48,080
What he has right now is also quite a large
amount. We definitely need to prevent the sale.

795
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,280
Could he have put them in a bank vault?

796
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,520
I don’t think so.

797
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,320
Illegal, untaxed money.

798
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,040
I’m sure he keeps it close.

799
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:11,240
Let’s keep searching. Let them look under every
stone. Let’s not skip any place. We must stop this.

800
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,080
Otherwise, what he's
done will go unpunished.

801
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:28,560
When are these guests going to leave,
Mom? Both of them are very boring.

802
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:36,920
Especially that Güllü, the woman
thinks she’s some kind of angel of love.

803
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:43,040
I have no idea, my girl. If it weren’t
for Ateş, I’d throw them out immediately.

804
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,080
What is it?

805
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,440
Why are you upset, son?

806
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,200
Nothing.

807
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:24,560
Honestly, I missed my
village in just one day.

808
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,200
Nature, the soil…

809
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:32,720
I just took a little walk around
the house and it refreshed me.

810
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,720
Even if it’s not like your
village, it’s green here too.

811
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,560
The air is clean.

812
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,560
Or did you get bored on the first day?

813
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:50,400
Of course not. You hosted us
beautifully, son. May God bless you.

814
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:55,080
After a certain age,
one always longs for home.

815
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,560
I think you shouldn’t leave
your garden unattended too much.

816
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,920
Okay.

817
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,000
Enjoy it.

818
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,280
Mercan, did you make all of this?

819
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,280
Look at her, acting like it’s a big deal.

820
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,760
Hope you enjoy.

821
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,000
Here you go, Uncle Durmuş.

822
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:31,480
Thank you, child.

823
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:32,520
Enjoy.

824
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,200
Aunt Güllü.

825
01:42:43,201 --> 01:42:44,760
Thank you, child. -Here you go.

826
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,840
Enjoy.

827
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,120
Cemal.

828
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:06,280
Thanks Mercan.

829
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,520
Enjoy.

830
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:21,680
I don’t want any.

831
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,480
I don’t want any either, I’m on a diet.

832
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:33,760
Fine.

833
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:46,520
If you keep eating things
like this you’ll gain weight.

834
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,440
Fine, your stomach tolerates it.

835
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:06,840
I’m one of the lucky ones. No
matter what I eat, I never gain weight.

836
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,040
It's right.

837
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,240
I’ve witnessed it a few times.

838
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,960
Thank you, it's very delicious.

839
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,560
I’ve never eaten anything
this delicious before.

840
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,760
Because Mercan girl kneaded the dough.

841
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,880
And it rose very nicely.

842
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:33,240
God willing, the yeast of your marriage
rises like this too, and becomes abundant.

843
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:08,560
Chew it well, girl. Nobody is chasing you.

844
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,400
Okay.

845
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:35,560
Mom, the kitchen smells
wonderful. You've made wonders.

846
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:45,360
Berat, the money paid to that loan shark weighs on
my heart, my son. I keep thinking about who paid it.

847
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:50,760
Look, son, sleep left my
eyes, peace left my soul.

848
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:59,720
Son, our deceased come into my dreams every night.
They all say the same thing, “Pay your debt.”

849
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,200
The debt is paid and gone, my dear mother.

850
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:08,120
There’s no need to worry anymore.

851
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,399
Tell the deceased too, let
them not come into your dreams.

852
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:16,000
God forbid. How could that be?

853
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:27,280
Let's find whoever paid the debt. May God bless
them, but we need to pay back. A debt is a debt.

854
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,600
Telling me to talk to
the deceased, God forbid...

855
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,320
I cared about you, Mom.
It doesn't bother me at all.

856
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,600
Berat.

857
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,680
What is it?

858
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:19,520
It's nothing.

859
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:26,480
I came and stood here. I’m looking
at the garden like you. Can’t I look?

860
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:30,240
You can, but it's obvious something's up.

861
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,600
You’re blaming me.

862
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,040
Come on, tell me.

863
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,520
Don't hold it in.

864
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:44,520
I guess I make myself too obvious.

865
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,320
And you understand it right away.

866
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:52,600
I could even write a thesis
about you. Let me put it that way.

867
01:48:55,480 --> 01:49:00,040
If you know me that well,
why don’t you trust me?

868
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,480
Why would I?

869
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,240
Our conversations are always like this.

870
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:15,440
I ask you something, you either answer
with a question or immediately snap back.

871
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:19,360
I can even predict what you’ll say.

872
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:26,400
"Why should I do it?" "I saw fit." "I wanted
it that way." "It doesn’t concern you."

873
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,800
You’re constantly building walls.

874
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:35,720
If you know the answers,
then why are you asking?

875
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:43,000
See, another question
again. No answers ever.

876
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:48,000
Every time I say maybe this time
he’ll talk and say something but…

877
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:51,760
Perhaps I don't want
to respond dishonestly?

878
01:49:53,240 --> 01:50:00,400
I already understand that part. You just like your lonely
cowboy attitudes. You don’t want anyone to heal your wounds.

879
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,800
Are you the one to heal?

880
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,000
Another question.

881
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:16,640
You’re really rude. I just cared about you.

882
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,360
So it’s not curiosity?

883
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:24,760
It's because you care.

884
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:37,880
I know it’s hard for you to share what you’ve been through.
No matter how much I try to understand, I know I can’t fully.

885
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,680
I just want to touch your wounds.

886
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:47,360
I don’t know, I want you
to trust me, to share with me.

887
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,760
I want to be the solution maybe.

888
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:56,920
I know...

889
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:02,240
It might be a little selfish,
but I only think about you.

890
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,480
Do you trust me?

891
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I’m trying at least.

892
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,480
You don’t even do that.

893
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,800
Because both the wound...

894
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,120
And the remedy are in me.

895
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,320
Do whatever you want.

896
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:35,520
If I do, I do.

897
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:38,160
Fine. -Fine.

898
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:47,200
You’re actually a coward, you know that?

899
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:53,960
You’re constantly playing it evasive.
That’s why you answer like this, snap back.

900
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:04,440
There’s someone broken
inside you. You hide him.

901
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:18,480
You’ve created a limbo for
yourself. You locked yourself in there.

902
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:27,480
In the unbearable attraction of loneliness…
Trying to look mysterious, cooler and all that…

903
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:35,200
You stay there deliberately.

904
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:43,000
Because you know if you let someone
in, they’ll take you out of there.

905
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,360
Staying there feels safer to you.

906
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:02,600
You want no one to touch your wounds.

907
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,560
You want no one to care about you.

908
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:15,600
Fine, let it be that way
then, consider I never asked.

909
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:21,680
Are you done with your psychoanalysis?

910
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,360
For now.

911
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:31,000
But I’ll work on it more. Actually, I’ll write a
thesis about you. Let the whole world benefit from you.

912
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:35,160
That’d be good. At least there’d be a purpose
to you wandering after me pointlessly.

913
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:38,320
Since you’re so obsessed with me.

914
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:41,400
I’m not obsessed with you.

915
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:47,240
That’s not how I understood it, honestly.
You’ve thought about me quite a lot again, look.

916
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:55,320
Fine. It’s you. Only you are strong. You are
the one. Live happily alone in your limbo.

917
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,600
Do you want to come in?

918
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:15,520
No.

919
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:20,320
I just want you to come
out of there once in a while.

920
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:26,840
I want you to allow those who try to help.

921
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:32,440
I want you to trust
someone once in a while.

922
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,320
Where are the stones?

923
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,680
Somewhere safe.

924
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:07,600
But where?

925
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,440
Leave that to me.

926
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:12,520
Nezir, don't you trust me?

927
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,360
Half of them is mine, it's my
right to know where they are.

928
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,640
You'll get your share when it's
time, Haydar. Until then, be patient.

929
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:26,680
Stop talkin nonsense, Nezir, I
want to make sure they are safe.

930
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:30,280
I took the blame for you for those stones.

931
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,400
Did I make myself clear?

932
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:35,160
Fine, don't get angry, I'll tell.

933
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,959
What's up? Could you get it?

934
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,760
Great, thanks. -Thanks.

935
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:51,640
Cemal.

936
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:53,160
What is that?

937
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,560
I had ordered a few things.

938
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:57,560
Tell me what it is.

939
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:00,000
It’s nothing important, Aslı.

940
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:05,560
Give it to me, let's see what you hide.

941
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,320
Cemal.

942
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:14,360
What are these? -Aslı please give it back.

943
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,000
This is a kid's movie, Cemal.

944
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:19,320
Are you hiding it because
you’re embarrassed?

945
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:21,120
They're not for me, Aslı.

946
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,720
They're for Mercan.

947
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:29,600
It was meant as a thank you
for helping us find Ateş, but...

948
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,640
As a thank you? For Mercan?

949
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,640
You’ve really started to lose your minds.

950
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,680
Her father is the one who kidnapped Ateş.

951
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:44,720
What "thank you"?

952
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,520
You were both almost killed.

953
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:50,800
And now you’re preparing a
surprise for that man’s daughter?

954
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:00,200
What’s going on? Why are you shouting?

955
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:06,320
Gentlemen are preparing a
surprise for Mercan for saving Ateş.

956
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,680
They’re going to thank the lady.

957
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:11,440
God, I'm going to lose it.

958
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,480
Well, It’s not like that...

959
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,280
Enough Cemal. You go inside.

960
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:34,760
Calm down, girl. You’re right, this time you’re
right. This situation has started to make me sick.

961
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:42,520
Mom, I was always right, but you didn't listen. Ateş
has completely immersed himself in this marriage game.

962
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:50,800
Last night I was saying “Okay, now he’ll stay away from this
stupid girl,” But no, it didn't end, and it will never end.

963
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,840
It will never end until we
completely get rid of that girl.

964
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:58,640
Are you still seeing that man called Nezir?

965
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:03,120
Well...

966
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:08,840
I...

967
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:15,240
Clearly you didn’t listen to me. Anyway...

968
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:23,920
In that case, it’s time for
Nezir to finally be useful.

969
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,360
Whatever I do backfires.

970
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:58,400
It’s clear he has wounds in his past.

971
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,360
When I say tell me, he doesn’t tell.

972
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:11,000
If I accidentally touch one of
those wounds, all hell breaks loose.

973
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:15,320
It’s very hard to understand men.

974
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:19,240
It’s hard to understand women.

975
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:25,120
Especially such a grumpy one.

976
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,120
Especially the aggressive kind.

977
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:35,480
Their curiosities... Their stubbornness...

978
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:39,240
Especially Mercan…

979
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:50,120
The more I tell her to don’t
do it, the more she does it.

980
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:54,440
And the more she comes at
me, the more I lose my mind.

981
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,320
Then it becomes “Ateş got
angry, he lost his temper.”

982
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:09,280
Actually I’m not someone who talks this much. I
don’t know what happened, I can’t stop talking.

983
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:16,320
Look, I don’t have much know-it-all
wisdom. But there’s one thing I know.

984
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:22,040
If you want to keep a smile on your face, make
sure your wife’s heart is happy all the time.

985
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:25,840
That’s what I do, I swear it works.

986
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:38,160
You’re worrying about her sadness.

987
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:44,120
You regret hurting her.

988
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:54,000
Mercan girl’s heart is very
beautiful. Know her worth, young man.

989
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:55,440
Look.

990
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:59,400
My knowledge is deep.

991
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:04,280
Now, don’t take offense at what I say.

992
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:09,560
What I see is there’s an
unending anger inside you.

993
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:17,720
Whoever the cause is, save your
anger for its owner, not for Mercan.

994
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:25,400
She protects you like her own eyes.

995
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:32,160
Me?

996
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:56,200
Everyone has a shell, my girl. The porcupine’s
quills, the lion’s claws, all for protection.

997
02:01:57,400 --> 02:02:05,400
But know that all of them carry a soft heart inside. We
think they’re wild, they’re just protecting themselves.

998
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:12,640
Beneath Ateş’s hardness,
there’s a heart full of compassion.

999
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,400
I understand people from their
eyes. He values you very much.

1000
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:23,240
Me?

1001
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:31,720
Elders didn’t say for nothing that sweet
words can even draw a snake out of its hole.

1002
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:45,680
There’s no wall love can’t tear
down, no obstacle it can’t overcome.

1003
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:54,760
You’ll tear down those walls
one by one with patience and love.

1004
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:03,160
Don't forget these words, you'll see.

1005
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,280
Çiçek.

1006
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:03,000
What’s going on with you, my girl? One moment you’re
cheerful, the next you’re walking around as sad as a funeral.

1007
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:06,720
Should we take you to a doctor?

1008
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:09,880
No Mom, I’m fine.

1009
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,280
Does someone go to the doctor
just because they’re down?

1010
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:21,520
I don’t know, my girl, everyone goes to a
psychologist and such, that’s what came to my mind.

1011
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:30,440
Çiçek, this troubled state of yours… Is it from the
weight of your heart or is there something else?

1012
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:36,080
Look, girl.

1013
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:44,520
My children’s happiness comes before everything for me.
Both you and Berat should know, I'm always by your side.

1014
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:50,200
Knowing that you and Berat are
happy is worth the world to me.

1015
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,760
Don't be sad, girl.

1016
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:55,280
My mom.

1017
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,600
My dear mom.

1018
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:13,440
What's up, Berat?

1019
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,600
Fine.

1020
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:19,320
I’m fine. How are you?

1021
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:22,640
How could I be, I’m very tired.

1022
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:26,160
Mrs. Müzeyyen doesn’t let me breathe.

1023
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:30,560
Because of her, sometimes
I break your heart too.

1024
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:33,200
Please forgive me, Berat.

1025
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:41,760
Of course, it’s fine, Zehra. What’s the problem? I mean,
you're just carrying out orders. I understand you very well.

1026
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:43,840
Right?

1027
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:46,840
Did you come to get something?

1028
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:48,240
Me?

1029
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:53,440
I was going to get some water.
- Wait, I will...

1030
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,240
I’ll get it for you.

1031
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,240
That's enough, thank you.

1032
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:14,840
Sorry for the bother.

1033
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,160
No bother at all.

1034
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:20,600
Enjoy.

1035
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,400
Thank you.

1036
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:26,920
I should drink it.

1037
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:33,800
Are you okay?

1038
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:42,520
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm really fine.

1039
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:49,160
It’s time for Mrs. Müzeyyen's medication. If
it’s even a minute late, she goes mad with anger.

1040
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:51,640
See you, Berat.

1041
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:03,600
I think she also has feelings for me.

1042
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:15,880
Is he going to make a surprise for Mercan?

1043
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:19,200
But this man pushes Mercan
around at every opportunity.

1044
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:22,240
Where did this surprise come from?

1045
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:29,040
This isn’t going anywhere good, Nezir. It’s
like they’re getting a little closer every day.

1046
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:35,200
Mercan going to save Ateş was not good at all.
Ateş started to feel gratitude toward her.

1047
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:40,920
I should have taken advantage of the
opportunity while I had it. He was going to die.

1048
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:49,240
Not that much. I warned you before, if you do anything to Ateş, I’ll
burn Mercan too. I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t forget that.

1049
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,520
You don’t forget this either.

1050
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:03,800
No matter how much Ateş mistreats her, she doesn’t leave his side. He humiliated her in
front of the guests the other day but the girl still doesn’t take a stance against Ateş.

1051
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:08,720
Whatever we do backfires. I’m sick of it.

1052
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:12,640
Mercan is very soft-hearted.

1053
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:17,720
She always finds a reason
to treat someone well.

1054
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,760
It's not because she's crazy about Ateş.

1055
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:23,800
A full demonstration of stupidity.

1056
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,440
We have to do something.

1057
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:31,640
Of course we will, but
we must act together.

1058
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:37,840
Let's start by ruining tonight’s
plan. I’ll tell you what you need to do.

1059
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:09,720
It wasn’t easy to come here.

1060
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:13,720
I still can’t forget what
happened the last time I came.

1061
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:16,240
I know.

1062
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:19,680
I hurt you, I broke your heart.

1063
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:24,040
But, just know that you
were always on my mind.

1064
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:28,320
I regret very much leaving
you without fighting.

1065
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:58,040
If you want, let’s stand in front of my mother together. Let’s overcome everything
together. I can’t bear losing you, Malik. Please don’t turn your back on me.

1066
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:06,480
I won’t let you go anymore.

1067
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:16,159
Look what I made for you.

1068
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:18,360
What are these, Çiçek?

1069
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:21,280
You're also very talented. -Cake.

1070
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:24,360
I made you a cake, there's
an orange one there as well.

1071
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:28,560
This one is chocolate.
- All of them is beautiful. How will I finish?

1072
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,720
What I wanted to say…
- What I wanted to say…

1073
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:36,800
You go first.

1074
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:39,560
No, please go first.

1075
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:42,360
I'm so sorry.

1076
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:45,520
I pushed you too much.

1077
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:54,760
I should have been understanding when you didn’t
want to talk, but my intention was only to help.

1078
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:04,560
I thought that if you shared, maybe
your burden would lighten even a little.

1079
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:13,080
And this is my bad habit, taking
other people’s troubles as my own.

1080
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:20,120
My mother gets angry at me for this reason.

1081
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,520
What were you going to say?

1082
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:30,960
Be at the mansion at 10 p.m.

1083
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:35,200
Don't go anywhere. In my study room.

1084
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:38,200
Why?

1085
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:42,360
Be there. Don't ask questions.
