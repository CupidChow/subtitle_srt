1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,279
If you don't have any money, ask your wealthy son-in-law.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,200
If you're too prideful and can't ask for the money,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,960
I will ask him myself, no problem.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,400
And I'll tell him about you,

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
Thank you for bringing me here, Nezir.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,640
I'm the one who called.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,959
It wasn't in vain when I said I'm always with you.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,000
You ask and I do. That's our deal.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,959
You've brought nothing but trouble for everyone,

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,520
especially Mercan, since you showed up.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,560
But you'll leave.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,640
For good.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,640
Wow, you never miss, huh?

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,840
Haydar wouldn't have gone there for no reason.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,080
You called right on time. We were just about to leave.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,200
We barely made it, brother.

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
Haydar was on his way.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,360
Ateş asked me to look into someone named Tahir Aslan.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,360
And I did my part.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,559
I looked into him.

21
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,920
Yes?

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,760
Tahir...

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,680
He was in a car accident ten years ago.

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,800
If we don't keep an eye on him he'll ruin each and every one of us.

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,240
And how will you manage to do that, brother?

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,720
What can you do, Haydar? Will you have me killed?

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,359
Rıza is a money hungry man.

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,120
All he cares about is money. He'll stop talking if you pay him enough.

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,440
I don't think he'll tell Haydar anything

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,960
for now because he's trying to get money.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,400
You're reckless, reckless.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,960
The Tahir Mercan is looking for, has been under her nose all along.

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,800
And that Tahir became her husband but my niece has no idea.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,880
Do whatever you want.

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
You're reckless.

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,880
Your dad said your uncle has disappeared.

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,200
I've done a little research.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,320
Your uncle is at this address.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,359
The meeting's about to start.

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,520
You'll go later.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,160
Later won't do.

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,120
My uncle has been gone since yesterday.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,280
Why would my uncle be somewhere like this?

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
Let's go back.

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,760
There's no one here.

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,760
Uncle!

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Mercan, my dear niece.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,800
The Tahir you're looking for...

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,400
It's been years since they left here.

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,440
They were good people.

51
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,880
Esma was very skilled.

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,840
She could do any job.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Selim was also very hardworking.

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,720
He worked tirelessly

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,560
to provide for his family.

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,280
They lived for their children.

57
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,440
They were poor but happy.

58
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Nothing else comes to mind.

59
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,360
I'm old.

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
Why are you looking for them, girl?

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Eylül and Tahir

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,120
are my old friends.

63
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,200
Do you know where they went? Do you know any of their relatives?

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,400
They had no one. No one ever came or went.

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,280
They worked in one place anyway.

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Wait.

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,640
This belonged to Esma.

68
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,640
She had forgotten it.

69
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,400
I've kept it as a memory ever since that day.

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,200
Keep it with you from now on.

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
Thank you.

72
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
Mom.

73
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,800
Don't mind him.

74
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
He has something urgent to do.

75
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Don't worry.

76
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,920
Thank you very much.

77
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,480
Mrs. Binnaz is still nowhere to be seen.

78
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Berat's permission really worked out for her.

79
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,880
She got away with it nicely.

80
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,440
You're just doing the bare minimum anyway.

81
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,760
Mrs. Nermin, they haven't fired you from your job yet.

82
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
Thank God Malik isn't like you.

83
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,840
He's very hardworking

84
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,200
and disciplined.

85
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,680
I think it's good that you broke up.

86
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,520
He couldn't have done it with a lazy person like you.

87
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Enough.

88
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
You haven't given us any peace since you arrived.

89
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,920
You've criticized everything we've done.

90
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,920
You separated me from the man I love.

91
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Isn't it enough?

92
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,480
What more do you want from us? Our lives?

93
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,760
What are you doing? Let me go. Are you crazy?

94
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,680
What's your problem?

95
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,400
Tell me.

96
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Jealousy?

97
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,840
Malice?

98
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
Why this hatred and this anger?

99
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
Didn't they love you at all?

100
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,520
Didn't they ever wrap you up in their love?

101
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,200
Is that why your heart grew so dark?

102
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,960
Don't mess with me.

103
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Get off me.

104
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm going to rest for a bit.

105
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
How did it go?

106
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Did anything bad happen?

107
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
We need to talk.

108
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Son.

109
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,400
You don't seem happy. Did something happen?

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,440
Did that girl upset you?

111
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
No.

112
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
What did you do?

113
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,880
We couldn't find anything.

114
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm saying.

115
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,840
Maybe we're looking in the wrong place.

116
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,840
Maybe the USB belongs to Mercan.

117
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,200
I think we shouldn't rule out that possibility.

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Aslı is right.

119
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
She's Haydar's daughter, after all, you'd expect anything.

120
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I don't think so.

121
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
She was very close to his uncle.

122
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,680
He gave it to her to keep safe.

123
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
You should look for anyway.

124
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,240
What have you got to lose?

125
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,360
Let's not waste time.

126
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,200
Keep investigating Cemal.

127
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,520
Let's reach out to people Rıza knew.

128
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,360
Let's look at the places he frequented.

129
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Çiçek look.

130
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,560
Malik didn't leave me alone again, did you see?

131
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,920
He even brought me some pastry.

132
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,840
He knows exactly what I like.

133
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
That's great.

134
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,880
Enjoy brother.

135
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
But don't get involved in such things again.

136
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Thanks.

137
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Thank you son.

138
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,520
You came out in the middle of your work.

139
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Çiçek.

140
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,120
Make some tea.

141
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,800
Put some pastries next to it.

142
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
No.

143
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,400
I'll go now.

144
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
No way.

145
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
What happened?

146
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,440
You even withheld God's greeting from one another.

147
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
Are you angry with each other’s?

148
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
No.

149
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,840
I shall go now.

150
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,840
Hospital visits should be brief.

151
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,800
Don't stand up.

152
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,320
-No. -Don't stand up.

153
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Don't brother.

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,040
Thank you. I'll come again.

155
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,080
Come again, son.

156
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,120
Goodbye.

157
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Goodbye.

158
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,440
I want to eat some.

159
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Çiçek.

160
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,160
Make some tea.

161
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,960
Put some of them so that we can eat.

162
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Okay.

163
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Mom.

164
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,600
I missed you.

165
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,640
My sweet-smelling mother.

166
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,840
It's been years since they left. They were very good people.

167
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,360
Esma was very skilled.

168
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,280
She did everything.

169
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,920
Selim was very hardworking.

170
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,000
They lived for their children.

171
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,720
They were poor but happy.

172
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,000
Maybe we're looking for it in wrong place.

173
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,560
Maybe it belongs to Mercan.

174
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
I don't think we should rule out that possibility.

175
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,760
What's up in the middle of the night?

176
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Did you find it?

177
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Where did you find it?

178
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,680
Where did that really come from?

179
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
I was right, wasn't I?

180
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
No way

181
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Mercan?

182
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
I told you.

183
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Father's daughter.

184
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,000
Of course she'll cover up his crimes.

185
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Let's see what's inside.

186
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Let's take a look.

187
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,480
Aslı you're going too fast. We couldn't see.

188
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,120
There is identity.

189
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,800
What are you going to do when you see it? A bunch of IDs.

190
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,960
Honestly, I feel sick.

191
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,520
I'll look at the money flow file. That's what matters.

192
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,080
A lot of money.

193
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
That's it.

194
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
I think so.

195
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,120
I'll send it to our computer whiz right away.

196
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,360
Let's stir things up a bit. What do you say?

197
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Okay.

198
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Good morning.

199
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,720
What happened?

200
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Did something happen?

201
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,720
Why aren't you talking? Answer me.

202
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,280
Get ready and come down for breakfast.

203
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
Get ready and come down for breakfast.

204
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Unstable.

205
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,920
Where are you going?

206
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
I'm Berat's friend.

207
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,920
I want to talk to your boss.

208
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
He is Berat's friend.

209
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Let him in.

210
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Sit. No.

211
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,240
Did that cowardly friend of yours send you?

212
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
No.

213
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,800
Stay away from Berat.

214
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,520
If you hurt him again,

215
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
you'll have me to deal with.

216
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Well.

217
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,280
He must have eaten a brave heart.

218
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,160
Berat's debt is my debt now.

219
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,480
I'll pay it down to the last penny.

220
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
That's fine with me.

221
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,960
But I'm warning you.

222
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,160
You'll pay that money within two days.

223
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,960
Or I'll take your face off.

224
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,120
I'll pay it

225
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,560
And you won't touch Berat.

226
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Okay?

227
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
So be it.

228
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
Everyone is brave heart.

229
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,400
Would you like some honey, mom?

230
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Okay, give it.

231
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,880
I want to sweeten my mouth. I have a good appetite today.

232
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,280
I saw this this morning.

233
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,800
Since we're all together,

234
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,920
I wanted you to know about this scandal too.

235
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,080
Shocking allegations about renowned businessman Haydar Yıldırım.

236
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,680
Years of human trafficking have been proven with documented evidence.

237
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,400
The personal information of hundreds of people who were victimized by him has been accessed.

238
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Hatice Demir.

239
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,480
Süha Demir.

240
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Ayça Demir.

241
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Esma Aslan.

242
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Selim Aslan.

243
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Tahir Aslan.

244
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Eylül Aslan.

245
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Zuhal Tamer.

246
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Ferit Taştan.

247
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Replay it.

248
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Esma Aslan.

249
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Selim Aslan.

250
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Tahir Aslan.

251
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Eylül Aslan.

252
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Esma Aslan.

253
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
Selim Aslan.

254
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
Tahir Aslan.

255
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Eylül Aslan.

256
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
What are you doing?

257
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
What the hell are you up to?

258
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,080
What kind of monster are you?

259
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,880
-Ateş. -Get off my dad.

260
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
-Get off my dad.

261
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,560
I didn't do anything. This is slander.

262
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,040
What kind of monster are you?

263
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,960
How many people have you killed?

264
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,400
How many lives have you wasted?

265
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,456
How many more sins are hanging around their necks?

266
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,360
Get off me.

267
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,520
Tell me.

268
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Get out.

269
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
All of you.

270
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
-Get out. -Get out.

271
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Come on. Come on.

272
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,561
We'll learn everything, just keep yourself under control.

273
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,160
It's not time to burn.

274
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,520
It's not time to burn Cemal.

275
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,440
It's time to set fire.

276
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,680
If there's anything I don't know.

277
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,240
If Haydar had a hand in about my parents' death.

278
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
That man will taste

279
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,040
the worst kind of death at my hands.

280
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Esma Aslan.

281
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Selim Aslan.

282
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,720
Enough.

283
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,800
Calm down Haydar.

284
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,360
What will happen now?

285
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,080
We've embarrassed ourselves in front of everyone.

286
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,080
Hey won't get away with it.

287
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Dad, what's going on?

288
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,120
What's this news?

289
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,200
It's not true, is it?

290
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,640
How true. It's all lies.

291
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Lie.

292
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Character assassination.

293
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Don't you see?

294
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Dear.

295
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,000
What kind of question is that?

296
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,280
Don't you know your father?

297
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,280
What business do we have with such things.

298
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,080
They throw mud and hope it sticks.

299
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
No.

300
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,600
It can't be true.

301
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,000
But whether we believe it or not doesn't change anything.

302
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,616
Everyone is talking about it. That's a very serious accusation.

303
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,680
I'll call my lawyer.

304
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,160
I'll sue everyone who shares this news.

305
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,800
I'll shut down their channels.

306
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,360
Look. They're calling.

307
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Hello.

308
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,200
What is that?

309
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,920
We've been humiliated.

310
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Of course.

311
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,200
They're all talking about.

312
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,080
We're talking about dozens of dead people.

313
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,360
The last thing we should be thinking about is being humiliated.

314
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,520
I'm afraid to look.

315
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
God.

316
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,040
How?

317
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,240
What else are you hiding from me.

318
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,440
What hiding? I don't understand what you're saying?

319
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,880
I just learned these things too.

320
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,560
I'm surprised you can lie so well.

321
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,880
Your father killed dozens of people.

322
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,040
And you know nothing about it.

323
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,000
Smart when it suits you, naive when it suits you.

324
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Bravo.

325
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
These are.

326
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,936
These are just allegations. My father wouldn't do such a thing.

327
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,280
Don't defend that murderer to me.

328
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,000
We won't defend him to you, but to the court.

329
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,080
Then you'll understand that my father is innocent.

330
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,240
I trust people's conscience more.

331
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,200
When I listen to my gut, you know what it says?

332
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,800
That man is a murderer.

333
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
No.

334
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,720
Such a big mess can't stay hidden.

335
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,960
Even if nothing else, people would smell it.

336
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,520
You know I'm telling the truth.

337
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,120
You know your father is a murderer.

338
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,520
You're defending him.

339
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,040
If the allegations are true

340
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,480
I'll be the first to confront my father.

341
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,000
But what do you expect me to do now?

342
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,880
Execute him without trial?

343
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
I won't do that.

344
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,520
You never stop, you're amazing.

345
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Take a break.

346
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Thanks, but no.

347
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,840
Have one of these cookies and then decide.

348
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
They're an energy bomb.

349
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,400
What's ten minutes going to hurt?

350
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,480
There's too much to do.

351
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Thanks.

352
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
You eat the cookie.

353
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,000
Berat's work is left to you too.

354
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,600
I'm really sorry. He was lying down.

355
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,600
He wasn't much use when he was up either.

356
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,480
I'll tell Mrs. Müzeyyen

357
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
and send him away.

358
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,080
Let's get someone better.

359
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,880
Then you won't be so tired.

360
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Don't.

361
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,240
Don't do this.

362
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,560
Berat is like my brother.

363
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
If anyone hurts him, it's like they hurt me.

364
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Don't.

365
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Of course.

366
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,976
I wouldn't dream of messing with anyone's livelihood.

367
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,880
I was just thinking out loud about how I could help you.

368
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
I care about you.

369
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,880
I have to take these.

370
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,360
Good luck to you.

371
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,320
Run away, see how far you can get.

372
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
How did this happen?

373
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,200
How did we not see my family on the list?

374
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
It's my fault.

375
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,480
We skimmed through it and skipped that part.

376
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,880
What a disgraceful family.

377
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,440
They're rotten.

378
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,040
Don't worry Ateş.

379
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,240
Whatever happened, we'll find out.

380
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,600
Of course you feel bad seeing them on that list.

381
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,880
What are my mom and dad doing on that list?

382
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,280
Are there other things I don't know about?

383
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,600
I can't wrap my head around.

384
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
What does this mean?

385
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,560
We'll look into it and find out.

386
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
Don't worry about it.

387
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,280
I can't stop wondering what happened to them.

388
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,360
My parents stayed on that last day.

389
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,280
Just like every other day.

390
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
An ordinary day.

391
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,520
They dropped us off at school.

392
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Eylül.

393
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,920
Before going into school,

394
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,320
we would turn around and wave to our parents.

395
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,760
That day, it turns out, we were parting forever.

396
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,280
Those were the last smiles.

397
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,760
It was also the last happy day of my life.

398
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,400
We waited for hours after school.

399
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,120
Nobody came.

400
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Neither my mother

401
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
nor my father came.

402
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,240
Haydar's men came instead.

403
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
They took us to the mansion without saying a word.

404
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,840
Rıza told us my parents had died in a car accident.

405
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
So suddenly.

406
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,680
Then they locked us in the basement.

407
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,200
Days later, Haydar took us to a grave.

408
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
We hugged the earth and cried.

409
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,920
How did my mom and dad die?

410
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,440
Did I believe a lie?

411
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
You were a child, Ateş.

412
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,280
What else could you have done?

413
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,320
And you were innocent.

414
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,160
Since you weren't tainted by filth like them, evil never crossed your mind.

415
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,480
I'm going to have my parents' graves opened.

416
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
And Eylül too.

417
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,560
This is terrible.

418
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,640
That Rıza

419
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
has nowhere to sleep.

420
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,040
He's lumped everyone together. How we can get out of this.

421
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,440
Let's go abroad, Haydar.

422
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
No way.

423
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,480
Then we'll have accepted everything.

424
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
I'll take care of it.

425
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
How?

426
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
How do you?

427
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,080
The same way I did before.

428
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,400
Just don't panic and stir things up.

429
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,840
Don't do anything without telling me.

430
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Okay.

431
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,840
Whatever you say.

432
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,800
As long as we get out of this.

433
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,120
I'll find out if it was Rıza who got us into this mess, or if someone else is involved.

434
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,080
I'll find out.

435
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
The lawyer.

436
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,720
Hello.

437
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,280
Mr. Haydar. I've finished the meetings.

438
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,120
You need to go to the prosecutor's office and give a statement.

439
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
What statement?

440
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,560
Let's go before they issue a summons.

441
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,760
It will give a more positive impression.

442
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,240
Fine, I'll be out shortly.

443
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,320
You gather the team.

444
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,920
You'll have the graves opened and the autopsies performed.

445
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,800
We'll handle it our way.

446
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Alright.

447
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Dear.

448
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,040
The torment never ends because of the lightning.

449
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,480
Is this necessary, son?

450
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,840
We should have left the deceased in peace.

451
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,560
Now you have so much grief too.

452
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,200
I have to find out the truth, Müzeyyen mother.

453
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,000
Until now, I accepted what Haydar said as true.

454
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,640
I directed my life according to him.

455
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
But now.

456
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,160
Everything could change.

457
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,600
What if the people in the graves

458
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,720
are someone else?

459
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
What if my parents,

460
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,880
if Eylül didn't die?

461
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,200
Alright. Whatever makes you comfortable.

462
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,960
The men will return to us as soon as possible.

463
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,520
We will find out the truth.

464
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,160
You've always been strong, Ateş.

465
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,840
You have to be strong now too.

466
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,640
We are always behind you.

467
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,120
For the first time, I want Haydar to have deceived me.

468
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,200
As long as my family survives.

469
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,680
Come on dad.

470
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
My phone.

471
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,720
I must have left it in the living room.

472
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Are you okay?

473
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
Look where you're going.

474
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,120
Why don't you look

475
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,920
around?

476
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,560
There are other people in this house besides you.

477
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,800
There are other lives

478
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,520
they have their own problems.

479
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,680
What are you doing?

480
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:48,880
Dear.

481
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
I heard the news.

482
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,840
How are you?

483
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,000
Our minds are with you, Mercan.

484
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
We couldn't stay.

485
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,440
Another disaster.

486
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,840
It's as if someone touched it

487
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,560
and our lives completely derailed.

488
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
Come on, let's go inside.

489
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,480
Aunt Nermin please don't be upset about this nonsense.

490
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Of course.

491
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,920
It was bound to be a mistake anyway.

492
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,440
What are you doing in my house again?

493
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,360
Things you wouldn't understand, brother.

494
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,520
Friendship, camaraderie.

495
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,200
We support our loved ones in difficult times.

496
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,880
Be gone when I return.

497
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,440
Haydar's daughter.

498
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,160
What are you waiting for?

499
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,800
They're all guilty.

500
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
They're all rotten.

501
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,640
She knows what kind of man her father is,

502
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,600
yet she denies it so easily.

503
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,160
It's shameful.

504
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,640
This guy was your test too.

505
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,240
Anyways.

506
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
This will past.

507
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,120
Nezir.

508
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,760
I need to ask you something.

509
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,280
Go ahead.

510
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,920
Could you look into this news story for me?

511
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,280
Is this real?

512
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,120
What happened to those names?

513
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,920
Tahir's parents' names are on it too.

514
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,880
Are they dead or alive. I want to know everything.

515
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,960
Don't worry about it.

516
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,040
What did I tell you?

517
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,400
You ask, I'll do it.

518
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
I'm always here for you.

519
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,960
I'll look into it and get back to you.

520
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,640
Thanks.

521
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,440
If only I could get this done without anyone catching me.

522
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,920
Müzeyyen mother, wherever you're going, have the children take you.

523
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,200
No.

524
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,160
I'm going somewhere nearby anyway.

525
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,960
I'll just get some fresh air.

526
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,280
Okay.

527
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,440
Alright, hurry up a bit.

528
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,080
This is very important.

529
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,640
I'm waiting for news from you.

530
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,440
I spoke with the man responsible for the grave.

531
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,560
Can we get a DNA sample right away?

532
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,496
I got in touch with someone from forensic medicine.

533
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,400
It cost a bit, but they'll get it done quickly.

534
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,000
I already sent your sample too.

535
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,120
A voice inside me says believe,

536
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,800
but my mind immediately tells me to stop.

537
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,400
But I can't stop, Cemal.

538
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,040
A tiny hope that everything could be okay has sprung up inside me.

539
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,080
That tiny hope is so strong,

540
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,400
it's holding me tight.

541
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It won't let go.

542
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,120
If I give it up,

543
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,760
it's as if all the blame will be mine.

544
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,080
Am I making a mistake, Cemal?

545
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,520
Tell me something.

546
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,800
You're not wrong, of course.

547
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,440
But in any case, don't forget to surrender to God.

548
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,320
Od is the cure for the most incurable ailment.

549
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Thanks.

550
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,840
I'm leaving.

551
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,360
I'm going somewhere.

552
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,680
Is something going on? Should I come?

553
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,120
Just keep an eye on these for me.

554
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,880
He's after something definite again.

555
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,080
What did you want, son?

556
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I was thirsty.

557
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,960
He is thirsty.

558
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Çiçek.

559
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,480
Why did you blush like a carnation?

560
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,480
Come here.

561
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,560
Is there a problem?

562
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,520
Nothing.

563
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,200
I'm working.

564
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Fine, work.

565
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,360
If you cause any trouble, I'll have a heart attack.

566
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,440
You're the only thing I have left, so don't mess up.

567
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,480
Where did we end up?

568
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,360
What are we doing here?

569
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,120
What are you looking for?

570
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,320
This is a character assassination.

571
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,720
Don't pay any attention to the allegations.

572
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,920
It's a ploy by certain individuals who want to tarnish our family's reputation.

573
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,800
No.

574
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,320
This is a character assassination.

575
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,080
Don't pay any attention to the allegations.

576
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
Yes.

577
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,480
Yes, please is better.

578
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,640
Hello everyone.

579
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,400
When we heard the accusations

580
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,680
made against us this morning, our whole family was devastated.

581
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,400
None of them are true.

582
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,800
This is an attack on our reputation.

583
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,280
Please pay no attention to the allegations.

584
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,880
I am addressing all our enemies here.

585
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,920
No matter what you do,

586
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,880
you will not destroy us.

587
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,080
We are a family who love each other.

588
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,440
We will settle accounts with all of you in court

589
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,040
as befits us.

590
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,480
I hope they believe.

591
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,960
Another day has ended.

592
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,520
How many days has it been?

593
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,680
It's been 187 days, Eylül.

594
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,360
When it reaches 200, you'll rescue me from here, won't you?

595
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,920
Yes, I will.

596
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,376
Your brother will keep his promise.

597
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,560
I love you so much brother.

598
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,360
Where did you go?

599
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
I'm here.

600
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,640
I.

601
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,320
Yes.

602
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,040
Why are you following me?

603
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,240
Why would I follow you? Don't be ridiculous.

604
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,040
I've got work to do.

605
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,600
I was walking along the beach.

606
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,920
I wanted to talk when I saw you.

607
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,120
Okay.

608
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,600
I was following you.

609
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,160
Are you happy? You won.

610
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,240
I didn't feel anything. Because I already knew.

611
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,280
You followed me when I left the mansion.

612
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,400
You followed me around the neighborhood like a spy.

613
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,760
Just so you know, you're not keeping a safe distance.

614
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,480
And.

615
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,120
Constantly bumping into things and drawing attention to yourself.

616
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,640
Thanks for your advices.

617
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,440
But you'll be the first and last.

618
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,240
I have no intention of snooping.

619
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,720
What were you doing there?

620
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,040
What were you looking for in that neighborhood?

621
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,600
Why should I answer you?

622
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,240
True.

623
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,360
Ateş Karahan doesn't answer to anyone.

624
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,480
He doesn't take anyone seriously.

625
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,360
Why are you here?

626
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,000
Why aren't you with your family right now?

627
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,880
Deep down, you know it too, don't you?

628
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,560
That's why you're here.

629
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,360
I.

630
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,720
You have doubts, even if they're small.

631
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,520
No. No.

632
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,280
But you're right.

633
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,440
No one wants to be in your shoes.

634
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,720
You're cruel.

635
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,160
No.

636
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,400
I'm just being realistic.

637
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,680
Actually, it's very easy.

638
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,840
Just open your eyes a little and look around you.

639
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,880
If you could just hear the lies your family tells you.

640
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,560
It's easy to hear.

641
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,720
He is my father.

642
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,760
Who covers me up.

643
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,520
Who says good night to me. Who loves my hair.

644
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,056
Who holds me close to his heart, calling me his daughter.

645
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,080
My father.

646
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,480
When in dire straits,

647
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,120
marries his daughter someone he doesn't know for money.

648
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
Bravo.

649
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,680
You hurt me again.

650
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,840
What did you do Haydar?

651
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,560
I gave my statement.

652
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,360
How did it go?

653
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,720
Dad.

654
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,920
Any progress?

655
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,520
We gave our statement to the prosecutor with a clear conscience.

656
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Okay?

657
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,080
That wasn't enough,

658
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,680
I also filed a criminal complaint against those who reported this news.

659
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,200
It's not easy to take on Haydar Yıldırım.

660
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,840
I'll get stuck in their throat.

661
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,920
Right there in their throat.

662
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,080
Pray that

663
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,520
it turns out as you say, Haydar.

664
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,080
Or else you'll have to answer to me first.

665
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,320
Why did they target you, Dad? Where did these come from?

666
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Rıza.

667
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,480
It's Rıza's thing.

668
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,720
He got himself into trouble.

669
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,160
He said he needed a lot of money and asked me for money. I don't have any.

670
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,080
When he didn't believe, he blackmailed.

671
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,160
I'll make different accusations, you won't be able to save yourself, he said.

672
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,680
He left this bomb to us.

673
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,240
How?

674
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,400
My uncle did all of them?

675
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,960
We didn't tell you so as not to upset you.

676
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,360
We didn't want you to be disappointed.

677
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,680
My uncle was such a bad person and you didn't tell me.

678
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,760
How could you not tell me this?

679
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,400
It's not that easy.

680
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,400
He was my brother.

681
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,880
Even if he was bad, he was still my brother.

682
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,080
I can't believe you.

683
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,480
I called that man uncle.

684
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,280
I showed him respect.

685
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,960
I worried for days about such a man, I mourned him.

686
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,640
You had no right to do this.

687
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,240
Still,

688
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,240
may God have mercy on him.

689
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,200
Let humanity remain within us.

690
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
He is my dad.

691
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,240
Who covers me up.

692
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,000
Who says good night to me. Who loves my hair.

693
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,616
Who holds me close to his heart, calling me his daughter.

694
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,640
My father.

695
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,920
When in dire straits,

696
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,600
marries his daughter someone he doesn't know for money.

697
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,240
You hurt me again.

698
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,280
Bravo.

699
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,560
Look at you.

700
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,320
You fell from the tree.

701
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,200
You couldn't stay still for a moment.

702
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,000
You were here one minute, gone the next, like a squirrel.

703
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,040
I used to walk around with a band-aid on my hand all the time.

704
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,120
Look.

705
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,280
Tahir and Eylül.

706
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,200
Little babies.

707
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,920
Tahir brother.

708
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,120
I've forgotten.

709
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,360
You were little, of course. You don't remember.

710
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,640
My child, what they went through.

711
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,160
Eylül.

712
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,200
Sweet girl.

713
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,840
She is dead.

714
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,120
Mercan is here.

715
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,600
Did you see? Look at Tahir.

716
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,640
Eylül is beside him.

717
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,600
Mercan is here too.

718
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,280
Mercan loved them so much.

719
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,520
She didn't go out much in the garden, she was always sick.

720
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,320
But when they go out,

721
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,840
she wanted to go with them.

722
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,840
Without Mercan,

723
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,440
those poor children would never have seen the light of day.

724
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,600
How could Mercan know?

725
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,720
What do you mean?

726
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,960
It doesn't mean anything.

727
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,800
Tahir.

728
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,440
Little child.

729
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,160
Who knows where he is now?

730
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,920
Anyway.

731
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,360
You're here with me, and I'm grateful for that.

732
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,920
Hey say that as children grow, their troubles grow too.

733
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,560
It's true.

734
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,200
When you were little, it was easy to manage.

735
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,160
Does pulling ears solve these troubles?

736
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,440
There's nothing I can do.

737
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,440
I'm all knotted up inside.

738
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Mother.

739
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,200
Forgive me, mother, I've upset you.

740
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,840
Forgive me.

741
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,840
You were both mother and father to us.

742
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,680
We can never repay you.

743
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,160
You're not at fault, it's all my stupidity.

744
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,520
That's the price of having children.

745
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,200
Parents bear the sins of their children.

746
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,240
You be well,

747
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,720
I accept your sins and your hell.

748
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,200
Mommy.

749
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,680
These days will pass. I promise you.

750
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:57,680
Okay?

751
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,240
We will find peace, mother.

752
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,640
I showed you hell,

753
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,520
I will also give you heaven.

754
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,280
I promise.

755
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,760
Don't be upset.

756
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,960
My dearest son.

757
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,600
My god bless you.

758
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,880
I promise.

759
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,720
Can I come?

760
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,760
What does that mean?

761
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,400
Old village, new customs.

762
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,320
Crazy girl.

763
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,600
How messy things have gotten.

764
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,280
But this is too much.

765
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,080
Having Ateş's grave dug up and all that.

766
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,280
I think he's right.

767
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,880
If I were him, I'd be suspicious too.

768
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,120
Why are you so happy?

769
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,160
Why shouldn't I be?

770
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,240
Everything's going well lately.

771
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,400
Mercan and Ateş are also on bad terms.

772
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,440
Aslı.

773
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,840
Where did you go today?

774
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,560
How many hours were you gone?

775
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,080
I had work to do.

776
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,240
You have secrets, though.

777
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,760
There is something about you.

778
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,080
Sometimes you just disappear like that, gone for hours?

779
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:23,600
What is going on?

780
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,920
What do you mean by that?

781
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,600
What are you implying?

782
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,400
Are you questioning me?

783
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
No, Mom.

784
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,680
I'm not implying anything.

785
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,960
I was just curious.

786
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,080
I'll go.

787
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,320
Good night.

788
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,240
Good night.

789
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,040
What are you doing there?

790
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,160
What I said.

791
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,760
I'm trying to prove my father's innocence.

792
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,160
You'll see it's all my uncle's fault.

793
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Don't turn off the light.

794
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,160
My father is not the man you think he is.

795
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,160
Come on dad.

796
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,760
Don't deceive me, dad. Please.

797
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,280
I hope you're alive.

798
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,160
I hope I'm such a lucky man.

799
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,616
If only I could understand what's going on with you.

800
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,080
What's burning inside you like this?

801
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,880
Mom. Stop, calm down.

802
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,360
I'm fine.

803
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,440
But.

804
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,760
There is an important issue.

805
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,680
There is an important issue.

806
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,080
I have a friend.

807
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,600
A close friend.

808
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,840
He's in dire financial straits.

809
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,720
Anne.

810
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,280
It's a matter of life and death.

811
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,840
So.

812
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,080
Can you

813
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,760
send me

814
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,360
some money?

815
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,840
Hello?

816
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,040
Mother.

817
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,160
Hello.

818
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,640
Mom.

819
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,720
Mom,

820
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,600
look what they've written.

821
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,200
High society is filthy.

822
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,120
They've been sucking people's blood

823
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,920
and sitting in their mansions.

824
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,200
Are we surprised?

825
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,800
Watch out for the upstarts.

826
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,600
They've definitely stepped on someone's back to get where they are.

827
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,440
They're worthless now.

828
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,360
Those were the good old days.

829
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,320
We're slowly laying the stones that will bring about the end of them.

830
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,000
Almost there, my girl, almost there.

831
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,640
If only we could get rid of that girl too.

832
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,000
Everything will happen in due time.

833
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,880
The people are disgusted.

834
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,600
If we put them in front of the door, they'll stone them.

835
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,480
Look.

836
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,160
Be thankful I have work to do.

837
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,680
Otherwise, I'd make you pay for these slanders.

838
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,680
Come on Nezir.

839
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,120
Bring me that news.

840
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,640
Come on Cemal.

841
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,920
Come.

842
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,840
Give me the good news.

843
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,400
If I have one miracle in this life,

844
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,080
let it be with you.

845
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,640
I looked up the names in the news.

846
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,400
They all died years ago, around the same time.

847
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,960
The families.

848
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,040
Their surviving relatives.

849
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,600
They say they fell into the hands of human traffickers.

850
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,480
It's certain that

851
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,200
the people in the grave are your mother and father.

852
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,480
What?

853
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,440
Lead traces

854
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,560
were found in the bones.

855
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,880
What are you saying Cemal?

856
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,160
This lowlife man.

857
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,400
He executed them.

858
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,480
He shot

859
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,200
my mother and father.

860
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,880
Calm down brother.

861
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:17,920
I'll kill him.

862
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,840
Haydar.

863
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,720
I'll kill you.

864
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,520
It wasn't an accident...

865
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,200
Everything we knew was a lie!

866
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,040
Haydar did it!

867
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,360
He's the one who killed my family, dammit!

868
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,080
Haydar!

869
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,160
I'm gonna kill you, damn you!

870
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,920
I'm going to kill you!

871
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,096
Brother, calm down, for God's sake!

872
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:38,800
Let go, Cemal!

873
01:26:38,801 --> 01:26:39,879
- Brother, calm down... I swear to God. - Cemal!

874
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,959
For the love of God!

875
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,040
Cemal, get back!

876
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,960
Everyone is dead?

877
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:05,840
Yes.

878
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,840
I'm very sorry, but there were no survivors.

879
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
All of them?

880
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,360
Tahir is dead too?

881
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,160
This is practically a death list.

882
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,480
Haydar!

883
01:27:58,680 --> 01:27:59,680
Come out and face me!

884
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,240
Haydar!

885
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,400
Come out and face me!

886
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,640
Is someone shouting?

887
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:22,960
Yeah...

888
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,040
Did he say Haydar, or did I mishear?

889
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,000
No! I heard the same thing.

890
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:33,760
What's going on?

891
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,320
Mr Ateş's angry voice can be heard from outside the mansion.

892
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,760
There isn't a day without an incident.

893
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,920
I swear, one of these days I'll have a heart attack and faint.

894
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,320
-God forbid, Aunt Binnaz. -Heaven forbid!

895
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,520
What's going on? What are you doing here?

896
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:21,960
Where's your husband?

897
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,960
Um... He went out a little while ago.

898
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,880
What's going on? Why are you looking for my father?

899
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:49,680
What happened again? Why were you shouting? Why were you wrecking the place?

900
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:50,840
Where's your father?

901
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,680
Tell me, where is he?

902
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,480
I don't know.

903
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,720
Tell me the truth!

904
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,680
I said I don't know! And what are you going to do to my father?

905
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,480
Are you going to explain what's going on?

906
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,080
Why are you looking for my father? Why are you so angry?

907
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,160
Get out of my way!

908
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,200
What the hell is going on here?!

909
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,400
Huh? Is this some mountain wilderness?

910
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,320
You can't treat Mercan like this!

911
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,480
-Don't! -Ateş!

912
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,320
Okay, calm down!

913
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,760
-Stop... -Okay, Ateş. Calm down.

914
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,320
And you, back off, so this doesn't get any worse.

915
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,080
We'll settle this sooner or later.

916
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,360
What are you doing!

917
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,520
I'm telling you for the last time.

918
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,800
Where is your father?

919
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,480
I don't know. I don't know.

920
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,880
He broke the door to the room, Haydar.

921
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,520
It's a good thing you weren't here.

922
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,360
He was consumed with rage.

923
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,160
Good heavens! Why is he looking for me?

924
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,320
I don't understand either.

925
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,360
I was so scared, I swear.

926
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,400
I really don't understand it either.

927
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,520
He threatened me after I gave my statement.

928
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,280
That man has a problem with me, but...

929
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,400
Stay away, Haydar, until we understand the reason for his anger.

930
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,640
He was like a man possessed.

931
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,120
You're right.

932
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,600
Don't tell anyone where I am.

933
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:47,360
Be careful they don't poison Mercan's mind about me.

934
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,200
Okay. Okay, don't worry about it.

935
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,320
Come in.

936
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,360
I can't reach my father, Mom. Were you able to talk to him?

937
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,360
I just spoke to him.

938
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,680
But don't tell the others, whatever you do.

939
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,040
Where is he?

940
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,320
I don't know. He didn't say.

941
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,600
Is there something I don't know?

942
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,720
What could it be, my daughter?

943
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,920
Your father went to the police station and gave his statement.

944
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,720
If he were guilty, they wouldn't have let him go, right?

945
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,800
And I just don't understand why your husband went so crazy.

946
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,400
Your father is very confused too.

947
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,920
What do you know about my father's past?

948
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,520
Your father is a man who made something out of nothing.

949
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,720
Day and night, he worked like crazy.

950
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,760
He sacrificed everything so his children wouldn't experience poverty.

951
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,240
Don't you dare try to blame your father.

952
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:02,920
I'm not blaming him, Mom. I'm just trying to understand.

953
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,720
There's nothing to understand.

954
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,040
Rıza slandered your father.

955
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,880
He lived off your father's back his whole life.

956
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,920
He was always involved in dirty business.

957
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,200
And your father always cleaned up his messes.

958
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,800
Now he came to extort money.

959
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,840
And when he couldn't get it, he slandered your father.

960
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,600
That's all there is to it.

961
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,800
Anyway, things have calmed down a bit.

962
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,680
Thank God Haydar Bey wasn't home. If he were, it would have been trouble.

963
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,280
Ateş Bey...

964
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,560
Why did Ateş Bey react like that?

965
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,640
I mean... It doesn't concern him, after all.

966
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:55,640
Daughter, such news is very important for businessmen.

967
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,520
It makes company shares drop. Do you understand?

968
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,880
Situations like this... And it's not a small thing either, they lose millions.

969
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,640
Could Haydar Bey really have been involved in human trafficking?

970
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,880
I mean... I don't know if he did that or not, but...

971
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,840
But I know he has many sins to his name.

972
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,240
Here you go.

973
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,800
You haven't had a proper bite to eat for days.

974
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,920
What if they get angry with you, Aunt Binnaz?

975
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,040
Oh! They won't be angry, my dear.

976
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,160
Come on, eat up. Fill your stomachs.

977
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,240
Come on, eat and be full before anyone comes.

978
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:15,960
Here. Take these too.

979
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:34,960
Mom...

980
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,360
-Aunt Binnaz? -Mom!

981
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,880
- Mom, what's happening? - Brother, get a chair, quick!

982
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:39,960
Mom, are you okay?

983
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:41,160
-Mother. -Mom!

984
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:42,840
Malik, water! Water! Water!

985
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,720
-Mother, are you okay? -Mom!

986
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,080
Slowly!

987
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:03,880
Mom, are you okay?

988
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,680
I'm fine.

989
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:10,880
I'm better now.

990
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,080
Mom. Are you okay?

991
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,319
Ateş, my son, aren't you going to tell us what happened?

992
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,080
What did that scoundrel Haydar do this time?

993
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,360
My mother and father didn't die in an accident.

994
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:49,880
They were shot.

995
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,800
That scoundrel killed my family.

996
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,640
My mother, my father...

997
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:10,840
Haydar... that... Anything can be expected from him.

998
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,480
Taking your sister wasn't enough, he had to kill your mother and father too, huh?

999
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:17,600
Murderer!

1000
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:20,240
He has no mercy, no conscience!

1001
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,880
Why? Why?

1002
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,640
My mother and father were simple, peaceful people.

1003
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,600
What could they have possibly done to him?

1004
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:44,680
This man took my father, my sister from us.

1005
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,880
He shattered our family.

1006
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,960
He took our loved ones.

1007
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:10,520
I promise you.

1008
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:13,080
I won't let him get away with this.

1009
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,960
Those we've lost may never come back.

1010
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,480
But justice will be served.

1011
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,480
Please, my son, be very careful.

1012
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,680
That man is darker than we thought.

1013
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,600
I wish you hadn't married Mercan, Ateş.

1014
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:49,280
You married the daughter of the man who killed your mother and father.

1015
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,600
Is that it? Is that what you're thinking?

1016
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:10,080
Our men have checked everywhere, but Haydar is nowhere to be found.

1017
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,120
Tell them to keep looking.

1018
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,280
Wait a minute, stop!

1019
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I'm talking to you!

1020
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:32,840
Get out of my way.

1021
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:34,160
I won't.

1022
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,520
What is this anger of yours?

1023
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,200
What do you know that makes you hate my father so much?

1024
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,320
Is there something I don't know?

1025
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:49,920
Look...

1026
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,080
My heart aches for the dead too.

1027
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,320
It can't ache as much as mine.

1028
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,000
There were children.

1029
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:05,760
There were people I knew on that list too.

1030
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:11,240
And on top of that, having all this blamed on my father is already painful.

1031
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,600
(Unintelligible or untranslated line)

1032
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,800
And then you, on top of it...

1033
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,200
Your father killed those children...

1034
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:25,880
Those people...

1035
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,920
He killed people he knew.

1036
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,400
Enough already!

1037
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,440
This anger of yours has no end.

1038
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,880
You're constantly hurting those around you.

1039
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,000
Enough, do you understand? Enough!

1040
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,440
What do you want from me, from my father, from my family? What do you want?

1041
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,080
Don't you care at all about my feelings? What I'm feeling?

1042
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,080
No.

1043
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,960
What you think, what you feel, I don't care at all.

1044
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,400
Right.

1045
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,360
Only you exist in the world.

1046
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,120
You and your meaningless 187 days.

1047
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,840
Only your feelings...

1048
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,480
What you feel... Your family...

1049
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,160
Only you, you, you, you!

1050
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:36,440
Don't forget! I exist here too.

1051
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
My family exists too.

1052
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,000
Look. I'm just trying to understand.

1053
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,440
You don't expect me to blindly believe those news reports, do you?

1054
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,880
Your father is a murderer.

1055
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,680
I will be the one to punish him.

1056
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:28,760
From now on, you must keep an even closer eye on Ateş, Cemal.

1057
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,720
Learning that his parents were murdered has driven him mad.

1058
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,160
You're right, Müzeyyen Ana.

1059
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,920
If Haydar had been at home...

1060
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,200
In this state, Ateş might have even revealed his identity.

1061
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,840
Maybe... But I think it's good that Ateş found out.

1062
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,600
Lately, he had become excessively soft towards the Yıldırıms.

1063
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:52,720
Especially towards Haydar's daughter.

1064
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,600
Nothing can divert Ateş from his path now.

1065
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,440
Try to keep Ateş away from Haydar for a while.

1066
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,680
I would really like Mercan to suffer the pain of losing a father, just like I did.

1067
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,640
We didn't come here to spill blood, Aslı.

1068
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,440
I know. It's just a wish of mine.

1069
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,480
I don't care if he dies.

1070
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,080
But if he is to die, let it be at the hands of another.

1071
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:24,920
Listen to me, son.

1072
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,400
Find Haydar before Ateş does.

1073
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:33,280
If he gets hold of him before his anger subsides, it will be a disaster.

1074
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,920
Okay, Müzeyyen Ana.

1075
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,920
Mother, should we see a doctor?

1076
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,160
No, no.

1077
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,160
It will pass, my son, it will pass.

1078
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:06,880
May God forgive our sins.

1079
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:10,000
Mine, and theirs too.

1080
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,040
Mother, did you...

1081
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:18,160
Did you know that Mr Haydar was involved in human trafficking?

1082
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,960
Mother, what does this have to do with you?

1083
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:26,040
I mean, even if you did know, what could you have done?

1084
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,640
Anything can be expected from people who torment two little orphans. Anything.

1085
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:43,680
Sometimes, when a person remains silent in the face of injustice,

1086
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,120
they too bear the sin, my daughter.

1087
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,719
Anyway, let's get back to our business.

1088
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,839
Okay, sit down, Mother dear, you sit. I'll handle it.

1089
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,080
-Okay? -Mother dear, you sit.

1090
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,360
Çiçek will do it. I'll help too.

1091
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,200
You're okay, aren't you, Mother?

1092
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:04,760
I'm okay, Mother dear.

1093
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,200
Yes, Nezir?

1094
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,880
Is everything okay there?

1095
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,920
Neither Mercan nor her mother are answering my calls.

1096
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,480
I'm not Mercan's babysitter.

1097
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,856
I know you're not her babysitter.

1098
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,520
Ateş was roughing up the girl.

1099
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,120
That's why I was worried.

1100
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,640
What are you worried about?

1101
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,560
She's strutting around like a princess, that's all.

1102
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,880
Don't let your jealousy of Mercan show so much.

1103
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,416
If you reveal your weaknesses and vulnerabilities like this,

1104
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,000
it will be very easy to be used.

1105
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:56,000
Stop playing games and tell me now.

1106
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,920
Did Haydar call you?

1107
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,160
No. He hasn't.

1108
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:01,640
But it's imminent.

1109
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,120
When he's in trouble, I'm the first he calls.

1110
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,280
Good. Then listen to me.

1111
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,440
An opportunity you shouldn't miss has fallen into your lap.

1112
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,240
Are you okay?

1113
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,840
What do you think?

1114
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:11,280
I'm sorry.

1115
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:13,600
That was a question, you know.

1116
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,520
Today, I became an orphan once again, Cemal.

1117
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,520
Tell me.

1118
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,400
How many times can a person become an orphan?

1119
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:06,240
Since I found out, there have been constant questions in my mind.

1120
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,240
How did they die?

1121
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:18,360
Did they suffer?

1122
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,160
It keeps appearing before my eyes as if I were there.

1123
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,400
I wish I had died, Cemal. Me!

1124
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:08,840
I'm in so much pain.

1125
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:21,640
Their children...

1126
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,600
They left before they could enjoy their lives.

1127
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:32,920
They stole my mother and father.

1128
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:35,960
They stole my sibling.

1129
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,520
They stole our lives from us.

1130
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,000
Actually, my anger isn't at them. It's at myself.

1131
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:03,720
How could I not find out all this time? How?

1132
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,360
I never asked, never investigated.

1133
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:20,480
Ateş.

1134
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,600
Brother, don't do this, for God's sake.

1135
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:24,600
You're blaming yourself for nothing.

1136
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:37,360
The fire that burned inside me for Eylül's revenge has grown even larger now.

1137
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:43,120
And it's grown so large...

1138
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,880
That it could burn this entire city.

1139
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:54,160
And it won't go out until everyone gets what they deserve.

1140
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,400
It's all lies, my dear. All lies.

1141
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:21,520
Haydar went to the police, gave his statement.

1142
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:24,480
If he were guilty, they would have arrested him, right?

1143
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,279
I swear, lately, I've started thinking

1144
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,920
that someone is seriously messing with us.

1145
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,400
Lies and slander are everywhere.

1146
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:39,760
I have to hang up now, my dear.

1147
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:41,920
I'll call you later.

1148
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:46,320
Clearly, you have no custom of knocking on doors.

1149
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,360
First your son, then you.

1150
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:50,200
Get out.

1151
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:52,800
I said get out.

1152
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:58,200
Are you trying to get my son into trouble, huh?

1153
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,040
Where is your husband?

1154
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:01,600
Let go of me!

1155
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,760
I'm tired of your uncivilized behavior!

1156
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:06,920
What is Haydar being accused of to you?

1157
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:08,880
What do you want from us?

1158
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,320
What do we want?

1159
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,240
Our name is being tarnished because of your husband.

1160
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,640
He has the blood of so many people on his hands.

1161
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,400
How can you still speak without shame?

1162
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,999
If Ateş finds Haydar, very bad things will happen.

1163
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,656
If you're smart, you'll tell us where he is.

1164
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,040
I said I don't know.

1165
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:27,920
Get out.

1166
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,079
Because of something

1167
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:37,480
that hasn't even been proven true, why are you all so crazy?

1168
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:40,040
Relax. No one else knows about this place.

1169
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:41,720
Ah, damn you, Rıza.

1170
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,200
Look at the trouble you've gotten us into.

1171
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,040
Are you saying you're innocent?

1172
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:07,040
Wasn't there another place?

1173
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,440
I told you, no one else knows about here.

1174
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:12,960
Okay.

1175
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:17,040
Frankly, everyone was surprised you were released.

1176
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,680
They're saying there could be another detention.

1177
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:25,280
You could be called in at any time, so be prepared.

1178
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:32,200
You really haven't been able to accumulate any friends, Haydar.

1179
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:36,641
Whenever there's an issue related to you, everyone speaks negatively.

1180
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:38,880
I've never been a friendly person in my life.

1181
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,440
Thankfully, I'm here.

1182
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,240
Look, if you want, you should get away for a while.

1183
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:50,640
I know some solid guys.

1184
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:56,160
It's best to leave until things calm down.

1185
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:59,360
Thanks, Nezir. If it weren't for you...

1186
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:00,920
Forget it now.

1187
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,280
Before you go, you should call Mercan.

1188
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,720
She's very worried about you.

1189
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,440
No. If she learns I'm leaving, she'll suspect I'm involved.

1190
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,360
You talk to her and convince her.

1191
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:14,480
Mercan's sense of justice is precise.

1192
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:17,200
If she suspects me, she'll turn me in. I know it.

1193
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,360
If you don't talk, you'll create more suspicion.

1194
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:22,760
Call Mercan and talk.

1195
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,280
When you talk, she'll believe you.

1196
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,400
Our man watching Nezir's house sent a message.

1197
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:47,600
He says there's still no one coming or going.

1198
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:49,440
Where is this man?

1199
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:52,600
Whenever he's in trouble, he takes refuge with Nezir.

1200
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,280
We're having all his places watched.

1201
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:58,320
Although that fox Nezir has probably already figured us out, but...

1202
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,920
Can we talk for a bit?

1203
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,640
There's nothing to talk about.

1204
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:10,280
But I have something.

1205
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:14,720
You still haven't given me an answer.

1206
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,480
You want an answer?

1207
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:22,760
There's no need to pretend you don't know.

1208
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:26,320
You know very well what kind of scum your father is.

1209
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:28,560
That's the answer.

1210
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:33,640
Are you aware you're passing judgment before the law does?

1211
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:18,840
I was worried about you.

1212
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,280
I came to see how you are.

1213
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:33,160
I'm sure she knows where her father is.

1214
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:48,280
Mercan, your father is with me.

1215
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Hello, Nezir.

1216
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:05,800
Mercan, your father is with me. I'm putting him on.

1217
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Hello, my daughter.

1218
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:19,640
Her father's daughter.

1219
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,240
The world could burn and they wouldn't care.

1220
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:25,160
As long as nothing happens to them.

1221
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:29,800
Even though she knows Haydar is guilty, she's hiding him.

1222
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:35,839
But they released you after you gave your statement.

1223
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:37,360
Why do you need to hide?

1224
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:39,880
I can't leave my fate to chance, daughter.

1225
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,240
They're still messing with me.

1226
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:44,880
I won't be around until the truth comes out.

1227
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,256
One of the people who lost a loved one on that list

1228
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:50,320
might suspect me and come after me.

1229
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,480
How many people were on that list, you saw it too.

1230
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:58,440
I want to come see you.

1231
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:01,120
It's better if you don't come now, daughter.

1232
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,640
What are you going to do with that gun?

1233
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:41,400
Ateş, where are you going?

1234
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:47,400
Ateş! Stop.

1235
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,720
Ateş! Wait.

1236
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:15,560
Where are you, Cemal?

1237
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:26,880
Mother dear.

1238
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:29,640
Are you okay?

1239
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,336
- I'm fine. - Look, it's because of this debt stress

1240
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:34,520
you're going to get sick.

1241
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,920
I've found a solution, Çiçek.

1242
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,880
What solution? For the debt?

1243
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,360
I'm going to ask Ateş Bey for money.

1244
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:45,800
Are you sure, Mother?

1245
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:48,000
Look what's been happening since morning.

1246
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:49,880
It doesn't seem like a good time.

1247
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:51,920
There's no other way, Çiçek.

1248
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:53,800
Haydar Bey's situation is well known.

1249
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:55,720
His financial situation is very bad.

1250
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:59,440
I'm going to go talk to Mr Ateş and ask for money.

1251
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:02,560
Mother dear, you know what you always say?

1252
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,840
Never lose hope in God.

1253
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:07,200
When one door closes, another opens.

1254
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:11,560
Exactly, my beautiful daughter.

1255
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:16,600
Okay then. I should get up. Mrs. Müzeyyen wanted baba ganoush, I'll make it.

1256
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,760
The world is falling apart and the woman is still ordering food.

1257
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:21,880
She ordered it yesterday.

1258
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Oh my God!

1259
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:29,440
Mother!

1260
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,160
I'm coming from the loan shark's place…

1261
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:40,920
What! What happened?

1262
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,880
Wait, wait, don't panic immediately.

1263
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:46,280
I went to ask for a little more time…

1264
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:47,520
And?

1265
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:52,400
The guys said the debt is cleared, don't come around here again!

1266
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:53,440
Who paid it?

1267
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:57,320
I don't know… What does it matter? Someone paid it, that's it.

1268
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:00,560
How does it not matter? You should have asked who paid it.

1269
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:01,839
Daughter, haven't you heard?

1270
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:05,000
It's on TV, philanthropists clearing debts.

1271
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:07,639
Right now, I don't care who paid it at all…

1272
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:09,120
May God be pleased with whoever paid…

1273
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,840
-Let it be, I swear. -Right?

1274
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:14,880
Didn't I tell you, when one door closes, another opens?

1275
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:16,480
Thank God.

1276
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:29,400
All hell is breaking loose at the mansion, and you're here

1277
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,280
all cozy and cheerful, what are you doing?

1278
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:37,280
You guys are the best, I swear… No worries, no troubles…

1279
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:41,400
I've never seen anything like this in my life.

1280
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:44,280
You're right, Zehra…

1281
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,840
unlike some people, because our hearts aren't filled with malice, we have peace.

1282
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:01,040
Problem solved.

1283
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:06,840
How are you, Malik?

1284
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:09,840
Fine.

1285
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Tell me, Aslı.

1286
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:46,080
Did you tell Mercan where her father is?

1287
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:49,120
What happened now?

1288
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,760
Mercan made a phone call and left in a hurry.

1289
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:57,560
If she's going to meet her father, it's very bad…

1290
02:05:58,040 --> 02:06:00,240
Because Ateş took his gun and went after her.

1291
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,600
If he finds Haydar, he'll definitely kill him.

1292
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:07,920
I'm on my way…

1293
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:09,480
I'm calling Haydar immediately.

1294
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:14,120
You were supposed to call Mercan once things calmed down!

1295
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:17,680
Was this the thing to do while Ateş is looking for Haydar like a madman?

1296
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:21,080
How quickly you forgot that you were giving me advice.

1297
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:23,640
Now hang up…

1298
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:25,000
I have to warn Haydar.

1299
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:47,400
Haydar to the grave, Ateş to prison…

1300
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:39,440
Mercan! My daughter!

1301
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:01,040
I'm trying to defend you against people who think you're guilty, Father.

1302
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,040
Of course you will defend me…

1303
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:04,760
I'm innocent, my daughter.

1304
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:06,400
I didn't do anything, my daughter.

1305
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:08,160
Rıza's deeds are being blamed on me,

1306
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:11,200
but sooner or later I will bring out the truth. I promise you.

1307
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:14,000
Did you know about my uncle's actions?

1308
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:16,160
No, my daughter.

1309
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:17,680
If I knew, would I have allowed it?

1310
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:22,200
It's a shame, all those people died.

1311
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:24,920
I've lived with my honor all my life…

1312
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:12,440
What are you doing? Have you gone mad?

1313
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:17,360
Let go!

1314
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:19,360
Let go of that gun, are you out of your mind!

1315
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:28,080
You don't have the power to stop me!

1316
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,000
Ateş! Ateş!

1317
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:38,480
Ateş wait!

1318
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:50,240
Your end has come, Haydar!

1319
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:51,840
Don't run!

1320
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:07,080
Haydar!

1321
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:47,640
Ateş!

1322
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:51,120
Ateş stop! Calm down!

1323
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:53,296
Ateş what are you trying to do? What's your problem?

1324
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:54,320
Get on your knees!

1325
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:57,240
What do you mean "Get on your knees"?

1326
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:08,600
What are you trying to do? What's your problem?

1327
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:10,600
I told you to get on your knees.

1328
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,200
I beg you, don't do it…

1329
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,720
I never did anything to you, Ateş!

1330
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:22,840
Ateş, don't do it, I beg you!

1331
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:24,480
I didn't do anything to you…

1332
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,040
Stop lying!

1333
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:39,760
Why are you so angry at me?

1334
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:46,336
I also remained faithful to the agreement I signed with you.

1335
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:50,040
I gave you my mansion, my company, everything. Even my daughter…

1336
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:53,800
You...

1337
02:11:56,280 --> 02:11:57,280
I will kill you...

1338
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:59,320
You've deserved to die for a long time.

1339
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:19,440
You can't be a murderer.

1340
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:23,040
You may be a harsh, cold man, but you're not a murderer.

1341
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:29,160
Don't do it… You'll regret it…

1342
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,000
Your life will be over too.

1343
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:32,720
Don't.

1344
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:40,600
I beg you, Ateş… I'm innocent… I didn't kill anyone…

1345
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:42,480
I didn't do anything.

1346
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:47,320
I beg you.

1347
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:50,720
My only asset in life is Mercan, I swear on her, I didn't do it!

1348
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:53,000
Stop lying!

1349
02:13:05,160 --> 02:13:06,160
Please don't.

1350
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:10,640
Please.

1351
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:19,920
Get away from here!

1352
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:22,760
I won't.

1353
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,880
You can't think straight because of your anger.

1354
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:30,440
Put that gun down.

1355
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,200
I told you to go!

1356
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:37,120
I said I won't.

1357
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:02,000
Move aside, I'm going to kill him.

1358
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:03,600
Get a hold of yourself!

1359
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:06,040
You're talking about killing someone!

1360
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:07,280
This isn't right.

1361
02:14:07,480 --> 02:14:08,480
I won't allow it!

1362
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:16,840
If he is guilty, he will answer for it in court, not to you.

1363
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:20,800
I told you to go!

1364
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:27,240
I told you I won't allow this.

1365
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:29,280
You'll have to walk over my corpse first.
