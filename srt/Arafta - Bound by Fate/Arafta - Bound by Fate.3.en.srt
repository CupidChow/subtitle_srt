1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,480
It is a tradition.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Even for 187 days,

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,680
you will become Ateş Karahan's wife.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,320
You accepted Ateş's offer just
because I spent two days locked up?

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,160
This was not cool.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,320
I'm up to my neck in debt.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,840
We paid for the girl, you
expect a wedding on top of it?

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,520
Especially for a girl who will
be divorced in just 187 days?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Why? Why is this cruelty?

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,360
I don't want you! I said I
don't want to get married!

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,760
Why is it so hard to understand?

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,600
The process has already begun.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,200
Why won't you just give up?

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,720
I will never give up.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,480
Even if it means my death.

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,640
Just pull the trigger. Is it that hard?

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,520
You think it is easy?

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,040
I do not care if it is easy or not.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,800
But if you say you can't
do it, then things change.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,040
You will become famous thanks to me.

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,440
Who are you to make anyone
regret anything? Brat!

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
He is going to make me regret?

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,960
Who are you to make anyone
regret anything? Brat!

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,600
Open the door!

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Come on, open the door already!

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,080
Your parents are dead!

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,360
You will stay here from now on.
Make a sound and I'll break your legs.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,680
-You heard me? -You cannot keep me here!

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,160
You are going to wear this nightgown
for your first night together.

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,600
I don't want them. Please
take them out of my sight.

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,320
Did you think a short marriage to
Ateş meant you could skip your duties?

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,360
You are obligated to fulfill your
wifely duties until the divorce.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,400
I am warning you for the
last time. You won't marry her.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,720
Or else.

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,080
What are you doing? Leave!

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,000
What are you doing? Get out of here.

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,440
What are you guys doing?

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,160
It was me who shot you.
I'll pay for it myself.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,160
What did you do?

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,520
I shot Ateş.

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,080
Mr. Ateş, did you see who shot you?

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
No.

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
I didn't.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,520
Why did you do that?

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,720
Your punishment will be worse.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,320
I moved the wedding closer.

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,200
We are getting married tomorrow.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,480
Time to say goodbye.

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,200
Dad? This has nothing
to do with Nezir, does it?

50
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,600
How many times must I say it?

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,040
Don’t you trust me?

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,080
Go, before anyone sees.

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,720
Is Nezir helping again?

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,160
-If he is... -No.

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,040
This has nothing to do with Nezir.

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,200
I found another way.

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,920
He lied.

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,120
He lied to me.

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,800
You, again.

60
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,200
Are you my saviour or my executioner?

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,400
After today, everything
will be different for him.

62
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,560
It will.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,200
All for my sister.

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,800
For Eylül.

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,640
Haydar tore her from me.

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,560
Now I’ll take his life apart.

67
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,040
Mercan.

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,200
I won't give up.

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,200
I won't give up on you.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,080
Do you take Mercan Yıldırım as your wife?

71
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,960
Yes.

72
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,480
They neither gave up hatred
nor that blinding passion.

73
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,360
You are not going anywhere.

74
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,120
We're not done yet.

75
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,320
This is our tradition.

76
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,560
The groom kisses the bride on
the forehead, saying "she's mine."

77
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
But you are not worth it.

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
Did you really think you
could get away so easily?

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,440
You will pay for that getaway.

80
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,000
In the most painful way.

81
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,960
One day you will regret
what you put me through.

82
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,880
Because I don't deserve it.

83
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,600
What is this?

84
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,280
Who are you to disgrace us by
wearing a black wedding dress?

85
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,280
I would betray myself by wearing white.

86
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680
This is my darkest day.

87
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,040
I gave up on myself by signing that.

88
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Is that so?

89
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,840
Take off that rag.

90
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,960
Mother Müzeyyen.

91
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,880
Go put on something proper.

92
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,320
Go change.

93
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
Don't let this get any worse.

94
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Look at that shameless girl.

95
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,600
She has disgraced us in front of everyone.

96
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,840
If people back in Adana heard about
this, they would punish her very bad.

97
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,760
She should have ran
while she had the chance.

98
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
She will regret it so much.

99
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,320
Enough.

100
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,880
Mercan please open the door.

101
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,440
Mercan.

102
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:05,880
Mercan.

103
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,120
Well, it's a complete scandal.

104
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,880
A total scandal.

105
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Everybody will talk about this.

106
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,600
Mercan.

107
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,040
Are you okay, dear?

108
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,280
What will crying ever get you?

109
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Come on.

110
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,960
Go wash your face.

111
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And go downstairs.

112
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,800
Are you going to let them win?

113
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Win?

114
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,200
What are you talking about?

115
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
You left me alone there.

116
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,800
You did nothing.

117
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,440
I feel like I am something up for sale.

118
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,880
I am your daughter.

119
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,040
Your child.

120
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
Get out.

121
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
I said go.

122
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Okay.

123
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,920
Aunt Nermin, come.

124
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,800
Let's leave her alone.

125
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,280
What a disgrace.

126
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,440
Go change your clothes.

127
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,160
Who are you to disgrace us by
wearing a black wedding dress?

128
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,400
Go wash your face.

129
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,640
What a day.

130
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,480
Full of action.

131
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,960
Hold on, we're just getting started.

132
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Does this suit us?

133
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,480
It suits us perfectly.

134
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,800
I didn’t even do enough.

135
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,600
My blood hasn’t cooled down yet.

136
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
She should be thankful it stopped there.

137
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,000
No, mother Müzeyyen.

138
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
No.

139
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,920
Haydar’s daughter teams up with her
father to hurt you, then runs off...

140
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,280
And after all that, she dares to show up at the wedding dressed in black
like she’s coming to a funeral. And I’m supposed to stay silent, is that it?

141
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Just wait. I’m not done with her yet.

142
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,080
I haven’t even started.

143
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,360
I don't want any more trouble.

144
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,920
Either way, she is carrying my surname now.

145
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,160
She is my wife.

146
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,960
Get this into your head.

147
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,600
So what, just because she carries the family
name we’re supposed to treat her like royalty?

148
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
She should be grateful
it ended with just this.

149
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,920
What im saying is pretty clear.

150
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,560
It was not pleasant.

151
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,560
It will never happen again.

152
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Period.

153
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,880
What goes around comes around.

154
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Everybody gets what they deserve.

155
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,160
I will make a phone call brother.

156
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Excuse me.

157
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,720
You took my pride.

158
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,000
Took my honor.

159
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Made me a victim of your ambitions.

160
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,960
Look at what the great Haydar
Yıldırım’s daughter has come to.

161
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,160
No, Nezir is not answering.

162
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,120
Everything was done if Merjohn didn't come.

163
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,920
What are we going to do father?

164
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,960
How are we going to stop Nezir?

165
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,080
He's surely up to something.

166
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Cut it.

167
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,936
If he was going to do something,
he would’ve done it by now.

168
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,360
He's clearly waiting for something!

169
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,440
What really worries me is Mercan.

170
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
Didn’t you see the way she looked at us?

171
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,320
What that Müzeyyen did was…

172
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,560
The vile thing that woman did…

173
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,640
We have to make it up to Mercan.

174
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
My brother.

175
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Are you okay?

176
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,080
Such a pity for her.

177
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Don't bring it up.

178
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Brother,

179
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,400
their fears have grown beyond them,

180
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,320
yet they’re still chasing after intrigue.

181
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,680
How did Nezir convince them?

182
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,200
Didn't we block that guy's bank accounts?

183
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,640
Haydar does nothing without purpose.

184
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,840
Apparently, Nezir knows
something about the Yıldırım family.

185
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,440
Something so important,

186
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
that makes him deceive his daughter.

187
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,720
We will find out brother.

188
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,840
We will find out either way.

189
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,760
Go talk to our guy,
maybe something comes out.

190
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,160
I got this, brother.

191
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,520
What have we been through, seriously?

192
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,280
I'm upset, so upset.

193
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,800
Who knows Mercan's state right now?

194
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,680
Poor girl must be devastated.

195
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,920
Honestly, Müzeyyen is terrifying.

196
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,760
She's a foe like no other. What she
did to that girl was heartbreaking.

197
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
Look at where we are now.

198
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,720
Even the mighty Haydar Yıldırım
said nothing about what was done.

199
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,800
I had to hold myself back just to
stay silent. But he stayed quiet.

200
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
All it takes is one fall.

201
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,960
But a person should
also wonder why they fell!

202
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,680
Anyway, let’s get back to our business.

203
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,800
It’s hard to understand these rich folks.

204
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,440
What is it that they can’t share?

205
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,200
You’re rich, just enjoy your life,
right? But no, there has to be a problem.

206
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,960
But today I realized this: even the troubles of
the rich end up exhausting the tongues of the poor.

207
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,000
Get to work, come on.
We still have a lot to do.

208
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,560
The longing ends. I’ll
be by your side tomorrow.

209
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,480
He's coming.

210
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
What are you talking to yourself?

211
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Nothing.

212
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
Nothing?

213
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,320
How did I end up like this?

214
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,760
How did I fall apart?

215
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,040
No cry.

216
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
I have to stay strong.

217
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,200
No falling apart.

218
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,280
What do you want?

219
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,520
Aren't you done with your torture?

220
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Not yet.

221
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,840
It's going to be a long night.

222
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,040
Let's make something clear.

223
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,320
You can't come in without permission.

224
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,120
I don't take permission.

225
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,920
I give it.

226
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,360
If i want to.

227
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
You ran.

228
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,240
But you came back on your own.

229
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,680
It means you accepted everything.

230
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,960
What… What do you mean "everything"?

231
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Everything.

232
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,560
What do you mean by that?

233
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
I don't understand.

234
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,920
Don't touch me.

235
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,960
Where are you Nezir?

236
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,800
Where are you?

237
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,240
Still can't reach, right?

238
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Mercan.

239
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,320
Feeling better?

240
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,720
Yes I am, I will, and I have to be.

241
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
You will be.

242
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,200
They can’t break you, I know that.

243
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,480
I’m always by your side.

244
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,240
I know that, dear. Thank you.

245
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,200
I am right here. Talk to you soon, alright?

246
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,440
Don't give me that look, I did everything
just for you. Did you see what happened?

247
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,120
Now you understand that
I made the right decision.

248
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,160
You lied to me.

249
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,400
My daughter, I didn't
want you to marry that man.

250
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,120
We don’t even know who he is.

251
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,520
We don’t know his parents,
where he was born, nothing.

252
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,320
He just said ‘187 days’ and
walked right into our lives.

253
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,720
Nezir was someone we knew.

254
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,280
But I told you to go! I
told you to trust your father.

255
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,640
But you didn't listen,
didn't trust me, and came back.

256
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,720
Is it any better now?

257
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,640
Just watch, everything is
going to mess up because of this.

258
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,920
You lied to me.

259
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,520
Tricked me.

260
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,760
You destroyed the mountains I trusted.

261
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
And I am buried beneath it.

262
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,840
Who am I to trust now?

263
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,720
Who am I to lean on now?

264
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
That man already decided not to marry me.

265
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,280
I’m so sorry you had to
go through all this, Mercan.

266
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,360
But please know that
we never meant any harm.

267
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,160
We want to do what is best
for you, and for our family.

268
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,240
You left me alone.

269
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,520
You pushed me back into the pit.

270
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,040
Threw dirt over me.

271
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,160
I will never forgive you.

272
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Never.

273
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,480
A family feud?

274
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,760
What can you say brother?

275
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
She is right.

276
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,640
You say she is carrying your
surname but she stands with her family.

277
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,360
After all she's a Yıldırım.

278
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,440
She is living up to her bloodline.

279
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,640
I am listening.

280
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Brother, Nezir is here.
He is trying to come in.

281
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Okay.

282
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,160
What is it?

283
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,560
Brother, we have a problem.

284
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,400
Nezir.

285
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,800
Ateş Karahan.

286
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,760
Ateş Karahan.

287
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,560
Face me if you are a
man. Look, I am all alone.

288
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,960
I won’t let you have Mercan.

289
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Nezir.

290
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,440
You stay out of this.

291
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,880
Or we’ll be having a very
different kind of conversation here.

292
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Got it?

293
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,320
Brother.

294
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,136
Brother, please don't do it, let's go.

295
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Let go.

296
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
Nezir, please.
Stay back.

297
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,880
You won't get involved in this.

298
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,840
Nezir.

299
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:27,320
You won't talk to him.

300
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,920
You won't say his name.

301
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,120
My son.

302
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,440
Mother, stay out of this.

303
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,840
What a disgrace.

304
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,400
She is my wife now.

305
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,960
If I ever see you near her again...

306
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,360
I’ll make you pay the heaviest
price you’ll ever face in this life.

307
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,120
What's mine, is mine.

308
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,240
Don't hold anything back.

309
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,520
Ateş.

310
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,520
This was my last warning.

311
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,920
Come on brother let's go.

312
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Let go.

313
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,640
Ateş, are you okay?

314
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
My son.

315
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Move.

316
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I said walk.

317
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,640
You’ve raised a daughter
worthy of yourselves.

318
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,320
She has just married him, and her
ex‑fiancé is already storming the mansion.

319
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,640
You’d sell anything
for money, wouldn’t you?

320
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,920
Even your honor, your dignity.

321
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,680
Go on, tear each other apart.

322
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Enough.

323
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,040
If she keeps this up,
I’ll strangle that woman.

324
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,160
I’ll snap her in my hands.

325
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,080
Nezir won't stay quiet.

326
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,160
He’s going to ruin me.

327
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,080
We have to stop him as soon as possible.

328
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
Come on.

329
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Open the door.

330
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Open the door.

331
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,880
Aslı, Aslı don't do it, Aslı.

332
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Let go.
Aslı calm down.

333
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
Let go.

334
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,960
Take your hand off me.

335
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:07,760
Aslı calm down. I can't let you
go. You will regret this. Let's go.

336
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Let go.

337
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,880
You will never face that man again.

338
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,600
You will never speak to him.

339
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,200
See him on the street?
You will change your way.

340
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Have his number? You’ll
delete it from your phone.

341
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,680
Don't you ever forget this.

342
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,240
You are mine now.

343
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
My wife.

344
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,960
Only for 187 days.

345
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
I warn you.

346
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,720
Don't push me.

347
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
There will be consequences.

348
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Get out of here.

349
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
I don't want to be in
the same room with you.

350
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,960
You think I’m gonna be scared like that?

351
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
You're scared.

352
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,480
Your eyes give you up.

353
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
You fear.

354
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
That's not fear.

355
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
But hatred.

356
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,480
Now, look at my eyes again.

357
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What do you see?

358
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,600
I did it.

359
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,680
I shot you.

360
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,760
Why are you stopping me?

361
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,640
Why?

362
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,936
What was I supposed to do, Aslı?

363
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,080
Let you do something you’d regret?

364
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,640
They’re alone together in that room.

365
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,520
Do you know what that feels like?

366
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,760
I can’t take it.

367
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,360
I'm falling apart.

368
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,080
Aslı, calm down.

369
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,880
Do you want them to hear us?

370
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,760
Let them hear, yes. Let them hear.

371
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,520
Let everyone hear.

372
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,440
I’m tired of screaming on the inside.

373
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,760
How would you ever know?

374
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
I know, Aslı.

375
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,920
I know.

376
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,760
Storms rage inside you. You
want to be seen, to be heard.

377
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,720
But the one person you want the most
won’t see you, won’t hear you. I know.

378
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,240
I can't breathe, Cemal.

379
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,200
My heart is burning, I can't take it.

380
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,440
What am I to do?

381
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,800
How am I supposed to go on?

382
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
Cry, Aslı.

383
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Let it out.

384
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,560
They say the heart
cleanses itself with tears.

385
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Maybe it's true.

386
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,200
Don’t hold it in.

387
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,240
Get away from me.

388
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
Leave the room.

389
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
I said go.

390
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,920
I shot you once, I can do it again.

391
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
Do it then.

392
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,560
Are you gonna shoot me like that?

393
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,960
Put your finger on the trigger first.

394
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,160
Then you pull the trigger.

395
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
What are you doing?

396
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,520
You will switch off the safety first.

397
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,560
I will never let you touch me.

398
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,040
What makes you think that I will touch you?

399
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,640
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

400
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,600
You will come to me on your own.

401
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,600
Until then...

402
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,640
I will never touch you.

403
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,280
What is this nonsense?

404
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,760
That day will never come.

405
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,960
We're not real husband and wife.

406
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,160
Real husband and wife?

407
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
We'll see.

408
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,960
Well...

409
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
What do we have?

410
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,760
I talked to our guy.

411
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Nezir.

412
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,560
He showed Haydar a video
on his phone that day.

413
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,840
After watching it, Haydar hit Murat
so hard he literally kissed the floor.

414
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,800
Who knows what they watched...

415
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,720
That video solves the puzzle, brother.

416
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Find it.

417
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,680
But there’s something
more important right now.

418
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,440
Do you have the gun I was shot with?

419
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Yes I have it.

420
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,360
I grabbed it at the scene.

421
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,720
It waits to be a trump card.

422
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Have that gun checked for fingerprints.

423
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,240
Hand it to Hasan, at
the station. He'll help.

424
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,600
Tell him it's urgent.

425
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,760
I'll tell him for sure
but what's going on brother?

426
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,240
Is there something I don't know?

427
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,680
Put your finger on the
trigger first, then you pull it.

428
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,800
I have doubts about who shot me.

429
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,920
Am I supposed to be with this man now?

430
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,960
God give me patience.

431
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,400
How's this going to work?

432
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,240
How am I supposed to live like this?

433
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,720
Murat, Murat.

434
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,160
The promises given to me were broken.

435
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,400
Someone's gonna pay for this.

436
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:25,960
I swear...

437
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,200
Don't swear.

438
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,639
I’ll show you what it means to
take Nezir Keseroglu out of the game.

439
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,760
I swear we did our part.

440
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,240
Kept our word.

441
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,399
Mercan ruined it.

442
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,840
Stop the bullshit.

443
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,320
I care about the result. And
the result? Mercan marries Ateş.

444
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,240
It's over.

445
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,480
Nohing is over yet.

446
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,640
I will fix this. Just give me one more
chance. Don’t turn me in to the police.

447
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,520
I’ll do whatever it takes to
make Mercan come back to you.

448
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,160
What can you do? What?

449
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,560
What have you ever done right
that you’ll pull this off?

450
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Get lost.

451
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,520
You have my word.

452
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,320
Mercan will come straight
back to you. Trust me.

453
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,760
You are so sure about it.

454
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,960
Fine.

455
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,440
Have it your way.

456
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,960
Everybody deserves a seconds chance, right?

457
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:28,120
Look at me, this is your last chance Murat.
If you fail, I'll take you out myself.

458
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,920
Deal?

459
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,040
Aslı.

460
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,600
Are you feeling better?

461
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,520
Yes.

462
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,600
Yesterday was rough. That's
why I reacted like that.

463
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,600
This stays between us, right?

464
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,200
Did something happen yesterday?

465
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,600
I don't remember, what did you react to?

466
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,880
Thanks, Cemo.

467
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,600
Glad to have you.

468
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
Always, Aslı.

469
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,960
I wonder what would
happen if you weren't there.

470
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,400
But don’t worry, I’ll get used to it.

471
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,720
Of course you will.

472
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,680
People get used to everything.

473
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,280
I should take this.

474
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,960
Yes, brother Hasan?

475
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,080
Okay brother.

476
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,760
I have to get rid of this girl.

477
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,000
But, how?

478
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,760
Shame.

479
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,800
Seriously?

480
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,760
Insolent.

481
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,160
If you'll excuse me.

482
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,680
It can't go like this.

483
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,760
We're two enemies in one room.

484
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,240
We don't have to live like this.

485
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,040
You have to.

486
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,920
Stop repeating the same things.

487
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,920
All I ask for is a little
understanding. Is it too much?

488
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,000
Isn't it better for us
to seperate the rooms?

489
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,200
We wouldn't have to face someone we hate.

490
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,560
I think you want this too.

491
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,440
You got me wrong.

492
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,160
That's not gonna happen.

493
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,800
Embrace it.

494
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,520
Tyrant.

495
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,280
Hold on. Where are you going?

496
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,960
I have things to say to you.

497
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,160
Have you fulfilled your
wifely duties to my son?

498
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,040
I won't answer that.

499
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,440
Know your place.

500
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,120
You're facing your husband's mother.

501
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,960
If I have to teach you
wifely duties, I will.

502
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,560
I will ask what I want, you will answer.

503
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,320
I won't say a single word about it.

504
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,999
With this stubbornness,
you’ll suffer a lot from me.

505
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,680
That big nose of yours...

506
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,080
I’ll bring it down sooner or later.

507
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,840
I will teach you, respect,
manners, and womanhood.

508
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,880
If you’re the bride, you’ll
be worthy of our traditions.

509
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,040
Insolent.

510
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,800
I talked to Nezir and handled the sitution.

511
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,440
Well done.

512
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,800
Well done, you finally did one thing right.

513
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,920
What are you two up to without telling me?

514
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,800
I’ll forgive you on one condition.

515
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,599
From now on, you won’t
do anything behind my back.

516
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,280
My daughter, I'm your father,
I did what was best for you.

517
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,520
Is this what's best for me? I got
humiliated in front of everyone yesterday.

518
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,240
And I wanted to save you from that.

519
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,680
If we want to get rid of the
Karahans, we have to act together.

520
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:55,720
Just don’t cause any trouble again. I don’t have the strength to deal
with another scandal. Sweetheart, you got married, so sit back and relax.

521
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,480
I didn't want this marriage.

522
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:08,920
I’ll only find peace once I get that man out
of my life, Mom. And I’m determined to do it.

523
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,440
You see? This is Haydar
Yıldırım’s daughter.

524
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,040
Let's see how he can deal with us.

525
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:23,120
No, you’re determined. You’re
going to stir things up again.

526
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,280
Thanks to you, there’s
no peace left, no calm.

527
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:06,560
There’s something different about you today.
Your hair’s done, your makeup is on point.

528
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,680
And your face is blooming
with smiles. What’s going on?

529
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,840
Mind your own business, don't mess with me.

530
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:22,840
Stop all the chit-chat and get to work. The house still
needs cleaning, and the meal needs cooking. Let's go.

531
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,120
Where are you? Getting close?

532
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,560
I'm already here.

533
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,800
I'm here.

534
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,880
Welcome. -Welcome.

535
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,200
Where is Aslı?

536
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,040
We should’ve gone over today’s
schedule before heading to the office.

537
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,400
Message from Hasan.

538
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:09,480
Brother you were right, Mercan's fingerprints
aren’t on the gun. So, if only Murat was there…

539
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,160
She fooled me.

540
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,400
Are you mad? Let go of my arm.

541
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,680
I said let go.

542
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,520
What are you doing?

543
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,480
What are you doing? Let go.

544
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,400
I said let go.

545
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,480
What is this? What are you doing?

546
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,000
What are you doing?

547
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,800
Get out of my way.

548
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,160
You lied to me.

549
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,120
There is nowhere you
can escape. You're here.

550
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,920
You're with me.

551
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,400
Look at me.

552
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,680
I said look at me.

553
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,280
Why did you lie to me?

554
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,960
What are you talking about?

555
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,360
You took the blame for your brother?

556
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,520
Where did this come from?

557
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,240
Never.

558
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,560
Never lie to me again.

559
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,560
Or I won’t be responsible
for what happens next.

560
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,440
I wanted to protect my family.
I won't let you hurt my brother.

561
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,600
A person protects their family if
they’re innocent, not if they’re guilty.

562
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,880
What do you know about
protecting your family?

563
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,720
You don't have a heart.

564
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,800
Don’t cross the line.

565
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:55,000
Never, ever cross the line again.

566
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,280
Cemal, where is Ateş?

567
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,039
I heard a noise,
something happened to Ateş?

568
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:39,640
You can expect anything from these monsters.
I hope they haven't done something again.

569
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:44,120
Do you think I would just stand here
if they did something to my brother?

570
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,920
Well, where is he then?

571
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,720
He must be around. No
worries. He should be here soon.

572
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:54,440
You are hiding something
from us. What happened again?

573
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,760
Mercan spared us again.

574
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,880
I told you yesterday would work in our
favor. Mercan’s even more fired up now.

575
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:14,320
Please don’t stir things up
just to win her forgiveness.

576
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:20,560
Everything that happens to us comes from Mercan’s
stubbornness. It bounces off her and burns us too.

577
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,080
Murat.

578
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,920
Let go of my son. -What's going on?

579
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,040
Don't.

580
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,560
Let go of my brother. -Don't.

581
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,879
I said hands off. Let go.

582
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,959
You’re a vile man. Look,
she’s still protecting you.

583
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,279
And you shamelessly let her
take the blame. She is your sister.

584
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,919
A brother protects his sister,
can do everything for her.

585
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,040
He’d risk digging the
grave and lying in it himself.

586
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,920
And you just let it happen? Some
father you are. And you, some mother.

587
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,280
Let's not interfere, Mom.

588
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,480
What's happening again?

589
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,280
Karahan is making them pay.

590
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,640
Murat shot Ateş.

591
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,880
My son?

592
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:24,320
Mom, calm down. Brother is doing what’s needed. No
one gets away with what they’ve done, don’t worry.

593
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,400
They’re rotten to the core.

594
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,920
One’s a killer, the other a liar.

595
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,240
Don't think you'll get away with this.

596
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,640
I’ll do whatever it takes
to make him pay for it.

597
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,680
I’ll show you what kind
of man your brother is.

598
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,040
All of this happened while
I was in Egypt for two weeks?

599
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:10,760
Well, yes. Dear child, it’s better if you don’t go
back home again. We’re the ones who end up suffering.

600
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,720
There was trouble outside again.
Murat has been up to something.

601
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,239
Mr. Ateş shook him off.

602
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:34,240
When they brought that boy into this house, I knew
that he was gonna bring trouble. It's always him.

603
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,320
When they brought him?

604
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,480
What do you mean?

605
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,360
I mean the day he was born.

606
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:57,840
I flew for hours and didn’t get this tired. In just half an hour of what
you told me, I feel like I’ve been beaten up. And it’s all negative.

607
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,520
Absolutely, a lightning
bolt straight into the house.

608
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,240
How are your parents, my
child? Are they healthy?

609
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,240
They are fine, thank god.

610
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,400
I should go wash my hands.

611
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:28,800
Talking about parents made him upset. He
has a problem, but I didn’t understand it.

612
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:42,200
Çiçek, don't just sit around like the princess
of the house. Get up and chop the onions.

613
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,520
If they were handing out princesshood
for free, I wouldn’t get any, Mom.

614
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,839
Brother would you like tea?

615
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,160
Sure, please.

616
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,200
Okay.

617
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,120
Mercan is right. If we want to get
rid of them, we have to act together.

618
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:09,200
We need to find something on this man. Who is he? What
does he eat, how does he live? Good or bad, we don’t know.

619
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:15,240
He comes with the strangest offer, turns our
lives upside down, and we don’t even know him.

620
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,840
He has no past. A man who seems
like he never lived before 2005.

621
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,040
As if he was erased from the world.

622
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,319
Maybe they hide something.

623
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,160
Otherwise, why would they erase their past?

624
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,040
Okay, that's our starting point.

625
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,840
Look, even Haydar Yıldırım
couldn’t find anything.

626
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:43,960
We'll look again, and again, until we
find it. Every secret leaves a trace.

627
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And I will find it.

628
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,240
Yes, my girl.

629
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,440
I will.

630
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,159
Son, is Murat going to get away with this?

631
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,440
Don’t worry, I’ve got something in mind.

632
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,480
Wait a minute, so he’s
the only one guilty now?

633
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:09,160
Are we supposed to embrace Mercan just
because she didn’t pull the trigger?

634
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:14,800
In my eyes she’s just as guilty as her brother. Even
if she didn’t shoot, she protected the one who did.

635
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,640
What she's done was wrong,
but that's not our priority now.

636
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,960
Cemal.

637
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,160
That video.

638
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:29,320
We need it to keep Murat on a
leash, and strengthen our hand.

639
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,279
We have to take it from Nezir.

640
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,160
Don’t worry, Karahan. No one’s
ever escaped us, and he won’t either.

641
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,160
I will help you too.

642
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,240
No.

643
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,920
Why push me out?

644
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,480
No, Aslı.

645
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,120
This guy is dangerous. I
don't want you involved.

646
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,040
I'm not a kid.

647
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:43,640
People forget their sins,
but no sin goes unpaid.

648
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,399
Another day is over.

649
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,160
How many days?

650
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,800
It's been 187 days, Eylül.

651
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:01,400
When it's 200, you’ll save me
from here, right? You promised.

652
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:07,120
Don't worry. I'll save you.
Your brother will keep his word.

653
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,480
I love you so much brother.

654
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,600
Where are we brother?

655
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,440
Here.

656
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,400
Where do you want to go?

657
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,160
There, or there.

658
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,480
Maybe here?

659
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,400
Wherever you like.

660
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,160
Brother I'm so scared.

661
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:58,400
Don't be scared, I'm here. Don't.

662
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,760
What do you want from us?

663
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,960
I promise.

664
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,760
I'll erase these 187
days and start over, Eylül.

665
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,760
I’ll avenge the 187 days.

666
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,600
Brother will keep his word.

667
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,640
Where did he go?

668
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,680
What are you doing here?

669
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:53,040
I had an old album. I
was going to look for it.

670
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,080
None of your belongings are here.

671
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,760
They were moved to the shed in the yard.

672
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,760
And how about yours?

673
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,280
That's none of your business.

674
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:10,079
Instead of wasting your mind on this,
ask yourself why I’m protecting a criminal.

675
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,560
Maybe then you’ll be
ashamed to look me in the eye.

676
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,080
And I won’t have to deal
with these pointless questions.

677
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,600
Go.

678
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,240
Do you always have to be this harsh?

679
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,160
This is what you get. Go.

680
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,480
Take your hand off. I said, hand off.

681
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,960
Ateş.

682
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,480
Come watch a movie with me.

683
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,320
It's late, Aslı. I'm going bed.

684
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
We used to gather and watch
together. I miss those days.

685
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:01,199
Our life is a movie now, isn't it better?

686
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,439
Don't do that. Come on, let's watch.

687
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,440
Another time, promise.

688
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,760
I won’t let you forget that.

689
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,840
When did I forget my promise?

690
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,640
Fine, you’re too much to keep up with.

691
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,039
Go. Good night.

692
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,400
You too.

693
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,920
Çiçek, come on, we’re late, girl.

694
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,320
Girl, hand me that jam.

695
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,080
Not that, they didn't
like it, the other one.

696
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,200
Okay.

697
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:04,720
Do you eat breakfast this late
in this mansion? Come on, hurry up.

698
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,719
Five courses appeared out of
nowhere. No wonder we’re late.

699
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,760
Did you say something sweetheart?

700
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,960
Be careful, you’ll burn
yourself. The stove is on.

701
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,840
It’ll be ready soon,
let the breads toast a bit.

702
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,200
Good job, less talk, more
work, okay? Berat, vegetables...

703
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,840
Good morning.

704
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,800
We haven’t properly met.

705
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,959
Malik, the mansion’s
driver, came from Egypt.

706
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,080
That’s very nice. I love Egypt.

707
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,000
Of course, you went all the way to Egypt.

708
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,360
Nice to meet you, Mr. Malik.

709
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:04,880
I’m Zehra, the head servant of the house.

710
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,280
I’m the head of all of them.

711
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,600
She thinks you speak Arabic.

712
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,959
She solved it well.

713
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,880
Yes, sure, sure.

714
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,040
Glad to meet you too.

715
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,360
You speak very well.

716
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,840
Better than you.

717
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,920
Come on, girls, hurry up.
Don’t keep the family waiting.

718
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,360
Come on girls.

719
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,280
She keeps talking like that.

720
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,200
I must’ve pulled it
over me when I got cold.

721
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,760
The password.

722
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,480
I can find it.

723
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,520
You're not a complicated man.

724
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,880
Numbers important for you…

725
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,960
2005

726
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,960
Your rebirth.

727
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,640
It's not it.

728
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,480
187

729
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,720
What could be more important?

730
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,240
You came to ruin our lives, saying "187."

731
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,400
What were you looking for?

732
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:59,320
No one starts eating before Ateş sits at the table. Don’t you
have any manners at all? No one’s taking the food from you.

733
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,800
Don’t worry, you won’t starve, killer.

734
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,880
Good morning. -Good morning.

735
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,440
Good morning.

736
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:36,720
A parade of bad manners first thing in the morning.
And you had money too, did you learn nothing?

737
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,759
They’ve wasted their time eating.

738
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:46,000
Nothing good comes from a woman who wakes up after her husband. Get
yourself together. You need to get up and come before everyone else.

739
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,200
I woke up before him.

740
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:52,240
Have the breads arrived? I
hope they’re toasted just right.

741
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,240
You know, there’s a problem
with consistency in this house.

742
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,280
Enjoy your breakfast.

743
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,320
Wait Zehra.

744
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,200
Let the one whose duty it is do it.

745
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,240
Get up and pour tea for your husband.

746
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,000
This tea is too light.

747
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,960
Make it strong.

748
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:39,160
Get ready, we’ll head to
the company. Don't be late.

749
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,240
Aslı, hand over the jam please.

750
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,120
And the bread too.

751
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:51,040
Do you want some pastry?

752
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,760
Looks like you’re not hungry.

753
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,760
Good thing I am.

754
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,720
Annoying, primitive thing.

755
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:47,720
Why did that Zehra witch act like that toward
you? Unnecessary sincerity, silly jokes…

756
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,679
I don’t know. Like you say, maybe
there’s something wrong with her.

757
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,280
If she dares to keep acting like
that, I will show you what's wrong.

758
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,520
This is for you.

759
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,119
Don't want it.

760
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,640
But it came all that way for you.

761
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,559
No. I missed you so much, but look at
what you did the moment you got here.

762
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,800
What did I do?

763
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,280
You were soft on her, be hard.

764
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:20,120
Deal. I will be harder.

765
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:25,960
I changed my mind, don't be hard,
maybe she likes it that way. Be normal.

766
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,360
No, don't even look at her.

767
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,920
Okay, you are the boss.
Whatever you say goes.

768
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,240
Brought it for me?

769
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,320
Yes.

770
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:47,440
Did you tell your parents about me?

771
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,360
Didn't have the opportunity, my flower.

772
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,480
Had an issue with my dad,
so couldn't talk about it.

773
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,600
Thank you, it's very beautiful.

774
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,080
Looks good on you.

775
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
You’ve got good taste too.

776
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,280
Looks very beautiful.

777
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,560
Stay away from Zehra or I will
strangle you with this necklace.

778
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,720
Won't even get close, I don't care.

779
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,519
If someone comes, knock the door.

780
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,079
Don't worry, I got this.

781
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,080
Okay.

782
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,960
Let's see where you're hiding, Karahan.

783
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,680
Come on Mercan, come on.

784
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,560
What are you up to?

785
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,920
Too close.

786
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,560
Nothing.

787
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,560
There is nothing.

788
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,240
It's locked.

789
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,360
Where is the key?

790
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,320
Mr Ateş. -Mom?

791
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,759
Our new intern, Burak.

792
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:35,239
Thank you so much for hiring me.

793
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:38,120
Ms. Zahide found your
résumé very impressive.

794
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,239
Thank her, not me.

795
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,479
Welcome onboard.

796
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:45,160
Thank you. I’ll do my best, don’t worry.

797
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:50,760
Excuse me, this usually
doesn't happen. I'm excited.

798
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,599
No problem.

799
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,200
Congratulations again.

800
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,080
Okay, okay.

801
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,360
Mr. Yaşar?

802
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,000
Ms. Aslı?

803
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,120
You scared me.

804
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:16,520
I was checking the documents and talking
to my mom, didn't notice you. Mr Ateş.

805
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:22,840
Mr Ateş is also here. Have
a nice day. Have a nice day.

806
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:28,120
Smells like there’s a
little rat in your office.

807
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,080
It must be the curious little rat.

808
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:42,320
Alright, we started off on a bad note, but
let’s not continue like that, Ms. Müzeyyen.

809
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,760
Let’s talk and break the ice.

810
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:50,240
I have nothing to say to those
who threatened my Ateş’s life.

811
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:55,040
Çiçek, bring the coffees.

812
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:03,120
Don’t be stubborn, Ms. Müzeyyen.

813
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,999
It’s just a cup of coffee together.

814
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,600
I wouldn’t drink a single sip of
water from your hand even on my deathbed.

815
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,400
I’m burned.

816
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,800
Is she crazy or what?

817
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:34,960
She calls us rude, but
she’s the rudest of all.

818
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,240
Çiçek. Çiçek.

819
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,840
God…

820
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,480
What are you doing here?

821
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,920
Looking for information about you.

822
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,640
You’re going through my room. Again.

823
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:14,560
I told you clearly I’d find
out what you’ve been up to.

824
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:15,960
Let go of my arm.

825
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,320
Here.

826
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,720
Open and look at it.

827
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,040
You're bluffing.

828
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:32,840
If there was nothing important inside, it wouldn't be
locked. Everything else is open, only that one’s locked.

829
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:01,640
Bravo, You must have a lot of free
time to be busy with these things.

830
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:08,840
Said the girl who spends her time
sneaking in my office during work.

831
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:15,600
Look down on me all you
want. Torture me all you want.

832
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:21,519
One way or another, I’ll find something
on you, and then you’ll see. Then…

833
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,200
Then? Yes, then?

834
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:31,480
Quiet.

835
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,520
Yes, Cemal.

836
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,480
Listening.

837
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,280
Okay.

838
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,400
Walk, we're going.

839
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:47,560
Where?

840
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:48,680
To lunch.

841
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,120
I'm not coming.

842
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,160
I wasn't asking. Walk.

843
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,840
He bullies without a breath.

844
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,719
Mom, are you making stuffed peppers?

845
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:17,400
Yes.

846
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,720
I missed it so much.

847
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,560
I made you a delicious Turkish coffee.

848
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,640
To wake you right up.

849
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,480
No, thanks, I’ve already had some.

850
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,000
Not like this.

851
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:51,600
Let’s take these onions away
so they don’t burn your eyes.

852
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,760
Actually, we’re not
that far apart from you.

853
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,160
In what way?

854
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,920
Meaning, I like Egyptians.

855
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,680
About that…

856
01:35:04,681 --> 01:35:08,920
I've read a lot, and have good knowledge in
pyramids, they are in shape of triangles.

857
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:09,960
Yes.

858
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,640
She's very smart though.

859
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,640
So, tell me, when did you get here? What
are you doing here? What do you like most?

860
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:21,920
What’s with all these heavy
questions? Son, don’t listen to her.

861
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,640
I'm asking to get to know him.

862
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:32,280
So, did you like Kebab? Kebab? or forget Kebab,
tell me about the mansion, what is your thing here?

863
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:39,640
So, I'm a driver. Also doing master's
degree. Finishing school next year...

864
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:41,960
And going back to Egypt.

865
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:46,440
Isn’t there anything keeping you here? I
don’t know, like a girlfriend or something?

866
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,680
How improper. You can’t ask
something like that. Goodness…

867
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:57,920
I don't... I don't have a girlfriend.

868
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,600
Is this why we are here?

869
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,120
Lunch was an excuse.

870
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:48,040
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

871
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,280
Sit down.

872
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,320
Goddamn bastard.

873
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,000
Stuck in my throat.

874
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,600
Couldn't you find anywhere else?

875
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,400
You owe me an explanation.
You tried to go behind my back.

876
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,440
It's not like that.

877
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,480
Then how?

878
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,680
I didn't know you were part of it.

879
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,040
Believe me, there is an explanation.

880
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,720
I will tell you, but later.

881
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,920
You've got nothing to talk later.

882
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,760
I warned you.

883
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,800
And you.

884
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:19,200
There were enough people going behind
my back. You weren't necessary Nezir.

885
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:22,600
Mercan, I didn't have bad
intentions. I just wanted to help.

886
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,960
Go.

887
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:31,440
Take a walk with your intentions. You've
reached the time limit talking to my wife.

888
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,720
Don't exceed it.

889
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,280
Have manners.

890
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:36,440
Go.

891
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,320
You brought me here on purpose,
didn’t you? To annoy him.

892
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,720
Poor you… Living so
deliberately must be exhausting.

893
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:56,080
You're right, I'm smart, it's exhausting.

894
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:02,360
You're busy grumbling, looks like
you won't eat. Get up, we're going.

895
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,960
I am not.

896
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,680
Don’t you dare argue with me. Move.

897
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:38,200
My girl, could you find something?

898
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,840
I searched the office thoroughly,
looked everywhere, but there’s nothing.

899
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,680
Are you sure you looked everywhere, girl?

900
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,920
Yes, I looked everywhere.

901
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,960
Except one place.

902
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,760
Scoundrel.

903
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,520
A lowlife with no humanity.

904
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,360
This is treachery, brother.

905
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,480
These people are the
lowest of the low, Cemal.

906
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:35,000
They’re so rotten they’ll steal someone
else’s life just to live their own in comfort.

907
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:40,320
But the day will come… they’ll be so
desperate they’ll beg me to let them die.

908
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:47,280
And I won’t grant them that mercy. I’ll make
them face every last thing they’ve done.

909
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:51,720
They won’t leave this world
without reckoning for it.

910
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,040
Now’s the time, girl. Go on.

911
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:02,880
This can't be you brother.
You couldn’t have done this.

912
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,720
You can't be a murderer.

913
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,000
Did you find what you were looking for?

914
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:39,760
What's that now?

915
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,480
Wasn't that clear enough for you?

916
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,520
You're brother killed the girl.

917
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,440
Then threw her out of the balcony,

918
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,040
and framed it as suicide.

919
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,320
The case was closed just like that.

920
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,360
No.

921
01:44:58,640 --> 01:44:59,880
No, that's impossible.

922
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,720
Your brother killed a young girl.

923
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,360
He's a murderer.

924
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,400
Who are you?

925
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,120
I'm Ateş Karahan.

926
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,000
Do you expect me to believe this nonsense?

927
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,880
What do you want from us?

928
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,120
What are you trying to drag us into?

929
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,400
Since you don't believe me,

930
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:01,560
why don't you ask your brother?

931
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:03,960
Maybe he can tell you,

932
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,920
what he did to her,

933
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,760
and how the poor thing
took her last breath.

934
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:17,760
No matter what he says,

935
01:46:17,761 --> 01:46:20,200
he'll persuade you that
he's innocent anyway.

936
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:23,640
Since you don't believe

937
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:24,960
what you saw with your own eyes.

938
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:27,800
Maybe you already knew.

939
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:31,640
Your whole family is an accomplice.

940
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,200
Sweet pea,

941
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:22,680
what's wrong? You're pale as a ghost.

942
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:26,560
What's wrong, Mercan?

943
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:32,240
Tell us already.

944
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:33,280
What's wrong?

945
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:38,080
Just now,

946
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,160
I watched a video.

947
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:43,360
What video?

948
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:46,280
It was about you, brother.

949
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,160
You were arguing with a girl.

950
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:58,920
She was...

951
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,680
She was covered in blood.

952
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,840
Who showed it to you?

953
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:12,800
Does it matter?

954
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:16,960
Why are you so calm?

955
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,160
Have you always known?

956
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,760
I asked you who it was.

957
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:21,880
Was it Ateş?

958
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,320
Yes, it was him.

959
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:25,616
Is that what's important here?

960
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:26,839
Yes, exactly.

961
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,880
Because it's a lie.

962
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,600
False accusation.

963
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,480
I didn't kill anybody.

964
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,680
I saw it with my own eyes.

965
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,480
What you saw wasn't true.

966
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,416
This man took advantage
of our difficult times

967
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:43,480
, and seized our property.

968
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:46,096
As if that weren't enough, he's
trying to tear our family apart.

969
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:47,120
Don't you see?

970
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,080
What are you talking about?

971
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,640
Yes,

972
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:51,920
we were arguing.

973
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:53,920
She accidentally fell and hit her head,

974
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:54,960
but nothing happened.

975
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,600
Once she came to her senses, I left.

976
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,720
The last time I saw her,

977
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:02,280
she was still alive.

978
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:06,160
That girl stuck to me for money, Mercan.

979
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,240
That's why the argument broke out.

980
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:10,640
After I left,

981
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,800
she commited suicide.

982
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,440
If I had been there,

983
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:16,760
I would have prevented it.

984
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,959
I blame myself every day,

985
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,680
for leaving her like that.

986
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,680
What girl?

987
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,000
What suicide?

988
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:27,240
For the love of god,

989
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,600
will somebody tell me something?

990
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,160
Sweet pea,

991
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,040
Will you believe your brother

992
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,440
or that man called Ateş?

993
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:36,280
I haven't done things to be proud of,

994
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,400
I admit that.

995
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,960
You're all in trouble because of me.

996
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,600
But I didn't kill that girl.

997
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,360
I swear that I didn't.

998
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:46,680
I hope you didn't do it.

999
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,439
No matter what he says,

1000
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,320
he'll persuade you that
he didn't do it anyway.

1001
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,600
Since you don't believe what you saw.

1002
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:59,080
What's your problem with us?

1003
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,600
Why did you show it to her?

1004
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,640
Shh.

1005
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Don't ever enter my room
without permission again.

1006
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,680
How did you get a hold of that video?

1007
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:12,720
You'll learn not to underestimate me.

1008
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:14,240
Ateş,

1009
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:16,040
You shouldn't have shown it to her.

1010
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,960
No one knowing doesn't cover up sins.

1011
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,080
There is an unresolved issue.

1012
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,120
Your son killed a young girl.

1013
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:29,480
Did you think you could
sweep it under the rug?

1014
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,640
Look, there might be a misunderstanding.

1015
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:35,280
We can talk it out.

1016
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,020
Alright,

1017
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,560
I admit that he has flaws.

1018
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:41,120
But that only affects him and his family.

1019
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,560
The video shows otherwise.

1020
01:51:58,800 --> 01:51:59,800
Ateş,

1021
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,320
we're a family.

1022
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:04,280
Digging up the past hurts every one of us.

1023
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:07,040
Murat is my son and your brother-in-law.

1024
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:09,039
It affects not only us but you as well.

1025
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:10,040
You get it?

1026
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,160
I'm not a part of your family.

1027
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:15,920
It's just part of our deal.

1028
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:19,560
It includes my marriage
with your daughter too.

1029
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,720
You really thought I'd keep my mouth shut?

1030
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:36,840
When I'm done with you all,

1031
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,400
there will only be remains of you left.

1032
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,520
Murat wouldn't have done it.

1033
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,760
He wouldn't be able to.

1034
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:02,800
He wouldn't.

1035
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:06,080
He couldn't have done something like that.

1036
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,480
How could you be so cruel?

1037
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:19,620
Hm?

1038
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,560
It's your brother, that commited a murder,

1039
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,800
, not me.

1040
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,000
But it's a hard pill to swallow.

1041
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:27,760
I'll give you that.

1042
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,280
Murat says that he didn't do it.

1043
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:32,160
And the girl,

1044
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:34,800
apparently she was
still alive when he left.

1045
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:37,040
And he wouldn't do it.

1046
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:38,600
He couldn't.

1047
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:41,800
It's one of your mind games, isn't it?

1048
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,800
It's not a coincidence that
you have the video, right?

1049
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,520
You're just like them,

1050
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,280
blaming others to get yourself out.

1051
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:55,120
The brother you're standing
up for stabbed me from the back.

1052
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:57,720
On top of that, he let you take the blame.

1053
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:00,160
Isn't that right?

1054
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:03,320
Your brother is a murderer.

1055
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,600
He killed a young girl.

1056
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,240
And then he countinued on with
his life like nothing happened.

1057
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,720
Laughed, had fun.

1058
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:12,240
And you're accusing me
of playing some mind game.

1059
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:14,800
Enough.

1060
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,920
Shut up, I'm begging you.

1061
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,360
Shut up.

1062
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:26,840
Stay away from me.

1063
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,760
She can't accept what he'd done.

1064
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,120
But she will, eventually.

1065
01:54:58,360 --> 01:54:59,560
It's not that easy, bro.

1066
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,440
The ones that cut you too deep,

1067
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:05,120
, are the ones you love,

1068
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:06,520
, maybe even your family.

1069
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:08,960
That cut heals eventually,

1070
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:10,120
that's the easy part.

1071
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,200
But the scar it leaves,

1072
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:13,840
it stays with you until you die.

1073
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:16,880
That's exactly what Murat did.

1074
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:20,800
I'll go check on her.

1075
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:22,680
So that she doesn't faint and die.

1076
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,320
I'll leave the rest to you.

1077
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,960
Is it true, what Mercan said?

1078
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:40,120
I asked you a question.

1079
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,520
What did Ateş say?

1080
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,520
What kind of question is that, huh?

1081
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:51,920
What do you expect him to say?

1082
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:54,120
He's looking down on us like always.

1083
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:55,720
He wouldn't even listen.

1084
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:57,880
He thinks, he's all that.

1085
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:00,320
Didn't he tell you where
he got the video from?

1086
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:03,360
Damn it.

1087
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:05,000
It must be Nezir.

1088
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:06,880
Ateş is his enemy.

1089
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:09,040
Why would he give it to him?

1090
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,400
Didn't he know that he
would use it against us?

1091
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:12,720
Dad, do something.

1092
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,840
He doesn't intend on keeping
silent, since he showed it to ther.

1093
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:18,720
Shame on you.

1094
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,040
So, it was true.

1095
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:27,520
You brought all of us
down including yourself.

1096
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,360
How could I be so naive?

1097
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:32,400
Enough.

1098
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:36,720
Stop yelling. What would that fix?

1099
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:37,920
It was an accident, mom.

1100
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,080
I swear on it.

1101
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,160
What are we going to do now, Aydar?

1102
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,200
Huh?

1103
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:55,040
It's all Mercan's fault.

1104
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:59,601
If she had agreed to be with Nezir,
none of this would have happened.

1105
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,200
He's our problem because of her.

1106
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:03,440
I can't go to prison.

1107
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:06,320
I would rather die than go to prison.

1108
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:07,760
Dad,

1109
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:08,800
please help me.

1110
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:10,800
I beg of you.

1111
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:12,520
Save me, dad.

1112
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:15,560
I beg of you to help me for once.

1113
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Get up.
Dad.

1114
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,400
Get up.

1115
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:24,160
Get up.

1116
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:28,080
Alright.

1117
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:30,680
We'll figure a way out.

1118
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:33,320
We will.

1119
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,760
We will.

1120
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,160
But I didn't kill that girl.

1121
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,960
I swear on it.

1122
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:12,480
The brother you're standing
up for stabbed me from the back.

1123
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,280
Maybe you've always known.

1124
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,200
Your whole family is an accomplice.

1125
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:42,840
God, help me.

1126
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:29,520
You won' ever let me get a
moment of peace, will you?

1127
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,160
So that you can't cause problems for me.

1128
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,240
It's not that I worry about you.

1129
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,640
In case you hurt yourself.

1130
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:41,120
I can't be bothered.

1131
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:07,280
Mom,

1132
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:09,960
what about we go out today?

1133
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:12,600
I'm too tired, honey. I can't.

1134
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:14,960
Oh, come on, mom.

1135
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,680
We stay in all day.

1136
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,200
It's like we're trapped.

1137
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:21,880
As for Ateş, he's always after Mercan.

1138
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:23,620
What?

1139
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:24,960
Am I wrong?

1140
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:27,720
That liar is seducing him.

1141
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:33,800
He's not the type to be easily distracted.

1142
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,560
But Haydar's daughter,

1143
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:37,240
is an unpredictable one.

1144
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:41,280
Our job is to add fuel to
the fire when it's needed.

1145
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:43,800
I've been waiting years for this moment.

1146
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:48,480
I won't let her get in my way.

1147
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:50,800
Not just her,

1148
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,240
anyone.

1149
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:58,680
Swear to god, I'm beat.

1150
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,720
It's the gloom that gets to you.

1151
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,480
We stay inside all day.

1152
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:05,720
We have to get out.

1153
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:08,960
I told mom already.

1154
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:10,120
She doesn't want to.

1155
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:11,320
Would be nice actually,

1156
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:12,840
but Ateş is busy.

1157
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:15,400
With what?

1158
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:17,640
Mercan.

1159
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:22,160
Naturally, it was a hard
pill to swallow for her.

1160
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:24,840
Ateş went after her.

1161
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:27,040
Mercan this, Mercan that.

1162
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:29,520
Why do you chase after her?

1163
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:31,440
It's her brother after all,

1164
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:32,480
can't blame her.

1165
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:34,240
Is that so?

1166
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,320
She needs to be convinced after everything?

1167
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:41,640
Apparently, I'm the only
one that can deal with her.

1168
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,840
I'll teach her a lesson myself.

1169
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:03,760
Are you feeling better?

1170
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:08,000
I just want to go home.

1171
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,520
We have to visit the hospital first.

1172
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:15,160
I want to go home.

1173
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,560
Stop acting like a child.

1174
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:18,880
We're going to the hospital.

1175
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:22,240
What's with the pretentious caring?

1176
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:44,640
You scared me to death, Malik.

1177
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:45,760
What's wrong, Çiçek?

1178
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:47,560
You've been avoiding me all day.

1179
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,480
Why are you acting distant?

1180
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:52,800
I haven't seen you the whole day.

1181
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,760
Poor you, couldn't see me and all.

1182
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,800
You can see Zehra if you want.

1183
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,680
Why would I do that?

1184
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,456
Why did you tell her that
you didn't have a girlfriend?

1185
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,440
You told me not to tell anyone, darling.

1186
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:06,120
Huh.

1187
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:11,680
So that's why you've been distant all day.

1188
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:13,560
I mean...

1189
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,280
If she thought weren't taken...

1190
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:16,360
whatever, I don't know.

1191
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:17,600
I do as I'm told,

1192
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:19,320
and I'm still at fault, babe.

1193
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,480
I got work to do, I
can't chit chat with you.

1194
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:24,640
But...

1195
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:58,080
What are you doing?

1196
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:29,360
Mercan?

1197
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:31,040
Honey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

1198
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:32,880
Sweet pea, what happened? Are you okay?

1199
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:34,640
Nothing. I'm okay, mom.

1200
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:37,160
How is it nothing? You're pale as a ghost.

1201
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:43,720
Come inside.

1202
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:50,600
The prescription is in the car.

1203
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:51,760
Can you get it?

1204
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:10,440
If it wasn't you, how
did he get that video?

1205
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:12,680
How the hell do I know?

1206
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:15,480
You're still not trusting me apparently.

1207
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,960
I'm not that naive to help my arch nemesis.

1208
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:19,360
I'm about to lose my mind.

1209
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:20,760
How did he get it then?

1210
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,160
Couldn't you pick somewhere else to eat?

1211
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:38,280
Damn it.

1212
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:41,200
It was right under my nose.

1213
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,240
I didn't notice.

1214
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,400
He fucked me over right before my eyes.

1215
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:50,840
Your death will be from my hands, I swear.

1216
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:58,000
I was at dinner.

1217
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:00,920
Ateş and Mercan showed up.

1218
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:03,680
I was fuming so I went up to them.

1219
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:10,280
Welcome back, bro.

1220
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:12,240
How is she?

1221
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:14,680
Tired.

1222
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:17,720
Got a cold too.

1223
02:07:18,240 --> 02:07:19,880
She'll feel better after taking her meds.

1224
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:21,720
What about the task I gave you?

1225
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:55,440
How is the princess doing?

1226
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,600
Does she accept that
her brother is a murderer?

1227
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:03,160
What's with you Aslı?

1228
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:07,640
We're coddling her as if we have
nothing better to do, that's why.

1229
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:09,320
None of your business.

1230
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:17,480
Is Murat going to pay for it in the end?

1231
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:20,760
Why don't we hand him to the police?

1232
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:24,040
Change of plans.

1233
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,360
Instead, we wait.

1234
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,040
We wait?

1235
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:28,280
Why?

1236
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:30,280
Had to be that way.
