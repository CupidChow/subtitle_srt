1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,920
Let me tell you what Eylül would've wanted,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,640
she would've wanted her brother to keep his promise.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Cemal, stop talking.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,680
What kind of a brother are you? Is this how a brother would act?

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,040
I told you to shut up, Cemal.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,400
How will you face your sister, will you have the face to go to her grave?

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,600
Cemal, shut up!

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,280
This is not the path we decided to take, son.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,400
We can't catch flame at the first spark,

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,000
catch fire and burn everything.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,920
I gave up the name "Tahir" for that reason.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,720
That is why I became "Ateş."

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,840
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time, Nezir.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
I didn't want to get in to a fight today but here we are.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,480
I'm not going anywhere.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,280
Mercan needs me.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,680
I'm paying my debt to them right now.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,760
That's why I married you.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,360
That's why I'm putting up with this torment.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,440
Don't touch my family.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
You're asking the impossible of me.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,120
Did you put this in my room?

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,560
Your dad is a murderer and you're paranoid, I suppose?

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,800
I'll expose the dark side of all of you, why you're tormenting us in this way.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,600
Why didn't you just die?

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,800
Haydar Yıldırım is a mountain.

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,760
I won't go down with a couple of blows.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,560
You could only burn me as big a man as you are.

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,440
Then I won't be a flame but a dynamite.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,640
I won't burn but blow you into pieces!

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,480
You're walking on the body of my child!

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,440
You took him and took his life, just so you could live in prosperity!

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,120
You evil people!

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,680
Our last offer is from Keseroğlu Conglomerate,

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,920
the offer they have made is for...

36
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,160
10 million and one dollars.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,320
In this case, Keseroğlu Conglomerate has secured the tender.

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,640
Congratulations, Mr. Nezir.

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,000
You...

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,240
You did this.

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,640
Every betrayal has its consequences.

42
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Çiçek, add the spices to tomorrow’s shopping list, girl. They’ve run quite low.

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:21,120
The mansion isn’t like it used to be, the population has doubled. We need to check the pantry often.

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,800
If anything’s missing, Mrs. Müzeyyen will give us hell.

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,680
Çiçek.

46
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,000
Çiçek, girl, what are you doing?

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,120
Peel the zucchinis properly, where is your mind?

48
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
I was lost in thought, mom.

49
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,440
You wouldn't even notice if the mansion burned.

50
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,440
Çiçek, make me a coffee.

51
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,600
Zehra, make your own coffee, girl. We’ve got work to do.

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes. Make your own coffee, then go drink it somewhere else.

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,920
You’re lucky I’m in a good mood today. Otherwise, I’d snitch on you to Mrs. Müzeyyen and line you all up.

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,040
Really?

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,680
Çiçek, turn around and mind your work. Zehra, make your own coffee if you want.

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,240
Haven’t you realized yet that you can’t mess with me?

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,680
Çiçek.

58
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,000
Look at her, now we’re supposed to make coffee for the lady. God forbid.

59
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,040
Berat, what’s up? Is something wrong?

60
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,920
Hello Mr. Cemal.

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,160
Hello Berat.

62
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,280
Mr. Cemal, may God bless you.

63
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,400
Really, I will also speak to Mr. Ateş at a convenient time. Thank you so much for paying the money.

64
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,480
I mean, we pay your salaries every month, you don't have to thank me for that. Don't be sorry.

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,040
Mr. Cemal, sorry for bothering you, good evening.

66
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:44,200
Berat, if there’s any problem with the money, you can tell us. Ateş and I will help you, you know. We’ll handle it as best as we can.

67
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,640
I know, Mr. Cemal, thank you again.

68
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,480
Good evening. -Good evening.

69
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,960
I'll be there in a couple of hours.

70
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,360
Okay, nice to meet you.

71
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,320
Yes, Mrs. Mercan.

72
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,000
Good morning Yaşar.

73
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,640
Good morning.

74
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,480
Is there any progress with the security footage?

75
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,320
Unfortunately there is no progress yet, Mrs. Mercan.

76
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,800
Keep trying Yaşar, it's very important.

77
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,160
Don't worry at all, Mrs. Mercan.

78
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,320
If there’s been any tampering with the footage, it will definitely come out.

79
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,440
Okay.

80
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,200
See you.

81
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,280
Who are you talking to?

82
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,040
Come in.

83
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
Good morning.

84
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,040
Good morning Cemal.

85
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,960
Didn't you sleep last night?

86
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,200
Oh, brother.

87
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,520
Okay then, have some rest and come to the office afterward.

88
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,720
No rest before teaching Nezir his lesson.

89
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
I'll be out in a couple of hours.

90
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,280
I need to go to Bursa.

91
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,360
To the company that opened that tender?

92
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,360
Yes.

93
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,720
We’ve done some business with the owner.

94
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
He also owed me.

95
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,560
Let's see what can I do.

96
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
I can come with you, if you want.

97
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,320
You stay.

98
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,560
The company and the mansion are in your care.

99
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,880
I also need some time alone.

100
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,960
As you wish, but be careful.

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,160
Çiçek, come here for a second.

102
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,360
Oh, Malik, come brother.

103
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,320
All the best with that.

104
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,480
Thank you.

105
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Can you continue? I’ll pick up some stones and decorate the place a bit.

106
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,160
I'll be right back.

107
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,160
What a beautiful flower.

108
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,080
Yes it is.

109
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,800
It’s beautiful by itself, but it loses its charm when other flowers come.

110
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,240
You men... You're all the same.

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,200
I don't get it. Are you talking about the flowers or the men?

112
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:04,120
The place is full of flowers, and everyone’s buzzing from one to another, but luck isn’t always on your side.

113
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,080
One moment, you might end up taking honey from the wrong flower. Then, good luck to you.

114
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Where are you going?

115
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,440
You’ve been in your office all night and still haven’t slept.

116
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,280
Did you worry about me like a caring spouse?

117
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,760
Or are you gathering new information to report?

118
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,920
You’re being unfair.

119
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,240
I guess you’re up to new schemes.

120
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,200
I caught you secretly talking on the phone in the garden.

121
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,480
Take it.

122
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,920
Take it and look.

123
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,440
See who I was secretly talking to.

124
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,560
You can look all you want, take it.

125
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,560
I'm not reporting to anyone.

126
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,200
I’m not scheming against anyone.

127
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,000
And I didn’t hide that I was gathering information about you.

128
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,240
Isn’t it only natural for me to look into a man who suddenly came into my life and hurt me?

129
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm tired of talking about the same things.

130
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,640
I'm going now, I've got work.

131
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,640
I'll be back around 5.

132
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Be ready then.

133
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,000
There is a meeting we need to attend.

134
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,680
I'll give you the exact time.

135
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,120
Don’t go anywhere.

136
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
I'm not guilty.

137
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Hello.

138
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,040
Hello.

139
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,200
You seem lost in thought. What’s on your mind?

140
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,560
Nothing, nothing at all.

141
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,320
Actually, I should go back to work.

142
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Wait, Malik.

143
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,400
I want to talk to you.

144
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,800
You are not a stupid man.

145
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,160
You are probably aware of my feelings towards you.

146
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,800
All I can see is you since you came here.

147
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,840
You are not like the others.

148
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,280
You've been always kind to me.

149
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,480
You little snake.

150
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,400
You didn’t push me away. You even let me cry on your shoulder.

151
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,680
And, my feelings towards you even more...

152
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,200
Zehra. Please, stop.

153
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,880
Let’s not take this conversation any further.

154
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,600
I don't have anything towards you besides friendly feelings.

155
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,280
If I did something that could be misinterpreted, I'm very sorry.

156
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,160
But there can’t be anything more than friendship between us.

157
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's assume we didn't have that conversation.

158
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,720
Hello Cemal, where are you?

159
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,360
I’m at the mansion, brother. Any news? Did you get your business done?

160
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,080
I’ve taken care of it. I bought the company that Nezir won the tender for.

161
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,920
As I said, they owed me. We've settled.

162
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,560
Brother do you hear what you say?

163
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,680
That Nezir we’re always on about, cheeky Nezir, is he working under us now?

164
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,640
For now. But I'll cancel the tender.

165
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,880
I don't work with people that doesn't have my trust, you know.

166
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
Let's handle the this matter now, the rest is easy.

167
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,640
Brother Ateş, you know that I trust your reason. There's no one you can't beat with your intelligence.

168
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,360
Thank you brother, tell Zahide to handle the procedures.

169
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,920
The other side’s lawyer will also reach her. She can call me if there’s any problem.

170
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,640
I’ll stop by the cemetery before I get to the mansion.

171
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,120
Okay brother.

172
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,880
You have no idea how badly I want the remaining 159 days to be over, so I can be rid of you.

173
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,520
I'm so tired of waking up to a new nightmare everyday.

174
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Speak.

175
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,840
What is it?

176
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,520
Ateş.

177
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,600
He bought the company in Bursa that handled the tender.

178
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,440
We need to teach him a good lesson.

179
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,480
Calm down now, Nezir.

180
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,000
Ateş put him here to keep an eye on me.

181
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,600
If he suspects anything, he will tell him right away.

182
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,200
This will be finished today.

183
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,320
Why isn't he calling?

184
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,560
''The person you call cannot be reached at the moment.''

185
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,840
Hello Yaşar, is Karahan at the office?

186
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,320
He wasn't there today?

187
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,200
Okay, thanks.

188
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,880
Where are you?

189
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
He's late.

190
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Not his style at all.

191
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
If I know him even a little, he should have arrived by now.

192
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,480
Where are you?

193
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,000
The person you have called can not be reached at the moment.

194
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Probably his battery ran out.

195
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Did he go to the meeting alone?

196
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hello. This is Mercan.

197
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Is Ateş Karahan there?

198
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Did he call?

199
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Understood.

200
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Best to check with Cemal.

201
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
If anyone knows, he does.

202
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,000
Nezir...

203
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,000
You're the vulture circling around me.

204
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
I know.

205
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,320
You can't stop me from seeing you.

206
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,000
Ateş korkusu seni sarmış.

207
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,200
It's penetrated your whole body.

208
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,640
I can smell your fear.

209
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
It's why you're attacking me so lowly.

210
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
You don't even have the courage to talk.

211
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Nezir, who can't get enough of losing.

212
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Is this how you plan to deal with me?

213
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,000
Same old you, congrats.

214
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,000
Strucked from shadows.

215
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It takes real nerve to attack someone who tied up.

216
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Bravo!

217
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So this is the full extent of your so called manhood.

218
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You do not even have the courage to fight me eye to eye.

219
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
This is why you are doomed to lose.

220
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,000
Don't hold back.

221
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,600
Hit me again.

222
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
This is your last chance.

223
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,000
I'll get out of here.

224
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,000
Sure of it.

225
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,600
And the moment I take my step outside...

226
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,800
...that is when your hell begins.

227
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,000
Cemal, have you spoken to Ateş recently?

228
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
No. I have not.

229
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I cannot reach him at all.

230
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
He said he had things to take care. He should be back soon.

231
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yes, he had things to do.
He sent a message earlier.

232
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We were supposed to go to a meeting together, but he is over half an hour late.

233
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
His phone is off too.

234
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
His battery must be dead.

235
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Don't worry.

236
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Or maybe he does not want to talk to you.

237
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,800
You know, after everything going on lately,

238
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
people get ideas stuck in their heads.

239
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I doubt it.

240
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
On the contrary, he would have called to torment me with his words.

241
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Am I the only one who finds it strange he did not show up or call?

242
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
This is not like him.

243
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
From what you say, I get the sense that you think Ateş is a predictable man.

244
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I think you are mistaken.

245
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What if I told you he called and told me to wait?

246
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Does it not still feel strange someone who did that would not show up?

247
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Maybe for you.

248
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But to me, it feels perfectly normal.

249
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,000
After all, we are talking about Ateş.

250
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,000
Excuse me, I need to make a call.

251
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Something definitely happened.

252
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I feel it in my bones.

253
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,800
What is it, my girl? That face again, a mile long.

254
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,600
I saw Mercan. Ruined my mood.

255
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,480
What were you talking about with Mercan just now?

256
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,000
Nothing important, Aslı.

257
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,000
She asked about Ateş.

258
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What does she want with Ateş?

259
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What business could she have with him?

260
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
They had a meeting.

261
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
When Ateş was late, she got worried.

262
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
She does not know he was going to visit the cemetery, of course.

263
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,000
The nerve of her.

264
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
As if a grown man owes her an explanation.

265
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
As if he has to report where he goes every minute.

266
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I think Ateş is doing this on purpose.

267
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
To punish her.

268
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,800
And he would be right to. That girl deserves worse.

269
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Do not you dare call Ateş and tell him Mercan is waiting.

270
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,800
Let him visit his family grave in peace.

271
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,600
Normally Ateş knows what he is doing. Give him some time, then I will call.

272
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,800
Come on, Ateş Karahan.

273
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
Let us see your bravado now.

274
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,360
This is how a man gets silenced.

275
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,360
I will cut that voice of yours forever.

276
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,960
You will never get under my feet again.

277
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Mercan will be mine.

278
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Do not leave him alone.

279
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,600
If he slips through your fingers, dig your own graves.

280
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,600
I will drop all of you with one bullet.

281
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
Alright, it matches the financial statements.

282
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Here, send the email.

283
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,800
Yes, Ms. Mercan.

284
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,200
Ms. Zahide, you know him well.

285
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,000
Where could he have gone? Any business, a meeting?

286
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,000
Other than the meeting he missed today, nothing else shows on his schedule.

287
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
He did not tell me anything personal either.

288
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Alright. If he calls, will you let me know please?

289
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Of course, Mercan.

290
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Do not worry. I will call you right away.

291
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Thanks.

292
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Where are you, Ateş?

293
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Pick up the phone already.

294
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You cannot reach him either, right?

295
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I am not exactly eager.

296
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
The farther he stays from me, the better.

297
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But I have a feeling.

298
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Something bad happened.

299
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
If there is something you know and I don't, tell me.

300
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I do not know more than you do.

301
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Does he have another phone?

302
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Some place he might go.

303
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
An old acquaintance, a friend.

304
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Maybe a woman.

305
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
No, nothing like that.

306
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Then where is this man?

307
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,000
Are we supposed to sit around like this, hands tied?

308
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,000
To be honest, now I am worried too.

309
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,000
Finally.

310
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,000
Alright, I'll check the places he might go.

311
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,000
Hopefully we get good news.

312
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,000
Hopefully.

313
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,000
Look at you.

314
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,000
Waiting to die, miserable and helpless.

315
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,000
Your life is between my lips, Mr. Ateş.

316
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,000
You picked the wrong man.

317
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,000
You must understand that by now.

318
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,360
Who is tougher, the hand or the lord?

319
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Yes, Nezir.

320
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Our prey is in the cage. Badly wounded.

321
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Good.

322
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,960
So he will wait to die in pain.

323
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,960
He will beg for death.

324
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,960
I would love to see Ateş Karahan at that moment.

325
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,800
But if I disappear too,

326
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Cemal will suspect both you and me.

327
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Once his voice goes quiet, they will start looking soon anyway.

328
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Let them look.

329
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The enemy is in our hands after all.

330
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Besides, whoever searches finds both fate and trouble, right?

331
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I am sure Cemal will find his trouble too.

332
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
We will catch him in our web like a fly.

333
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Two birds with one stone, huh?

334
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Exactly.

335
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Alright, we will be in touch.

336
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You look pleased, Haydar.

337
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
What is it?

338
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Something I do not know?

339
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You will learn, Nermin.

340
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Very soon.

341
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Why has the boy not come back yet? Does a grave visit take this long?

342
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
He's been under a lot of pressure lately.

343
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Maybe he wanted to be alone.

344
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,960
Clear his head.

345
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,960
He has gone off the grid like this before.

346
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
But he will come back, right?

347
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Let us hope so.

348
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Not hearing from him this long upsets me too.

349
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
I am starting to fear something happened.

350
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
God forbid, my son.

351
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,960
I called everywhere, everyone. Not a word from a single soul.

352
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
As a last resort, I asked a friend in the police.

353
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,960
They are checking the cameras. If anything comes up, he will let me know.

354
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,800
We are looking for Ateş outside,

355
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
but our enemies are right under our noses.

356
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
What if that snake bastard had his hand in this?

357
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Best thing is to go grab him by the collar.

358
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Wait, Mrs. Müzeyyen. He was at the mansion all day.

359
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And if anyone is going to demand answers, it will be me, not you.

360
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I do not trust that girl either.

361
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Cemal, what if they are plotting something against my son?

362
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Maybe she is part of it.

363
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
She might be acting worried so she does not look suspicious.

364
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It is not like that, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

365
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
She came to me before any of you, begging me to call Ateş.

366
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Lightning strikes, they are all the same.

367
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I will keep looking, Mother Müzeyyen.

368
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I am going for a walk in the garden. I feel suffocated.

369
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,760
Any news about Ateş Karahan, my girl?

370
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
No.

371
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
No one has seen or heard anything.

372
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,720
It is like the ground swallowed him.

373
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
Do you know where Ateş is?

374
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,720
No idea. I do not care either.

375
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Ateş Karahan is the last person I would worry about.

376
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,720
Watch your words when you talk about Ateş.

377
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,720
Or I will not watch mine, and you will regret it.

378
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Is this really the time to fight? We have bigger problems.

379
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,680
You are right. I will find Ateş first.

380
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,680
Then I will make you eat every word you said.

381
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,680
Do you not realize how serious this is, dad?

382
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,680
We have not heard from Ateş for hours.

383
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,400
Even if you hate him, show some respect for people’s concern.

384
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,200
What respect are you talking about?

385
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,280
Did this man not hold a gun to my head just yesterday?

386
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,600
How fast you forget.

387
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,680
I did not forget. I want to get rid of him too.

388
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,600
But that does not mean I want something to happen to him.

389
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,200
I will find him.

390
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,600
Haydar?

391
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,440
Are you involved in this?

392
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,080
Involved or not,

393
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,240
what had to happen happened.

394
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
Hello?

395
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Did you do something to Ateş?

396
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,160
What?

397
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
I do not understand what you are saying.

398
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,160
Ateş is missing.

399
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,160
No one can reach his phone.

400
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,280
If you are behind this,

401
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,280
if you hurt Ateş,

402
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
your death will be by my hand.

403
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,920
I will not spare that precious Mercan of yours either.

404
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,000
I will put her in the ground too. You will reunite there.

405
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,360
I admire your courage and audacity, honestly.

406
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,520
But I have nothing to do with this.

407
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,720
If someone did something to Ateş, good for them.

408
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,000
Everyone is tearing the place apart looking for you, Mr. Ateş.

409
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,320
They will find you, but as a corpse.

410
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,320
I need to go.

411
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,200
Keep an eye on this one too.

412
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,400
Do not get careless just because he is wounded.

413
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,400
As you wish.

414
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,600
I hope what you say is true, Nezir.

415
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,880
But if not,

416
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
if I learn you harmed Ateş,

417
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,080
I will tear you apart piece by piece.

418
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,120
I will not let you or Mercan live.

419
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,680
I will kill that Mercan you love so much right in front of your eyes.

420
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,480
Then you.

421
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,200
You made me cry.

422
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,200
I will never let you come together.

423
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,720
Zehra, what happened? Why are you crying?

424
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,600
How do you know I am crying?

425
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,600
I have pollen allergy.

426
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,640
That is why my eyes are watering.

427
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,720
Does not look like that to me. You look like you are really crying.

428
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,720
What is it to you what I am shedding? Mind your own business.

429
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,200
I have no business.

430
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,400
I saw you like this and thought I would help.

431
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,680
If you are fine, then I am fine.

432
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,720
I am fine. Perfectly fine.

433
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,200
Well I will be damned.

434
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,240
She says she is fine and cries at the same time.

435
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,400
Do people cry from being fine?

436
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,200
Man, I do not understand women.

437
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,800
I swear, I do not.

438
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,400
Any news?

439
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,000
Not yet.

440
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,200
We are waiting for a word from our friends at the station.

441
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,960
While the lady strolls around the mansion,

442
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,560
we have no idea where Ateş is or whether he is alive or dead.

443
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,760
Do you have no shame at all?

444
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,000
You stand there mocking us, pretending to be worried about Ateş.

445
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,200
We are not buying your act.

446
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,360
Tell us where my son is.

447
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,080
What are you doing, are you insane? Let go of me.

448
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,200
Talk, or did that damn father of yours do something to my son?

449
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,720
Speak, or I will kill you. What did you do to my Ateş?

450
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,560
Let her go, Ms. Müzeyyen. Calm down.

451
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,000
Please, calm down.

452
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,600
Is this really the time for shouting and fighting?

453
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,520
She knows. She knows everything.

454
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,600
I know how to make her talk.

455
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,320
Mrs. Müzeyyen, until Ateş comes back, no one touches Mercan.

456
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,200
If anyone tries, they will answer to me.

457
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,720
Well done. You defend that snake too.

458
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,000
I am not defending anyone.

459
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,400
My only concern is Ateş. Mercan is Ateş’s wife, nothing more.

460
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,480
Let Ateş come back. Let me understand what is going on.

461
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,560
If you are behind this, then I know exactly what I will do to you.

462
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,840
I cannot even think about what you would do to me right now.

463
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,440
Whether you believe me or not, there is only one thing on my mind.

464
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,880
Your son.

465
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,120
I will do everything to find him alive and bring him home.

466
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,480
Instead of coming at me, you should do the same.

467
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,720
The nerve of her. Giving advice on top of it.

468
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:43,720
Çay elinden öteye, gidelum yali yali, gidelum yali yali, gidelum yali.

469
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,400
Çiçek, maybe you should see a doctor, my girl.

470
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,920
Your moods beats the weather of the Black Sea.

471
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,000
Snow, storm, sunshine all in one day.

472
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,720
You look very happy today, mashallah.

473
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,200
Why should I not be happy, mom?

474
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,200
Look at the weather. Clear and sunny. We are healthy.

475
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,200
We have work, thank God.

476
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,200
We woke up to a beautiful day.

477
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,400
May it be easy.

478
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,720
Thanks dear.

479
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,080
Have you heard about Mr. Ateş?

480
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,360
What happened to him?

481
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,720
They say no one can reach him.

482
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,000
How come?

483
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,720
His phone is probably off. Battery dead.

484
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,280
I don't know, it didn't feel like that to me.

485
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,360
They looked worried.

486
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,720
I don't get what's happening to this mansion. Let me know if you can.

487
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,400
Seriously. Endless trouble.

488
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,880
Even our faces stopped smiling.

489
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,360
God protect us all, Inshallah.

490
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,880
Amen. Hopefully nothing bad happens.

491
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,000
Hopefully, son.

492
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,200
Alright everyone, calm down.

493
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,680
There is nothing yet. The kitchen became a summer panic already.

494
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,800
The man probably went out. He is young. Hanging out.

495
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,000
Remember, girl? I disappeared for a few days too.

496
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,200
I went camping with friends without telling my mother.

497
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,800
Turns out there was no signal either.

498
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,680
Do not remind me. Took years off my life.

499
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,680
Those two days never ended. You irresponsible thing.

500
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,680
So what happened after?

501
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,280
What would happen? A proper mother scolding.

502
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,240
A painful slipper of justice.

503
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,680
What did you think?

504
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,680
You deserved it.

505
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,680
So, what is for dinner?

506
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,680
Stuffed vegetables, son.

507
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,680
Nothing else?

508
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,680
Why are you looking at me like that, mom?

509
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,680
I am hungry. Would you not ask?

510
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,680
Hunger is one thing, pain is another. Right?

511
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,480
Do not laugh!

512
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,120
What are you laughing at?

513
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,800
Allah Allah...

514
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,360
I did not want to cry, sorry.

515
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,880
I will try to be stronger.

516
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,600
You do not have to be strong.

517
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,440
Sometimes the greatest courage is asking for help.

518
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,600
Is that really you saying this?

519
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,600
Do what I say, not what I do.

520
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,600
And do not apologize for crying.

521
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,600
People apologize when they make mistakes.

522
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Crying is not one of them.

523
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,600
On the contrary, it shows your heart has not frozen.

524
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,600
What about you?

525
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,600
Do you cry, or has your heart frozen?

526
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,600
Depends on who is in front of me.

527
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Ice for some, volcano for others.

528
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,600
I give everyone what they deserve.

529
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,600
Nezir, come here.

530
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,600
This is your last chance.

531
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,600
If you are planning anything about Ateş, you stop right now. Do you hear?

532
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
What are you talking about?

533
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,600
I think you know exactly what I mean.

534
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Stop playing dumb and answer me.

535
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,600
You never really knew me, Cemal bro.

536
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,600
I will not bow to threats from a servant like you.

537
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,600
What did you just call me?

538
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,600
A servant.

539
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,600
I gave you a chance, Nezir.

540
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,600
Now talk, answer me.

541
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
You're wasting your breath.

542
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,640
Since I am wasting my breath,

543
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,520
then I will not spend another second on trash like you.

544
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,760
I said what's needed to be said.

545
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,600
Rest is on you.

546
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Your cheek is fine boy.

547
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,240
You waved a red rag at a bull with that move, Cemal.

548
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Your end has come as well.

549
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,800
Any news from Mr. Ateş?

550
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,800
No, my dear.

551
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,240
You have not been knitting for a long time, have you?

552
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,720
What is going on?

553
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,720
What should I do, my girl?

554
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,720
When my hands are empty, I get bored.

555
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,720
Winter came, I thought I would knit a scarf for Berat.

556
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,720
Look, how is the pattern?

557
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,720
It is beautiful, mom. Bless your hands.

558
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,720
I used to have more patience.

559
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,720
I knitted more. Now I get bored easily.

560
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:25,600
In our time, young people were shy to say I love you to their husbands.

561
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,600
There was no habit of going to buy gifts either.

562
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
We showed our love with our own labor.

563
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Sometimes stitch by stitch,

564
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,600
sometimes needle by needle.

565
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,600
Time came and went like a storm.

566
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,600
It took our youth away.

567
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,600
We did not know its value.

568
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,600
So you will know it.

569
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,600
You will not waste your days.

570
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,600
You will live fully.

571
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,600
Life passes like that.

572
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,600
One day you cry, one day you laugh.

573
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,600
That is why youth must be cherished.

574
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,600
What are you staring at?

575
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Nothing.

576
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,600
I heard a noise, thought I would look.

577
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,600
It is nothing.

578
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Ateş.

579
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,600
I found you.

580
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
Here you are.

581
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
I worried so much about you.

582
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,600
Worrried so much...

583
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,600
I knew you were not well from the ache in my heart.

584
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,600
But look, I am here.

585
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
I am with you.

586
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,600
Come on, open your eyes.

587
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,560
Look at me.

588
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,560
Look into my eyes.

589
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,880
You cannot leave me alone.

590
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,000
Come on, get up.

591
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,640
Take my hand.

592
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,120
Let us get out of here together.

593
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,560
Let us go on with our lives hand in hand.

594
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,000
Mercan...

595
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,560
Is that you?

596
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,680
Ateş.

597
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,280
Come on.

598
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,600
Where are you? I'm waiting.

599
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,480
Ateş.

600
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,680
I'm waiting for you?

601
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,600
Come on.

602
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,960
I'm waiting for you?

603
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,280
Come on.

604
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,960
Ateş.

605
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,480
Come on, I'm waiting.

606
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,680
Where were you?

607
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,960
I worried so much.

608
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,800
I have been waiting here for so long.

609
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,360
This feeling...

610
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,360
Is it real?

611
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,080
It is.

612
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,280
Nothing ever been more real.

613
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,360
You are here.

614
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,360
I am.

615
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,080
I knew you would come.

616
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,880
How did you?

617
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,680
Because you always came.

618
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,360
And I never stopped waiting.

619
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:33,360
I told myself that this story cannot end like this.

620
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,360
It won't.

621
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,080
It won't end here.

622
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,360
Even if they tie me up, even if they imprison me...

623
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,240
I'll get out and...

624
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,120
Come on.

625
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,360
Where are you, Ateş?

626
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,360
Where are you?

627
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,360
Something definitely happened to him.

628
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,480
There is no other explanation.

629
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,080
I feel it.

630
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,480
Something definitely happened.

631
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,480
Any news from the camera footage?

632
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,480
No, nothing yet.

633
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,360
I am waiting to hear from the commissioner too.

634
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,360
I am very worried, Cemal.

635
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,360
Do not worry. Ateş has been through many storms.

636
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,360
After storms like that, he grows stronger.

637
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,360
He knows how to take care of himself.

638
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,880
Do not mind me getting angry and worried.

639
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,880
My worry is different.

640
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,600
He throws himself into adventures alone, without telling me.

641
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,200
You two are very close.

642
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,880
So what do we do now? Where do we look?

643
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,360
There are a few places to check.

644
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,360
I will go to the ones I have not checked yet.

645
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,360
Before that, I am waiting for the commissioner.

646
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,360
Let me call him.

647
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,360
I am coming with you.

648
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,280
You are not going anywhere.

649
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,360
Hello, commissioner.

650
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,360
What is the situation?

651
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:44,960
Hello?

652
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,080
What do you care where I am, woman?

653
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,360
Cut it out.

654
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,360
I cannot deal with your nagging now.

655
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,280
I said I will come in a few days.

656
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,640
Tell the boy not to cry.

657
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,360
Say his father will buy him a toy car.

658
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,560
Look here.

659
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,080
Come on.

660
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,480
Come on.

661
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,360
Alright, commissioner.

662
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,360
I asked everyone I know too.

663
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,360
I have a few places to check.

664
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,960
We will talk again.

665
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,360
They checked the cameras, still nothing.

666
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,680
They will keep checking.

667
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,480
Let's go. We're losing time.

668
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,200
What is this?

669
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,440
Got a location from an unknown number.

670
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,280
What location?

671
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,000
This is Ateş.

672
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,600
Hello?

673
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,360
Cemal, it's me.

674
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,880
Bro, can you hear me?

675
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,360
Cemal it's me, can you hear?

676
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,360
Cemal.

677
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,360
Ateş, hello? Is this you, bro?

678
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,720
What is it?

679
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,280
Hello!

680
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,360
Cemal it's me. Can you hear me?

681
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,360
Cemal!
Take this too.

682
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,560
No, this is enough. I am not that hungry.

683
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,680
Eat it. We are still here.

684
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,800
So you were planning to escape the cage.

685
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,080
That was the plan.

686
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,360
Guys, look here.

687
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,360
Tie him up.

688
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,000
Let go.
Sit.

689
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,560
Behave.

690
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,480
What happened, call again.

691
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,880
It came from a hidden number, I cannot call back.

692
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,760
I am going straight to the location.
You wait here.

693
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,680
No, I am coming.

694
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,280
No. Get out of the car.

695
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,880
I am not getting out.

696
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,760
Mercan, this message might be a trap.

697
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,080
I do not know what is waiting for me there.

698
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,960
I cannot risk anything happening to you.

699
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,880
Do not worry, I can take care of myself.

700
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,480
You are entrusted to me. I said get out.

701
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,840
I am in a hurry.

702
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,800
Then step on it. Let us go fast.

703
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,360
Ateş was right.

704
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,400
About what?

705
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:50,920
Cemal.

706
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:53,960
Cemal.

707
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,680
Cemal, where are you going?

708
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,880
Yes, Aslı?

709
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,360
I saw you, I ran but could not catch you.

710
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,200
Where are you going?

711
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,680
Any news about Ateş?

712
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,040
Aslı, nothing definite yet.

713
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,800
I will let you know when there is.

714
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,680
Why is Mercan with you?

715
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,520
I will explain later. I do not want to tie up the phone now.

716
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,160
I hope the location came from Ateş.

717
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,360
I hope so too.

718
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,360
Hopefully we will find Ateş safe and sound.

719
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,840
Hopefully.

720
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,640
What's going on dear?

721
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,280
Cemal and Mercan jumped into the car and left.

722
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:54,480
He did not give details, but probably there is news about Ateş.

723
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,080
I hope everything is alright Inshallah.

724
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,840
Inshallah but I don't get it.

725
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,960
Why did Mercan go as well?

726
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,840
While I am here.

727
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,120
Why did Cemal not say anything?

728
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,360
He must be hiding something.

729
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,360
Something definitely happened to Ateş.

730
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,360
God, protect him.

731
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:21,200
Do not think bad thoughts, mom.

732
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,960
They will return with good news Inshallah.

733
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,520
Inshallah.

734
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,360
You are searching for nothing.

735
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:37,360
Ateş Karahan already reached the end of the road.

736
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,920
Would you like another one?

737
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,040
No, this is enough, thank you.

738
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,680
Any new information about Mr. Ateş?

739
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,080
No, not that I know of.

740
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,560
Ms. Mercan was feeling so sad.

741
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,560
Isn't it natural?

742
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,120
They gave each other a promise with those signatures.

743
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:47,360
I believe with all my heart that Mr. Ateş will return.

744
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,840
With Ms. Mercan’s love, he will overcome this trouble.

745
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:51,880
He will return to his wife.

746
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:59,360
Because no one and nothing can break the vow they made at the wedding table.

747
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:09,360
In our time, young people were shy to say I love you.

748
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,360
There was no habit of buying gifts.

749
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,360
We showed love with our own labor,

750
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,360
stitch by stitch,

751
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,360
needle by needle.

752
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,360
Malik.

753
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,360
I...

754
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,120
I...

755
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,880
Should I pour you another tea?

756
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,760
I already said I did not want any.

757
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,760
Right.

758
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,760
I forgot.

759
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,760
You... I mean, your cheeks are glowing.

760
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,760
Are you alright?

761
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,760
Yes.

762
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,680
We need to talk about something important.

763
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,200
This is the location.

764
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,040
But there is nothing here?

765
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,360
You stay here, wait in the car.

766
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,240
No.

767
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,720
Yes you will, I'll check first.

768
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,360
But I am coming too.

769
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,720
Mercan, I said no.

770
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,800
You already came this far, I did not say a word.

771
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,280
But I cannot explain the rest to Ateş.

772
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,520
You stay in the car. I will check.

773
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,800
Do not drag it out. Come on.

774
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,520
We got the message.

775
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,920
We'll finish you off and leave.

776
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:04,960
Tell them to gather.

777
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,840
As you wish.

778
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,000
What are you looking at?

779
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,480
I look before killing.

780
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,760
It is tradition.

781
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,360
Should I be scared now?

782
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,480
We have company.

783
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,880
I am coming.

784
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,360
You seem a little scared.

785
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,040
I will come.

786
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,320
Wait.

787
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,360
Do not be late.

788
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,720
Do not worry.

789
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,360
Come on, Cemal.

790
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,040
My lion.

791
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:55,640
I am here, brother.

792
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,080
Where to, brother?

793
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,000
Out for a walk, brother.

794
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,880
We said we came for a stroll, brother.

795
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,000
Thank God.

796
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,560
What are you doing here?

797
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,160
Do not move.

798
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,680
Why did you come?

799
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,960
Oh, Mercan.

800
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,960
Get inside. Move.

801
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,360
Don’t you ever touch her again.

802
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,280
Don’t push me like that again.

803
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,280
What are you going to do?

804
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,640
Huh?

805
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,960
Mercan. Mercan.

806
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,200
Are you okay?

807
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,760
Are you injured?

808
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,320
I'm fine.

809
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,400
What did you just do?

810
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,320
I warned him. He didn’t listen. What was I supposed to do?

811
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,880
This is too tight.

812
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,920
You beat up a guy but can’t untie a rope?

813
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,280
How did you even get here? Where’s Cemal?

814
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:53,800
He went to find you. He told me to wait in the car, but I didn’t.

815
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,480
Are we surprised? Of course not.

816
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,960
Call Cemal.

817
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,760
I don't have my phone.

818
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:03,640
As soon as I got your location, I left the house and got in the car.

819
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,280
God, give me patience.

820
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:10,320
Don’t complain. I was worried about you, I didn’t think of the phone. Sorry.

821
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:14,680
I’m not complaining. They’ll be here any minute. Hurry up.

822
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:17,160
I'm doing my best, it won’t come loose.

823
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,320
Then get away from here, now.

824
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,040
I will never leave.

825
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,280
I said go. They’re coming. Listen to me.

826
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,440
I told you, I’m not leaving.

827
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,520
I said go.

828
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,960
I can’t protect you with my hands tied.

829
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,520
I said I'm not leaving.

830
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,520
I said go. They'll be here any minute.

831
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,720
God, I’m grateful.

832
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,720
What will we do with him, boss?

833
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,640
Leave him here, a feast for the wolves.

834
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,800
Let her go. I said let her go.

835
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,200
Let go of my arm.

836
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,960
As you command, Your Majesty.

837
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,360
Let go of me. I said let go.

838
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,360
Get your hands off her.

839
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,760
Let go of me.

840
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,000
Stay still.

841
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,360
I said let go.

842
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,800
You hear that? He says let her go.

843
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,640
What should we do, let her go?

844
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,720
This is between you and me. Let her go.

845
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:43,400
Tough luck. It’s your bad day. Actually… the worst day.

846
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:49,240
Pretty girl too. What a shame…

847
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:55,720
Let go.

848
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,480
Hold him properly.

849
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,360
I said let go.

850
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,760
Don't touch her.

851
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,920
I'll make you regret it, you'll all pay for this.

852
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:10,680
See? Your husband’s angry because we upset you.

853
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:24,000
You couldn’t hold one damn guy?

854
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:39,000
Are you staying calm or not?

855
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,520
Fine, lower the gun or you'll regret it.

856
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,840
Come on.

857
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:05,720
Tie him tight. Don’t let it get loose again.

858
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,480
We tied them both, boss.

859
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,160
Let's go.

860
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,040
You okay, right?

861
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:37,120
I'm okay. Don’t worry about me.

862
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,400
Too late for that.

863
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:45,680
You shouldn’t have come. Why did you even come?

864
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,640
I was worried about you.

865
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:52,240
It was too obvious something happened, I sensed it.

866
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,640
She sensed it.

867
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,920
I couldn’t just stay at the mansion.

868
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,760
Sometimes you should.

869
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,760
I just wanted to help.

870
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,680
What if something happened to you?

871
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,840
You really helped, thanks a lot.

872
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,600
If you had untied my hands, we’d be gone by now.

873
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:22,840
Actually, I untied them.

874
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,520
But you were too slow.

875
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,760
But it was really tight.

876
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:30,400
Is it all my fault now?

877
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,760
Of course not.

878
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,960
I just have to worry about you now.

879
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,360
What’s so wrong about caring for each other?

880
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:47,920
But you’re right.

881
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,080
There are people worth worrying about, and people you regret worrying about.

882
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:58,600
I’m scared of something happening to you. Don’t you get it?

883
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,040
It's my fault.

884
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:05,600
I wish I didn't come.

885
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,880
And they would...

886
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:18,120
Our only hope is Cemal right now.

887
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,120
I hope he's okay.

888
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,560
He is. He’s fine. Nothing will happen to him.

889
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,360
What?

890
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:59,080
Things got active here, boss. We were about to take him out when guests showed up.

891
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,800
What guests?

892
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,400
Mercan and some guy raided the place. The guy’s finished. We caught Mercan too.

893
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:10,920
What the hell are you saying? What do you mean Mercan came? How could she come?

894
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:16,880
I don’t know how, but that’s the situation. Everything’s under control now.

895
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,320
Mercan is okay, right?

896
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:26,600
She’s fine, boss. She's strong as hell. We tied her up.

897
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:31,680
What should I do with Ateş? Should I finish him off?

898
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:36,600
Every single thing about that man turns into a problem with you, Mercan.

899
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:45,320
Wait for my word. And listen carefully, If anything happens to Mercan, consider yourself dead.

900
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,240
Damn it, Mercan.

901
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,480
You ruined the whole plan.

902
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,320
We’ll get out of here. You’re not scared, are you?

903
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,840
I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t.

904
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:10,960
But you’re here. For some reason that calms me.

905
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:17,080
As long as I’m alive, no one can lay a finger on you.

906
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,800
I know.

907
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,600
You should never have come here.

908
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:45,120
Cemal wouldn't take you with him, but you didn't listen. Next time, listen to me. Don’t go against my word.

909
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:47,800
See?

910
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,240
This happens when you don't listen.

911
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,600
Good or bad, I’m not going to sit in the mansion watching TV while you’re like this.

912
01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:00,160
Even if I knew this would happen, I’d still come.

913
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,440
Who did this? Why?

914
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,920
It's obvious who did it.

915
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,360
I don’t know, but I’ll find out.

916
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,920
And when I do, they’ll regret it.

917
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:31,240
There’s still no word from Cemal. What if something happened?

918
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:35,760
If you knew what Cemal’s survived, you wouldn’t worry.

919
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:41,240
Long ago, they ambushed him. They broke his arms, legs, everything.

920
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:47,480
But my brother came back from the brink in the hospital. He took every one of them down.

921
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:52,360
My brother is strong. He won’t be brought down by a coward’s blow.

922
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,040
I'm sure we’ll get out of here.

923
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:08,880
But if we can't, I want to say this. You blamed me unfairly for the tender. I didn’t do it.

924
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,960
Is that really your only concern right now?

925
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,680
Yes, it is.

926
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,920
I can’t stand injustice.

927
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,800
If I’d done it, I’d admit it. You’d just yell at me.

928
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,000
So that's it?

929
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:26,680
That's about it.

930
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,040
You wouldn't hurt me.

931
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,640
Other than yelling, of course.

932
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,800
Look, we have big problems with you.

933
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:45,440
But know this: I wouldn’t even betray my enemy.

934
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,320
Just wanted to let you know.

935
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,760
I don't want you to think wrong of me.

936
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:59,520
We might not survive this. These may be our last words, our last seconds.

937
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,800
I didn't want to hold it in.

938
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:17,040
If it came to that, what would upset you the most?

939
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,520
What would be left unfinished inside you?

940
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,560
Not keeping my promises, would upset me.

941
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:19,440
I have a plan.

942
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,440
Is something wrong?

943
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,000
Mercan is there.

944
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,000
What?

945
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:44,280
How? What is she doing there?

946
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:45,800
I don't know.

947
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,560
But the whole plan is ruined.

948
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,240
I should have known.

949
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:57,680
I should have understood when they left with Cemal. Why is she doing this?

950
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,920
Why does she ruin all my plans?

951
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:05,280
Just as we had the opportunity to finish the Karahans off, why the hell she goes there?

952
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:08,360
What about Cemal?

953
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,600
They said he died.

954
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,880
What are we going to do now?

955
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:20,280
There is no going back.

956
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:24,520
We are close to the end.

957
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:29,840
I can’t let one person’s mistake ruin everyone’s interest.

958
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,960
What, are you going to sacrifice Mercan too?

959
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:37,960
Can you save her without sacrificing her? Mercan wanted this.

960
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:39,200
No way.

961
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,120
I won't give up on Mercan.

962
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:45,200
But Mercan gave up on us, by going there.

963
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I'll handle it.

964
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,160
Don’t do anything crazy without telling me.

965
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,440
You’re the one being crazy.

966
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:11,120
In this world, sentimentality leads only to death.

967
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,520
Look over here.

968
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:24,920
What the hell you want?

969
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,840
Where is your owner?

970
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:31,760
Did he run off and leave you here?

971
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:35,000
Looks like your leash is remote-controlled.

972
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,600
What the hell are you talking about, leash?

973
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,560
You’re the one on a leash here.

974
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:49,240
Looks like you’re itching, but you can't reach. Do you want me to scratch you?

975
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,680
You’re carrying some weight, huh?

976
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,480
May your hands break.

977
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,280
Stay calm, stay quiet.

978
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:28,120
God knows I'll put you to sleep, understood?

979
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,440
You too.

980
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:34,080
Stay still.

981
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,200
Stay still.

982
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,640
Are you okay? Did it hurt?

983
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,440
I'm fine.

984
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,240
It worked.

985
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,400
What are you doing? Have you gone mad?

986
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,760
Yes I've gone mad.

987
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,160
You drove me crazy.

988
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,320
Where is Ateş?

989
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:35,560
How should I know?

990
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:38,760
I said, where is Ateş?

991
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:41,920
I don't know.

992
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,440
He has plenty of enemies; one of them might have wasted him.

993
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:49,000
If you lay a hand on Ateş, I won't let you live.

994
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:53,720
I’ll find you and kill you, even if you go to the other side of the world.

995
01:46:53,840 --> 01:47:00,960
Remember what you said? ''You’re either crazy in love or pure evil.'' I’m both. Do you understand?

996
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:06,760
If you lay a hand on my love, you have no idea what I'm capable of.

997
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,200
I don't know where he is.

998
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:11,920
Am I supposed to watch that bastard?

999
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:14,880
Find out who is it, and kill them, not me.

1000
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,960
Your whole family is crazy.

1001
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,040
You’ve completely lost it.

1002
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:20,400
Insane people.

1003
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,320
You're insane. Insane.

1004
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:42,080
What the hell is going on? Who are you?

1005
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:48,560
Shoot them if they move.

1006
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,800
What is this nonsense? What are you trying to do?

1007
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,400
Enough is enough.

1008
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:04,920
Ateş is missing. If anything happens to him, you’ll all leave this house in body bags.

1009
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:15,640
If you did this, I won’t leave you to them. I’ll tear you both apart alive.

1010
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:23,520
If anyone causes trouble, shoot them.

1011
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:25,920
My daughter is also missing.

1012
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,960
I’m just as worried as you are.

1013
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,320
You’re so wrong, woman. So wrong.

1014
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,480
Don’t forget, there’s always tomorrow.

1015
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,000
Shut your mouth.

1016
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:42,240
I'm not going to learn right from wrong from a lowlife like you.

1017
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:50,960
Besides, it’s still not clear whether there’s a tomorrow for you.

1018
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,280
If they move, shoot.

1019
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:15,120
Listen to me carefully. After I untie you, hide behind the door.

1020
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:19,840
And once the men get inside, you run with all your strength. Understood?

1021
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,200
I’m not leaving you alone here.

1022
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:24,600
I can take care of myself. You saw that.

1023
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,200
No arguing. Do as I say.

1024
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,200
We only have on chance, we have to use it right.

1025
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:34,200
But...

1026
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,600
Do what I say.

1027
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,840
Go behind the door.

1028
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,640
Hello.

1029
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,720
Look over here.

1030
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,680
What are you doing? Go over there.

1031
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,960
Don't worry, I got it.

1032
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:26,280
Lord, give me patience.

1033
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:31,960
What the hell is going on here? Who untied you?

1034
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,320
Calm down.

1035
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:12,720
Let's go.

1036
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:34,920
To where?

1037
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:07,080
Wow, look at who I’m married to.

1038
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:14,600
I’ve got a few moves too.

1039
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:18,200
Let's go.

1040
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:05,880
Just don’t shoot me.

1041
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:09,400
Even now, you’re throwing jabs. I can't believe you.

1042
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,720
Come on, we have to go.

1043
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,600
There’s no escape.

1044
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:07,320
From here, it doesn’t look that way.

1045
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:55,120
Your time’s up. Say hello to the other side for me.

1046
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:39,240
Tell your cursed greetings yourself.

1047
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,040
Are you okay?

1048
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:44,920
You’re fine, right?

1049
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,360
I'm okay. I’m fine.

1050
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,000
Are you okay?

1051
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:49,960
I'm fine.

1052
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:51,720
Just a bit shaken up.

1053
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,040
I can't tell.

1054
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:56,360
Let's go before they wake up.

1055
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:39,920
You.

1056
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:42,240
Go around the back.

1057
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,160
You come with me.

1058
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:47,480
Don't come back until you catch them.

1059
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Farewell, Çiçek.

1060
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,360
Take care…

1061
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,440
That’s all I ask.

1062
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,080
What’s up?

1063
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:43,440
I’m going back to my hometown. I got my plane ticket a few days ago. Look.

1064
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:46,960
Look.

1065
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:50,480
I don't care about the tickets. Mrs. Müzeyyen said no one leaves.

1066
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:55,640
Please, for God’s sake. I’m going to miss the flight. Besides, what do I even have to do with Mr. Ateş?

1067
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:57,880
It’s an order.

1068
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:06,120
Alright.

1069
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:29,400
''The person you have called cannot be reached at the moment. Leave a message.''

1070
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,280
Ateş is missing, Cemal is missing, where are they?

1071
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:36,880
Haydar. Haydar.

1072
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:43,760
Pray that Ateş shows up. Otherwise, I’ll kill you so slowly you’ll be begging for mercy. You’ll be wishing for Ateş instead.

1073
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:45,520
Still no news.

1074
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:50,600
I’m dying of curiosity.

1075
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:54,000
Don't worry dear, they'll come.

1076
02:00:55,480 --> 02:01:00,800
Both my lions will enter through this door. There’s no other way. This is the only way.

1077
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,320
Are you okay? You’re fine, right?

1078
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:29,480
I'm fine.

1079
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:31,840
I'm so tired.

1080
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:34,040
Hang in there a little longer.

1081
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,200
Let's not waste time, come. Give me your hand.

1082
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:45,800
Don't run. Come here.

1083
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:52,040
There's no escape.

1084
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,120
God damn it.

1085
02:01:57,400 --> 02:02:01,640
Split into two. Find them. I’ll kill them.

1086
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:10,040
Put more flour in there, dear.

1087
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:11,960
Okay, mom.

1088
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:19,880
May God allow him to return home safely.

1089
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,720
Hope so.

1090
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,680
I hope nothing bad happens.

1091
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:26,680
God forbid, girl. Hope nothing bad comes out.

1092
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:28,600
Yes, God forbid.

1093
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:37,000
If anything happens to Mr. Ateş, Müzeyyen would shoot all of us and burn the mansion down, I’m telling you.

1094
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:38,840
Well, that’s true.

1095
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:48,400
Don’t prepare too much for tonight. Mr. Ateş and Mr. Cemal aren’t here. No one has an appetite anyway.

1096
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:50,200
Mrs. Mercan is also missing.

1097
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,880
Ah yes, she isn’t here. Just a detail.

1098
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,960
Dear mom...

1099
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:21,480
Thanks.

1100
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:32,600
Son, find a broom or something, come on. We're busy.

1101
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:37,120
You broke the glass, and she just picked up the spoon. Do you see that?

1102
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:39,680
That’s her limit, really.

1103
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:02,680
Still off.

1104
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:06,120
Where are you, Mercan…

1105
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:10,000
I brought you coffee.

1106
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:14,000
Burak, I’m not in the mood to work at all.

1107
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:18,200
I didn’t come to work. Looks like you just need to talk.

1108
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:22,400
I can’t reach Mercan. This isn’t normal.

1109
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:23,680
What if something happens?

1110
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:25,040
It won’t.

1111
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:34,760
I’ve never understood how someone can be both so fragile and so strong at the same time. If you got to know her closer, you’d be both shocked and in awe.

1112
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:46,200
Everyone wants to appear good, but Mercan proved that she is truly a good person, not just in appearance, through every challenge we faced.

1113
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:56,520
If someone will sacrifice themselves in a situation, don’t look anywhere else, it’s always Mercan. She never allows anyone else to get hurt.

1114
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:02,000
She’d rather be broken herself, as long as you stay safe.

1115
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:04,080
You explained it beautifully.

1116
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:10,520
And I barely scratched the surface. You can’t describe such an amazing person.

1117
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:14,360
Have you been friends with Mrs. Mercan for a long time?

1118
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:15,880
A very long time.

1119
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:23,360
Don't worry, Mrs. Mercan will come back safely. A person like her doesn’t break easily.

1120
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:28,960
You’re right, Burak. Talking really helped, thank you.

1121
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,520
You're welcome.

1122
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:22,520
Where the hell are you?

1123
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:42,240
We really need your stubbornness right now.

1124
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:45,760
Come on.

1125
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:54,040
Someone was there.

1126
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:09,800
You're okay, right?

1127
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:11,720
I'm fine.

1128
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:14,520
Let's go, come on.

1129
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:24,760
You’ve been shot.

1130
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:39,760
Why is she so worried about me?

1131
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:58,960
Back in our day, young people were too shy to say ‘I love you’ to their partners or husbands. Buying gifts from the market wasn’t a thing either.

1132
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:07,560
So we’d show our love with our own hands; sometimes weaving it stitch by stitch, sometimes sewing it, needle by needle.

1133
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:32,720
What are you doing, girl?

1134
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:35,360
Nothing, just sitting, mom.

1135
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:39,040
Oh, I'm too tired.

1136
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:45,120
I’m so tired, so tired. And I didn’t even do anything.

1137
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:51,560
Feels like my body’s just falling apart. When you’re not at peace, this is what happens, girl.

1138
02:09:52,080 --> 02:10:05,040
There’s no peace at home; we don’t even have the energy to lift a hand. When there’s no peace, even a feather bed feels like a nail-studded bench.

1139
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:08,200
True, but...

1140
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:10,600
What about Mrs. Mercan?

1141
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:16,520
She married without love. Lived more like enemies than husband and wife.

1142
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:20,840
Yet she risked herself chasing Mr. Ateş.

1143
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:22,960
It's very strange.

1144
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:28,560
That strange thing is the life itself.

1145
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:33,000
Do you really think love happens at first sight?

1146
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:41,160
There are many kinds of love in this world. Some start with fights and arguments, and gradually find their rhythm.

1147
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:44,560
In fact, that’s the strongest kind.

1148
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:55,120
Because it involves truly getting to know each other, building the life together, fixing the flaws together. It requires effort, real effort.

1149
02:10:55,600 --> 02:11:00,640
And it’s that effort that bonds two people at the deepest level.

1150
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:04,560
And that bond doesn't break so easily.

1151
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:08,920
Well, once you fear losing someone…

1152
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:22,920
the feelings they’ve coddled, pleaded with, and hidden even from themselves burst out like raging waters.

1153
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:33,200
When someone is by your side, when you know you’ll find them every time you reach out your hand, you act carelessly, thinking, they’re right here, they’re mine.

1154
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:48,840
But today it’s here, tomorrow it’s there. Once the fear of losing enters the heart, love swells like the waves of our Black Sea and knocks a person flat.

1155
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,640
My beautiful girl.

1156
02:11:56,480 --> 02:12:04,400
If half of love is happiness, the other half is pain. If half is peace, the other half is restlessness.

1157
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:12,840
No matter what happens, one must stand by one’s love, of course if they’ve found the right person.

1158
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:22,000
But I know. I know my daughter will do what’s most beautiful, what’s most right.

1159
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:26,640
I embroidered her heart stitch by stitch, like lace.

1160
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:33,360
My flower, my beautiful girl...

1161
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:48,000
Thankfully, the bullet just grazed your arm.

1162
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:04,160
How do you feel?

1163
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:07,960
I’m fine.

1164
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:17,840
Not quite. If you were, the bleeding would’ve stopped. Stay still so I can bandage the wound properly.

1165
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:21,080
It doesn’t hurt. I don’t feel anything.

1166
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:24,400
I guess your pain threshold is high.

1167
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:30,280
Yes.

1168
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:32,160
A bullet is nothing to me.

1169
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:33,560
Excuse me?

1170
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:43,360
I’m saying if we linger any longer, we’ll get wounds that really hurt. We need to go.

1171
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:51,320
I’m so sorry. I usually have a light touch.

1172
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:12,680
We have to go.

1173
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:33,680
Mother was right. What does a person stand up for in this world? Their honor and their love.

1174
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:38,160
I stood up for my honor, but my love?

1175
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:42,720
It can't go like this.

1176
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:45,920
I’m going to tell Malik everything.

1177
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:55,640
Malik, where are you? Where did you go?

1178
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:32,440
You, that way. Let’s corner them.

1179
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:54,920
Stop.

1180
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:01,480
Don’t be afraid, I’m here.

1181
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:03,520
Nothing will happen to you.

1182
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:07,880
Let’s settle it man to man.

1183
02:19:08,480 --> 02:19:10,040
Let the girl go.

1184
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,840
You’re not in a position to bargain right now.

1185
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:23,520
Two is better than one.

1186
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:28,440
You’re both finished.
