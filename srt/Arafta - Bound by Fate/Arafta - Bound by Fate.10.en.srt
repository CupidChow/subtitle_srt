1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,800
This project belonged to my childhood.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It meant so much to me.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,240
That’s why I chose to be an architect.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,360
What does this mean now?

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,120
But you ruined everything!

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,160
You destroyed all my dreams!

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,240
Why is she thinking of my sister?! Why?!

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,680
Why shouldn’t she? Is
that such a bad thing?

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,240
She shouldn’t!

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,560
Easy, brother. Don’t get angry right away.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,680
I was surprised too.

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,360
I'll be honest. But
clearly your sister left a mark on Mercan.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,080
Do you know who this Eylül is?

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,480
I don’t know.

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,560
Why
are you so hung up on this useless subject?

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,560
Eylül or Murat. Either or.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,560
A hospital is a business.
What matters is profit.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,760
-Son! -Ateş!

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,560
-What did you do, son?! -Ateş.

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,880
Eylül is dead, dear.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,800
She was sick.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,480
As for Tahir,
I don’t know where he is, what he's doing.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,520
I hid it from you so you wouldn’t grieve.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,520
I’ll tell you they’ve
paid for what they did to that little girl.

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,320
I’ll make
those who stole our happiness taste misery.

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,720
I’ll take away their loved ones,

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,160
I don't remember
Tahir as well as I do Eylül, but...

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,080
the way he protected us...

29
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,960
was not like a kid, but like an adult.

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
I don't understand.

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,120
How can you remember all this?

32
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,360
Ateş spends
way too much time with Haydar's daughter.

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,880
He strays further away from us.

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,400
I can feel it.

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,760
What if he changes his
mind about the revenge?

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,400
Ateş won't give up on his plan.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,200
At this point, he couldn't
even if he wanted to.

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,880
Or Haydar will destroy us.

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,360
Do you think Ateş will set himself and us
aside for the killer's daughter?

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,880
Because we decided to
build the hospital somewhere else.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,840
What does it mean?

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,000
If only
you told us about your noble plans before.

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,720
At least, you wouldn't
have been ripped off. Right?

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,200
You think you are smart, aren't you?

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,320
You'll
soon find that you shouldn't mess with me.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm following them as you ordered.

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,240
They've been driving around for hours.

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,720
I think they're checking plots.

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Alright.

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,600
Keep following them.

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,480
And you know what to do
when you have the chance.

52
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't worry, Boss.

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
No, it can't wait.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,200
We have to meet!

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm telling you it can't wait!

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,480
Alright, be at the seaside in an hour.

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,640
Be at the seaside in an hour!

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Çiçek.

59
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,120
It upsets me seeing you on edge like this.

60
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,240
I can't help, Malik? I'm
afraid someone will see us.

61
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,880
Alright, from this day on, we will
have everything out in the open.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,600
The car is done. Next is the loan.

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,560
God willing, we'll get that too.

64
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,480
It's time to talk to your mother now.

65
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,720
Don't tell me to wait, Çiçek.

66
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,200
Umm...

67
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,760
So much has happened lately.

68
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,040
If she finds out about
us on top of all that, she'll lose it!

69
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,840
She always says she wouldn't
let me move away after marriage.

70
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,240
And you'll go back to your family.

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Oh dear!

72
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,800
Ours is an impossible love.

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,520
Every problem has a solution.

74
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Okay?

75
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,600
I'll talk to your mother.

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Çiçek.

77
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,360
I am not one to do things behind someone's
back.

78
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,760
I can't even look you family in the eyes.

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,160
I feel ashamed every time
they treat me like family.

80
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,040
And I want to hold your hands freely now.

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,240
Why are we hiding?

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
Isn't it unfair to both of us?

83
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,080
Alright. Let's go and tell them.

84
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,640
From now
on, let's not get anything come between us.

85
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Alright.

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,040
I liked the second plot.

87
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,920
It will be good for the patients
for the hospital to be in the nature.

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,760
-Right? -Yes.

89
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Thank you.

90
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,280
I don't know what to eat.

91
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,360
Should I have meatballs?

92
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Or the pasta?

93
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
I don't know.

94
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,440
Whichever I pick, I'll miss the other.

95
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,040
Bring both of them.

96
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Yes, sir.

97
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
I can't decide what to eat when I'm hungry.

98
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,840
If I
pick one, I keep thinking about the other.

99
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,840
So, you change from one moment to the next?

100
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,520
At least, I have something going on.

101
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,720
I'm not boring like you are.

102
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Çiçek.

103
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,280
For God's sake, tell me the truth! Did they
not get the car?

104
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,720
Calm down, Mom. It's nothing like that.

105
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,560
The other day, we couldn't finish our talk,
Ms. Binnaz.

106
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Mom.

107
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,840
I've been here for a while.

108
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,400
You know me now.

109
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,680
I don't have
bad habits, and I'm a good lad. Thank God.

110
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
I pray five times a day.

111
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
Family is sacred to me.

112
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,600
You've been a family to
me. We became a family here.

113
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,560
Alright, Son, I get
it. Tell me what you want to say.

114
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,680
-I... -Mom!

115
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,360
The bracelets are fake.

116
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
What?

117
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
-Oh God! -Mom!

118
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
Mom, wait. Calm down.

119
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,920
Are you alright, Mom?

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Mom, are you OK?

121
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,760
The bracelets are fake?

122
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,400
They are.

123
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Are you sure?

124
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
Yes, dude. They are fake.

125
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,120
Give me the bracelets.

126
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,720
Slow down. You'll choke.

127
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,000
Now, you're counting my bites? Thanks!

128
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,080
You're eating so fast, I couldn't even if I
wanted to.

129
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
So rude.

130
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
Fresh air increased my appetite.

131
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,960
Besides, I haven't eaten properly in days.

132
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,680
This place is beautiful.

133
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,440
A breath of fresh air after a hard day.

134
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
What're you doing?

135
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
What do you think?

136
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,760
You had ayran there. I wiped it.

137
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,200
-Let's go. -But I haven't finished eating.

138
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,880
You ate enough.

139
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,040
It should hold you until we get home.

140
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,680
You have to ruin everything that's nice.

141
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,120
And you have to keep tripping up!

142
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,800
You didn't tell me what
you thought about the plots we checked.

143
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,040
It wouldn't be right
of me to decide before seeing all of them.

144
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,160
But, you must like one of them more.

145
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,760
I don't
decide based on flowers and birds like you.

146
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,880
And
I don't want it to be in a secluded place.

147
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,960
Gosh, you're so intense!

148
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,520
All you do is to think.

149
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,200
I'm sure your projects
are all about soulless concrete.

150
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,200
You have no idea about me or my projects.

151
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,480
So, stop commenting on them and shut up.

152
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
What's happening?

153
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
I don't know.

154
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,720
Smoke comes out of the hood.

155
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Calm down.

156
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I'll check it out.

157
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
I'll fix it.

158
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
I'm following them, Boss.

159
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,600
Their car broke down. They stopped.

160
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,400
He is checking the car.

161
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,600
The girl is in the car.

162
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
What happened?

163
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,200
The engine overheated.

164
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,240
We need to wait a bit. Let it cool down.

165
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
Then I’ll take another look.

166
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,680
Go inside if you want. Don’t get cold.

167
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,640
No. I’m fine like this.

168
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,920
I’m getting some fresh air anyway.

169
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Suit yourself.

170
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,280
We’re stuck here for a while.

171
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,560
Do you think it’ll work?

172
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,800
I don’t think so. The problem continues.

173
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,880
We need to find a mechanic.

174
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
No signal.

175
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,800
Does your phone have signal?

176
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
No.

177
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,360
There’s no point waiting like this.

178
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
It’s getting cold.

179
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
We need to find a solution before sunset.

180
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,240
Maybe we can find a mechanic nearby.

181
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Let’s walk.

182
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Okay.

183
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,800
You can hold on to me if you want.

184
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,240
No need. I’m managing.

185
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,000
If I’d known we were going to get stranded,
I would’ve worn more comfortable shoes.

186
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
Good thing you called, Haydar.

187
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,560
How long has it been since we last met?

188
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,160
Well...
It must’ve been about ten years, I guess.

189
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,960
You haven’t changed at all, brother.

190
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,160
The years just brushed past you.

191
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,040
Are you making fun of
me, Kazım? Come on now!

192
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,880
We’re getting old little
by little. Can’t you see my hair and beard?

193
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,120
We should still be grateful.

194
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,520
You know Şahin,
right? He passed away so suddenly.

195
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,560
I heard, I heard. I was really sorry.

196
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,920
That big man was taken out just like that.

197
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,880
Exactly. I was shocked too.

198
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,280
Whoever did
it has no conscience! No one knows either.

199
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
You...

200
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,920
Do you know who Şahin
was doing business with lately?

201
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I don’t know, Haydar.

202
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
We last spoke two or three months ago.

203
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,640
We just chatted briefly.

204
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,720
He was in a good mood.

205
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,960
Life, you know... Arm in arm with death.

206
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,760
So you don't know either!

207
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,760
How deserted.

208
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,560
Forget a
mechanic, there's not even a person.

209
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,800
I told you to hold on to me.

210
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,080
How much longer will we walk?

211
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't know.

212
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,880
My phone's battery is dead.

213
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,760
There's no signal anyway.

214
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Then...

215
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
We keep walking.

216
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,240
What if we can't find a mechanic?

217
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,480
We probably won't find one anyway.

218
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,160
What do you mean? Then...
Will we be stranded in this cold?

219
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Looks like it.

220
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
Are you cold?

221
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
No.

222
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,320
We need to
find shelter before it gets dark.

223
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Are you scared?

224
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,720
I've been more scared at other times in my
life.

225
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
This is nothing yet.

226
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,320
Enough chit-chat.

227
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,400
Let's find a place to spend the night
before we become food for wolves and birds.

228
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,720
This place
has been touched by an ember once, brother.

229
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,880
Your fury and hatred for this man stem from
that.

230
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,680
You're downright
jealous of Mercan for Nezir.

231
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Which way?

232
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
This way.

233
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,480
Will you let go of my arm?

234
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,120
You said, "Take my arm."

235
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
I don't
understand why you're saying "Let go" now.

236
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,320
I mean, you contradict
yourself. You're really hard to understand.

237
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
I'm boring, so...

238
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm bringing some excitement to our lives.

239
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
Th... Thank you.

240
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,040
But now you'll get cold.

241
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I don't get cold.

242
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,680
Don't worry about me.

243
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,360
And don't get sick and
cause trouble for me.

244
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,880
You always do this.

245
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Do what?

246
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,400
You do
something nice first and then behave badly.

247
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,920
It's as if
you deliberately kill the good inside you.

248
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
No, it's not like that.

249
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
I'm always the same.

250
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
What happened?

251
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Did you see something?

252
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
I heard a sound.

253
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,040
Probably a squirrel.

254
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Hello.

255
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,240
Hello.

256
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,360
What are you
young folks doing in the forest?

257
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,680
Our car broke down. We're stranded.

258
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,960
Is there a mechanic nearby?

259
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,960
There is
one nearby here, but... It's closed today.

260
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,680
Master Hayri is throwing a wedding for his
son.

261
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,480
He'll probably open tomorrow.

262
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,721
Is there a hotel,
pension, or something like that nearby?

263
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Yes! Right over there! The Güllü Hotel.

264
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,600
That happens to be my wife.

265
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,840
Please, come. Be our guests.

266
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,960
No, we don't want to trouble you.
A hotel would be better.

267
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh-oooh!

268
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,480
God's guests have come to our very door. I
would never let them go.

269
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,280
The kids have flown the nest. It's just my
wife and I.

270
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,520
A Köroğlu and an Ayvaz.

271
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,080
Come and let our home liven up a bit.

272
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,040
Okay. Then we won't refuse your kindness.

273
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,920
What was your name, young man?

274
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Ateş.

275
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,520
This is my wife.

276
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,960
I'm Durmuş.

277
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Nice to meet you.

278
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Nice to meet you.

279
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,560
You too. Come on now, this way.

280
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,960
-I'll handle it. -Oh my!

281
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,920
Oh, child, you'll get
your clothes all muddy.

282
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,960
It's nothing. You've
invited us to your home.

283
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,120
Good. Let's go this way then.

284
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,200
-From here? -Yes, this way.

285
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,760
I'm right behind you, damn it!

286
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,760
What are you doing, Aunt Binnaz?

287
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Melting lead.

288
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Lead?

289
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,400
Oh! Are you going to do a lead pouring?

290
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Yes.

291
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,760
There's evil eye both
on us and the mansion. We'll remove them.

292
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,960
Uh... Where will you pour it?

293
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
On your head.

294
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
On our head?

295
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
Yes.

296
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,840
No way. I don't want it.

297
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,400
Yes, yes. With this lead, we'll ward
off all the evil eyes... All the filth.

298
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,800
Don't you do this in Egypt?

299
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,840
No. I've never seen anything like this.

300
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,400
You'll see in a moment.

301
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,240
I have a vow. We'll ward
off all the evil eyes.

302
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,920
I hope so.

303
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,360
I've been wanting this for a long time, you
know!

304
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,520
There's a streak of bad luck, misfortune on
me. I wonder whose evil eye has touched me?

305
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
On you?

306
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,600
Why would anyone give
you the evil eye? Huh?

307
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,080
And he keeps appearing everywhere all of a
sudden...

308
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,480
Well, I don't think you should believein
such things. These are superstitions.

309
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,120
Superstition.

310
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,880
Exactly. I don't really
believe in it either, but... just for fun.

311
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,400
Hmm... He changed his tune quickly, see?

312
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Flower.

313
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,896
Did
you put water in the copper bowl, my girl?

314
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,400
I did.

315
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,679
Okay. Cloth, skewer, knife, key... Are they
all ready?

316
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,840
They're ready, mother, ready.

317
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,200
This is about to melt too. Now sit down and
hold the cloth over your heads.

318
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
What the heck?

319
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,240
Look at this!

320
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,480
Oy oy oy! Oh dear, oh dear!

321
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,240
What happened?

322
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,200
Look at this, look!

323
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,920
Oh my God!

324
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,520
Oh
My! Do you see how much evil eye there is.

325
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,440
Whose evil eye could it be?

326
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,600
May their eyes be plucked out!

327
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,320
Look! Mine has a woman
with a head like a snake. Like Medusa.

328
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,080
So there's someone around me who is like a
snake.

329
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,520
I hope she drowns
in her own venom. Drowns in her own venom.

330
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
Malik.
Yes?

331
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,560
Hey, doesn't this look like a car engine?

332
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,160
It's
melted lead. What else would it look like?

333
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,800
Don't believe in
such things. It's nothing but superstition.

334
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Meaning?

335
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,080
Don't believe in these.
They are superstitions.

336
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,400
An eye came
out, an eye. I can see them all here. Wow!

337
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
An eye came out.

338
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
Eye...

339
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,840
-Look! -Eye...

340
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
(spits on the bad eye)

341
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,480
Eye... Came out.

342
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,920
I feel relieved!

343
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,120
Me too.
It's good.

344
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,520
(spits on others faces)

345
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,920
Come on children. Come here. Come.

346
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,200
Put them over there. On that side.

347
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,960
We have guests, Güllü! My Güllü!

348
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,480
Look! We have guests, Güllü!

349
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,280
I've brought you son Ateş
and daughter-in-law Mercan.

350
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,000
Welcome.

351
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,880
Welcome children!

352
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,040
Thank you!
Welcome!

353
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,639
The young
folks' car broke down, they were stranded.

354
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,840
Oh dear, oh dear! It's fate!

355
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,520
They mentioned a hotel or something, but I
said no way.

356
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,400
I said Güllü would be mad at me!

357
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,960
Oh-oooh! What hotel? How can that be?

358
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,720
We don't want to be a bother.

359
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,280
Don't mention
it, my child. You sit right here.

360
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,960
Let me get you some ayran.

361
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,000
Catch your breath, rest a bit. Come, you go
over there.

362
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,680
Come on, come on. Sit over here.

363
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,920
Relax as if you were in your own home.

364
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,800
Let me get you some ayran too.

365
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,440
Sit. Sit. Please children. Sit.

366
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,840
(smiles happily)

367
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Let me help.

368
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,160
No, my girl. I'll fill them up in no time.

369
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,680
Here you go, child.

370
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920
Thank you.

371
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
Bless your hands.

372
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,520
Enjoy.

373
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,120
Mashallah. How beautiful they are.

374
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,080
Yes, yes. May God
make their happiness everlasting!

375
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,560
Amen.

376
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,480
May they grow old together like us.

377
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
God willing.

378
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,200
You must be hungry.

379
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,360
I'll set the table in a bit.

380
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,880
Please don't go to any trouble.

381
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,120
What trouble, my
child. Everything is already ready.

382
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,200
I'll boil some black-eyed pea tarhana soup.

383
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,360
We had eggy arapsaçı.

384
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,760
I also made stuffed vine leaves with olive
oil.

385
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,000
And if
I make a salad to go with it, it's all set.

386
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
What more could you want?

387
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,360
See? Guests come with blessings.

388
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,400
See how our home has livened up right away?

389
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,880
And what do they say?
A guest comes with their own sustenance.

390
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,440
They become a means for the
host's sins to be forgiven and then leave.

391
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,680
Whatever we do for you is not enough.

392
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,960
What's this?

393
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Churn.

394
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,880
It's used to make butter.

395
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,760
Look what all he knows!

396
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,320
He's pulling it. Let me call Cemal and let
him know.

397
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
Okay.

398
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,560
Hello.

399
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,880
Cemal, I won't be coming tonight.

400
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
Mercan is with me.

401
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Nobody should worry.

402
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,480
What's up, brother? Is there a problem?

403
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,800
No.

404
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Don't worry.

405
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Alright.

406
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,520
Any news from Ateş?

407
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,720
No. He can't be reached.

408
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,400
I talked to Ateş. He can't come tonight.

409
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,120
Why can't he come?

410
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,960
Work stuff, Aslı. You know.

411
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,200
That girl is with him, isn't she?

412
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,520
Yes.

413
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,960
I have a meeting I need to do.

414
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,720
Newlywed couple. They
must be spending some time alone, it seems.

415
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,760
Eh! That's good.

416
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,960
The kids couldn't even go on a honeymoon.

417
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,760
Enough! Shut up!

418
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,600
Why did you get so angry?

419
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,200
Did I say something to upset you or what?

420
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,080
Very beautiful.

421
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,920
I took it out
of my trousseau, my girl Mercan.

422
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,000
I couldn't bear to wear it andput
it in a chest. It was destined for you.

423
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,120
And it suits you very well.

424
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,840
Thank you so much. You gave it to me
when you couldn't bear to wear it yourself.

425
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,640
You've embarrassed me. We've caused you so
much trouble.

426
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,640
What do you
mean, my girl? Don’t mention it.

427
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,120
You came and brought joy to our home.

428
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,680
Come
on, let’s go to the living room together.

429
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,480
Sit
down, my child, make yourself comfortable.

430
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,160
So, how long have you two been married?

431
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,360
About three weeks.

432
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,480
Ah! So you’re still newlyweds.

433
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,400
The honeymoon phase goes by fast. Enjoy it.

434
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,040
But if you’ve found the right person, every
stage of marriage is beautiful.

435
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,120
And if it’s crowned with
a child, it becomes even more beautiful.

436
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,040
May God grant you healthy children, I hope.

437
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,800
Let me leave this brushwood and bring some
firewood.

438
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,440
I’ll bring it, Mr. Durmuş.

439
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,200
Don’t trouble yourself, my child!

440
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,880
Then I’ll go make the salad.

441
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,040
Let me help you.

442
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,240
Hah.

443
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,480
I’ll take care of it, Mr. Durmuş. You sit.

444
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,160
So you know how to do it. Good for you.

445
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,160
Heh! Okay.

446
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,880
You
understand this job! Well done! Well done!

447
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,120
So? Tell me, what brings you here?

448
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,559
We have a hospital project.

449
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:22,960
Huh?

450
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,480
We came to look at land.

451
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,560
On the way back, our car broke down. So we
got stuck here.

452
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,240
It’s okay. As long as
you’re safe. May God protect you from harm.

453
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,400
Come closer to the stove, warm yourself up.
Don’t get sick.

454
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,880
I
Noticed you gave your jacket to your wife.

455
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:49,240
I appreciated that. A true man
looks after his wife. Treats her with care.

456
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,760
But...

457
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,920
It doesn’t end with just wrapping her in a
jacket.

458
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,880
Look! Love and loyalty are also needed.

459
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,720
Let me give you a little advice.

460
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,200
Whatever your wife says,
just say she’s right.

461
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,040
Don’t oppose her.

462
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,720
Look, that’s what I do.

463
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,480
We’ve lived happily with
Güllü for forty years.

464
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Careful.

465
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,840
The tea is inside as well.
Ms. Güllü said to put it on the stove.

466
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,560
Oh! Now this place will smell wonderful.

467
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,520
It’s full of peace here.

468
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,600
You can always come, my girl. Whenever you
want.

469
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,440
Where did you do your military service?

470
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,560
In Amasya.
Ah!

471
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,720
What happened, my child?
What are you smiling at?

472
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,280
Nothing...

473
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,480
Give me that big bowl.

474
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,720
I’ll chop the greens.

475
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Here you go.

476
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
Thank you.

477
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,320
I really like you two. It’s obvious
your husband protects and looks after you.

478
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,720
And you don’t lack respect.

479
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,760
Always stay like this, okay?

480
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,240
Marriage works with love
and respect. Do you understand, my child?

481
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,160
Ah! I forgot
to pick parsley from the garden.

482
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,280
It’ll be a bit of a bother, but could you
pick some parsley for me?

483
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,000
Oh please,
don’t mention it. Of course I’ll pick it.

484
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
Go get some from the garden and come back.

485
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,120
If I can manage it, of course.

486
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,280
You’ll see it in the corner of the garden,
planted.

487
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,760
Okay.

488
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Don’t be scared, it’s me.

489
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,800
You scared me to death! Why walking
up so quietly? You should’ve called out!

490
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,320
I didn’t think you’d get scared. Sorry.

491
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,040
Not like that.

492
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,480
Look, you’re supposed to do it like this.

493
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,360
You pick without uprooting it.

494
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,440
Meaning, you
don’t pull it up from the root.

495
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,640
Otherwise, it won’t grow again.

496
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,240
I think that’s enough.

497
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,000
What are you going to do now?

498
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,240
I wish I knew, Malik.

499
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,360
I really wish I knew.

500
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,680
I told you from the beginning.

501
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,680
Lies won’t work. You
should’ve told the truth from the start.

502
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,880
How would I know, brother Malik?

503
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,240
Malik.

504
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,920
Could you look for a second?

505
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
That’s all we needed.

506
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,280
I haven’t seen the car for a day or two. I
hope there’s no problem.

507
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,120
Th… The car? Uhh… The car, um…

508
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,280
Something happened to the car…

509
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,520
The car is being serviced, Mr. Cemal.

510
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,360
Uh-huh.

511
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,000
Yes, in service.

512
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,640
Uh-huh. In service.

513
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,840
Malik has a bit of trouble speaking our
language. He couldn’t explain it, I think.

514
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,560
Alright. Let me know when
it’s out of service.

515
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,856
Of course. Of course, Mr. Cemal.

516
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,400
See you.

517
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,360
Good evening.

518
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,200
There you go. Another lie. Happy now?

519
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,480
This won’t end well, I’m telling you.

520
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,120
He has trouble speaking our language, huh…

521
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,080
The soup is here!

522
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,520
Oh! The stuffed leaves are here too!

523
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,480
I don’t know about you, but I’m starving.

524
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,240
Come on, sit at the table!

525
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,880
Come on, sit! Come on!

526
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,440
Come on now.

527
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,200
Come on, please.

528
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,240
Enjoy your meal.

529
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,600
Thank you, my Güllü!

530
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,240
It smells wonderful!

531
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,840
Enjoy!

532
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,080
The reason for this affection…

533
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,200
Is that they’re newlyweds.

534
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,560
Yeah!

535
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,040
May God grant you a long life together.

536
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,440
That’s what the elders say.

537
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,360
One pillow, two hearts.

538
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,040
You share your pillow, you share your love.

539
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,120
What’s
with everyone having separate pillows now?

540
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,640
But it’s obvious, I can tell.

541
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,040
You can’t live without each other.

542
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,400
Come on, drink your soup.

543
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,040
Don’t let it get cold.

544
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,520
Are you okay, my girl?

545
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,440
Are you okay?

546
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,840
The soup is delicious, thank you!

547
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,400
Enjoy it, my girl. Eat it for healing.

548
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,560
This is Aegean-style tarhana.

549
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,320
It has everything in it.

550
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,960
Minced meat, tomatoes, garlic...

551
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,600
Olives go great with this.

552
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,560
Get some olives too.

553
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:13,440
Thank you.

554
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:14,560
Durmuş!

555
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,080
Shame on
you, Zerrin! What kind of a mother are you!

556
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,680
How can a person
ever give her daughter to a foreign groom?

557
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,640
Which series is this?

558
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:06,960
“Gurbet Yolları.”

559
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,080
She’ll give her daughter to
a foreign groom just because she loves him.

560
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,840
What’s wrong with that?

561
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,680
If they love each other, of course she’ll
give her.

562
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,320
No. You
can’t live with the longing for your child.

563
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,440
I have a daughter
too. I’d never give her to a foreign groom.

564
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,280
Me neither.

565
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,800
It won’t work.

566
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,560
I think they suit each other perfectly.

567
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,040
No, no. And he’s
going to take her to his own hometown too.

568
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,600
Thank you, dear.

569
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,480
It’s gotten cold.

570
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,200
We’ll go inside with Güllü. We’re old now.

571
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,440
Our rheumatism flares up otherwise.

572
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,000
You stay seated though.

573
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,040
Sit, child.
Go on.

574
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,080
Okay.

575
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,120
Now it’s good.

576
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,400
People can
experience things they can’t even imagine.

577
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,840
Could you imagine spending this night in a
place like this?

578
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,840
Sometimes our
lives don’t go the way we plan.

579
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,160
You know they say: “Life is what
happens while you’re making other plans.”

580
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,640
It’s really true.

581
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,160
I brought you dried fruit.

582
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,560
I didn’t buy
these from the market. I dried them myself.

583
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,040
And I collected the walnuts from
the garden.

584
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,280
Thank you very much.

585
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,000
Won’t you join us?

586
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,800
No, dear. When I
stay out in the cold, my whole body aches.

587
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,720
You enjoy it.

588
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,440
-Thank you. -Thank you very much.

589
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,760
Do people like this still exist?

590
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:09,160
They’re so warm, sincere, kind-hearted.

591
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,440
Apparently they do.

592
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,520
Aren’t they such a sweet couple?

593
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,120
Yes.

594
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,000
I really liked Uncle
Durmuş and Aunt Güllü too.

595
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,560
How wonderful...

596
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,880
Even after all these
years, they still love each other so much.

597
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,960
This place… These people have been so good
for me.

598
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,680
I’m almost going
to say I’m glad we got stranded.

599
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,240
It’s
been so long since I saw such good people.

600
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,800
My hope for kindness is genuinely renewed.

601
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,200
That’s great.

602
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,520
Enjoy it.

603
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,560
You can stay here if you want.

604
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,320
It would actually be nice to
stay away from the company and the mansion.

605
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,440
But I can’t.

606
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,000
There’s
a hospital project I need to finish.

607
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,320
Don’t worry.

608
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,920
We’ll build Eylül Hospital.

609
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,680
These are so nice.

610
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,520
Have some too.

611
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,880
It’s gotten really cold.

612
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,960
I’m fine like this.

613
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,920
What did Uncle Durmuş tell you?

614
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,760
If you don’t
want trouble, you’ll say “You’re right.”

615
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,800
Look.

616
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,360
There are so many stars.

617
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,240
Even the night is magnificent here.

618
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,960
Because of the city lights

619
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,281
we’ve never been able
to see any of the stars in the sky.

620
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,160
It’s like we’re under a rain of light.

621
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,720
Look. Do you see that?

622
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,920
Hmm.

623
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,280
The North Star.

624
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,720
It’s also called the Shepherd’s Star.

625
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,720
Which star is that shining one then?

626
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,760
That’s not a star.

627
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,760
Venus.

628
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,440
The second brightest planet.

629
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,720
In Roman mythology, it represents love and
beauty.

630
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,400
You’re quite
knowledgeable about these things.

631
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,600
I’ve read a bit.

632
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,600
It’s too cold. I’m freezing.

633
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,960
The blanket isn’t enough anymore. I’m going
inside.

634
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,640
What’s happening, Ateş?

635
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,840
Get a hold of yourself.

636
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,400
She’s just a weird girl, that’s all.

637
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,480
Your job is done. Go back now.

638
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,440
I’ll take care of the rest.

639
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,000
Say whatever you’re going
to say quickly. Go before someone sees you!

640
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,720
If you listen to
my cooperation offer, we’ll both benefit.

641
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,640
If that’s why you came, no point.

642
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
What are you doing!

643
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,440
Let’s put our misunderstanding aside.

644
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,320
Take your hand off.

645
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,800
Look at this.

646
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:36,920
Get out of here!

647
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,760
So you agree.

648
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,360
Fine.

649
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,760
I’m not responsible for what happens next.

650
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,320
Keep it as a souvenir.

651
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,120
I won’t allow this.

652
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,880
I won’t let you have Ateş.

653
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,920
I’ll ruin you!

654
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,200
I’ll make you regret being born.

655
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,680
Are you sleepy, kids?

656
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,800
Your bed is ready.

657
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,280
Go lie down and get a good night’s sleep.
Rest well.

658
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:50,040
Durmuş! Durmuş!

659
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,720
Come on, dear, your neck will get stiff.

660
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,560
Get up and go to bed.

661
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,720
Okay.
Hold my hand.

662
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,360
Okay.

663
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,200
Wait. Wait. I’m getting up.

664
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,320
Poor thing is
tired. With the garden, woodwork and all…

665
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,000
Goodnight, kids.

666
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,680
-Goodnight. -Goodnight.

667
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,080
Come on kids, let me show you your room.

668
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,880
Come on. Come on.

669
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,480
Here you go, kids. Come
in. Come in. Come in.

670
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,160
Sister Güllü.

671
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,280
Come in, child.

672
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,880
Come in, son.

673
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,440
I put your pajamas there.

674
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,960
The sheets are spotless too. I just washed
them.

675
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,159
-May Allah give you rest. -But um...

676
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,400
Goodnight, child.

677
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,600
Are we going to sleep together now?

678
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,440
Did you get dressed?

679
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,760
Yes.

680
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,920
God, what is this?

681
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,640
It throws me off balance.

682
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,720
She is so beautiful.

683
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,520
Come to your senses, Ateş.

684
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,640
I'll sleep outside.

685
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,560
Okay. Alright.

686
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,320
Do you want something son?

687
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,520
No.

688
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,720
Yes. I wanted water.

689
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,640
I put the pitcher by your bedside.

690
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:44,760
I couldn't see.

691
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,240
Okay. Good night.

692
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,280
Good night.

693
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,360
What happened?

694
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,080
I got caught by Aunt Güllü.

695
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,456
I made up
an excuse that I was going to drink water,

696
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,240
but she had
already placed it by our bedside

697
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,080
What we're going to do now?

698
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:11,880
You can sleep.

699
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,200
I sit on the floor.

700
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,320
No way.

701
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,720
You're going to be driving, so you need to
be alert.

702
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,496
You come like this, I'll sit there.

703
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,520
No way.

704
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,400
Don't worry about me.

705
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,680
We didn't grow up in feather beds anyway.

706
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,600
If you're doing this just to get
me angry and make me say

707
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,680
it's okay
for you to lie there, don't bother.

708
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,720
Princesses have hearts too.

709
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,680
I can't let you sleep there.

710
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,520
In this relationship,
you have a husband who gives permission.

711
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,960
Yes.

712
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,720
But
you're such a lucky man that despite this,

713
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,560
you have a wife who doesn't stoop to evil.

714
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,120
Like.

715
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,080
Let's lie down at both ends.

716
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,080
But at the ends.

717
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,280
You're a very lucky woman too..

718
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,280
Your husband gives you the only pillow.

719
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,440
He'll do that too.

720
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,040
He is my husband.

721
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,720
How can I sleep

722
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,240
next to him in the same bed?

723
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,320
How can I sleep now?

724
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,120
Good night.

725
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,360
Good night.

726
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,320
Take care of yourself.

727
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,480
Don't push your luck.

728
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,680
Or me.

729
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,600
Well.

730
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,960
If the Karahans find out
about the debt, we'll be disgraced.

731
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,560
We're really in deep trouble, honestly.

732
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,200
I don't know what to do.

733
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,160
Enjoy your food.

734
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,200
What are you doing?

735
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,560
Black Sea girls.

736
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,040
Son.

737
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,920
Are you crazy?

738
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,240
Are you okay?

739
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,280
Mommy.

740
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,760
I want to drink a cup of tea by your hands.

741
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:21,920
God.

742
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,520
Now we have to deal with this craziness.

743
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,880
He lost his mind.

744
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,400
Brother.

745
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,480
Are you okay?

746
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:30,960
I'm good.

747
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,360
In fact,
I'm really good. I've never been this good.

748
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,120
Mom, don't be afraid.

749
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,560
Don't.

750
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,240
There isn't a problem.

751
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,840
Your son paid off the debts.

752
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,320
What? How did you?

753
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,240
I got back my money.

754
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,600
I had something to get from a friend.

755
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,480
He had been stringing
me along for a long time.

756
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,800
I said I couldn't wait either.

757
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,120
And he paid back.

758
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,680
I paid off the debt and

759
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,280
had the car repaired.

760
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,560
No more problem.

761
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,200
Berat.

762
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,000
Are you serious or trying to fool me?

763
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,440
Mommy.

764
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,200
There are evident.

765
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,280
Look.

766
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,640
Give it to me.

767
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,080
Black Sea mom, take it.

768
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,320
This is proof.

769
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,920
He says true.

770
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:41,160
Thank God, I made a vow, and my Lord heard
my voice.

771
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,360
Take you tea.

772
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,120
We have to celebrate it.

773
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,160
Let's celebrate.

774
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,560
We were saved.

775
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,640
Thank god mom.

776
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,680
God thank you.

777
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,880
What are you doing to me?

778
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,520
What are you doing?

779
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,080
Well.

780
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,080
I had a nightmare.

781
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:25,720
That's why.

782
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,120
It smells wonderful inside, let me
take a look.

783
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,280
Who knows what they did. I'll go and help.

784
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,160
Dazed

785
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,920
Good morning.

786
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,800
Good morning.

787
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,320
Good morning.

788
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,400
Good morning Ateş.

789
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,640
Good morning.

790
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,640
May it be easy.
May it be easy.

791
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,520
Thank you dear.

792
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,360
Did you sleep well.

793
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,840
There isn't a problem, right?

794
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,480
-Yes. -No.

795
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,760
God.

796
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,120
We slept well. Thank you so much.

797
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,120
Yes, we slept well.

798
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,880
Fresh air affected us.

799
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,240
Yes, the fresh air.

800
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,480
Well, you slept well.

801
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:57,760
You rest.

802
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,080
Now it's time to work.

803
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,080
We have to do dough for our breakfast.

804
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,240
Dough?

805
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,800
I'll help you.

806
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Come here.

807
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,440
But that's not how it works, is it?

808
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,200
Of course.

809
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,880
You need
to fold your arms while kneading the dough.

810
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,480
Why is
he looking at me like that? It's annoying.

811
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,400
Your hands are dirty.

812
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,280
You can't get enough of looking.

813
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:01,960
Look.

814
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,120
These are.

815
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:05,760
Organic tomatoes. They're not like the ones

816
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,120
that you eat in the city.

817
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,240
They smell so good.

818
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,720
Ateş, son, smell it first.

819
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,440
It smell so good.

820
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:34,720
Just like you.

821
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,840
Come here boy.

822
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,040
God doesn't like the lazy ones.

823
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,880
We have to break some wood.

824
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:47,680
Come here.

825
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,040
Let's see how you use the axe.

826
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:51,800
Put a little more flour.

827
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,880
Ateş hasn't come back yet, has it?

828
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,200
No.

829
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,160
This isn't worth worrying about.

830
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,920
Think twice.

831
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,760
They're playing at families.

832
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:52,840
I told you.

833
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,320
You didn't even listen.

834
01:34:59,400 --> 01:34:59,840
Today

835
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,960
who befriends the enemy's daughter

836
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,160
will shake hands with the enemy tomorrow.

837
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,880
Why did Nezir send you a photo?

838
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,240
What business do you have with him?

839
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,600
He offered me something.

840
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,520
What is this?

841
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,720
A proposal to work together so that

842
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,840
Ateş and Mercan do not unite.

843
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,240
Whatever is in Mercan

844
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,560
Nezir is obsessed with her.

845
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,800
Stay away from him Aslı.

846
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,600
We are the strong ones.

847
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:38,240
We don't need him.

848
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,800
Show our power mom.

849
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,360
Do something.

850
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,760
I'll take care of it.

851
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,280
We don't have much time.

852
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,640
Mercan is setting him up.

853
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:56,560
Confuse his mind and ruin him.

854
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,680
I'll take care of it. Leave it to me.

855
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,160
Every time the same.

856
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:01,720
You don't do something.

857
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,240
I'm not leaving it anyone from now on.

858
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,120
I'll take care of it.

859
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,440
I went out saying I was
going to the neighbor's.

860
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,280
We're experts at lying, aren't we?

861
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,680
Even your lies are innocent.

862
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,680
Forget about it.

863
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:36,240
We were dying, but how did we come back to
life at the last moment?

864
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,840
We got the car and paid off the debt.

865
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,680
Thankfully, everything is back to normal.

866
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:43,920
Thank god.

867
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,520
How did Berat find the money?

868
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:50,080
He had something to collect from
his friend. He took it.

869
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,320
Good.

870
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:53,760
The benefits of lending money.

871
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,120
Look, the dark clouds have ran away.

872
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,160
Finally, we're walking hand in hand.

873
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,880
What?

874
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,520
They say the dark clouds have dispersed.

875
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,880
I say they ran away.

876
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:27,360
We were going to tell her about our
relationship. A lot of things got in the way.

877
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:31,080
Now that those things are over.

878
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,320
I think we can talk to my mom.

879
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,040
Are you sure?

880
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,320
I'm sure.

881
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:42,640
If we wait, something new will
come up and our work will remain the same.

882
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:44,960
Let's just say it.

883
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,560
Let them worry about the rest.

884
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,240
Okay.

885
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,320
Then today, it's over.

886
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:55,200
Does your mom like me?

887
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:57,360
But stop.

888
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:02,800
Let's tell my mom and brother, then
we'll go kiss your parents' hands.

889
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,120
Of course we can go.

890
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,280
My mom likes you.

891
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,000
Why doesn't she like you?

892
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,400
Same as the name.

893
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,040
Halva.

894
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,360
Do you like halva?

895
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:15,880
Yes.

896
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,120
Halva.

897
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,320
-Brother, can you come? -Yes.

898
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,400
-Can we take two? -Of course.

899
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,080
-Here. -Thank you.

900
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,160
Take this.

901
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:25,520
Thank you.

902
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:26,920
Thank you.
Have a good day.

903
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,520
-Good luck. -Thank you.

904
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:33,760
Thank you.

905
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:35,840
Enjoy it.

906
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:45,040
Stop.

907
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,840
I'll give this to you.

908
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,360
Look girl.

909
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,720
You'll press like this.

910
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,760
You have a blessing in your hand.

911
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,120
Gently.

912
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,640
But strong.

913
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:22,720
Do it.

914
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,400
Like this.

915
01:39:58,760 --> 01:39:58,960
No.

916
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:00,720
I couldn't do it.

917
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,120
Look, it tells you something.

918
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:04,760
You didn't listen it.

919
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,400
Be careful.

920
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,000
Like this. Turn this.

921
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,360
The forest.

922
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,480
Gives peace to the person.

923
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:33,760
You know why?

924
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,240
The nature

925
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,240
Nature is the essence of man.

926
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,720
When the person

927
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,320
finds his essence

928
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,680
then he can find the peace.

929
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,360
Son.

930
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:55,960
Okay.

931
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:05,640
You're crazy about your wife, we get it.

932
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,680
But the axe won't forgive!

933
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:10,480
Focus on your work, don't have an accident.

934
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:12,520
Be careful.

935
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,640
You're right, Uncle Durmuş.

936
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:19,760
Lady.

937
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,840
Your hands
are busy, your eyes are wandering.

938
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,680
They're not stealing your husband.

939
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,400
Mind your own business. Hold the
rolling pin like this

940
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,320
I won't be having breakfast today.

941
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,400
For a while.

942
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,400
Detox.

943
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,480
I need to get rid of the toxins in my body.

944
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,840
Otherwise, it's hard to find peace.

945
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,720
Who do you think you are, talking
back to me?

946
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,160
Don't sit in front of me like that again.

947
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,880
And don't even think about talking back.

948
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:56,120
Okay.

949
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:59,560
If you want, make a list.

950
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:02,320
What I should do and what I shouldn't do.

951
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:03,680
Okay.

952
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,240
You say I need to be told what to do.

953
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:08,760
No.

954
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:09,920
I don't say this.

955
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:15,040
I'm just wondering how much longer
you're going to keep talking nonsense.

956
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,440
Just give it to me when
you've made the list.

957
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:26,480
Look at this.

958
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:30,720
They've really taken things too far.

959
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,880
Things have heated up now.

960
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,600
Hold on.

961
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,200
Come on, run, girl.

962
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,080
What are you waiting for?

963
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:53,760
Take this and pour water on your husband's
hand, they're coming.

964
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:56,200
No.

965
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:59,040
Water is flowing
from the fountain. He washes his own hand.

966
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,320
Listen to your aunt.

967
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,200
It is both a custom and mutual aid.

968
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,480
Take this and pour it.

969
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:11,120
It shows that you care.

970
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,960
Leave it and give it to me.

971
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,240
It smells so good uncle Durmuş.

972
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,520
Reach out your hand.

973
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:29,920
What?

974
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,720
Come on.

975
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:34,080
What am I doing this?

976
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,120
She said to me.

977
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:42,160
I'll help you to wash your hands.

978
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,200
Custom and sharing.

979
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,640
Come on.

980
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:36,880
What are you doing?

981
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,040
You have flour on your face.

982
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:45,880
It's not your business.

983
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,080
Alright.

984
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:00,480
My sweet little headache.

985
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:12,800
Aunt Güllü.

986
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,360
It smells so good.

987
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,000
Look we did so good.

988
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Girl.

989
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:32,080
Give your husband a piece.

990
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:33,280
I don't give.

991
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,480
Come on.

992
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,280
Take.

993
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:58,000
Feed with your own hands.

994
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,520
Go ahead, don't be shy.

995
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:24,240
Is it enough?

996
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,160
Let me continue.

997
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,360
I'm cooking dear, okay.

998
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,200
Don't tire yourself, give it to me.

999
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:53,240
I'm telling you to take care
of your husband, but you're trying to help.

1000
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,560
Cook it, I'll continue to make it.

1001
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,040
Careful.

1002
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,320
Don't let it burn.

1003
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,040
No, don't worry.

1004
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:47,400
Did you see my brother, Yaşar?

1005
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:49,960
No.

1006
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:57,400
I haven't seen him since
this morning, and he hasn't called either.

1007
01:48:58,680 --> 01:48:59,920
Where is he?

1008
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,640
Hello.

1009
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:04,880
Hello.

1010
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,320
You don't know about my brother either?

1011
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:11,480
But let me check if you'd like.

1012
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,280
I don't think he came.

1013
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:15,040
If it is important.

1014
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,200
Why is she nervous that much?

1015
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,040
Is there something important?

1016
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:32,200
Mr. Ateş isn't here either, is he?

1017
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:34,600
No.

1018
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,600
Mrs. Mercan
isn't here either. No one is around today.

1019
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,480
Is there a meeting or something?

1020
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:43,880
I don't know.

1021
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,320
Hopefully it's good news.

1022
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:48,240
Anyway.

1023
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:49,400
May it be easy.

1024
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,040
Bon appetite!

1025
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:16,160
Bon appetite.

1026
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,080
The dough must have made her hungry.

1027
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:56,480
Eat slowly.

1028
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,440
It'll stay on your stomach.

1029
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:02,800
He is counting my bites.

1030
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,120
Eat, eat, don't stop.

1031
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,440
Eat, my daughter, food is life.

1032
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:18,880
Yes.

1033
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,960
If you've learned to say yes,”

1034
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:23,600
your marriage will surely last.

1035
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,240
Will surely last.

1036
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:26,920
Good.

1037
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,056
It's obvious
you've already made up your mind.

1038
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,600
I can tell from the look in your eyes.

1039
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,320
Take it.

1040
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,720
Your wife made this.

1041
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,600
It wasn't very good. You don't have to eat.

1042
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,160
It’s good.

1043
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,320
He didn't let his wife
say a word and ate the burnt flatbread.

1044
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:00,320
Let me be the porter of the basket

1045
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:07,560
On your back.

1046
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,440
Let me see your face through

1047
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:14,280
the white towel.

1048
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:23,840
What
are you doing standing there like a ghost?

1049
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,560
I need to discuss an important matter with
you.

1050
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Binnaz mother.

1051
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:30,280
Mother.

1052
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:31,840
Mother.

1053
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,240
What?

1054
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:36,360
Is there something bad happened?

1055
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:39,400
Yes but something good this time.

1056
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,080
Don't be afraid.

1057
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:47,200
Everyone is here.

1058
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:48,880
What is the matter?

1059
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:55,320
You can't tie a knot without a knot.
Glad you came, Berat, come on in.

1060
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,960
If only you
could talk, you'd have so much to say, but.

1061
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:00,400
It is about the wedding.

1062
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,920
Wedding.

1063
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:03,680
Yes.

1064
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:06,680
Wedding.

1065
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:08,240
Yes, wedding.

1066
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:11,600
Say whatever you want, I've got work to do.

1067
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,160
It's.

1068
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,520
I.

1069
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:19,240
The milk spilled, mom.

1070
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,080
The milk.

1071
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:25,880
I was going to make yogurt, but you kept me
talking.

1072
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,240
Come, clean it.

1073
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:41,960
Clean it up, turn off
the stove. What a shame.

1074
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:52,200
Aslı.

1075
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,320
Answer the phone, we are wondering.

1076
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:02,560
Pay attention to these. You'll write emails
too. Don't forget the signatures.

1077
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:02,920
Okay.

1078
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:04,520
One minute. Wait.

1079
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:08,480
Hello, yes Mr. Cemal.

1080
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,440
Is Aslı here Mrs. Zahide?

1081
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,160
No, I didn't see her Mr. Cemal.

1082
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,960
God. Where is this girl?

1083
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:20,160
If you want, I'll check with the company
again, but no one came today anyway.

1084
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,520
Mr. Nezir isn't here.

1085
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:23,440
His sister is constantly looking for him.

1086
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,240
Okay Mrs. Zahide.

1087
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:30,760
If Aslı comes
to the company, please let me know.

1088
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,120
Okay, Mr. Cemal. See you.

1089
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,800
Mother Müzeyyen must know where she is.

1090
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,120
Cemal is calling.

1091
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:56,800
Hello Cemal.

1092
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:59,040
Mother, I was going to ask you about.

1093
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:00,320
Did you see Aslı?

1094
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,720
I don't know son.

1095
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,800
She left saying
she was going to the office in the morning.

1096
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:08,360
I can't get through. Either
the phone is off or she's not answering.

1097
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,280
If you can talk to her, let me know.

1098
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,200
Aslı didn't go to the company.

1099
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:15,160
What is this?

1100
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:18,960
There's something about them.

1101
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:21,560
Nezir isn't here.

1102
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,680
Aslı doesn't answer.

1103
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,400
Mother Müzeyyen is weird also, she doesn't
do this.

1104
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,240
There is something, let me see.

1105
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,000
We'll see soon.

1106
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:40,920
How wonderful that you found each other.

1107
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,400
When people look at you, they see love and
say

1108
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:45,120
“God bless you.”

1109
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:49,640
My Lord has given you
the most beautiful gift, your other half.

1110
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:53,600
You will give each
other not just a home, but a life.

1111
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:02,040
Hold each other's hands tightly.

1112
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:05,120
So you don't fall when the storm hits.

1113
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:07,040
Leave them.

1114
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:09,560
Hold hands.

1115
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,080
Give it too.

1116
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,200
Hold your hands.

1117
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:31,160
Congratulations.

1118
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:32,800
The car is okay.

1119
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:36,640
We have to go.

1120
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:39,160
I wish you would stay here today.

1121
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:41,240
Are you in a hurry?

1122
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:42,960
We've already bothered you.

1123
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:44,680
We have to go.

1124
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,840
We're going to have a barbecue.

1125
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:48,920
Don't go.

1126
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:54,200
You'll regret later.

1127
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,480
My barbecue is famous.

1128
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:05,560
We won't upset you then.

1129
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:08,280
Then.

1130
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:11,040
Fish are on you.

1131
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:12,800
We'll handle the things here.

1132
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:16,960
Come on girl, good luck.

1133
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,880
Do you know how to fish?

1134
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:24,640
I know.
Good.

1135
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,360
I guess she doesn't know.

1136
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:29,280
Your husband can teach you.

1137
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:32,240
No, I know.

1138
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,080
In fact, I can teach you.

1139
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:38,480
She is gifted.

1140
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:44,280
My dear wife.

1141
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:48,560
My dear husband.

1142
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,080
Thanks.

1143
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:46,200
I can't talk on the phone.

1144
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:48,360
We have to meet, it is really important.

1145
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,160
Okay.

1146
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:51,480
Let's meet at Beykoz.

1147
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:53,600
No, Beykoz.

1148
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:56,800
Okay.

1149
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:24,201
Hello Mr. Cemal. There
is something that you should know.

1150
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,240
So you're planning to become a mole.

1151
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:29,960
As if you don't know me.

1152
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:32,280
You fool!

1153
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:08,040
We couldn't do it.

1154
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:09,760
We'll be humiliated.

1155
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,000
Not just this.

1156
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:14,680
People will be hungry because of us.

1157
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,720
Fishing is a job that requires patience.

1158
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:21,560
Like everything

1159
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:23,280
you have to wait.

1160
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,400
You have to be patient.

1161
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:27,920
I know.

1162
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:32,200
Fishermen don't enjoy
fishing itself as much as

1163
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:34,480
they enjoy this waiting part.

1164
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:37,520
I'm the same.

1165
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,480
It calms the soul.

1166
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:47,800
I just don't want to come back empty-handed

1167
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:57,960
Let's try again.

1168
02:01:58,960 --> 02:01:59,960
Okay.

1169
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,080
You said that you had known how to fish.

1170
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:34,720
But it doesn't seem like this.

1171
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:36,240
Why sis you say this?

1172
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:38,400
I know.

1173
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:44,520
I caught a fish.

1174
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:46,800
I did, did you see?

1175
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,080
You couldn't but I did.

1176
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:54,800
It doesn't come.

1177
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:58,960
Let me help you.

1178
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:26,320
It pulls.

1179
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:28,440
Hold tight.

1180
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,400
What will we do now?

1181
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,440
The duty was ours.

1182
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,560
We'll do what novice fishermen do.

1183
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:14,360
What?

1184
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:30,440
Wait.

1185
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,080
Wait for the children.

1186
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:34,520
Okay.

1187
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,120
They're here.

1188
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:46,680
Welcome.

1189
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:51,960
How many fish you've caught!

1190
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:56,160
We caught so many
that we gave half of them to the fisherman.

1191
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:04,280
Mercan.

1192
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,960
Let's clean them.

1193
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:08,160
Okay.

1194
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,360
Son, let's prepare the barbecue.

1195
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,840
Bring woods from here, come on.

1196
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,280
From the fine ones.

1197
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:47,600
The home is like home.

1198
02:05:48,280 --> 02:05:50,920
It's been so long
since we've had a peaceful meal.

1199
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,920
I really relaxed today.

1200
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:57,416
The house had turned into a kebab
restaurant.

1201
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,040
Full of noise, too.

1202
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:02,600
We've grown weary of nobility.

1203
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,600
Look.

1204
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:05,680
Look.

1205
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:07,160
There's no one around.

1206
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:08,920
Silence.

1207
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:11,360
Just like in the old days.

1208
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:14,280
What good is a day of enjoyment?

1209
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:17,160
We need to get rid of these people.

1210
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:19,760
As soon as possible.

1211
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:21,360
It's gone on far too long.

1212
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:26,320
You can't live like this, Haydar.

1213
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:28,720
They've literally taken us prisoner.

1214
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,600
Constant humiliation, constant rejection.

1215
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:35,120
Sit there, get up, eat,
drink. They've turned us into toys.

1216
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:39,680
We've become the laughing
stock of strangers in our own home.

1217
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:44,440
Wait Nermin.

1218
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:49,080
Haydar Yıldırım
may have fallen, but he's not dead yet.

1219
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,600
We'll see who's fooling whom soon enough.

1220
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:57,200
I'll get my hands
dirty if I have to get rid of them.

1221
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,200
Their fun is coming to an end.

1222
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,840
They're at the end.

1223
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:05,360
Their end will be very painful.

1224
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:07,720
Very.

1225
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:18,080
The life.

1226
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,120
Life seems like

1227
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:22,640
it will never end when you're young.

1228
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:24,360
But

1229
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:25,800
one day you look down

1230
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:28,280
and your knees won't hold you up.

1231
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:31,560
Those rock-hard hands

1232
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:33,640
are wrinkled.

1233
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,920
You used to have hair,

1234
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:42,480
now you don't.

1235
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:49,720
Autumn has come.

1236
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:51,960
I've grown old.

1237
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:55,520
It's as if it all happened in a single day.

1238
02:07:58,200 --> 02:07:58,840
That's why

1239
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:01,280
every breath is precious.

1240
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:08,160
The best thing is to overcome

1241
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:12,320
all problems hand in hand,

1242
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:14,640
without
getting caught up in worries and troubles.

1243
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:18,600
What did Ruhsati say?

1244
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:21,240
I saw two people

1245
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:22,920
digging a grave.

1246
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:25,760
Grief has come,

1247
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:26,880
it's overwhelming.

1248
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:29,640
Those who live long

1249
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:31,480
live up to a hundred years.

1250
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:36,800
Come and tire yourself
out in this world, crazy heart.

1251
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:41,440
Durmuş.

1252
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:43,440
Why do we need a grave for now?

1253
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:45,560
Turn on a music and

1254
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:47,920
lift our spirits.

1255
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,760
Okay.

1256
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,920
Let's remind them of the date now.

1257
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:01,280
So there
are no problems on the payment day.

1258
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:03,240
Otherwise, I'll miss the day,

1259
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,440
forget the date,

1260
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:06,000
and we won't accept that.

1261
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:08,080
We don't mess around.

1262
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:09,800
No, this won't happen.

1263
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:13,440
I'll put the money

1264
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:15,096
on the table on the day of payment.

1265
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:16,120
That's what we agreed on.

1266
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:19,200
Hello?

1267
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:25,040
Berat.

1268
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,160
Berat.

1269
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:31,320
Malik.

1270
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:32,400
What happened?

1271
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:35,560
Nothing.

1272
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:37,000
No, there is something.

1273
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:38,440
Tell me.

1274
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:40,360
I have a problem.

1275
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:43,000
What are you talking about?

1276
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:44,560
What problem?

1277
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:47,720
I borrowed money from

1278
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:52,400
a loan shark to pay off my debt.
Loan shark?

1279
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:53,920
Loan shark?

1280
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:58,200
That's all we needed.

1281
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:00,680
That's all we needed.

1282
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:07,320
Come on Mercan.

1283
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:08,920
Let's clear the table.

1284
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:10,640
Don't keep the food waiting.

1285
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:25,640
Come on!

1286
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:28,840

1290
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:39,360
I don't know how to dance.

1291
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:42,360
Would you dance?

1292
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:44,280
I danced this a lot when I was young.

1293
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:46,640
Now it's your turn. Come on.

1294

02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:57,360
Come on, come on.

1298
02:12:58,080 --> 02:12:59,919
-Come on. -Come on.

1299
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:01,560
-You can dance. -Come on.
