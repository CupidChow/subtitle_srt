1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,440
What is going on between you two?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,880
You and him are..?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,279
You're married, your last name is Karahan.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,360
Did you hear me?

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,760
What are you accusing me of?

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,480
What kind of a mother are you?
Teach your daughter some manners.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,960
Married women shouldn't have

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,120
strange men at her door picking her up.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,520
You're crossing a line, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,160
What are you trying to say?

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,880
I said what I said.

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,000
This is inappropriate in our
culture. You should act accordingly!

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,240
What do you think you're doing?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,560
No one can send my wife flowers.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Let him go.

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,136
Let him go, what are you doing?

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480
Shut up, don't try to protect him.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,400
Demet sent those flowers.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,840
That's the best lie you could come up with?

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,960
Stop!

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,559
The hospital project,
architectural design of which,

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,439
was done by Mercan
Yıldırım, and is a product of

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,160
a Yıldırım Conglomerate and
Nezir Keseroğlu partnership,

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,200
will be launched at a party
that will be held by Ateş Karahan.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,080
The business world is in suspense.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,176
You're pulling out the big guns, huh?

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Uh-huh.

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,520
You're going to regret this.

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,960
I promise you.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,400
Everyone who turns their back Yıldırıms

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,200
will once again be a slave
at the door of this mansion.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,000
You don't have to play the
role of the loving spouse.

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,160
I'm already relaxed.

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,000
This is just a message.

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,480
So no one comes near what's mine.

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,800
I will dig up the ground myself.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,720
She will pay for every moment

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,320
she touched Ateş, every
moment it drew near!

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
What is this?

40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Read it.

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,240
You can't be that cruel.

42
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,960
This project was my dream.

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,880
You saw how hard I worked.

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,080
Esteemed guests, dear friends.

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,160
We've gathered here for the
opening of Eylül Hospital.

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,840
It is both a pride and an honor for us.

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,320
I invite Mercan Karahan to
continue the presentation.

48
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,960
Mrs. Mercan.

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,000
You made me live this pain.

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,280
And I’ll always remember you with it…

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
without forgiveness!

52
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,840
Oh, wouldn't there be a
presentation? Why did she leave?

53
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,720
Ateş Karahan, you did it again.

54
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,080
Is this what we just prevented?

55
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,400
EYLÜL HOSPITAL

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,160
He had the construction permit canceled.

57
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,160
Keep it up, Ateş Karahan.

58
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,280
Thanks to you, I’m one
step closer to Mercan.

59
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,400
Why Eylül?!

60
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
Why did you give the hospital that name?

61
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
Are you mocking me?

62
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
This hospital was the project of my life.

63
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,680
And you stand there asking
why I gave it that name!

64
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,160
This project belonged to my childhood.

65
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
It meant so much to me.

66
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,600
That’s why I chose to be an architect.

67
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,720
What does this mean now?

68
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,480
But you ruined everything!

69
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,520
You destroyed all my dreams!

70
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,160
She said it was her childhood…

71
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,600
Can that be true?

72
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
Are you happy now?!

73
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,640
Tell me, are you happy?!
Tell me, are you happy?!

74
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,160
I warned you.

75
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
I said I wouldn’t allow it.

76
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,160
You didn’t listen.

77
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,320
You did as you pleased.

78
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,240
Now you face the consequences.

79
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Why do you take away
everything I hold on to?

80
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
Why this grudge, this hatred?!

81
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,160
Every time you plot behind my back,

82
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,920
you’ll find me standing in your way.

83
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,640
I don’t understand.

84
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,840
What do you want from
me? Why are you doing this?

85
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,560
What do you want from me? What?!

86
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,680
I don’t even know what I want anymore.

87
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
This project belonged to my childhood.

88
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,640
It meant so much to me.

89
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,560
But you ruined everything!

90
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,440
You destroyed all my dreams!

91
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,720
Tell me, are you happy?!
Tell me, are you happy?!

92
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,080
Pouring your heart out again?

93
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,760
I don’t understand!

94
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,560
Why did she choose Eylül’s name?!

95
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,680
Why is she doing this?

96
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,600
Why is she thinking of my sister?! Why?!

97
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Why shouldn’t she? Is
that such a bad thing?

98
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,600
She shouldn’t!

99
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
Easy, brother. Don’t get angry right away.

100
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,040
I was surprised too.

101
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,720
I'll be honest. But clearly
your sister left a mark on Mercan.

102
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,760
You got what you wanted.

103
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,160
The project is canceled.

104
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,760
So why the rage?

105
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,640
Don’t look at me like that.

106
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,520
The answer isn’t with me. It’s with you.

107
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,280
Why?

108
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,560
Why am I so angry?

109
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,280
My revenge isn’t against her…

110
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,240
then why?

111
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,640
Why "Eylül?" Why?

112
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,840
I must find out.

113
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,480
I’m being tossed around
in the middle of a storm.

114
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,160
The farther I move away from you,

115
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,480
my path still leads back to you.

116
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,680
Why?

117
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,520
Why doesn’t the storm ever calm?

118
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,680
Anything else, Mrs. Zahide?

119
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,600
Um, One last thing, Mr. Ateş…

120
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,760
Mr. Nezir is requesting a meeting.

121
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,760
Tell him his request is denied.

122
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,600
I have more important matters.

123
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,520
Understood. Is that all?

124
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,280
Mr. Ateş?

125
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,400
I have to hang up now.

126
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,760
I’ll save you the trouble.

127
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,160
I’m going to work.

128
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,040
What work?

129
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,600
You don’t have a project anymore.

130
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,480
For now.

131
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,800
What’s that supposed to mean?

132
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,120
It means you made me
suffer destruction yesterday.

133
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,080
But today, I rose again.

134
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Good for you.

135
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
That project you destroyed, yesterday…

136
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,160
It wasn’t just money.

137
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,520
It meant something to me.

138
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,120
But you trampled it.

139
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,520
What do you mean,

140
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,800
it had meaning?

141
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,000
I don’t want to explain.

142
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,960
And I don’t have to.

143
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,840
I have to find out.

144
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,920
Yes?

145
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,440
How are you? I'm worried about you.

146
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,560
I’m so sorry about yesterday…

147
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,720
I’m fine. Don’t worry.

148
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,200
That’s what I was hoping to hear.

149
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,360
I know how strong you are.

150
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
Don’t let it get to you.

151
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,480
We’ll solve this together.

152
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,400
I believe that too.

153
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,840
No breaking down.

154
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,600
No giving up.

155
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,000
-What are you doing? -The call is over!

156
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,960
Give me my phone! I said give it!

157
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,960
-I said give it! Give it to me!

158
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,160
Hello?

159
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,600
-I said give it! -Mercan?

160
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,440
You’re quitting the job.

161
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,920
Give me the phone!

162
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,200
You won’t talk to him, anymore.

163
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,600
Why?

164
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,080
Because you don’t have a project anymore.

165
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,800
No reason to work with that man as well.

166
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,200
Hello?

167
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,240
You…

168
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,400
You only know how to
wreak havoc, don’t you?

169
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,320
You’re enslaved by your rage and hatred.

170
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
But be sure of this:

171
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,600
whatever you do, it
won’t change the outcome.

172
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,440
Destroy me, burn me...

173
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,040
Every time, I’ll rise again.

174
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,760
Every time you burn me,
I’ll be reborn from the ashes.

175
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,520
Even if I have to do it a thousand times!

176
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,680
But why? Why do you do it?

177
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,040
Just to be a pain?

178
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,640
Huh?

179
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,360
Don’t test my patience.

180
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,640
You’ll never figure it out.

181
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,000
Your mind isn’t enough.

182
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,720
Don’t defy me.

183
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,840
You’ll be the one to lose.

184
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,800
My heart is enough.

185
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,680
It will defeat your mind.

186
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,600
Since you don’t have a heart,

187
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,000
you’ll lose balance.

188
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,040
Fine…I won’t go to the company.

189
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
You win.

190
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,480
I won’t go to the company
but I’ll work from home.

191
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,440
Since you don’t have a heart...

192
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,960
Çiçek, put that börek
on the other side, dear.

193
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,800
Yaşar, we need a new partner
for the hospital project.

194
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,560
Call anyone who’s been involved before.

195
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
I’ll get right on it, Mrs. Mercan.

196
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,680
I don’t expect a long list.

197
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,960
Thanks.

198
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,440
-Good morning. -Good morning, dear.

199
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,640
Good morning, dear.

200
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,880
How are you, love?

201
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,680
Fine.

202
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,680
Do we have any other choice?

203
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,840
Ateş Karahan has crossed
the line, far too much.

204
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,600
He keeps blocking us,

205
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,200
playing with us like a cat with a mouse.

206
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,240
Whatever he does, it’s useless.

207
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,360
I’ll break this game, father.

208
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,200
I’ll build that hospital no matter what.

209
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,760
See?

210
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,960
Here's Haydar Yıldırım's daughter.

211
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,520
My daughter is strong. She does
whatever she sets her mind to.

212
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
I need your help, dad.

213
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,120
Can you please call anyone you know.

214
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,600
We need to fix the permit issue.

215
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,680
Nezir is working on a solution too,

216
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,760
but tackling it from both
sides will speed things up.

217
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,000
They went quiet when we walked in.

218
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,960
Who knows what schemes they're up to again.

219
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,760
Morning, everyone. ASLI: Good morning.

220
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,040
-Good morning. -Good morning, son.

221
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,880
Enjoy your meal.

222
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,320
Go pour the tea.

223
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Do I have to remind you every morning?

224
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,840
Didn’t they teach you manners?

225
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,440
You start with the head of the household.

226
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
He provides your bread and water.

227
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,040
We taught her well, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

228
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,840
We did.

229
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,000
And we taught her properly.

230
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,720
My daughter knows exactly what to do.

231
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,200
Enough.

232
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,600
Let’s eat in peace.

233
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,600
Thank you, dear.

234
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,360
Wouldn’t want to spoil your appetite.

235
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,600
Did you check social media?

236
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,440
Yesterday’s fiasco is everywhere.

237
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,760
“An event with no launch,” someone wrote.

238
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,280
Another mocked, “A hospital
that ended before it began.”

239
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,600
What a disgrace.

240
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,720
Let them mock.

241
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,720
Nothing’s over yet.

242
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,840
Won't you ever stop.

243
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,360
The project is fine,

244
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,960
but I don't get why you
didn’t name it after Murat.

245
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,840
You could’ve honored your brother.

246
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,400
From the moment I decided to build
it, this was the name in my mind.

247
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,600
That's why I didn’t want to change it.

248
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,480
But we’ll do another
project in Murat’s name later.

249
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,400
Bravo.

250
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,200
First time you’ve made a right decision.

251
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,320
For a project like this,
you choose someone meaningful.

252
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,160
I’d understand If there
were an Eylül in our lives.

253
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,880
But there isn’t.

254
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,960
Do you know who this Eylül is?

255
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,360
I don’t know.

256
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Why are you so hung up
on this useless subject?

257
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,440
Eylül or Murat. Either or.

258
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,440
A hospital is a business.
What matters is profit.

259
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,560
-Son! -Ateş!

260
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,360
-What did you do, son?! -Ateş.

261
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,200
Zehra! Zehra!

262
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,760
Clear the table, at once.

263
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,600
If my son left, no one continues.

264
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,600
Çiçek! Çiçek, come here!

265
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,000
Give me a hand. I'm not
clearing all by myself!

266
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,480
Doesn’t matter if they clear it.

267
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,040
I’m in no state to eat.

268
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
They ruined our morning again.

269
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,400
Anyway, I’m going to the club.

270
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,720
My car’s gone, so I’ll have to take a taxi.

271
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,240
What a disgrace.

272
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,240
Oh, Nermin…

273
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
How did you end up like this?

274
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,120
Oh God… patience.

275
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,920
Dear...

276
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,360
I’ll sort out the permit.

277
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,680
I’ll do what I can.

278
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,360
I’ve got a few contacts.

279
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,440
I’ll call them first.

280
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,440
Is he alright?

281
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,840
The event ended early, for some reason.

282
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,960
Something was clearly wrong.

283
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,840
Mrs. Mercan looked so upset,

284
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,600
like she’d gotten bad news.

285
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,960
After she left, Mr. Nezir told the guests

286
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,640
the event was postponed.
Everyone scattered like chicks.

287
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,200
She must’ve been struck by the evil eye.

288
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,320
Did you see her? How beautiful she was.

289
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,160
She looked like a fairy last night.

290
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,880
Especially when she danced with Mr. Ateş…

291
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,600
everyone was staring.

292
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
Definitely the evil eye.
What else could it be?

293
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,520
May the eyes of the envious be blinded.

294
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,760
Exactly.

295
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,480
My brother still hasn’t shown up.

296
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,040
He left early this morning,

297
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,800
didn’t even have
breakfast. Can you believe it?

298
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,320
-Wonder why. -Right.

299
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,080
Gossiping again?

300
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,800
Use your hands, not your mouths.

301
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,120
Buy these. Hurry.

302
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,160
Why do you keep picking on us?

303
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,600
If I were you, I’d stay on my good side.

304
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,600
Or you’ll regret it.

305
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,560
Come on, girl.

306
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,360
Mind your business. We’ll mind ours.

307
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
We’ll never get along, Zehra.

308
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,800
I don’t deal with bad people.

309
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,040
Come on girl.

310
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,360
Is she threatening us? Huh?

311
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,800
Forget it, mom.

312
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,280
I swear, I’ll lose control with her.

313
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,080
Not worth it.

314
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,160
I’ll go get these, then.

315
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,760
Get them, dear.

316
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,480
Rude girl.

317
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,440
Ateş, this won’t do.

318
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,960
Stop being stubborn. Let me check.

319
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,160
If the cut’s deep, you’ll
need stitches. Please.

320
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,520
I checked. No stitches needed.

321
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,320
At least let us dress it, son.

322
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,520
What if it gets infected?

323
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,640
Nothing will happen, Mother Müzeyyen.

324
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,800
Don’t worry.

325
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,160
All because of the Yıldırıms...

326
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,280
They upset you, so you crushed that glass.

327
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,080
See? Neither Nermin nor
Haydar even remember Eylül.

328
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,960
They're stone-hearted.

329
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,120
And Mercan thinks naming
the hospital after Eylül

330
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,120
will ease her conscience.

331
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,960
But it’s not that simple.

332
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,040
A life was lost because of them.

333
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,520
They’ll all pay for what they did to Eylül.

334
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,320
Ladies, maybe we should drop this?

335
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,680
Why? Isn’t this the very reason we’re here?

336
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,000
Enough!!!

337
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,480
Come on, Cemal. We’ve got work to do.

338
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,000
Fine... I was going to the company anyway.

339
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,280
Mom, come with me. I won't stay too long.

340
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,880
We’ll stop by the mall after.

341
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,800
Sure, sounds good.

342
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,480
I’ve never been to the company.

343
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,640
Let’s see what it’s like.

344
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,600
Alas!

345
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,080
If Mother Müzeyyen meddles in
the company, we’re doomed, bro.

346
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,520
Oh, stop it.

347
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,240
Why doomed?

348
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,040
You boys and your nonsense.

349
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Come on now, good luck with your work.

350
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,520
Ateş humiliated Mercan last night.

351
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,600
Honestly, it felt so good.

352
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,840
That’s Ateş for you.

353
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,240
He tore her down.

354
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,280
Her project went up in smoke.

355
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,320
Serves her right.

356
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,280
I hate that girl.

357
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,880
Ateş should never have married her.

358
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,440
A mistake.

359
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,040
We should’ve pressured him more back then.

360
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,560
Maybe he’d have listened.

361
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,480
You talk like you don’t know him.

362
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,400
Once Ateş decides, no
one can change his mind.

363
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,760
Still… Mercan naming the
hospital after Eylül affected him.

364
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,720
Let me tell you.

365
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,880
You’re right.

366
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,960
That girl had a terrible influence on Ateş.

367
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,200
Her mind is sharp, but twisted.

368
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,120
Then let the devil suffer.

369
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,640
The tender will be sealed bids.

370
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,080
We should research the firms,

371
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,720
adjust our offer accordingly.

372
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,600
What’s wrong?

373
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,800
Nothing, bro. I’ll handle it.

374
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,640
Do you regret it?

375
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,080
Blocking the project.

376
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,320
It would’ve carried Eylül’s name.

377
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,400
-I mean, if you knew... -No.

378
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,600
I’ll admit, at first
I was a little affected.

379
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,040
I didn’t expect it.

380
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,880
Maybe because of that.

381
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,000
But even if I’d known,
nothing would’ve changed.

382
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,040
I’d still have stopped it.

383
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,320
Our goal was to strike the Yıldırıms.

384
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,400
And the more I think about
it, the more I’m glad I did.

385
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,000
I’ll never allow Nezir’s money

386
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,000
to be used for something
in my sister’s name.

387
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,280
I don’t need them to honor Eylül.

388
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,480
We’ve already done plenty
of projects in her memory.

389
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,920
My sister’s name, her love, her longing...

390
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,120
They’re always with me.

391
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,520
I’ll build this project
myself if I have to.

392
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,920
Bro,

393
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,240
If that’s not the issue
then what’s bothering you?

394
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,200
Nezir.

395
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,120
We have to stop him
from funding the Yıldırıms.

396
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,320
Is that really all?

397
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,560
Just money?

398
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,000
That’s what I’m fighting for.

399
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,720
See you later, brother.

400
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,600
Time’s short. I need to chase this.

401
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,520
I need a room.

402
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,480
For what?

403
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,760
To work, obviously.

404
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,240
I’ll be working here today.

405
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,080
You can stay.

406
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,440
I’ll allow it.

407
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,680
No need.

408
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,920
I’ll find a quiet corner.

409
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,240
Malik!

410
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,400
MALIK: Oh...

411
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,240
You scared the hell out of me.

412
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,240
Don’t be afraid, Çiçek. It’s me.

413
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,520
Are you alright?

414
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,480
I’m fine. Really.

415
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,160
Maybe a little scared.

416
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,840
Um,

417
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Sorry, my Çiçek. For a moment,
I couldn't control the brakes.

418
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,080
It’s okay. I forgive you.

419
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,720
I was distracted anyway.

420
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,960
What’s wrong, my Çiçek? Why so distracted?

421
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,040
I thought about what we
talked about all night.

422
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,200
Yeah?

423
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,720
Let's not wait anymore.

424
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,680
Let's tell my mom everything.

425
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,480
If she hears from someone
else, she’ll tear us both apart.

426
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
She won’t just tear us apart

427
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,800
she’ll pull a gun and shoot.

428
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,320
She does. I'm sure.

429
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,960
So… shall we talk to her?

430
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,880
Really?

431
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,080
Let’s do it. Let's talk to her right now.

432
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,520
Great. Let's go.

433
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,320
Give it to me.

434
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,160
Oh no. Not like this.

435
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,920
We're already close to the mansion.

436
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,640
I'll go first. You follow me, alright?

437
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Fine. Let's do it that way.

438
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,000
-Well, I'll see you, then. -See you there.

439
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,880
What are you doing?

440
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,960
What does it look like?

441
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,960
I’m not heartless like you.

442
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,120
I can’t ignore someone in pain.

443
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,520
You may have taken everything from me,

444
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,920
but I still have my humanity.

445
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,000
It’s a bad cut.

446
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,120
Why would anyone do this to himself?

447
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,040
Did I hurt you? Sorry.

448
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,760
Let’s put this on, so
it doesn’t get infected.

449
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,200
You keep surprising me.

450
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,280
Funny, isn’t it? We
both hurt our left hands.

451
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,040
What a coincidence.

452
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,000
Perfect harmony, Mr…

453
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,160
Mr what?

454
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,480
Mr... Just out of respect.

455
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,920
Nice bracelet.

456
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,960
Why?

457
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,960
-Why what? -Why do you like it?

458
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,240
I don’t know. It’s just nice.

459
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,400
What will you do with the project?

460
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,120
Are you mocking me?

461
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,120
Do I look like I am?

462
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,680
Huh, no.

463
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,680
Even a stone of patience
would crack with you.

464
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,520
It wouldn’t just crack. It would shatter.

465
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,960
You ruined my work, and
now you ask what I’ll do?

466
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,560
Come on. This is too much.

467
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,000
If you still want it, you can
make the hospital project happen.

468
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,520
I want to do it.

469
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,960
But…

470
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,360
NEZİR CALLING

471
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,720
There are conditions.

472
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,080
I should’ve known.

473
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,680
Foolish of me to think you’d show mercy.

474
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,560
We’ll work together.

475
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,120
And you’ll give up all financial
and legal rights to the project.

476
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,880
Unbelievable.

477
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,600
You’re stealing my project, is that it?

478
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,480
Weren’t you the one who
said money doesn’t matter?

479
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,600
Here’s your chance.

480
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,360
I’m not interested in your offer.

481
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,320
I’ll find another way.

482
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,760
There’s a permit issue that needs fixing.

483
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,160
That's why I'm calling you.

484
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,440
I'll need your strong connections.

485
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,680
Can you handle it?

486
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,440
Nothing I can do, Haydar.

487
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,960
I can’t go against Ateş Karahan.

488
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,520
-If he finds out… -Enough!

489
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,280
Spare me. I don’t need your favors.

490
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,600
I know you'll be talking behind my back.

491
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,360
But don't forget: Haydar
Yıldırım isn’t dead yet.

492
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,440
They’ll see. You as well.

493
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,520
Those old scores will be settled.

494
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,840
Enough! Hang up!

495
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,000
How come you're still around?

496
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Didn't you going to the club?

497
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,400
I did. Wish I didn't.

498
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,120
They wouldn’t let me
in. Can you believe it?

499
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,640
My membership was canceled for unpaid fees.

500
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,840
I was humiliated.

501
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,960
Nermin,

502
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,360
I’ve got enough on my plate.
I can't take your nonsense.

503
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,920
Come on, let’s go inside.

504
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,680
Fine. Fine.

505
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,000
Nothing can be said to you anyway.

506
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,560
Oh, Çiçek, have you heard from Berat?

507
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,280
I haven’t seen him since last night.

508
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,320
I'm worried. Where can he be?

509
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,400
Has something happened to him?

510
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,000
Don’t worry, Aunt Binnaz. Berat’s fine.

511
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,720
Just busy.

512
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,000
Um... Mom…

513
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,640
we need to talk to you
about something important.

514
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,600
You know me, Aunt Binnaz.

515
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,280
Em... No drinking, no gambling, thank God.

516
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,720
I work hard.

517
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,760
You know what they
say: "a good family boy."

518
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,600
Well, that’s exactly what I am.

519
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,920
I mean, what I'd wish to say is that...

520
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,200
Berat! Berat, what happened, son?

521
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,800
Why don't you tell me! What happened, son?!

522
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,080
Brother, tell us what happened?!

523
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,120
What's wrong, son?! Speak!

524
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,800
What happened, Berat?

525
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,840
Something terrible.

526
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,120
What?!

527
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,600
I crashed the car.

528
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,320
Which one?

529
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,080
-The mansion's car. -Oh!

530
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,400
Welcome.

531
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,600
Make two plain coffees for us.

532
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,880
- With lots of foam.
- I'll bring it right away.

533
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,360
It seems we got carried away.

534
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,400
But we bought such nice stuff.

535
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,720
Especially, this one.
I fell in love with it.

536
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,400
I couldn’t leave it behind.

537
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,800
It suit very well on you.

538
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,320
You look like a swan in it.

539
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,960
Gorgeous.

540
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,680
Beautiful.

541
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,640
Welcome, ladies.

542
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,880
How was shopping?

543
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,400
We bought a few things.

544
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,800
Where’s Ateş? How’s his hand?

545
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,560
He's fine, Aslı. No worries.

546
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,880
Cuts don’t bother him.

547
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,160
Finally, I was at the company, today.

548
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,480
Everyone at the company talks about Nezir.

549
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,400
They say he and Mercan are close.

550
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,120
It upset me.

551
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,320
Come on, mom, as if you don't know Cemal.

552
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,560
He won’t comment.

553
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,480
He’s afraid of Ateş.

554
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,080
I’ve got work. Excuse me, I’ll be outside.

555
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,080
That’s him... runs away
whenever things get tough.

556
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,480
Soon he’ll even call her "sister-in-law."

557
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,640
Aslı.

558
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,080
You’ve no filter, girl.

559
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,080
Shame on you.

560
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,400
Anyway, I'm exhausted.

561
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,720
I’m going to rest in my room.

562
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,080
Are you angry at me?

563
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,880
Do I have the right to be?

564
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,040
Don’t be like that.
What’s with this Right talk?

565
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,400
Why so angry?

566
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,560
Please, Aslı. Drop it.

567
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,640
You’re siding with that girl against me.

568
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,320
No.

569
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,880
Alright, I’m not mad at
you. Let’s not drag this out.

570
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,000
Cemo, don’t be like this.

571
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,360
I'll be heartbroken.

572
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,280
Ateş already turned his back on me.

573
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,040
Don’t you turn away too.

574
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,760
Aslı, no one turned their back on you.

575
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,640
You are the one.

576
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,120
But your hatred is drowning you.

577
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,360
And with those waves,
you try to drown others.

578
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,120
Don’t do that, Aslı. Stop. Wait.

579
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,000
Is there even time left to wait?

580
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,480
What I say won’t matter, will it, Aslı?

581
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,800
It won't matter.

582
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,560
You’re right. I’ve lost my balance.

583
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,680
But you have to understand me.

584
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,480
Seeing her around Ateş all the time…

585
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,880
It's all her fault. I
had nothing to do with it.

586
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,000
You’re letting your feelings win.

587
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,800
I know you don’t like that girl.

588
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,640
But there's something you don't know.

589
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,200
That girl isn’t to blame.

590
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,960
I can’t believe you.

591
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,360
I’ll always speak the
truth, even if it kills me.

592
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,640
And what I see is very
different from what you claim.

593
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,800
Listen before you shout.

594
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,280
This hospital matters to me.

595
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,800
It’s not just money. It’s prestige.

596
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,000
So you see, I’m losing not
only money but reputation.

597
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,200
I warned you.

598
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm not responsible.

599
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,080
In fact, I gave you a blank check to leave.

600
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,160
You ignored me.

601
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,960
Now face the consequences.

602
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,200
I'm not the only one who lost.

603
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,880
You’re losing profit too.

604
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,760
And what do you lose if you reconsider?

605
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,400
It also meant a lot to Mercan.

606
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,880
Nezir, please.

607
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,280
I don’t want trouble.

608
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,760
I didn’t come here to cause trouble.

609
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,360
On the contrary, I’m here to solve it.

610
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,760
I was telling Ateş he’s too narrow‑minded.

611
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,120
Besides, chasing a single goal is risky.

612
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,920
Investments should be diversified.

613
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,880
At least I have a goal.

614
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,720
I’m not drifting like a rudderless ship.

615
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,080
Explorers drift too.

616
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,080
Maybe I’m finding new routes.

617
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,240
Then you’re doomed to get lost.

618
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,680
While you wander,

619
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,920
I’ll already be at my destination.

620
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,480
Sometimes getting lost is good.

621
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,040
Life needs adventure.

622
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,960
The opposite is boring.

623
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,200
Road may be an adventure for you.

624
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,880
For me, it's just a purpose.

625
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,560
I’m the traveler.

626
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,840
The road ends,

627
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,520
but the journey never does.

628
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,760
Enough.

629
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,720
I’ve got more important work.

630
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,360
Let me tell you...

631
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,320
You don’t need enemies.

632
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,000
You’ll destroy yourself.

633
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,880
And I’ll enjoy watching.

634
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,680
I have a meeting about this project.

635
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,840
Nothing is over yet.

636
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,720
I’ll stop by when I'm done.

637
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,800
We’ll see what we can do.

638
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,440
See you later, Mercan.

639
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,920
We’ll meet again.

640
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,120
Your end will be by my hand.

641
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,680
This time, you’ll have no way out.

642
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,480
The offer I made this morning still stands.

643
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,160
I want that project.

644
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,440
If you're smart, accept
it before I change my mind.

645
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,280
Because I won't let you work with that man.

646
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,000
Hopefully, you understand now.

647
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,560
You know I keep my word.

648
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,720
Hello, Yaşar.

649
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,000
Please tell me you have good news.

650
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,880
My father couldn’t help.

651
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,640
You’re my last hope.

652
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,640
Sorry, Mrs. Mercan.

653
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,520
I spoke to four investors.

654
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,320
But none are interested.

655
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,600
Two mentioned the failed launch.

656
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,800
The others won’t join
without Ateş Karahan’s support.

657
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,960
Thank you anyway.

658
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,120
You tried.

659
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,960
You used to say money
wasn’t what mattered to you.

660
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,040
Mercan, you won’t forget me, will you?

661
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,880
Never! How could I forget you?

662
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,520
Eylül, I promise.

663
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,760
I will remember you.

664
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,440
You won't forget me, will you?

665
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,560
I won't forget you. Promise.

666
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,360
I’ve come too far to give up.

667
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,360
I’ll do whatever it takes.

668
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,920
I’m listening.

669
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,200
Your predictions were right.

670
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,600
Haydar and Mercan knocked on every door,

671
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,040
but all said no.

672
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,120
We’ve dealt with everyone.

673
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,400
But Nezir… he still insists.

674
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,400
Maybe because we snatched away
the bride he was about to marry?

675
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,240
Don’t look at me like that, bro.

676
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,800
I’m just saying what I see.

677
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,280
It’s a bitter truth,
like Adana kebab spice.

678
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,120
Tell me, didn’t all this happen?

679
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,800
That subject is closed.

680
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,000
Never bring it up again.

681
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,840
She’s my wife now.

682
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,720
Fine, let’s drop it.

683
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,560
I kept quiet until I couldn’t anymore.

684
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,760
But I have to say this.

685
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,520
Why are you so obsessed with this man?

686
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,520
Isn’t Haydar supposed to be the target?

687
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,800
The offer I made this morning still stands.

688
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,880
I want that project.

689
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,600
If you're smart, accept
it before I change my mind.

690
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,200
Even hearing Nezir’s
name throws you off balance.

691
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,800
This isn’t just about money or the project.

692
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,800
What are you implying?!

693
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,800
I’m not implying, brother.
I’m telling you what I see.

694
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,640
Get mad at me if you want.
You don’t realize it…

695
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,680
Realize what?

696
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,480
There’s already a fire here.

697
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,000
There’s already a fire here.

698
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,640
Your rage against him comes from that.

699
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,480
You’re obviously jealous of Nezir…

700
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,840
You’re obviously jealous of Nezir…

701
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,520
You’re obviously jealous of Nezir…

702
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,560
What are you doing here?

703
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,360
We need to talk.

704
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,160
I thought about your
offer and came to talk.

705
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,520
This?

706
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,480
This is what you came to say?

707
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,240
What else did you expect?

708
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,680
It’s about the hospital…

709
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,520
Didn’t they teach you to knock?

710
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,080
Another example of
thinking you know everything

711
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,000
when you know nothing.

712
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,960
Doors aren’t for listening,
they’re for knocking.

713
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,800
I wasn’t listening.

714
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,600
I came to talk.

715
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,640
But pardon me… I forget
you don’t talk to anyone.

716
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,360
The ember has fallen, brother…

717
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,280
Your rage and hatred for
this man comes from that.

718
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,200
You’re obviously jealous of Nezir…

719
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,440
Say what you came to say.

720
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,920
Later. When you calm down…

721
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,160
I am calm!

722
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,760
This is your calm?

723
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,000
Fine. I’m calm. Speak.

724
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,720
The hospital project…

725
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,080
It’s deeply important to me.

726
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,960
It’s tied to a promise I made long ago.

727
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,520
Yes, my anger toward you is huge.

728
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,520
But this project…

729
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,560
is too valuable to be
buried under that anger,

730
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,080
too sacred to be tainted by it.

731
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,560
When I started,

732
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,200
my goal was to keep my promise
and free myself from you.

733
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,360
One day I will.

734
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,760
But I don’t want the
hospital to wait until then.

735
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,560
So?

736
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,640
So, I accept your offer.

737
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,720
No matter what, you’ll gain
nothing material from this.

738
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,040
I know.

739
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,200
Right now money matters…

740
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,560
but some things are always
more important than money.

741
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,080
That’s all.

742
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,920
When I started,

743
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,960
my goal was to keep my promise
and free myself from you.

744
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,080
One day I will.

745
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,120
But I don’t want the
hospital to wait until then.

746
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,600
What’s happening to us?

747
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,120
Don’t worry, mom.

748
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,200
We paid the first installment.

749
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,800
We’ll handle this too.

750
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,600
You’re right, daughter.

751
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,840
At least we paid our debt for now.

752
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,520
We’ll fix the car somehow. Right?

753
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,440
-We will, mom. -We'll fix it, son. Will we?

754
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,960
Why are you looking
at each other like that?

755
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,720
Brother? Malik?

756
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,440
Son, there isn’t something else, is there?

757
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,160
Tell me there isn’t.

758
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,480
Actually, Berat wants to tell you…

759
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,840
What?

760
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,800
Berat…

761
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,200
Son… If there’s more,

762
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,280
my heart can’t take another blow.

763
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,840
Earlier… when she came, it was cut short.

764
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,080
There can’t be anything
between us, not like you implied.

765
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,400
No jealousy.

766
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,840
We came here to play the final game.

767
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,840
You say an ember has fallen…

768
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,880
There's only one fire within me, brother.

769
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,960
And that is the fire of revenge.

770
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,120
She’s my enemy’s daughter.

771
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,120
So, to me she can only ever be… an enemy.

772
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,400
There's life, Cemal.

773
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,520
Between us lies a bitter life.

774
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,160
In my game, she’s just a pawn.

775
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,640
Here today… gone when the game ends.

776
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,360
Know this, and don’t bring it up again.

777
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,600
Brother, you speak right,

778
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,960
but you know me.

779
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,600
I always speak what I believe is true.

780
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,320
And I say what you believe is wrong.

781
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,680
Alright then, if you say so…

782
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,720
Enough. Go.

783
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,680
Cemal! Yes, Mother Müzeyyen.

784
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,600
I heard you with Ateş.

785
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,840
What’s going on, son? Did he do something?

786
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,720
Is there something with Mercan?

787
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,400
Come on, Mother Müzeyyen.

788
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,160
Have you ever seen me
gossip, all these years?

789
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,360
Does it suit a man of
honor? Especially about Ateş?

790
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,360
You misunderstood, son.

791
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,360
I ask because I care about Ateş.

792
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,240
If there’s something
we can do, we should help.

793
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,240
Then ask him, not me.

794
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,560
You know I never betray anyone’s secrets.

795
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,280
Look, even my enemies know that.

796
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,400
And you… Anyway, let’s say you
didn’t ask, and I didn’t hear.

797
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,760
Ah, my good hearted sons…

798
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,680
Our enemies are ready for anything,

799
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,800
yet you cling to honor.

800
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,760
With this goodness, you’ll end
up destroyed by the dishonorable…

801
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,320
Kill me, son!

802
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,880
My death will be at your hands anyway.

803
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,120
End it now, and we’ll both be free.

804
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,080
Mom, drink a little.

805
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,040
Give me poison, dear,
what’s the use of water!

806
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,600
May God treat you the
way you deserve, Berat!

807
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,280
The debt still stands, and
you’ve wrecked the boss’s car.

808
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,560
You turned the Karahans’ car into a taxi…

809
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,160
What will we do if they find out?

810
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,960
Mom, calm down. I’m
scared something will happen.

811
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,640
Brother, how could you do this?

812
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,800
Why do you provoke mom, sister?

813
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,320
You’ll make her sick.

814
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,360
Unbelievable. You mess up and blame me.

815
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,960
Son... Son, have you lost your mind?

816
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,320
Mom, it all came from good intentions.

817
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,960
I trusted a childhood
friend to pay the debt.

818
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,240
He cheated us.

819
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,320
Tried extra work... had an accident.

820
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,400
The more I tried to fix
things, the deeper I sank.

821
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,040
You sank, and dragged us down too.

822
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,760
Now how will we get out?

823
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,800
The bank could knock any moment.

824
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,520
And if Ateş or that
witch Müzeyyen find out,

825
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,080
I swear, they’ll throw us out in no time.

826
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,960
Okay, calm down.

827
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,120
Aunt Binnaz, don't say
that. We'll find a way.

828
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,160
We'll solve it.

829
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,160
We'll find a way.

830
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,000
He says he'll solve.

831
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,840
He says he will.

832
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,040
Centuries pass, and nothing changes.

833
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,320
Even back then, the
woman said the same thing:

834
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,760
"Happiness in marriage is pure luck."

835
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,600
What am I even saying?

836
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,840
This man has thrown me off balance.

837
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:55,600
Mercan, I’ve thought of some
adjustments to the project.

838
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,360
You’ll love them.

839
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,960
Nezir, there’s something
I need to tell you.

840
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,000
I’ve gone back to the company.

841
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,960
So, we won’t be working together.

842
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,840
I’m sorry… it’s sudden, I
know, but it had to be this way

843
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,800
I get it.

844
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,400
Don’t beat yourself up.

845
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,280
None of what’s happening in
your life right now is your fault.

846
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,640
He’s asking for a beating!

847
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,000
She’s my enemy’s daughter.

848
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,120
She can only ever be an enemy.

849
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,040
Between us lies life itself, Cemal.

850
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,800
A bitter life.

851
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,760
Mercan is just a pawn in my revenge game.

852
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,800
Here today… gone when the game ends.

853
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,960
But you do know you cannot
trust that man, don't you?

854
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,480
Whatever he tells you, don’t believe him.

855
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,160
You’ve seen how he tramples
everything whenever he wants…

856
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,560
Leave before I throw you out.

857
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,800
What do you think you’re doing?

858
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,840
First you cancel the project,
then you bring it back?

859
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,960
I did what I saw fit.

860
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,280
My wife has returned to the company.

861
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,160
She’ll work with me, where she belongs.

862
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,640
You’ve lost your excuse.

863
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,000
Stop getting under my feet.

864
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,600
You see?

865
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,080
- While there’s still time...
- While there’s still time,

866
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,800
every road led back to me.

867
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,240
You’ve gone too far.

868
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,120
Hello?

869
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,080
Pick one of your toughest men.

870
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,440
I want shadowing… and cleanup.

871
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,800
You actually enjoy being rude.

872
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,880
Let’s just say I treat
people the way they deserve.

873
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,960
No.

874
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,400
I’ll never understand you.

875
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,160
You carry a hatred I’ve
never seen in anyone before…

876
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,600
for everything, for everyone.

877
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,160
No one can live like that!

878
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,480
You’ve got what you wanted.

879
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,280
Everything’s going your
way. What more do you want?

880
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,760
Not everything.

881
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,680
You keep meeting that man, talking to him.

882
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,080
I tell you to stop, and you don’t.

883
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,280
Live however you please!

884
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,280
Do whatever you want!

885
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,200
Maybe my test in life is
trying to understand you!

886
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,000
Live however you please!

887
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,440
If I’m free to do whatever I
want, then what’s with all this?

888
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,560
Hot and cold… such a bully.

889
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,240
All bluster and bark…

890
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,040
Good luck with the work, Çiçek.

891
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,480
Thank you, Mrs. Mercan.

892
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,120
I want to ask you something.

893
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,600
Where did the old things
from the basement go?

894
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,040
Mrs. Müzeyyen ordered
them to be moved to storage.

895
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,400
I got it.

896
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,680
Are you alright?

897
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,200
You look unwell. Are you sick?

898
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,320
No, I am fine.

899
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,640
I'll come with you, we can check together.

900
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,200
Are you sure?

901
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,440
Yes, no problem.

902
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,320
Fine.

903
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,920
We told Mrs. Müzeyyen these
things would get damp here,

904
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,280
but she wouldn't listen.

905
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,400
The photos are ruined…

906
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,720
If you do not need
anything else, I will go.

907
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,760
Sure, go rest a little.

908
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,240
What are you hiding?

909
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,200
Nothing.

910
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,000
Show me what you're hiding.

911
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,480
I won't.

912
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,840
Then I will take it myself.

913
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,360
Try if you can.

914
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,480
My childhood friends…

915
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,080
I remember the day this was taken.

916
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,000
We laughed so much, had such fun…

917
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,760
Children! Pose for me!

918
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,200
Pose for me! Come close.

919
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,520
Ready!

920
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,720
I'm taking it!

921
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,720
I always remember them happy.

922
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,920
Those were the truest laughs of my life…

923
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,040
Especially Eylül.

924
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,680
Her smile was so warm.

925
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,400
Maybe because

926
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,800
I was such a lonely child.

927
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,440
I don't remember a lot.

928
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,520
I guess back then they meant so much to me…

929
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,280
they keep coming alive in my mind.

930
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,240
I wish they were here…

931
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,160
laughing like that again.

932
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,320
Mercan! Mercan!

933
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,320
Mercan?

934
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,200
Are you alright, Mercan?

935
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,240
Mercan! Mercan!

936
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,440
-Step aside! -What happened!

937
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,560
Let go!

938
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,040
What did he do to my daughter?!

939
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,960
Lift her up. Carry her off?

940
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,080
I keep telling her not to mix with them,

941
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,760
but she never listens.

942
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,480
What did you do to my girl!

943
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,040
What did you do to my Mercan?!

944
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,360
What did you do to my girl!

945
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,920
What did you do to my girl!

946
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,640
My girl!

947
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,360
What did you do... to my girl!

948
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,240
Where are you going! What happened?

949
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,280
-Mercan! -Step aside!

950
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,560
-What happened?! -Let go!

951
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,480
What did you do to my girl!

952
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,200
What did you do to my Mercan?!

953
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,600
What did you do to may girl?!

954
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,920
This is how different we are…

955
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,800
All those memories you call happiness

956
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,880
are scars on me…

957
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,680
Even if it’s the last
thing I do in this world,

958
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,080
I’ll make you regret this, Haydar.

959
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,120
You stole my childhood.

960
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,200
You took my sister from me.

961
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,960
I’m dead tired.

962
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,400
Work just finished.

963
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,040
Why don't you close the door, dear?

964
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,840
My brother is getting in.

965
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,520
Berat, I’m at the end of
my rope. Don’t say a word.

966
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,600
Okay, mom. I won’t.

967
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,360
Mom,

968
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,320
don’t be like this.

969
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,360
Honestly, he’ll get sick.

970
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,760
Nothing will happen. Let
him learn the hard way.

971
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,120
I swear, I’m worn out
thinking of this and that…

972
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,760
Mom, don’t.

973
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,800
We’ll handle it. Okay?

974
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,880
How, daughter, how?

975
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,120
Shall I make you a coffee?
It’ll ease your fatigue.

976
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,640
No, dear. I’m already losing
sleep from all this thinking.

977
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,120
I don’t want to lose more.

978
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,560
Let me make.

979
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,240
It won't hurt. Come on.

980
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,960
-Çiçek... -Yeah?

981
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,920
He won’t get sick from
all this worry, will he?

982
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,280
Oh, my sweet mom, you
just can never hurt us.

983
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,520
No, no. Don't worry.

984
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,600
But you mustn’t get sick either, okay?

985
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,840
- Then, I'm making the coffee.
- Well, make it, then.

986
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,960
That’s the wrong room, Ateş…

987
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:50,040
But when all this fuss is over
and we’re back in our own home,

988
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,520
you’ll find the right one.

989
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,120
I won’t let that girl come between us.

990
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,280
You were always mine.

991
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,680
You’ll always be mine.

992
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,920
They say aging is cruel.

993
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,600
All praise is sung to youth…

994
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,800
But the old, stripped
of passion and desire,

995
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,720
think more clearly.

996
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,360
They make the right choices without
being slaves to their emotions.

997
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,240
Ateş, blinded by youth, ignores me

998
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,680
and insists on his own way.

999
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,400
But the path he walks leads him astray.

1000
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,400
Living by emotions drags you into mistakes.

1001
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,280
Try to burn someone, and
you’ll be the one burned.

1002
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,320
You’re right, mother.

1003
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,720
But I don’t want to be right.

1004
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,640
I want to be happy.

1005
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,320
But I don’t want to be right.

1006
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,320
I want to be happy.

1007
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,760
You’re okay, right?

1008
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,880
Nothing’s wrong.

1009
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,880
The hospital’s name…

1010
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,800
why Eylül?

1011
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:15,840
The photo I showed you…

1012
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,040
my friends…

1013
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,840
The girl with the beautiful
smile... her name was Eylül.

1014
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:27,160
So you want to name it
after your childhood friend?

1015
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,120
Why?

1016
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,000
I don’t know.

1017
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,360
I was a lonely child,

1018
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,240
always guarded, always watched…

1019
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,840
They were the only ones around me.

1020
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,040
As kids we promised

1021
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,280
never to forget each other.

1022
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,200
Maybe that’s why… maybe something else.

1023
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,400
I don't know.

1024
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,120
It’s hard to explain.

1025
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:14,160
Sometimes something happens and you
just know it’s tied to your fate…

1026
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,680
That’s what it feels like.

1027
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,640
Where are they now?

1028
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,920
I asked my father that
so many times as a child…

1029
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,640
He said they were going
to their grandparents,

1030
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,920
that they wouldn’t return.

1031
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,680
And they never did.

1032
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,760
She never came back. Because
she died because of your father.

1033
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:40,920
I always missed them.

1034
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:49,960
Eylül is vivid in my memory…

1035
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,600
but the boy’s name I can never recall.

1036
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,040
Something like

1037
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,640
Mahir, or Kadir…

1038
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,000
But I never forgot you.

1039
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:23,160
Because of Haydar.

1040
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,640
Tahir.

1041
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,520
Tahir!

1042
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,800
Eylül's brother is...

1043
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,560
Tahir. I remembered.

1044
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,800
I saw him in my dream.

1045
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,760
Tahir came,

1046
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,520
sat at the foot of my
bed, watching me quietly.

1047
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,720
Then,

1048
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,760
my hair had fallen across my face.

1049
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,800
He gently brushed it aside.

1050
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,200
He covered me, then left.

1051
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,040
It’s only because we spoke
of them so much yesterday.

1052
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,760
Don’t dwell on it.

1053
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,320
Apparently they were just
the workers’ children here.

1054
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
That doesn’t make them unimportant.

1055
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,760
Mind your words about Tahir and Eylül!

1056
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,080
Here you go, mom.

1057
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,640
Thank you, dear.

1058
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,040
We need to get it fixed right away

1059
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,680
but with what money…

1060
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,880
At my age, I’m tested with
someone else’s property…

1061
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,440
Better I had died than
live to see these days.

1062
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,640
Mom, yes it’s bad,

1063
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,400
but don’t talk about dying…

1064
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:00,280
Look, we’ll find a way. Okay?

1065
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,840
Pull yourself together.

1066
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:05,600
Çiçek, Zehra mustn’t hear of this

1067
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,880
If she tells them,

1068
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,280
they’ll throw us out
the minute they find out.

1069
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:11,600
Right.

1070
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,440
Come, son, come.

1071
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,640
You see what’s happened to us.

1072
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,520
Don’t torment yourself.

1073
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,760
Today we cry, tomorrow we laugh again…

1074
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,480
But we must act.

1075
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,280
We can’t hide this
forever. It will be found out.

1076
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,520
No, no, son! We’ll hide it to the end.

1077
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,760
Those who wronged the
mighty Yıldırım family

1078
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:44,120
would trample us like insects.

1079
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,320
Um, I don’t think Mr. Ateş is like that.

1080
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,640
I believe, he’ll understand
if we speak with him.

1081
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,040
He might get angry,

1082
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:53,920
maybe dock our pay.

1083
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,840
But of course, he’d be right to.

1084
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,040
That may be… Right.

1085
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:02,360
If they hear you gave them
the car, they’ll fire you too.

1086
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,160
You’ve burned him as well, Berat Effendi.

1087
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:13,720
You had no mercy on your mother,
at least you could’ve spared him.

1088
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,120
Don’t worry about me.

1089
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,960
As long as this debt is
paid, that’s what matters.

1090
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,800
I’ll fend for myself.

1091
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,120
We’ll find a way…

1092
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,600
Um, Çiçek... Um...

1093
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:39,400
Çiçek, soak the chickpeas, so we
put them in the pot at once, dear.

1094
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,320
- I will, mom.
- The grass has grown long. I’ll go cut it.

1095
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,800
And I was just about to
take a look at the car.

1096
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,200
See you.

1097
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,800
I can't figure out how we can manage this.

1098
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,880
-I mean... -No problem. We'll manage.

1099
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
-You said it won't happen but... It will.

1100
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,360
Mrs. Mercan is coming back to the company.

1101
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,600
I never understood why
she left in the first place.

1102
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,600
Mrs. Mercan is a good manager,

1103
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:31,240
very successful in her work.

1104
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:36,080
Whether Mr. Ateş dismisses someone

1105
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,440
or brings them back, he has his reasons.

1106
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:42,440
Hello, how are you?

1107
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,960
Welcome, Ms. Demet. I’m
doing great, thank you.

1108
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,480
And Mrs. Mercan is
returning to the company too.

1109
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,040
I wanted to give you the news
so you’d be happy to hear.

1110
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,200
Come on, Burak!

1111
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:58,920
Couldn’t you leave some of the news for us?

1112
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,920
Oh, that’s really good news.

1113
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,120
Are you just standing here talking
about who’s coming and going?

1114
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,320
Get back to work…

1115
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,360
Burak! Come on!

1116
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,360
Come on.

1117
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,040
See you Demet Hanım.

1118
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,880
Brother, why are you shouting at people?

1119
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,280
Demet, don’t start with
that sympathy talk again.

1120
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,600
But it’s true!

1121
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,200
And did you know Mercan was coming back?

1122
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,000
Unbelievable…

1123
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,880
If you knew, why didn’t
you tell me earlier, brother?

1124
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:41,720
Is Mercan returning to work under
Ateş really something to celebrate?

1125
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,520
The man’s crazy,

1126
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,160
he’s hurting Mercan…

1127
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,040
Speak.

1128
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,480
Is he competent?

1129
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,160
Fine. Keep him on standby.

1130
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:07,520
Nothing's over yet.

1131
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,160
We still have bullets left.

1132
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,080
If we can’t find the money and fix the car,

1133
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,240
we’ll be fired.

1134
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:25,880
And then we won’t be
able to see each other.

1135
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,080
I won't be like that.

1136
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,200
I’ll find a way.

1137
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,240
What, a lottery win?

1138
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,840
Just when everything was getting better…

1139
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,760
Oh, my brother, oh.

1140
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:39,880
What can he do…

1141
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,760
He was trying to find a solution.

1142
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,560
Why didn’t you stop him?

1143
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,120
Your brother?

1144
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,360
Do you think he'd listen to me?

1145
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,920
He wouldn’t, you’re right.

1146
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,720
With things like this, we can’t
announce our relationship either.

1147
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,760
Our happiness was short lived…

1148
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,760
The car will be back to normal soon.

1149
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,240
We’ll find the money.

1150
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,880
Our happiness will last. Don’t worry.

1151
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,560
Don't be sad.

1152
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:25,240
Huddled together like this,
they’re definitely up to something.

1153
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,080
Let’s see what it is…

1154
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:48,080
Mom, where’s dad?

1155
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,920
Don’t know, he went out early to…

1156
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:54,080
somewhere.

1157
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:22,360
Mom,

1158
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,640
do you know where Eylül and Tahir are?

1159
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,160
Who?

1160
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,520
Eylül and Tahir.

1161
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,000
Who are they?

1162
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,680
They stayed here for a
while when I was a child…

1163
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,920
How would I know where they are…

1164
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:54,640
What’s with this nostalgia
breeze first thing in the morning?

1165
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,280
I found a photo of us together…

1166
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:01,840
Ask your father.

1167
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,280
If anyone knows, he does.

1168
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:08,520
Fine. I will.

1169
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,360
Okay.

1170
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,080
Wait outside.

1171
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,640
Yes, sir.

1172
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,360
Okay.

1173
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:23,120
It’s only because we spoke
of them so much yesterday.

1174
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:24,600
Don’t dwell on it.

1175
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,480
Apparently they were just
the workers’ children here.

1176
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,280
That doesn’t make them unimportant.

1177
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,920
Mind your words about Tahir and Eylül!

1178
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,360
NEZİR CALLING

1179
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,720
He’s practically saying "come beat me up!"

1180
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,560
The woman is married!

1181
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,440
I was looking for my
phone. Why do you have it?

1182
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,080
You left it here.

1183
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,960
Keep track of your things.

1184
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,880
What now…?

1185
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,120
If you’re heading over
to the company, take me too.

1186
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,000
I'll catch up on the work I’ve missed.

1187
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,840
I have something to handle first.

1188
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,320
I'll come and pick you up, then.

1189
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,040
Once I’m back, we’ll go together.

1190
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:43,520
If you'll be busy, don’t bother
coming back. I’ll go myself.

1191
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,720
I told you I’ll come get you.

1192
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:49,040
I’m your boss and your husband.

1193
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,640
Remember this.

1194
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,360
When will this torment end?

1195
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,520
How many days has it been?

1196
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,720
When will these 187 days be over?

1197
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,160
Dad!

1198
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:15,200
What’s the matter, Mercan?

1199
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:18,080
I wanted to ask you about Tahir…

1200
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,640
You said you didn’t remember Eylül,

1201
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,760
but Tahir was her brother, right?

1202
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,800
Tahir?

1203
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,056
-Come here! -Let go of my sister!

1204
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,136
We’re going to the doctor. Let go!

1205
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,680
-Let go of my sister! -Move away, you!

1206
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:35,480
-Brother! -Let go!

1207
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,000
-Let go of my sister! -Let go!

1208
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:50,160
-Brotheeeeer!!! -Ugh…

1209
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,440
-Let go of him. -Ugh…

1210
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,840
Come on!

1211
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,880
No! No!

1212
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,240
Give me my Eylül!

1213
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,160
Give back my sister!

1214
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:07,320
Um, yes… I remember now,
since you mentioned Tahir.

1215
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,520
Why are you asking?

1216
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,560
I was looking at old photos.

1217
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,960
I wondered where they are
now, what they’re doing.

1218
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,360
Do you know?

1219
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,600
You asked me long ago,
and I told you before.

1220
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,680
They went to their grandparents.

1221
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,520
Okay, but where are their grandparents?

1222
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,200
Don’t we have a number?
I want to reach them.

1223
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,240
What would you do, contacting them now?

1224
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:31,120
There’s no trace of them here anymore.

1225
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,200
But I have their traces in me, father!

1226
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,680
I want to find them.

1227
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,360
Well, Eylül is...

1228
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,200
Eylül is dead, dear.

1229
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,120
She was sick.

1230
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:47,800
As for Tahir, I don’t know
where he is, what he's doing.

1231
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,840
I hid it from you so you wouldn’t grieve.

1232
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,440
Eylül…

1233
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:06,720
Is Eylül dead?

1234
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,320
Eylül...

1235
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:26,560
Yeah,

1236
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,240
Okay, Master Selim.

1237
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,680
Thank you. I appreciate.

1238
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:34,880
Take care.

1239
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,400
-So? -What's he saying?

1240
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,080
Master Selim gave us another discount,

1241
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:45,800
but since the car is expensive,

1242
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:47,960
the repair is costly too…

1243
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,600
None of us has that kind of money.

1244
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,200
And with the loan debt,

1245
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:56,840
there’s only one option left.

1246
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,040
Should I go to a loan shark?

1247
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,600
Ha! Don’t even think about it!

1248
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,720
No loan shark! Don't you dare, son.

1249
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:12,040
Remember Murat went to those loan
sharks and you saw how it ended.

1250
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,920
Don’t you dare, Berat! Ever!

1251
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,440
I swear I won't lay my blessings on you.

1252
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:19,080
I’ll kill you myself. God forbid!

1253
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:21,880
I’ve got no strength left
to be tested with my child.

1254
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,200
I said don’t, and I mean it!

1255
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:27,080
-Act accordingly! -Okay, mom. Okay.

1256
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,680
Swear to me you won’t go to a loan shark.

1257
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,400
Mom, I said okay…

1258
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,360
no need for oaths, mom.

1259
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:43,400
Alright, I’ve fallen into a pit,

1260
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:46,000
but I won’t fall any deeper, don’t worry.

1261
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:51,640
Please, son. Stay away. Will you?

1262
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:00,360
We need to solve this before
one of the Karahans finds out.

1263
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,840
Çiçek's right.

1264
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,040
As they say:

1265
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,600
Meaning?

1266
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:15,760
Those who keep their plans
private reach their goals faster.

1267
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,760
Your brother is trying to
keep all his promises, Eylül.

1268
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,000
I told you

1269
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:52,040
I’d always come to you,
that you’d never be alone.

1270
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,800
See, I’m here.

1271
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,680
Even if I burn, even if I suffer… I’m here.

1272
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:05,640
I’m keeping my greatest promise too.

1273
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:08,600
I’m taking revenge on them.

1274
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,360
I’m making them suffer a thousand times

1275
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:13,920
what they made us suffer.

1276
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:17,080
After the final blow, I’ll come

1277
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:26,640
and say, "I did it, sister."

1278
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,680
Now rest easy.

1279
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:33,400
I’ll tell you they’ve paid for
what they did to that little girl.

1280
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:39,200
I’ll make those who stole
our happiness taste misery.

1281
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:41,600
I’ll take away their loved ones,

1282
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,960
so they understand what it means.

1283
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,000
Look…

1284
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:04,520
no one forgets your smile.

1285
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,640
You had such a beautiful smile.

1286
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:16,440
When you smiled, hearts smiled too.

1287
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:27,720
But I don’t forget your tears either.

1288
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:34,600
I'm torn apart inside but I’ll
never forget your tears, Eylül.

1289
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:09,640
Eylül.

1290
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,800
EYLÜL ASLAN, BORN: JUNE 22,
2000 DEATH: OCTOBER 15, 2005

1291
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,160
Eylül, my dear.

1292
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:24,720
Passing away so young...

1293
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:26,800
It's so unfair to you.

1294
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:29,960
I didn't know.

1295
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,440
My dad kept it from me.

1296
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,000
But you were always in my heart.

1297
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:41,080
I never forgot about you.

1298
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:43,720
I never forgot.

1299
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,000
I never forgot.

1300
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,240
Are you really sad?

1301
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:14,440
Sometimes I doubt that you
are actually Haydar's daughter.

1302
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:17,840
My dear Eylül.

1303
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:35,040
I don't see why Ateş would do that.

1304
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,240
I don't know either, but he has an agenda.

1305
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:43,800
I wish Şahin could have
talked before he died.

1306
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:46,400
It would've been easier for us.

1307
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,200
We'd have made him kill Ateş.

1308
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:51,000
And we'd save our asses.

1309
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:53,960
It'll be me who'll bring upon his end.

1310
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:56,800
Not long now. I'm holding on.

1311
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:58,400
The time will come.

1312
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:01,040
We need to find out
what he has on his mind.

1313
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:05,720
It wasn't normal for Şahin to
join us out of nowhere anyway.

1314
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:11,200
What about Ateş having the
entirety of the shipping list?

1315
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:16,320
Emotional nonsense weakens people.

1316
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,240
It makes you lower your guard.

1317
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,560
I fell into that trap myself.

1318
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:24,960
You're getting old, Haydar.

1319
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:28,320
First, Ateş.

1320
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:30,280
Then, Şahin.

1321
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,200
I'd never have thought
they would be connected.

1322
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:38,960
Who would have?

1323
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,400
Who would've thought? We're still not sure.

1324
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:44,040
But I'm telling you, mark my words.

1325
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:46,920
Once the contract ends
and I get back what is mine,

1326
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,880
I'll make them see the
true face of Haydar Yıldırım.

1327
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:51,720
Just wait.

1328
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:54,160
I may not be patient enough until that day.

1329
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:55,680
Nezir.

1330
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,560
Stop.

1331
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,600
Death would be a blessing to him.

1332
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:03,360
Every person has
weaknesses, some weak spots.

1333
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,920
Ateş must have a weakness, too.

1334
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:09,360
Or some dark stuff he did in the past.

1335
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,920
First, we have to look into that.

1336
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,480
No need to look into anything.

1337
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,720
We have to stop him before
he gets even stronger.

1338
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,080
Or he'll rule over us.

1339
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:19,280
I'm telling you to be patient.

1340
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,600
There is someone who I
think works with Ateş.

1341
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:23,000
I'm trying to be certain.

1342
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:27,360
If I'm right about my
suspicions, we'll have leverage.

1343
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:31,080
Theer is a time ffor
everything. Don't forget that.

1344
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:33,400
What's his game?

1345
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:37,600
He has a million ways
to call off the contract.

1346
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,400
It couldn't be taking
hold of the company, either.

1347
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:41,640
He has a lot of money.

1348
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,160
He doesn't need your company.

1349
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,920
And I don't have the
patience to wait for him.

1350
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:54,240
I'll leave now.

1351
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,920
I have fun chore today,
which is annoying Ateş.

1352
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:22,640
What are you doing here?

1353
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:27,800
What are you doing here?

1354
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:33,880
They told me you went to the cemetery.

1355
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,840
It's quiet and dangerous here.

1356
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:42,880
That's why I'm here.

1357
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:45,960
Thank you.

1358
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:56,120
Eylül.

1359
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,960
I just found out she died.

1360
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:17,400
It's so sad.

1361
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:30,160
Weird, isn't it?

1362
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:33,880
Someone I don't even know well...

1363
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,880
affecting me so profoundly.

1364
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:45,400
I feel like my childhood has died.

1365
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:55,640
Every memory is so blurry.

1366
02:01:58,120 --> 02:01:59,120
Sometimes...

1367
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:02,040
I don't know if all
that we lived were real...

1368
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:05,600
or if I created it in my childish mind.

1369
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,520
But if there's one thing I know...

1370
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:17,560
it's that they always make me feel good.

1371
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:36,720
I wanted to name the hospital after her...

1372
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,440
to immortalize her memory.

1373
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,200
It's like I felt it.

1374
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,160
Death doesn't suit children.

1375
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:57,800
Not at all.

1376
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,480
I'm so sad.

1377
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:05,360
BORN: JUNE 22, 2000 DEATH: OCTOBER 15, 2005

1378
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,440
I'm so sad.

1379
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:26,040
Thanks.

1380
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:37,200
Let's go.

1381
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:49,920
I'll come again.

1382
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:53,360
My childhood.

1383
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:55,280
I'll come again.

1384
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,440
I wonder what happened to her brother.

1385
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:56,440
Tahir.

1386
02:04:58,760 --> 02:04:59,920
Eylül's older brother.

1387
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:06,720
I remember he was very fond of his sister.

1388
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:12,000
I think he always protected me, too.

1389
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:18,400
But as I said, these memories are blurry.

1390
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,400
I don't remember Tahir as
well as I do Eylül, but...

1391
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,320
the way he protected us...

1392
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:29,200
was not like a kid, but like an adult.

1393
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:31,440
I don't understand.

1394
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:33,360
How can you remember all this?

1395
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,760
He didn't let his sister out of his sight.

1396
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:43,720
And that reassured me back then.

1397
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:55,720
If you're done recounting
your childhood memories...

1398
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,640
I have a lot to do.

1399
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
You shouldn't have come.

1400
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:02,200
I didn't ask you to.

1401
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:04,760
Mister...

1402
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:06,720
Mister Stone-heart.

1403
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:08,640
What?

1404
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:10,360
Mister Stone-heart?

1405
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:12,760
Yes. You're stone-hearted.

1406
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,200
Hello?

1407
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:22,320
Bro.

1408
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:24,560
Nezir's bought the plot of the hospital.

1409
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:26,080
Just as you guessed.

1410
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:27,880
It's nothing we can't handle.

1411
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:29,960
Are we prepared?

1412
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:31,440
Of course, bro.

1413
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:33,760
People like him rarely get their way.

1414
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,560
And if it does go his way,
we know how to prevent it.

1415
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:38,280
Are you at the company?

1416
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,680
No, I'm in the mansion.
I'll leave in a minute.

1417
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:43,320
-OK, I'll be there. -Alright bro.

1418
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:46,880
Has something bad happened? Who was that?

1419
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,560
If it was something you need to know...

1420
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:52,120
I'd tell you.

1421
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:55,080
You keep changing from
one moment to the next.

1422
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,720
I can't keep up with your mood anymore.

1423
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:01,600
Yeah, right.

1424
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:41,480
I've been thinking about Ateş.

1425
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:44,720
He doesn't spend time
with us like he used to.

1426
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:48,000
Do you where he is now, Mom?

1427
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:50,960
At the cemetery.

1428
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:54,520
He didn't even ask us if
we'd like to come along.

1429
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:56,000
So what, Aslı?

1430
02:07:56,680 --> 02:07:58,320
Maybe, he wanted to go there alone.

1431
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:00,680
He usually goes there alone anyway.

1432
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:05,480
We haven't visited your
dad's grave in a while.

1433
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:06,880
We should go sometime.

1434
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,880
It'd be nice if we did
a good deed in his name.

1435
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,360
Stop acting like you don't understand.

1436
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:16,120
Ateş spends way too much
time with Haydar's daughter.

1437
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,640
He strays further away from us.

1438
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:20,160
I can feel it.

1439
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:22,520
What if he changes his
mind about the revenge?

1440
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:24,840
Listen, my daughter.

1441
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:29,000
Ateş has suffered just as
much as us, maybe even more.

1442
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:31,680
You had me to look over you.

1443
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,200
But he...

1444
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:35,080
Without a mother or father.

1445
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:36,600
He almost died many times.

1446
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:41,080
Of course he'll hold the man who's
done all those cruelties accountable.

1447
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:47,600
Mercan kept talking about
Eylül for a few days now.

1448
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:50,080
Stop talking about this.

1449
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,480
She doesn't know anything.

1450
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:54,840
Whatever she does won't work.

1451
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:57,840
Ateş won't give up on his plan.

1452
02:08:58,120 --> 02:09:00,640
At this point, he couldn't
even if he wanted to.

1453
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:03,320
Or Haydar will destroy us.

1454
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:06,800
Do you think Ateş will set himself
and us aside for the killer's daughter?

1455
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,720
I see what that devil really is.

1456
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,520
She's just like her father.

1457
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:15,120
They'd do anything for their benefit.

1458
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:17,280
She'll trick Ateş, too.

1459
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,960
Right. She's like her father.

1460
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:22,040
But I told you before.

1461
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:23,520
I won't let her get her way.

1462
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:24,960
I won't.

1463
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,240
You don't do anything.

1464
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:29,960
She's got Ateş wrapped around her finger.

1465
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,120
But I know how to break that finger.

1466
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,960
I'll reveal that girl's true face.

1467
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:39,800
A faithful friend who names the hospital

1468
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:42,640
after her poor childhood friend!

1469
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:45,080
I'll expose her!

1470
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,440
Enough!

1471
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:48,560
Get a hold of yourself.

1472
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:50,840
I hate that girl, too!

1473
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:52,400
I almost killed her.

1474
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:54,000
I'll do it again if I have to.

1475
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:56,160
But calm down.

1476
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,040
We'll wait.

1477
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:01,040
I can't listen to your lectures!

1478
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:02,680
I don't have time!

1479
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:04,760
I am losing everything I have.

1480
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:06,880
I won't just stand and watch anymore.

1481
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:10,320
I'm going to the company.

1482
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:19,600
Thank God she didn't hear us.

1483
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:21,760
Or she'd tell everyone in the mansion.

1484
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:31,320
Here, brother.

1485
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:33,160
Thank you, bro. Appreciate it.

1486
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,720
Ms. Müzeyyen asks for a painkiller.

1487
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:42,680
There must be someone in that cupboard.

1488
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:45,280
Malik, can you get them?

1489
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:46,920
My back hurts, I can't reach.

1490
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:07,320
Thank you.

1491
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,400
This girl irks me so much.

1492
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:24,640
Even if she heard it, she'd
say she didn't. Such a devil!

1493
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,800
She is!

1494
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:30,280
Come on! She is trying to curry
her boss's favor and keep her job.

1495
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:37,120
Oh, I forgot to get water.
None of you reminded me! Oh, here!

1496
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:39,600
You must be thinking
about other things then.

1497
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:54,760
She left for real this time.

1498
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:56,880
Dirty gossipmonger!

1499
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:59,400
But I know what she's like.

1500
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:02,640
She wouldn't look around like
that if she knew something.

1501
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:05,600
You know those conniving women on TV?

1502
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:07,120
She'd stare at us just like them.

1503
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:09,080
She's always up to something.

1504
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:20,160
Berat.

1505
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:23,440
Son, take these.

1506
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:27,200
Sell these and bring back the car.

1507
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:31,520
I keep losing sleep anyway.

1508
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,800
What good are these on my arm?

1509
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:49,320
I made everything worse
when I tried to fix them.

1510
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:53,080
I'm sorry, Mom.

1511
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:58,000
Come on now, son. No need for such stuff.

1512
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:00,200
Go, sell these and bring the car.

1513
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:03,240
We shouldn't let anyone say bad things

1514
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:05,440
about neither us nor the
family that fed us for years.

1515
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:09,520
Oh!

1516
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,160
What's two bracelets?

1517
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:15,120
What matters is that we're together.

1518
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:21,280
Come here, Malik brother.

1519
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:24,360
[speaks Arabic]

1520
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:26,880
-What did he say now? -Meaning?

1521
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:28,800
Being a family is such a nice thing.

1522
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:30,440
Come here!

1523
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:08,760
Hello.

1524
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:09,960
Hi, Cemal.

1525
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,320
- Did you talk to the realtors?
- Yes, I'll tell you later.

1526
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,360
Nezir is waiting for
you in the meeting room.

1527
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:21,600
What is going on?

1528
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:24,160
You're asking that?

1529
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:29,280
Don't act like you don't know.

1530
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:33,000
I'm sure as hell you
know what your ex is up to.

1531
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:36,000
How dare you say that?

1532
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:37,520
What ex?

1533
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:44,240
Nezir has bought the plot where
the hospital was going to be built.

1534
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,640
These two wouldn't act without
telling each other, Ateş.

1535
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:52,840
Did you know?

1536
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:55,480
No, this is the first time I'm hearing it.

1537
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:01,680
And I'm tired of you blaming me with stuff.

1538
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:21,080
You can fool everyone...

1539
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:24,160
with your innocent, ladylike acts.

1540
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:26,240
But you can't fool me.

1541
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:32,240
I can read from your
eyes what a fraud you are.

1542
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:35,160
What you're reading is your own heart.

1543
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:11,280
I've come to celebrate
us being partners again.

1544
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:20,440
Why did you buy the plot?

1545
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,720
Because I worked hard for the project, too.

1546
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,960
Plus, it's a good investment.
I didn't want to miss it.

1547
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:38,600
And I don't want to leave you alone.

1548
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:41,680
After all...

1549
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:45,560
people around you fetter
you rather than support you.

1550
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:47,920
Oh dear!

1551
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,360
You two are so fond of each other.

1552
02:16:55,960 --> 02:16:56,960
Pity!

1553
02:17:01,400 --> 02:17:03,680
Because we decided to build
the hospital somewhere else.

1554
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:15,640
What does it mean?

1555
02:17:17,320 --> 02:17:20,800
If only you told us about
your noble plans before.

1556
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:26,520
At least, you wouldn't
have been ripped off. Right?

1557
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,960
Because the plot owner knew
we weren't going to buy it.

1558
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:44,320
Didn't he tell you?

1559
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:48,200
Of course, he wouldn't.

1560
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:53,280
They create rivalries and
get a ton of money out of it.

1561
02:17:58,640 --> 02:17:59,640
No problem.

1562
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:03,520
It's still an investment.

1563
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:05,920
If Mercan doesn't mind,
I don't mind it, either.

1564
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:29,880
You think you are smart, aren't you?

1565
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:34,000
You'll soon find that
you shouldn't mess with me.

1566
02:18:48,360 --> 02:18:51,240
I found a few plots for the construction
and sent you a mail about them.

1567
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:52,920
I'll go and check the locations now.

1568
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:54,920
Thanks, Cemal.

1569
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:56,720
Let's go and check them out.

1570
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:59,680
Ateş, I'm coming, too. Let me get my bag.

1571
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:01,920
Aslı, you stay here.

1572
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:11,520
Someone should stay here.

1573
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:13,960
-Cemal is h... -Stay, Aslı.

1574
02:21:04,360 --> 02:21:05,360
Don't do that.

1575
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:08,760
Do what?

1576
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:11,200
Stop playing with whatever that is.

1577
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:16,400
Roll up the window.

1578
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:20,240
What's going on?

1579
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:21,840
Why are you so intolerant?

1580
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:23,920
I am a person, not a robot.

1581
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:25,960
You can't restrict everything I do.

1582
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:37,920
I'll sleep a little.

1583
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:41,880
Such a Gestapo!

1584
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:43,840
I heard that!

1585
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:46,120
Good.

1586
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:57,960
You've already fallen for her.

1587
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,480
That's the reason for your
hatred and fury for that guy.

1588
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,160
You obviously resent Nezir for Mercan.

1589
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:16,680
What happened?

1590
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:18,560
Nothing.

1591
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:20,760
Keep sleeping.

1592
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:23,760
No one should ride with you.

1593
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:25,320
Drive more carefully.

1594
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:49,160
Movie night?

1595
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:51,160
Okay.

1596
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:53,200
I have a thing at 8:00 PM.

1597
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:55,160
All right.

1598
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:58,480
I don't want him to come. He eats
everything before the movie starts.

1599
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:00,120
I'll call you when I leave the office.

1600
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:01,800
Bye. See you.

1601
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:08,200
Do you want to die?

1602
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:10,480
You prick! Huh?

1603
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:13,200
They found another plot for the hospital.

1604
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:14,840
Why didn't you tell me?

1605
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:17,920
Mr. Nezir. Please let me go.

1606
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:24,200
I can't breathe, Mr. Nezir!

1607
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:27,600
I'm not an oracle, Mr. Nezir.

1608
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:29,160
How would I know?

1609
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:34,680
Where is this plot?

1610
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:35,960
Tell me!

1611
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,280
I swear, I don't know.

1612
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:40,720
How should I know about
Mr. Ateş's daily schedule?

1613
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:42,800
I don't know what he buys or sells!

1614
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:47,560
His workers would know!

1615
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:49,040
They would!

1616
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:56,440
What?

1617
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:01,880
OK.

1618
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:09,320
I'm busy now.

1619
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:11,600
I'll call you later.

1620
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:17,200
Hi.

1621
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,280
We didn't have a chance to talk.

1622
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:25,120
We could be good friends, you know.

1623
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:28,880
Me, friends with you?

1624
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:32,240
What gave you that impression?

1625
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:36,280
Our wishes and goals align.

1626
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:39,600
What is my wish?

1627
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:43,080
Ateş.

1628
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:49,320
You want Ateş just as
much as I want Mercan.

1629
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:55,760
I saw how you looked at them
while they danced at the cocktail.

1630
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:59,640
I knew then that you
felt the same as I did.

1631
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:10,920
Aslı, what's wrong?

1632
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:13,240
Is he bothering you?

1633
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:15,400
No.

1634
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,160
How could he bother me?

1635
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:23,640
You're clearly upset.

1636
02:27:23,960 --> 02:27:25,240
I'll go and talk to that prick.

1637
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:26,400
Stop.

1638
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:32,080
He keeps talking nonsense. Don't mind him.

1639
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:35,800
Let's go and do our job.

1640
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:40,000
Help me look for that file.

1641
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:05,040
We wouldn't be lost if
you had followed the GPS.

1642
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:06,320
We're not lost.

1643
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Look at you.

1644
02:28:10,280 --> 02:28:12,000
You don't even admit that we're lost.

1645
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:36,680
Your know-it-all attitude is boring.

1646
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:38,696
Besides, we're lost, and it's your fault.

1647
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:39,840
For God's sake, shut up.

1648
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:41,440
I'm fed up with your nagging.

1649
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:46,600
Blah blah blah. I just
got off for some fresh air.

1650
02:28:47,560 --> 02:28:48,760
Oh, I'm nagging?

1651
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:50,560
You're so rude.

1652
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:51,920
Am I wrong?

1653
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:55,240
You've been talking since you
got in the car, saying we're lost.

1654
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:56,760
You tire me out!

1655
02:28:57,800 --> 02:28:59,520
Besides, if we're lost, it's your fault.

1656
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:01,560
What is your problem with me?

1657
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:04,560
All day, you kept snapping
at me for no reason.

1658
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:09,640
OK, I'm used to you
being so rude and angry.

1659
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:13,920
But for the last few days,
you hardly let me breathe!

1660
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,600
You're not someone I
could have problems with.

1661
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:17,720
Ms. Nagging.

1662
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:21,360
You just overwhelmed with all your talk.

1663
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:23,320
Now get in the car.

1664
02:29:23,720 --> 02:29:25,280
We'll check one last plot.

1665
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,160
Then, we'll go home.

1666
02:29:28,320 --> 02:29:29,480
I want this torture to end.

1667
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:35,560
Yes, Boss.

1668
02:29:35,760 --> 02:29:36,760
Where are you?

1669
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,440
I'm following them as you ordered.

1670
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:40,280
They've been driving around for hours.

1671
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:41,760
I think they're checking plots.

1672
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,160
Alright.

1673
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:44,640
Keep following them.

1674
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:47,520
And you know what to do
when you have the chance.

1675
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:49,040
Don't worry, Boss.

1676
02:29:51,960 --> 02:29:52,960
Get in the car.

1677
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:55,880
Here come the orders again.

1678
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:01,040
Don't you ever say 'please'?

1679
02:30:03,480 --> 02:30:06,120
Always with the 'sit down',
'get up', 'walk', 'stop',

1680
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:07,920
'shut up', 'don't walk'!
