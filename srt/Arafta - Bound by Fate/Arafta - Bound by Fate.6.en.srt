1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,440
Mrs. Müzeyyen!

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,800
Mercan!

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,840
Mrs. Müzeyyen, open the door.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,920
I'm telling you, I didn't do anything!

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,000
Mrs. Müzeyyen!

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,120
Mercan open up!

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,120
Open the door! Open up!

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,240
Mercan!

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,400
Mercan!

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,160
Open it.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,600
Open the door!

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,440
I'm telling you to open!

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,720
Open the door.

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,680
What's going on here?

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,080
Mrs. Müzeyyen dragged Mercan by the
hair and locked her in the kitchen.

16
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,440
Open the door.

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,120
I'm telling you to open!

18
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,160
Stop! Don't do it!

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,560
The reason why Aslı was poisoned
will be revealed before evening.

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,120
Pray that those results don't point to you.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
If you had a hand in
my daughter's poisoning,

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,640
I'll tear this mansion down over your head.

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
That's enough.

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,040
If rocks fall on your head,
you'll know it's from us.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,360
If you did this

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,760
I swear you'll pay the price.

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,000
I won't leave any of you behind.

28
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,600
Let's wait for the results to come out.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,880
You'll see.

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,760
I'll make you regret.

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,120
If something happened
to you, what would I do?

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
You're my Aslı.

33
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Cemal's Aslı.

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,800
Cemal can never have it.

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,680
I have no choice but to
bury it deep in my heart.

36
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Aslı.

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Life without you

38
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
it can't be.

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Did she sleep?

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
My dear.

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,560
The medicine makes her sleep.

42
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,080
She is better but she has to rest.

43
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,080
Let the test results come out.

44
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,600
Let me see something about Yıldırım there.

45
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Mother, stop.

46
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,800
As long as Aslı okay,
we'll do what's necessary.

47
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
What is this?

48
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
What is this?

49
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
I got bored too.

50
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,800
Every day brings a new incident.
The house is in shambles.

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
We hear our daily scolding thanks to Mercan

52
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
As always.

53
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,200
What does it have to do with Mercan?

54
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,840
Everything is related to her.

55
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,520
Everything we have experienced.

56
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
Nermin.

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,960
Be patient.

58
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,000
Stop accusing Mercan.

59
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,320
Whatever misfortune befell us,

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,640
it was because of that bloodthirsty face.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Because of him.

62
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
What's that mean?

63
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,200
You haven't had enough
of our son in the grave,

64
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,120
you're still insulting him.

65
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,440
The blood is your blood, know that.

66
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,080
I wish it had happened.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,120
What was I going to do?

68
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,920
My mind is a mess!

69
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Where is Zehra?

70
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
I didn't see.

71
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,600
Let's meet in the workroom
in an hour for work.

72
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
Okay.

73
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
How is Aslı?

74
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,800
Were you able to find
out why he was poisoned?

75
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
She is sleeping.

76
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,760
The results haven't come out yet.

77
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
I can do.

78
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,119
I don't need.

79
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Leave it.

80
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Leave it.

81
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,040
I can do it.
I said leave it.

82
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Leave it.

83
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
I said leave it.

84
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Look.

85
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
That is your help.

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,880
I said leave it.

87
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
It fell because of you.

88
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
The usual grumpy mood!

89
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,520
No.

90
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,840
This is your usual recklessness

91
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,640
Everything you touch turns into this.

92
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Leave it, I can handle.

93
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:44,760
No.

94
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,440
You'll cut your hand.

95
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,280
I won't.

96
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,280
You'll cut if you do like this.

97
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Look what you did.

98
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Did it cut?

99
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,240
Come.

100
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
We should clean.

101
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,520
It's nothing.
You're exaggerating.

102
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm not.

103
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,760
You're not listening.

104
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,840
Be in the workroom in one hour.

105
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
God.

106
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,160
How polite he can be when he wants to.

107
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
Let's look what can we find here.

108
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
These are all work documents. Nothing more.

109
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,440
Nothing.

110
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Nothing more.

111
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,440
Isn't there something here
that belongs to a person's past?

112
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Why are you here?

113
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Well.

114
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,640
You said about meeting, that's why I came.

115
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Yes, I said.

116
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Yes.

117
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,720
But I said after one hour.

118
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
You said so?

119
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
I said so.

120
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,120
Okay, I misunderstood.

121
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
I shall go.

122
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
I'll come after one hour.

123
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
If you let me.

124
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Why are you here?

125
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
The meeting wasn't here.

126
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,440
I don't know, I thought it was here.

127
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,960
Isn't this a workroom?

128
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
So you misunderstood that too.

129
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,320
Just like the hour.

130
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,320
Yes I misunderstood.

131
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,040
Why all these questions?

132
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,440
As if

133
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,280
I had done something wrong.

134
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
You've really dragged this out.

135
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
Okay, I misunderstood. I'll go.

136
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
I'll come after one hour.

137
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,840
You can't tell a lie, you know that, right?

138
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
Okay.

139
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Yes, I know.

140
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,840
Everyone says so.

141
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,520
I don't like to tell lie.

142
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,920
Sometimes you just have to do it.

143
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,560
I can't do that either.

144
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Why are you here then?

145
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,840
Well, I have a guess.

146
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,040
If you know, why are you asking?

147
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Look.

148
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,880
I have a lot of questions
about you in my head.

149
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,680
And you leave these unanswered.

150
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,480
If only you'd tell me,
you wouldn't tire me out.

151
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
How nice.

152
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,920
You've got work to do too.

153
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,400
I already have work.

154
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
These are drudgery.

155
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
You are stealing my time.

156
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
If I knew who you are, what you are

157
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
what you're made of

158
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,760
there would be no need for any of this.

159
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,880
As long as I want, you won't
find answers to your questions

160
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Why all the mystery?

161
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Why this curiosity?

162
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
I wonder why.

163
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,680
You suddenly came into our life.

164
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,240
Constant anger, constant hatred.

165
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,360
I told you before.

166
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,840
I'll be free of you before 187 days are up.

167
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
I struggle for this.

168
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
You won't.

169
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Know that.

170
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,080
But it will be enjoyable
to watch your efforts.

171
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
We'll see.

172
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
After one hour.

173
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Try to find.

174
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Maybe you can find.

175
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,880
What is the situation Haydar?

176
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,640
We need more time Şahin.

177
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,720
There is a minor problem but I'll handle.

178
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,720
The job is good.

179
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,200
I know that you have problem.

180
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

181
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Say yes.

182
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,760
You're right but.

183
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,680
If you don't want, say no.

184
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,200
There are many people out
there who would jump at the job.

185
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,960
It's fine by me.

186
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,640
We'll have so much money, don't miss it.

187
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,480
Okay Şahin. I'll call you.

188
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Mercan.

189
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,120
How am I going to convince you?

190
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I'm sorry.

191
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,000
I didn't realize you were inside.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come.

192
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
It's okay.

193
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Were you impressed?

194
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
God.

195
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
Why am I impressed?

196
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:54,880
Yes.

197
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,640
Haydar waits for something to start.

198
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,760
But he doesn't tell me what it is.

199
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,160
Force him a little more.

200
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,880
Hurry him up, there's not much time left.

201
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,080
Get him involved in some way.

202
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,680
We have to get him into this.

203
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,560
Okay, I can do.

204
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,680
These structures are part of our
environmentally conscious green projects.

205
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,560
Erhan.

206
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,400
Mr. Emrah also approved it.

207
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,600
The reports aren't quite finished
yet, but I'll get them done.

208
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,520
All the details and latest developments.

209
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,720
Are added to the file.

210
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,520
If you want, you can review the
file, then we'll take another look.

211
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,280
Did you find the answer that you look for?

212
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Not yet.

213
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
But I'll.

214
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,400
Don't you think that I'll give up.

215
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,120
When I set out on a
path, I walk it to the end.

216
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
I don't go back.

217
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Of course, go.

218
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
All the ways are yours.

219
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,400
Mom, enough, I'm full.

220
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Open your mouth.

221
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
God.

222
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
I won't eat.

223
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,520
Are the results out?

224
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Not yet.

225
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,040
As if there were a need.

226
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,160
It will be a declaration of the obvious.

227
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,520
I'm sure that one of them did this.

228
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
That sneaky girl

229
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,160
was telling Aslı that I'd kill you.

230
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,000
It's definitely her.

231
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Who else could be?

232
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,360
You can get as angry as you
want when the results come out.

233
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
How are you Aslı?

234
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Not bad.

235
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,960
But I'll feel better if I take a walk
in the garden and get some fresh air.

236
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Come.

237
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,120
Easy, girl, easy.

238
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,960
We can't even see properly because
of the commotion at the mansion.

239
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Yes.

240
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,480
I missed you so much.

241
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,920
But I have to go.

242
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,656
The table is being set. My mother
has already started complaining.

243
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Look.

244
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,200
Shall we go out tomorrow?

245
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,880
We can walk.
What do you say?

246
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,960
Okay.

247
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,720
Okay, agreed.

248
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,280
Someone is coming.

249
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Go, go, go.

250
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,440
Listen to your mother.

251
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Eat what she brings.

252
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Rest.

253
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Okay.

254
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,480
I'll eat and rest.

255
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,280
I'll get up two sizes bigger, right?

256
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,320
As soon as I got better, she
made me drink two bowls of soup.

257
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
Look, I'm full.

258
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,560
You stood me up last time, but

259
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,040
when I get better, we'll
have a movie night, right?

260
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,440
Just get well.

261
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,840
I can do a festival.

262
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,920
Then, the corns are on me.

263
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
With chocolate.

264
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,360
What is that Aslı?

265
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,920
The corn has to be roasted.

266
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Man.

267
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
If only we could eat it.

268
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Appetite monster.

269
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,400
What can we do?

270
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
I spoke with Ahmet.

271
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,480
He talked with Mercan.

272
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The plan is working.

273
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,040
She's giving up on this from now on.

274
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,120
It won't be that easy but, let's do.

275
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,280
Stop talking about this girl.

276
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,640
What kind of a man are you?

277
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
Are you a bully or a compassionate person?

278
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
It's unclear whether you're good or bad.

279
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,040
Whatever you are, you're the most,

280
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,480
the most unpredictable
one, that's for sure.

281
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Are you okay?

282
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
What happened?

283
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,160
I thought that I'm okay but its hurt.

284
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Get well soon.

285
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Are you okay?

286
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Come.

287
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,920
You go inside, I'll be there shortly.

288
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Aslı, come.

289
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,480
When it comes to the things you
value, everything changes, doesn't it?

290
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
You've done so much since my brother died.

291
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,680
You rubbed salt into our wounds.

292
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,641
You laughed and had fun as
if you were making fun of them

293
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,440
Do you understand how we feel now?

294
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Today, for first time

295
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,000
I saw a heart beating behind that iceberg.

296
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
I have a heart too.

297
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
A broken heart.

298
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,320
You have no choice but to carry on

299
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
with whatever remains of that heart.

300
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Good night.

301
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,320
What did he mean by saying broken heart?

302
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Yes, doctor.

303
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
I'm listening.

304
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,240
Çiçek, did you see my bag?
It has to be somewhere here.

305
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,440
No, I didn't see.

306
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,760
What is going on?
What happens?

307
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,720
What are you doing?

308
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,096
-What are you doing? -Leave him.

309
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,400
-Leave him. -What are you doing?

310
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,559
-I said leave! -What?

311
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Leave me!
Leave him!

312
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Someone poisoned Aslı with rat poison.

313
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,280
Who did this?
I don't know.

314
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,040
Leave my dad.

315
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
Leave him.

316
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,000
Take your hand off.

317
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Leave him.

318
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
What is going on there?

319
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,600
They're poisoned Aslı.

320
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,560
They gave rat poison.

321
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,640
What? Rat poison?

322
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,200
God bless her.

323
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,080
Mr. Ateş grabbed Mr. Haydar's throat.

324
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,160
They're arguing.

325
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,440
There's going to be hell
to pay at the mansion soon.

326
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,160
Don't let anyone see you.

327
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Rat poison.

328
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,360
It seems like this.

329
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,000
Which one of you did this?

330
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,800
Who poisoned my sister?

331
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,120
Leave him.

332
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,400
It will come out immediately.

333
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,240
You'll beg for mercy.

334
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,800
It's the time.

335
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,616
By the time I find the person who did this

336
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,080
it will be too late for you

337
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
Enough!
What is happening?

338
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,480
What is going on?
Get off me!

339
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,640
Someone poisoned her with rat poison.

340
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Didn't I say?

341
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,440
Didn't I say they're murderers?

342
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,560
They're all murderers.

343
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
You.

344
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Is that poison?

345
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
It's not mine.

346
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,640
Isn't that bag yours?

347
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:25,840
Yes.

348
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,240
The bag is mine but the bottle isn't.

349
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,240
If it isn't yours, then
why is this in the bag?

350
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,960
Did you try to kill my daughter?

351
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
How dare you?

352
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,840
I'll kill anyone who touches my kids.

353
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,376
-What happens? -What happens?
Mother Müzeyyen, enough.

354
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,040
I'll kill her, let me go Ateş.

355
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Mother Müzeyyen, enough.

356
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let me go. She pays what she did.

357
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,760
I'll kill her.

358
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,320
She tried to kill Aslı.
Why do you protect her Ateş?

359
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,040
Let me go.

360
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,400
I didn't do anything.

361
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,096
My daughter doesn't do something like this.

362
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
You set a trap.

363
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,560
Please, Mr. Haydar.

364
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
You're too much.

365
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
What is happening?

366
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,480
You are.

367
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,240
You caused the death of my child.

368
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,000
You're tormenting the other one too

369
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,240
You'll pay for this.

370
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,000
May harm come to my daughter's hair.

371
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,120
Just wait, then I'll show you
what torment and insult really mean.

372
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,080
Do you think that you bring justice?

373
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,216
Is this how you're going to
take revenge for your brother?

374
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,960
What revenge are you talking about?

375
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,200
Don't mess with me.

376
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,921
I realize that you think we are
responsible for your brother's death.

377
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,080
You've been saying this since the cemetery!

378
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
What?

379
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,600
Murat was murdered, and
did I poison Aslı in return?

380
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,880
That's exactly what I'm saying.

381
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,760
I didn't poison anyone! Let go!

382
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,320
Why was it in your bag then?

383
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I don't know, I swear I don't know.

384
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,600
You also threatened Aslı for
taking your brother's room.

385
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,080
I'm not going to poison every disrespectful,
thoughtless person I encounter.

386
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,080
If you didn't do it, then who did?

387
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,120
Are you protecting someone?

388
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,880
I'm not protecting anyone!

389
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,560
I can't hurt anyone.

390
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,896
Despite what you've done to me, I
couldn't even harm you or your family.

391
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,640
I'll find out who did this.

392
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,040
Someone set me up by putting that
thing in my bag, and I'm going to find!

393
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,640
Don't worry, I'll find it
without needing your help.

394
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,720
Someone from this house did it.

395
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
You.

396
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Or someone else.

397
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,480
When I find him, I'll make
him pay with my own hands.

398
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
I have an appointment.

399
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,600
Wait here until it's done.

400
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Don't wander around.

401
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,000
Especially don't let
mother Müzeyyen see you.

402
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,480
Who could have poisoned this girl?

403
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,320
Did they put it in her food or something?

404
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Oh god.

405
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,360
Then it'll be our problem.

406
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,480
Everything comes out of this kitchen!

407
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,480
Mom, why are you so scared?

408
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,400
What benefit will be
killing the woman do us?

409
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,880
If it had any benefit.

410
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
God forbid.

411
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It is it.

412
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,760
People don't commit
murder without a reason.

413
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
Çiçek is true.

414
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,440
Why should we do it?

415
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
What's in it for us?

416
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,200
That's why no one can blame us.

417
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Stop talking nonsense.

418
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,960
My heart is already in my mouth.

419
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,760
Keep your spirits up, mom.

420
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Be positive.

421
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,040
Everyone inside is at odds with each other.

422
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,960
It's not our turn.

423
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
Okay? Relax.

424
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,920
Lady Müzeyyen is calling
you all to the hall.

425
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
God bless us.

426
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,840
Do you have any insect or
rodent poison at home, Binnaz?

427
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,640
No, Lady Müzeyyen. We're
not letting her in the house.

428
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
Lady Mercan.

429
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,400
Doesn't allow us to use
toxic pesticides in the garden.

430
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,800
What is this? What's
with all these questions?

431
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,896
As if our pain weren't enough,
we also have to deal with this.

432
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,480
Enough with your pain.

433
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,400
Am I so stupid that I don't understand you
tried to kill my daughter to ease your pain?

434
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,600
Mrs. Müzeyyen, if I had been
hostile, you would have understood.

435
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,120
You won't get to that stage, be sure.

436
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
Now.

437
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,880
Somehow this bottle was
brought into the house.

438
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,440
That's why everyone will
answer my questions one by one.

439
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,280
Whatever I ask, you will answer.

440
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,760
If anyone in this mansion
tried to poison my daughter

441
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,800
and you know how

442
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,200
You choose the worst pain for yourself.

443
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,360
Get back to work.

444
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Look at that.

445
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,120
There's no peace left, nothing at all.

446
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Are you done?

447
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
For now.

448
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,600
What's happening?

449
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
What are you doing?

450
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,880
She was trying to choke me.

451
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,440
I didn't do such a thing.

452
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,240
Her head had slipped off the
pillow. I was going to fix it.

453
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
She's lying.

454
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,200
Did you come to finish what you started?

455
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Why are you here?

456
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
You know why?

457
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,360
To choke me.

458
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,000
Get her out of my room!

459
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,920
I came to talk.

460
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,400
I was going to ask you
something about the poisoning.

461
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,760
Saying finish what you started.

462
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
She did, didn't she?

463
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,560
Is what Aslı said true?

464
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
Of course not.

465
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,040
Am I a murderer? She misunderstood.

466
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,120
I told you not to show yourself around.

467
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,960
I told you not to leave your room.

468
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,680
Why did you go to her room?

469
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,880
I just wanted to talk.

470
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,520
Who knows, maybe he saw something?

471
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,520
She was sick.

472
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,160
Her head had fallen off the pillow.

473
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,160
So I couldn't let it
go. I wanted to fix it.

474
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,440
When she suddenly woke
up, caused a problem.

475
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,240
I'm saying I didn't do it.

476
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,000
Until I find the one who did this

477
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,920
because you're the main suspect,

478
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,320
you will stay away from Aslı.

479
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,600
You won't be alone with her.

480
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,280
You won't go to her room.

481
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Or else.

482
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,560
If a rock fell on Aslı's head from the sky

483
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
I'd blame you.

484
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,960
Why are you all so prejudiced?

485
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,320
I'm saying she misunderstood.

486
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,560
Don't argue with me and drive me crazy.

487
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Do what I say.

488
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,080
Hello, Yaşar.

489
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,960
We have an urgent problem.

490
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,360
Mr. Emrah from America is
requesting a video conference.

491
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,000
He will have some requests for you.

492
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,640
I forwarded the email. The meeting
is at 10:30 PM. You have to come.

493
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,280
Okay Yaşar. I'm coming.

494
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
Okay Ms. Mercan.

495
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,040
Mr. Emrah requested a meeting.

496
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,240
Yes.

497
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,440
I can handle.

498
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,840
He has new requests.

499
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,040
The files are at the
office, so I'm leaving.

500
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,520
We're going together.

501
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,720
The project may belongs to you,

502
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,920
but the company belongs to me.

503
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,360
So the project is mine too.

504
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Walk.

505
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Mercan.

506
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,560
Can we talk for a moment?

507
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,680
I'm at car.

508
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Don't make too long.

509
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
What is this?

510
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,800
He acts like he's the boss to everyone

511
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
Oh my god.

512
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
What is it dad?

513
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,600
This isn't going to work out, my daughter.

514
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,920
Look at the state Haydar
Yıldırım has fallen into.

515
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,760
I couldn't even stand up to what
was done to you, just to avoid trouble.

516
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,240
How is this going to work?

517
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,840
I'm used to it.

518
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,320
Whatever you say, you're right.

519
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,440
That's what all my efforts are for.

520
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,880
To get you out of this situation.

521
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,440
You.

522
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,120
Have you thought about what I told you?

523
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,440
Shall we talk about this later?

524
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,960
I need to go to the company.

525
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,560
I have a meeting with Mr. Emrah.

526
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Okay dear, go.

527
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
I knew.

528
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,840
I said she did it.

529
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,440
The poison came out of her bag.

530
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,280
She says she didn't do it Aslı.

531
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,480
The girl is obsessed.

532
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,496
What would have happened
if I hadn't woken up?

533
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
She was going to kill me!

534
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,720
Actually, when you think about it.

535
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,600
Maybe.

536
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,640
Maybe.

537
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,000
Maybe what, Cemal?

538
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,800
Maybe I misunderstood?

539
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
Are you crazy?

540
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,560
Do you doubt what you
see with your own eyes?

541
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,640
Why are you here Cemal?

542
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,840
She tries to kill me.

543
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,720
You're leaving me here alone.

544
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,840
From now on, he can't
hurt a hair on your head.

545
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,640
You are dead on your feet.

546
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,160
If I hadn't woken up, the woman
would have smothered me with a pillow.

547
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,800
What are you saying?

548
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
When?

549
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:20,800
Just now.

550
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,280
Ask Cemal.

551
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,800
When he arrived, the
pillow was still in her hand.

552
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,320
Cemal.

553
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,000
I'll drag him here by his hair.

554
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,880
No one can take that girl away from me now.

555
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
Mother, don't.

556
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,520
She went with Ateş. They aren't at home.

557
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,760
Does Ateş know what she did?

558
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,280
Wouldn't he know it?

559
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,800
He took her out of the room.

560
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,880
What is this child still waiting for?

561
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,040
The girl says she didn't do it.

562
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,880
Fire is also trying to find the truth.

563
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,960
The poison came out from her bag. What
else needs to happen for him to believe it?

564
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,080
My dear.

565
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,320
I would sacrifice that girl
for a single tear from you.

566
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,400
Seems like I'll have to
handle my own business.

567
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,440
I can't get Aslı's
poisoning out of my mind.

568
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,280
I didn't do it, I swear.

569
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,200
The last time I saw you.

570
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,080
You were standing next to her
bed with a pillow in your hand.

571
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,720
How many times did I
say I was going to talk?

572
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,160
What did he eat? I wonder
she ate out or something.

573
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,880
She was at home all day.

574
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,240
No one came from outside either.

575
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,560
I'm taking care of it.

576
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,040
Mind your own business.

577
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,240
I'm sorry Mr. Ateş.

578
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,800
-God. -No problem.

579
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,160
How clumsy I am.

580
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
I clean.

581
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,440
Sorry Mr. Ateş.

582
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,200
Leave it. Make coffee again.

583
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
No need.

584
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
These things can happen.

585
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,320
Don't worry. Okay?

586
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
Thank you my lady.

587
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,120
Thank you.

588
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,920
Do you want anything else Mr. Ateş?

589
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,040
No, thank you.

590
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,080
I brought all the
necessary files, Ms. Mercan.

591
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,080
I emailed the all of them too.

592
00:46:59,560 --> 00:46:59,720
Okay.

593
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,560
Thank you Yaşar.

594
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,880
It's too late, you should go now.

595
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,560
You can leave too.

596
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,040
Okay. Good luck.

597
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,320
Good evening.

598
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,400
I will work in my room.

599
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,880
Sit down.

600
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,760
You will work here.

601
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,600
When will you learn to obey?

602
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,160
I tell you work here.

603
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,800
Why are you always angry?

604
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,840
Why are you always so tense?

605
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,800
As if we've known each other for years
and I've done something terrible to you.

606
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,560
What do you expect me to do?

607
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,160
Do you want me to be
your slave at your door?

608
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,640
You understood exactly what I meant.

609
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,640
You seem to hate me and my family.

610
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,800
It's my natural right to question this!

611
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,200
We made a deal.

612
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,640
It's best not to assign too
much meaning to this agreement.

613
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,680
The company.
The mansion.

614
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,200
The marriage.

615
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,840
They are only worth their
commercial value to me.

616
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,360
That's it.

617
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,200
But you're not sitting still as a family.

618
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,720
The company.
The mansion.

619
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,240
The marriage.

620
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,880
They are only worth their
commercial value to me.

621
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,440
You're very tense, so I
made you some herbal tea.

622
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,560
Did Ateş come?

623
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,960
No.

624
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,440
This damn girl.

625
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,640
She didn't either my lady.

626
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,840
How many hours have they been gone?

627
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,080
What are they doing at the company?

628
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,720
Come with me.

629
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,200
You robbed the vending machine.

630
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,160
What can I do?

631
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,840
I can't stop eating while I'm working.

632
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,680
But I have a complaint.

633
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,680
Machine took my fifty liras.

634
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,880
Tell the plaza management.

635
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,440
Why?

636
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,280
Aren't you a manager at this company?

637
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,880
You were cool when you bought
the company and signed the contract.

638
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
I was cool, right?

639
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,880
Did you focus on me that
day when you lost the company?

640
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,200
Why on earth?

641
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,280
Where did you come up with that?

642
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,000
Why should I focus on you?

643
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,960
What arrogance is this?

644
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,280
No, you said it yourself.

645
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,520
You said that I signed cool.

646
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,640
Is that what I meant?

647
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:24,600
Well.

648
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,280
I meant to say you were unbearable.

649
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,120
You were put on the ritz.

650
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,280
An attitude of disliking everyone.

651
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,160
Like you're constantly staring at.

652
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,400
You gave so much details.

653
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,360
So you looked at me that much.

654
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,280
I didn't know you were
so focused, you know?

655
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,720
I don't focus on you.

656
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,280
What am I saying? What are you saying?

657
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,920
Are you a narcissist or something?

658
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,680
Of course I'm not.

659
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,400
I mean.

660
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,480
The way that you look at me that much maybe

661
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,200
you have taken the measure of me.

662
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,560
No.

663
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,280
You do this to make me angry.

664
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,040
There isn't any other explanation.

665
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,160
You are good at acting.

666
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:22,400
Anyway.

667
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,520
The meeting is almost here. I
won't be able to keep up with you.

668
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,520
While you're robbing the vending machine

669
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,040
I had already prepared the draft.

670
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,520
Look.

671
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,320
I tell myself not to get
angry and say something, but

672
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,920
you're definitely provoking me.

673
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,200
Shall we get back to the work?

674
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,720
I had already prepared the draft.

675
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,120
You've only made minor changes.

676
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,120
I realized that you don't
work, I finished the draft.

677
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,840
Does working with you always like this?

678
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,040
Is our time going to be spent
between your words and your narcissism?

679
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,560
How would you like it to go?

680
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840
Of course by working.

681
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,880
That's what I want.

682
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,880
When you openly expressed your

683
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,920
admiration for me, that's
when the topic came up.

684
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,960
Look at that draft.

685
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:46,760
Okay.

686
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,280
You're the best.

687
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,600
You're amazing, okay?

688
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,480
Let's look.

689
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,200
No way.

690
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
That’s my draft.

691
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,120
You've stolen my work.

692
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,720
If you don't know how to finalize

693
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,920
people come and stole.

694
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,280
I'm teaching you a life
lesson, what more do you want?

695
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,440
I'd rather not take that life
lesson, if possible. Please exempt me.

696
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,320
Life is hard enough for me.

697
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,560
Recent events speak for themselves.

698
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,360
Take, eat it.

699
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,120
Normally, I don't share but

700
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,280
While I'm eating, you eat too.

701
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,840
No need.

702
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,480
I don't eat late.

703
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
Alright.

704
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,360
What I say is

705
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,960
we should also suggest alternatives to
traditional architecture in the report.

706
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,160
We emphasize our own preferences.

707
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,440
The final decision will
be made by Mr. Emrah.

708
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,360
Okay.

709
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,840
Okay, but.

710
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,600
Does offering alternatives
make us appear indecisive?

711
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,400
I'm not sure about it.

712
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,200
What's the connection?

713
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,960
Maybe it's the opposite.

714
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,520
He will think we have mastered
all architectural structures.

715
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,800
If we're confident in ourselves,
I don't think there's a problem.

716
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,040
If you say so.

717
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,080
Okay.

718
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,280
At least we agreed on one thing tonight.

719
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,320
The night is long.

720
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,600
There is tomorrow.

721
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,000
There is the other day.

722
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,920
There are so many days ahead us.

723
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,640
I'm counting days one by one. Don't worry.

724
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Is that so?

725
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,640
Your math is good.

726
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,120
Such a shameless.

727
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,480
Did you say something?

728
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,640
No, I didn't say anything.

729
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,000
Let's focus on the work please.

730
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,760
I think so.

731
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,240
Look at what's happening to us.

732
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,840
Don't get so stressed out,
mom, your blood sugar will go up.

733
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,280
Do I have time to think about it?

734
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,800
We were clearly questioned.

735
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
Don't be sad, please.

736
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,920
Anyone can ask.

737
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,400
They know it has nothing to do with us.

738
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,560
They didn't even call the police.

739
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,040
That's true.

740
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,800
To be honest, it was hard for me too.

741
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,720
We lined up like criminals.

742
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,240
I had to hold myself
back from saying something.

743
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,960
Shut up, they are coming.

744
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Binnaz.

745
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,760
The meals will be prepared
under Zehra's supervision.

746
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,320
Without her, you couldn't
even boil a pot of water. Clear?

747
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,400
Clear my lady.

748
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,360
Just take care of the housework.

749
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,320
This can't happen.

750
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,640
It's clear that we can't
find peace in this mansion.

751
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,280
What happens to us happens to us.

752
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,000
We carry the can.

753
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,080
I can't breathe Cemal.

754
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,040
My heart is burning, I can't bear it.

755
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,280
How can I go on with this?

756
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,640
How can I resist?

757
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,480
Cry Aslı.

758
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,760
Pour your heart out.

759
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,200
They say

760
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,520
with tear, the heart is cleaned.

761
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,680
Maybe it's true.

762
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,200
Don't hold yourself, cry.

763
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,720
Thank you Cemal.

764
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,680
I'm glad you were there for me.

765
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,880
Every time Aslı.

766
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,440
But don’t worry.

767
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,200
I will get used to it.

768
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
Of course you will.

769
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,200
One can get used to everything.

770
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,480
These are nothing.

771
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,120
Cemal.

772
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,640
What are you doing here son?

773
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,520
Aslı is sleeping, I
don't want to disturb her.

774
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,960
I'm waiting just in case.

775
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,360
I lost my son when he was a baby.

776
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,160
But god gave me two brave sons.

777
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,920
I'm here.

778
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,160
You go to sleep. Good night.

779
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,440
Good night mother.

780
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm glad we found common ground.

781
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,616
The report will be delivered
to you as soon as possible.

782
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,640
Don't worry.

783
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,880
Thank you Ateş.

784
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,880
By the way, congratulations.

785
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,880
I didn't have chance to celebrate.

786
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,320
I wish you happiness.

787
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,720
You are a very beautiful couple.

788
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,840
Thank you.

789
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,080
Thank you for taking the time

790
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,480
at this hour.

791
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Hope to see you again.

792
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
See you.

793
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,240
Congratulations.

794
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,200
You played the role of a spouse very well.

795
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,800
What are you talking about?

796
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,640
You can be quite persuasive
when you want to be.

797
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,960
You have

798
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,560
unknown, hidden sides.

799
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,800
Like acting.

800
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,800
Yes Cemal.

801
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,080
Wait a bit.

802
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,680
I hope nothing bad happens Cemal.

803
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,440
No brother, everything is fine.

804
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,080
I called you just to notify you.

805
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,560
The workers have said true.

806
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,000
I searched the house thoroughly,
but there was no trace of poison.

807
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,840
Try to find where it comes.

808
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,840
We can handle brother, no problem.

809
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,080
Cemal.

810
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,880
What exactly did you see in Aslı's room?

811
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,880
Brother, when I entered the room

812
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,080
Mercan was holding a pillow.

813
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,760
Aslı was frightened, poor girl.

814
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,360
I don't judge anyone easily.

815
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,560
You know.

816
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,000
I don't like to fall into sin.

817
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,680
Maybe she really wanted to help but

818
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,920
this poison thing and what happened after.

819
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,720
Frankly, I don't know

820
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,080
what to believe either.

821
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,880
What if she is true?

822
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,960
Then someone in this
house poisoned Aslı and

823
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,760
as if that weren't enough,
pinned the blame on her.

824
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,560
Mother Müzeyyen.

825
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,000
Knew what happened last night.

826
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,520
She says he'll make Mercan pay
for these things before you do.

827
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,400
And there is one more thing.

828
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,320
I couldn't tell you
because of what happened.

829
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,800
She was a bit harsh with Mrs. Binnaz too.

830
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,240
Just so you know.

831
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,040
Understand.

832
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,376
We need to find out how the poison
got into the house as soon as possible.

833
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,120
Otherwise, this issue will not be resolved.

834
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,880
We can't focus on our own work

835
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,280
because we're dealing
with unexpected issues.

836
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,360
Good night. I'm going to sleep.

837
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,840
Good nigh mom.

838
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,640
Good night.

839
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,840
Mom.

840
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,440
Don't be upset. Okay?

841
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,920
Good night.

842
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,360
Don't be upset brother. Okay?

843
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,440
Everything will be fine.

844
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,840
Don't be sad either.

845
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,080
Come.

846
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,360
How innocent she looks.

847
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,040
Could you have done it?

848
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,080
You're confusing me.

849
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,040
How sleep makes even the most
ruthless person seem innocent.

850
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,480
As if all those harsh words

851
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,520
hateful glances

852
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,440
as if they belonged to
someone else, not to him.

853
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,040
Why did she cover me up?

854
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,800
She surprises me every time.

855
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,120
Good morning.

856
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,560
Good morning.

857
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,720
So?

858
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,600
Like a pair of lovebirds.

859
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,920
Did we come here to look at the sea?

860
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,600
Sorry.

861
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,360
I'm not a morning person.

862
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,040
Understood.

863
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,040
You got up on the wrong
side of the bed today.

864
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Okay.

865
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,640
Let's be serious and get to the work.

866
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,280
Come in.

867
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,120
Good morning Ms. Aslı.

868
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,440
Good morning.

869
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,480
I made your breakfast.

870
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,000
You can eat it with peace of mind.

871
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,840
Did Mercan and Ateş go downstairs?

872
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,680
They aren't at home.

873
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,040
Are they out at this time?

874
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,000
They didn't come last night.

875
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,680
Get out.

876
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,400
But, well.

877
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,920
Don't just stare like that.

878
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,440
Get out.

879
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,480
Mrs. Müzeyyen's words really hurt me.

880
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,240
I have been in charge
of this kitchen for years.

881
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,040
The best thing is to leave.

882
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,240
Let's look for work.

883
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,480
If it doesn't work out, we'll go back home.

884
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,640
Mother.

885
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,320
People from

886
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,200
my hometown come here for work.

887
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,800
What do we do there?

888
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,520
Yes.

889
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,720
Why are we messing up our routine?

890
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,800
Didn't you see what happened, my daughter?

891
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,480
This is officially telling us to go.

892
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,240
It is our duty to

893
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,800
do what is necessary.

894
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,040
At least

895
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,440
we can have peace.

896
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,120
Mother.

897
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,640
They are easy to say.

898
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,880
Do you think it's that easy to
mess the routine and rebuild it?

899
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,200
Son, I'm an old woman.

900
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,400
These words are getting heavy now.

901
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,040
We haven't find peace in this
mansion since they arrived.

902
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,800
Actually.

903
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,400
They pay our money.

904
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
That's true.

905
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,400
True but.

906
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,120
If only they weren't so hateful.

907
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,080
Mr. Ateş is good.

908
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,880
Mr. Cemal is good too.

909
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,560
Yes, I think so.

910
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,720
Only Mrs. Müzeyyen.

911
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,240
She is a little bit like a demon from hell

912
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,520
And her daughter also.

913
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:14,800
Well well.

914
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,400
Are you still having breakfast?

915
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,960
Clear the table and work a little.

916
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,360
Work needs to be done.

917
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,680
We should go.

918
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,440
I can beat her before we go.

919
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,360
Don't be ridiculous.

920
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,560
Eat your breakfast. Come on.

921
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,520
We are at home.

922
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,560
We couldn't talk.

923
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,480
Is there anything new about the poison?

924
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,680
No.

925
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,200
Don't you ever learn?

926
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,280
The more we tell you to stay
away, the more you dig in.

927
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,040
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't stay away.

928
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,800
I'm the one being accused, you know.

929
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,200
You should stop.

930
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:01,720
You'll do

931
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,960
what I say.

932
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,280
Welcome Mercan.

933
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,480
Thank you Binnaz sister.

934
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,496
Would you make me a cup of tea? I'll
change my clothes and be right back.

935
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,680
Of course. I'll prepare.

936
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,040
Mercan.

937
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,320
The things happened yesterday
was very heartbreaking.

938
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,920
We all know that you don't
do something like this.

939
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,600
I'll bring your tea now.

940
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Okay.

941
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,400
What are you doing?

942
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,240
Did you think I'd let what you did to Aslı?

943
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,200
I'll punish you for this.

944
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,240
Let me go.

945
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,160
Let me go. I didn't do anything.

946
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,240
Did you think you could have
Ateş in pocket and get away with it?

947
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,840
What is this? What are you doing?

948
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,760
I did the same thing that you did to Aslı.

949
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,320
What are you doing? Let me go.

950
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,040
I didn't do anything.

951
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,680
Mother Müzeyyen, what are
you doing? Are you crazy?

952
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:40,720
Leave her.

953
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,400
Let me kill her.

954
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,000
Even if I knew I'd go
to jail, I'd kill her.

955
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,040
Mother, calm down.

956
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,760
Such a stupid girl.

957
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,920
I don't let anybody to kill my cild.

958
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,520
Mother Müzeyyen, let's go.

959
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,640
Come on.

960
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:57,920
Are you okay?
Don't.

961
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,480
Leave me alone.

962
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:18,960
Don't.

963
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,560
Mercan.

964
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,680
Mercan, dear, what happened to you?

965
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,480
Are you out of mind mother?

966
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,680
If I hadn't come, you
would have killed her.

967
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,560
Not only did she poison her,
but she also tried to choke her.

968
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,320
If you don't take care of her, then I will!

969
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,040
Will we do it like this?

970
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,400
Did we discuss like this?

971
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,400
We didn't come here to shed blood.

972
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,000
They want to shed blood.

973
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,480
They started.

974
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,600
You mistaken by bringing Mümtaz here.

975
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,640
I see that you start to defense your wife.

976
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,200
You're being unfair.

977
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,040
Look at yourself.

978
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,360
You've gotten both
yourself and us into trouble.

979
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,360
Don't look at me like this.

980
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,200
It's all your fault.

981
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,160
You brought Ateş into our lives.

982
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:13,040
If you had listened to your
parents and married Nezir,

983
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,760
your brother would still be alive.

984
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,520
None of this would have happened.

985
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,560
Whatever goes around comes around.

986
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:25,560
Look.

987
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,360
How he made such a fuss

988
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,480
when it happened to his own daughter!

989
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,560
He should pray.

990
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,600
Let him pray that I only
added a little poison.

991
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,600
Otherwise the girl would have died there

992
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,480
Mother.

993
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,720
What are you saying?

994
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,720
Did you do?

995
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,080
I did.

996
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:50,720
I'm not regret.

997
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,560
What are you saying?

998
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,080
You did.

999
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,080
How many times I told you?

1000
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,760
Death is the way of escaping for them.

1001
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,840
They won't get away from me that easily.

1002
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,040
Let Cemal and I do what needs to be done.

1003
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,880
He is right mother Müzeyyen.

1004
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,280
We are at the beginning, let's not argue.

1005
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,040
We aren't like them. We don't kill anybody.

1006
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,720
There was no plan to marry
Haydar's daughter either.

1007
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,800
After that.

1008
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,480
After that, I do what I know.

1009
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,040
She did.

1010
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,680
She was at the kitchen.

1011
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,560
She poisoned me.

1012
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,640
I saw.

1013
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,600
Of course she did.

1014
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,720
Who else can be?

1015
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,520
What is going on?

1016
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:10,880
Why are you here?

1017
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,240
We learnt what your daughter did.

1018
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,880
We had already understood.

1019
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,080
Even those who couldn't
see or understand saw it.

1020
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,280
Are you sure?

1021
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,600
I'm sure.

1022
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,440
How can I lie something about this?

1023
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,080
Why didn't you tell?

1024
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,040
I wasn't looking for bad intentions.

1025
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,320
But after yesterday,
the puzzle is completed.

1026
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,400
I didn't do.

1027
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,879
You'll pay for doing this.

1028
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:04,880
Don't do this.

1029
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,640
You'll pay for this.

1030
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,200
But first, you have to do something.

1031
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,080
You have to kneel before Aslı.

1032
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,200
I'm not sorry for something I don't do.

1033
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,040
Kneel before Aslı.

1034
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,720
You will look into her eyes

1035
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,000
and apologize for what you have done to

1036
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,360
her for two days.

1037
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,640
She tried to kill my
daughter. Apology for what?

1038
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,920
Either you kneel and say sorry

1039
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,720
or I remove the 187 days
article from the agreement.

1040
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,200
You'll lose everything.

1041
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,520
You'll go to the jail.

1042
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,880
You can't be the man from yesterday.

1043
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,080
You left me all alone, again.

1044
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,920
I’m sorry.

1045
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,600
Not to me. Look at Aslı.

1046
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,760
Weakly I’m sorry.

1047
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:35,000
Louder! Everyone will hear it!

1048
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,800
You’ll regret this deeply.

1049
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,960
Come on!

1050
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,920
I’m sorry.

1051
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,360
I nearly believed she was innocent.

1052
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,640
This isn’t punishment, it’s a reward.

1053
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,560
The real punishment will come from me.

1054
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,680
Don’t!

1055
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,640
Don't. Don’t touch me!

1056
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,120
Go! I beg you.

1057
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,880
I can’t wrap my head around it, brother.

1058
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,720
This girl tried to poison Aslı on purpose.

1059
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,680
Don’t be fooled by how innocent
and proper she looks on the outside.

1060
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,720
How could one do such a thing?

1061
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,560
Were you really going to
drop the 187 day condition?

1062
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,840
Aslı is everything to us, you know that.

1063
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,600
What happened to her hurt me too.

1064
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,880
But I haven’t forgotten our real goal.

1065
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,280
I haven’t forgotten what 187 days means.

1066
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,320
I won’t die before I destroy them

1067
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,320
and make them face what they’ve done.

1068
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,680
This poisoning matter...

1069
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,680
The guy investigating the shipments called.

1070
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,280
He’d send the cargo details today.

1071
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,760
We already know who did it, but still…

1072
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,640
Let’s focus on our work now.

1073
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,640
This signature business

1074
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,360
has dragged on too long.

1075
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,080
We need to speed it up.

1076
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,160
Şahin, any news from Haydar?

1077
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,640
When will the signing take place?

1078
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,240
Nothing yet. I’m waiting.

1079
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,840
Just finish the job already!

1080
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,040
The signatures must be
signed today or tomorrow!

1081
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,760
He’s about to cave. Any moment now.

1082
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,200
That signature will be Haydar’s end.

1083
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,920
I’ll finish both him and his family.

1084
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,880
God willing, brother.

1085
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,800
Are all preparations complete?

1086
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,400
Exactly as you ordered.

1087
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,840
Once Haydar signs, the containers move.

1088
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,560
Then a police raid.

1089
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,480
After that, we’re in the clear.

1090
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,800
One day you’ll regret this deeply.

1091
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,000
What are we even living
through in this mansion?

1092
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,560
My Mercan was left all
alone, like an orphan.

1093
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,080
She looked to her parents for support,

1094
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,640
for a hand to reach out.

1095
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,120
My heart shattered.

1096
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,760
I was ashamed on their behalf.

1097
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,600
There’s so much hatred here.

1098
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,800
Why?

1099
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,360
We don’t understand either.

1100
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,480
We must leave this mansion.

1101
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,320
I know my decision is right.

1102
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,880
Look what they’ve done to
Haydar Yıldırım’s daughter!

1103
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,920
You've seen what they've done to her.

1104
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,800
I’ll make each one pay.

1105
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,720
Don’t look away, mother.

1106
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,840
Look at me.

1107
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,280
How could you do this?

1108
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:33,880
It wasn’t hard.

1109
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,880
And I’m not sorry.

1110
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:40,280
I lost my child because of that woman!

1111
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:44,680
Then she mocked my pain.

1112
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,840
I wanted her to suffer the same.

1113
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,880
What?!

1114
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,800
What do you mean?

1115
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,560
What did you do?

1116
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,240
I said what did you do?!

1117
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,080
I did it.

1118
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,280
That’s what happened.

1119
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,040
I can’t believe it!

1120
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,040
Taking a life. Was it that easy?

1121
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,120
Didn’t your conscience ache?

1122
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,960
Didn’t your hand tremble
as you put the poison in?

1123
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,640
It didn’t.

1124
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,600
Did her conscience ache?

1125
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:22,120
Did her hand tremble when
she posted that video online?

1126
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,280
The bullet came from that man’s gun,

1127
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,880
but the real killer of my son is Müzeyyen!

1128
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,240
And I didn’t knowingly
put the poison in your bag.

1129
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,760
If I had, would I have put it there?

1130
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,160
Would I have dragged my daughter into this?

1131
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:47,120
You did it, and you let
Mercan take the blame?

1132
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,320
Have you lost your mind, woman?!

1133
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:53,080
I don’t care. I’d do it again.

1134
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,200
Didn't you think of your daughter at all?

1135
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,440
Look what she’s been through!

1136
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,640
While the Karahans tortured
Mercan, did you feel nothing?

1137
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,240
What kind of mother are you?

1138
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,080
Enough!

1139
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,240
I’m in so much pain right now…

1140
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,880
Sometimes I wonder...

1141
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:19,280
Is my real enemy Karahans, or you?

1142
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,280
Who am I supposed to protect myself from?

1143
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,160
You, or them?

1144
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,360
-Dear... -I...

1145
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,480
If I can’t trust my parents,

1146
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:37,040
who can I trust in this life?

1147
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,000
Who can I lean on?

1148
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:43,520
What your mother did
is not right, daughter.

1149
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,880
What your mother did is unforgivable.

1150
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:52,120
She doesn’t know what she’s doing,
overcome with grief for her child.

1151
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:53,760
She wasn’t thinking clearly.

1152
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:57,840
Just like you, Ateş Karahan
is our family’s true enemy.

1153
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,520
Don't forget this.

1154
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,720
Yes, Şahin.

1155
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,680
You know in business, words mean nothing.

1156
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,120
Only signatures count.

1157
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,880
You’re dragging your feet.

1158
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,560
Others are waiting.

1159
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:25,760
I’m sorry, dear.

1160
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,480
What happened inside…

1161
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,920
I...

1162
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,200
never wanted you to go through that.

1163
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,400
If you don’t sign right away,

1164
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,600
I’ll make a deal with another company.

1165
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,440
Hurry up.

1166
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,720
There’s a small snag. I’ll call you.

1167
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,040
Şahin is pressing hard.

1168
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,840
We need to decide, dear.

1169
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,960
I want us united again.

1170
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,680
It’s the only way to defeat him.

1171
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,800
You’ll kneel before Aslı.

1172
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,520
I’m sorry.

1173
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:28,520
Louder!

1174
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,800
Everyone will hear it!

1175
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,520
I don’t owe you an explanation!

1176
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,560
You do.

1177
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:44,280
And you will.

1178
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,120
I don't.

1179
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,480
I'm not your slave.

1180
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:49,320
I go wherever and whenever I want.

1181
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,400
If this will free us from that man,

1182
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,080
I’m in.

1183
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,560
As long as he’s out of our lives.

1184
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,440
That’s the spirit of
Haydar Yıldırım’s daughter.

1185
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,960
Look, I promise.

1186
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:13,520
You’ll see, the money we make
will be our ticket out of the trap.

1187
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,800
We’ll start from scratch,
and together we’ll rise again.

1188
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,560
I’ll go at once and
have the papers prepared.

1189
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,480
Tomorrow we’ll sign the document
that removes Ateş Karahan from our lives.

1190
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,520
Things have calmed down a little.

1191
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,640
It’s the calm before the storm.

1192
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,560
Mrs. Müzeyyen won’t stop.

1193
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,640
She’ll stir up something again.

1194
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,440
Brother, mother seems determined to leave.

1195
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,080
What are we going to do?

1196
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,240
I’ll talk to her.

1197
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,000
-Really? -Yeah.

1198
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,320
Binnaz Sultan is a bit stubborn,

1199
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:17,760
but I do have a way with persuasion.

1200
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:18,920
I'll handle it.

1201
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,280
You’ll, won't you?

1202
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,000
Don't worry. I'll handle it. It' on me.

1203
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,360
Look, I trust you.

1204
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,360
It' on me. It' on me. Don't worry.

1205
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,680
On me.

1206
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,080
So?

1207
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,120
Come on, say whatever it is.

1208
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:38,840
Who?

1209
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,240
Me? No, I’ve got nothing to say.

1210
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,360
-Mother, -What?

1211
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,160
Are we really leaving?

1212
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,160
Is that your final decision?

1213
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,760
Why don't we think it over once more?

1214
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:56,960
We’re leaving, daughter.

1215
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,600
I’ll speak with Mr. Ateş.

1216
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,800
We’ll stay until he
finds someone to replace us.

1217
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,400
Then everyone goes their own way.

1218
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,080
Come on.

1219
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:07,520
Now, back to your work.
I’ve got work to do.

1220
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,320
Let’s not give anyone reason
to talk until we’re gone.

1221
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,600
Malik!

1222
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:32,200
Did you check the vehicles’ inspections?

1223
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:33,640
All done.

1224
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
No issues.

1225
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,400
Not with the cars,

1226
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,800
but looks like you’ve
got an issue yourself?

1227
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,040
I do, Mr.. I can’t stay silent.

1228
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,440
I have worked here a while,

1229
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,720
though not too long.

1230
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:49,080
But you get a sense of
who’s good and who’s not.

1231
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,400
Of course, you don’t know Mrs. Mercan.

1232
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,960
You’ve only been here a month or so.

1233
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,840
But I knew within weeks she’s kind hearted.

1234
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,280
To put it simply,

1235
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:06,520
no one here believes she’d harm anyone.

1236
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,240
Me included.

1237
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,440
You’ve wronged her.

1238
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:11,560
That’s all I’ll say.

1239
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,480
Fair enough, Malik.

1240
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,280
If you’ll excuse me.

1241
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,480
Be safe. Thank you.

1242
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,000
What’s this suitcase?

1243
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,920
Mrs. Mercan said she’ll
stay in the guest room.

1244
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:15,480
She asked me to bring her things.

1245
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,240
Put it back where you got it.

1246
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,400
But Mrs. Mercan…

1247
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,240
What are you doing?!

1248
01:42:58,320 --> 01:42:59,960
Are you insane?! Let go of me!

1249
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,960
Put me down!

1250
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,680
Are insane? What are you doing?!

1251
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:09,200
I said let go. Let go. Let go.

1252
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,080
You’ll stay in this room.

1253
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,200
Sleep in this bed.

1254
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,520
Every morning when you open your eyes,

1255
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,600
you’ll see my face.

1256
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,840
You don’t step outside,

1257
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:41,040
not even into the garden,
without my permission.

1258
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,080
You won’t escape me.

1259
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,640
This will be your biggest punishment.

1260
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,040
Look at me.

1261
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,640
Whether you want to or not,
you’ll keep seeing this face.

1262
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,800
I’ll get free of you.

1263
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,880
I apologized. What more do you want?

1264
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,160
When will this torture end?

1265
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,880
What are you going to do? Kill me?

1266
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,880
I wish you would, so I’d be free you!

1267
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,040
Your death will set you free.

1268
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,840
I won’t let you off that easy.

1269
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,960
Don't.

1270
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:54,600
Don’t even think about running.

1271
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,120
I’ll find you and drag you back here.

1272
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,720
If I have to, I’ll lock you in.

1273
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,760
And if that doesn’t work, I’ll tie you up.

1274
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,960
Be smart. Behave.

1275
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,000
We can sign tomorrow.

1276
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,480
You’ll sign with Nezir.

1277
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:45,280
Nezir?

1278
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,880
I sold my company to him.

1279
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,600
He’s your new partner.

1280
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,840
That’s a surprise.

1281
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:56,960
We’ve been negotiating for a while.

1282
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,480
Finally reached a deal.

1283
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,880
I thought I’d tell you once it was settled.

1284
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:04,280
Our goal is the same.

1285
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,600
Joining forces won’t hurt.

1286
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,200
Congratulations.

1287
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:12,680
So we’re partners now, Nezir?

1288
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:18,000
That’s right. But for now, keep it quiet.

1289
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:22,080
Once the papers are signed,
we’ll surprise Ateş Karahan.

1290
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,240
Works for me.

1291
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,280
Mercan wouldn’t hurt a fly.
I’ve known her for years.

1292
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,360
No mother’s warmth to hold her.

1293
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:49,360
She was framed.

1294
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,800
I’ll never believe she’d do such a thing.

1295
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,640
Me neither.

1296
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:03,960
-Mom? -What?

1297
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,480
We’re leaving. We're leaving.

1298
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,880
When elephants fight, the grass suffers.

1299
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:17,960
More battles will come, and
we’ll be the ones who suffer.

1300
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:21,640
What about the debts, Mother?

1301
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:22,960
We’ll find work somehow.

1302
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:24,640
I’ve spread the word.

1303
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,280
We’ll find work. It’ll be paid.

1304
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:31,520
Peace and health come first.

1305
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:40,200
That won’t do. Give
me a bigger one. Bigger.

1306
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,640
Catch it. Catch it. Catch.

1307
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,400
Give me a piece. He took it all.

1308
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:57,200
Such a tyrant!

1309
01:47:58,840 --> 01:47:59,960
Shameless!

1310
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,840
Face me.

1311
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:32,720
Look at him. Still giving orders.

1312
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:38,240
I said face me!

1313
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,280
Your face will always be turned this way.

1314
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:48,760
Sleeping or waking, your eyes will see me.

1315
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:53,920
Understand?

1316
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,080
Do you understand?

1317
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:06,600
I hate you!

1318
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,600
With all my soul!

1319
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:13,480
One day you’ll regret this deeply.

1320
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:19,680
You’ll beg for forgiveness.

1321
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,120
And when that day comes,
I won’t even look at you.

1322
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:43,080
You’ll beg for forgiveness.

1323
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:11,440
I won’t let your tears cloud my mind.

1324
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,560
I hate you.

1325
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,160
With all my soul!

1326
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,760
One day you’ll regret this deeply.

1327
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,600
Still here.

1328
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:49,160
Tyrant.

1329
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:11,520
How am I supposed to endure this torture?

1330
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,280
How?

1331
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:29,600
Let’s talk before you go to the company.

1332
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:01,680
What are you doing, brother?

1333
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,640
I’ve been checking job ads.

1334
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:06,520
Nothing feels right.

1335
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:08,800
We don’t want to leave, that’s why.

1336
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,720
We’ve been here for years.

1337
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,400
Once you get used to it,
it feels hard to leave.

1338
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:15,760
This mansion feels like home.

1339
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,280
True, dear.

1340
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,200
We’ve never known anywhere else.

1341
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,400
I understand mom, too.

1342
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,960
Being accused like that
was humiliating, for me too.

1343
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,240
But still… breaking up
our whole life so suddenly…

1344
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:30,640
I don't know.

1345
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:42,480
I don’t even know what
to be upset about anymore.

1346
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:46,840
Same here.

1347
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,800
Every day feels like a nightmare.

1348
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,560
No day goes by without it.

1349
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,920
Maybe leaving will be good, Çiçek.

1350
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:02,440
We’ll find a nice family.

1351
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,880
Quiet.

1352
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:06,480
Less work, better pay.

1353
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,520
Sure, they’ve been waiting just for us.

1354
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,280
Mrs. hasn’t told you yet, has she?

1355
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,840
No. But she’ll talk today
if she gets the chance.

1356
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,080
So the goodbye is close.

1357
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,520
The house is suffocating me.

1358
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,520
I’m going out.

1359
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:37,520
I’ll go to the cemetery.

1360
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:39,600
Visit my Murat.

1361
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:46,960
Just don’t cause trouble, Nermin. Go.

1362
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:58,760
Daughter, we need to be at
the company this afternoon.

1363
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:01,240
Remember, the papers will
be signed around three.

1364
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,760
Dad, I agreed, but…

1365
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:07,520
something about this
deal doesn’t sit right.

1366
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:10,240
Are you sure we can trust this man Şahin?

1367
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,000
Şahin is not our contact anymore.

1368
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,080
It’s Nezir.

1369
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:19,640
-Nezir? -He bought Şahin’s company.

1370
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:22,360
We’ll be dealing with someone we know.

1371
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:33,280
Dear, you want to be rid of Ateş
Karahan as much as I do, don’t you?

1372
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:36,200
Then let’s sign and
get the shipment moving.

1373
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:38,560
I built this company.

1374
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:40,600
He came and took it over.

1375
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:43,840
Look, there’s nothing
wrong in what we’re doing.

1376
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,520
Trust me, dear.

1377
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,520
Rest easy.

1378
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:53,840
I’ll be at the company
at the time you said.

1379
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,400
I knew you’d do the right thing.

1380
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,080
I’ll head to the company
to prepare the documents.

1381
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:12,440
I’m glad you came.

1382
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:14,520
Let’s go to the gazebo.

1383
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:24,440
You’ll pay for what you did to my daughter!

1384
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,000
A hollow apology won’t save you!

1385
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,800
I keep thinking about you.

1386
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:41,920
How are you?

1387
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:44,520
How could I be fine in all this?

1388
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,320
I’m exhausted.

1389
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,160
I’m spent, Demet.

1390
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:53,240
My dear, don’t give up.

1391
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:55,720
You’re strong.

1392
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:58,040
I also try to stay positive.

1393
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:03,600
I tell myself "you can’t
surrender, you have to fight."

1394
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,840
But, I don’t know what to do, either.

1395
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:09,520
This way...

1396
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,920
Mrs. Müzeyyen what are you doing?!

1397
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,320
Let go of her!

1398
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,720
Stay out of this! Get lost!

1399
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:16,920
Stop it!

1400
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,320
Fine. When the proposal
file is ready, email it to me.

1401
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,200
Get inside!

1402
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:24,680
Fine.

1403
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:26,280
-Demet, do something! -Go away!

1404
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:28,000
I told you to let go!

1405
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,960
What do you think you're doing?!

1406
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:33,800
Mrs. Müzeyyen, I told you to
let go of her! You’re hurting her!

1407
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:35,920
Mercan!

1408
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:41,280
All right.

1409
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:45,640
Walk!

1410
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:47,400
Mrs. Müzeyyen!

1411
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:48,760
Mercan!

1412
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,800
Mrs. Müzeyyen, open the door.

1413
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,880
I'm telling you, I didn't do anything!

1414
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:54,960
Mrs. Müzeyyen!

1415
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,080
Mercan open up!

1416
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,080
Open the door! Open up!

1417
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,200
Mercan!

1418
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:06,360
Mercan!

1419
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:08,120
Open it.

1420
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:09,560
Open the door!

1421
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,400
I'm telling you to open!

1422
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:12,680
Open the door.

1423
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:13,640
What's going on here?

1424
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:17,040
Mrs. Müzeyyen dragged Mercan by the
hair and locked her in the kitchen.

1425
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,400
Open the door.

1426
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:20,080
I'm telling you to open!

1427
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:23,120
Stop! Don't do it!

1428
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,960
Open! Mercan! Open!

1429
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:41,400
What’s going on here?

1430
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:44,360
Mrs. Müzeyyen brought Mercan
inside and locked the door.

1431
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,680
Mother Müzeyyen, open the door!

1432
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,400
Stop it! Don't!

1433
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,960
You’ll pay for what you did to my daughter!

1434
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:33,400
What are you doing, Mother Müzeyyen?!

1435
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:35,320
I'm giving her the lesson she deserves.

1436
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:38,080
Get out! We’ll deal with this later!

1437
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,800
Are you alright. Let me! Let me!

1438
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:00,040
Okay, calm down.

1439
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:04,200
Calm down. Relax.

1440
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:13,400
Let me see.

1441
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:21,960
Oh, my poor girl!

1442
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:24,160
Come.

1443
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,176
Look, Mother, you know
I’d never disrespect you.

1444
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:47,560
I don't like to oppose you.

1445
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:49,640
But this wasn’t right.

1446
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:51,000
But this wasn’t right, Mother.

1447
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:52,400
You hurt the girl badly.

1448
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:54,320
It was exactly right.

1449
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:58,880
What are you doing, Mother Müzeyyen?

1450
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:00,480
Burning her hand?

1451
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:02,280
How could you?!

1452
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,240
After all these years,
you still don’t know me?

1453
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:08,600
If anyone harms my children,
I’ll burn the world.

1454
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:11,360
That snake should be grateful
she got away with just a burn.

1455
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:15,640
Do you think I’d let what
happened to Aslı go unpunished?

1456
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:17,960
Of course I’ll make them pay.

1457
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:19,600
But not like this.

1458
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,800
This will never happen again!

1459
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:26,600
What’s this urge to protect Mercan?

1460
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:31,560
I’m not protecting anyone!

1461
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:33,680
But you don’t do this to a person.

1462
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:36,800
The pain we’ll inflict won’t be physical.

1463
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,080
They poisoned my daughter!

1464
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:42,160
And now they’ll live here,

1465
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:44,120
eat at our table?

1466
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:46,120
-That’s their punishment? -Yes, it is.

1467
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:51,000
Every meal with us will choke them.

1468
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:53,640
Every day under this roof

1469
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:55,600
will drive another nail into their coffin.

1470
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,240
And I’ll watch it all.

1471
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,720
The signing is close.

1472
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,960
I’m heading to the company.

1473
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,520
You stay here.

1474
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:18,400
Who knows what Mother
Müzeyyen will do next.

1475
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,840
Don’t worry, brother. I’ll keep an eye out.

1476
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,280
Call Şahin. Tell him to stay sharp.

1477
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:24,880
All’s ready for the operation.

1478
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,400
All we need is Haydar's signature.

1479
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:29,120
He will sign his own death warrant.

1480
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,120
The police will tear him apart.

1481
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:32,840
I’ll get ready and go.

1482
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:49,520
My head’s splitting.

1483
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:53,680
I’ve lived this long,
never seen anything like it.

1484
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:55,640
The woman’s a psychopath.

1485
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:59,120
My headache is killing me.

1486
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:04,240
These eyes have seen plenty,
these ears have heard plenty.

1487
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:06,920
But never this.

1488
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:14,480
We forgot our own troubles,
worrying about Ms. Mercan.

1489
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:20,080
What Mrs. Müzeyyen did to her,
you wouldn’t do to an enemy.

1490
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:23,560
They’re no different from enemies anyway.

1491
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:29,400
Her scream… it cut right through me.

1492
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:31,160
I heard it from here.

1493
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:32,640
Just what we needed.

1494
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:36,360
Well, well. Family gossip hour.

1495
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,720
Good luck with that, Mr. Malik.

1496
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:56,240
We’re already upset, huh.

1497
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:00,160
Don’t mess with us.

1498
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:17,560
That woman assaulted you, Mercan.

1499
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:19,800
Come on, let’s go to the police.

1500
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:22,040
Demet, please don’t push me.

1501
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:25,120
I can’t deal with police
and stations on top of this.

1502
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:29,080
If neither of us goes, what then?

1503
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:32,560
This is abuse, literally torture.

1504
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:42,760
At least let a doctor see your hand.

1505
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:45,520
I’m fine. It’s not that bad.

1506
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,360
It’s almost over.

1507
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,080
It’ll all be over soon.

1508
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:55,120
What did you say? I didn’t hear.

1509
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,520
No, I didn't.

1510
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,640
I need to get ready.

1511
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:04,120
I have things to do outside.

1512
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:16,080
Out. We’ll handle this.

1513
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,600
Please take care of yourself.

1514
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:21,960
Call me if you need anything.

1515
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:23,840
I’m fine. Don’t worry.

1516
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:28,560
With people like you
around, how could you be?

1517
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:54,880
Put this on.

1518
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,360
What’s this, now?

1519
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,240
Is your conscience bothering you?

1520
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,480
Where are you going?

1521
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:10,040
To the office.

1522
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:12,640
I forbid it. You’re not going.

1523
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:16,480
What? I don’t need
permission to go to work.

1524
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:18,480
From now on, you do.

1525
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:21,160
Is this a joke?

1526
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:23,160
I work there, remember?

1527
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:26,200
You should’ve thought of
that before trying to kill Aslı.

1528
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:30,920
This is how it is now.

1529
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:33,680
I’m going! And you won’t stop me.

1530
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:37,920
What are you doing?! Give me my phone!

1531
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:41,680
You’re locking me in?!

1532
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:43,160
I warned you.

1533
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:44,680
No! You can’t!

1534
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,200
Don’t fight in vain. I don’t want you hurt.

1535
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:53,880
Open this door! I said
"Open!" Open the door!

1536
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,600
You'll work on this now.

1537
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,680
Mr. Haydar? Welcome!

1538
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,400
It’s been a while since we’ve seen you.

1539
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:23,520
What a nice surprise.

1540
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,000
Today’s a big day.

1541
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,240
Isn’t that right?

1542
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:29,120
It is.

1543
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:40,400
Who’s that?

1544
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:42,960
Him? The new intern.

1545
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:47,560
Burak!

1546
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:49,280
Come here, son. Come.

1547
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:55,800
Hopefully he won’t trip
on the way over. Bit clumsy.

1548
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:01,040
Yes, Mr. Yaşar?

1549
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:04,240
Meet Mr. Haydar, the
founder of our company.

1550
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:06,640
Nice to meet you, sir.

1551
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:10,640
Just started, huh?

1552
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:11,720
Yes, sir.

1553
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:14,160
And Mr. Nezir, a family friend.

1554
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:22,080
I… I should get back to work.

1555
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:24,280
Again, I'm pleased to meet you.

1556
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:36,000
Haydar (to Come here a second.

1557
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:37,560
What’s Burak’s story?

1558
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:39,520
Um..

1559
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:42,280
So... well, Mr. Haydar.

1560
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:45,080
Mr. Burak and Ms. Zahide are...

1561
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:50,000
-Yes, Demet. -later on... therefore...

1562
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:51,520
What!

1563
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,960
What are you saying?!

1564
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:10,280
-Just another action packed day. -Stop!

1565
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:18,280
I heard what happened to Mercan!

1566
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:21,640
This is how you protect your wife?

1567
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:23,360
This is how you keep her safe?!

1568
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:27,120
?

1569
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:31,440
As you said, she’s my wife.

1570
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:35,920
What happens under this
roof is none of your business.

1571
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:37,960
Now get out!

1572
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:42,920
Your time’s up, Ateş Karahan!

1573
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:46,240
From now on, I’ll be on
your heels. Until death!

1574
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:09,040
Mother Müzeyyen just
brought trouble down on us!

1575
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:12,280
I’m leaving. The mansion’s in your hands.

1576
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:42,440
As long as I don't rid that
man, this captivity won’t end!

1577
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:47,720
I have to find a way out.

1578
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:50,360
I have to sign that contract.

1579
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,720
Time’s running out.

1580
02:13:58,040 --> 02:13:59,960
Open the door!

1581
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:03,320
Is anyone there?! Can you
hear me?! Open the door!

1582
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:06,160
Is anyone there?!

1583
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:17,080
No one hears me.

1584
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,080
What am I going to do?

1585
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:29,920
[ON-SCREEN] CEMAL CALLING

1586
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:31,880
Yes, Cemal.

1587
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:34,080
I just got a message
from the delivery company.

1588
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,560
Pesticides ordered under
Nermin Yıldırım’s name.

1589
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:38,760
So, rat poison delivered to her.

1590
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:44,800
I’m sorry.

1591
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:46,800
Not to me. Look at Aslı.

1592
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:48,240
Louder!

1593
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:52,520
You’ll regret this deeply.

1594
02:15:58,560 --> 02:15:59,640
She didn’t do it!

1595
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:03,520
Exactly. It was Mrs. Nermin
who poisoned Aslı, not Mercan.

1596
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:07,920
Alright, I’m coming right now.

1597
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:10,280
She escaped!

1598
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:13,040
She must’ve gone to the company.

1599
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:15,720
Thinks she can defy me!

1600
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:17,800
Zehra!

1601
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:19,120
Yes, Mr. Ateş.

1602
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:20,960
Where’s Mrs. Nermin?

1603
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:23,200
She went out.

1604
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:37,640
Why did Aslı say Mercan did it?

1605
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:39,440
I don’t know, brother.

1606
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:41,280
Maybe she thought so?

1607
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:43,640
We’ll find out, soon.

1608
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:47,040
First, let’s finish Haydar.

1609
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:49,920
Nezir’s already taken the bait.

1610
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:53,080
We'll kill two birds with one stone.

1611
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,120
- I’m heading to the company.
- Alright, brother.

1612
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:20,560
I made you lemonade.

1613
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:22,600
I made it.

1614
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:25,720
Thank you, my Çiçek.

1615
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:35,600
Delicious.

1616
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:43,960
Once you leave, there’s
no point in me staying here.

1617
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:47,120
There will be.

1618
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:49,280
Madam Zehra will bring you lemonade then.

1619
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:51,480
If you go, I’ll quit too.

1620
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:53,400
What do you mean?

1621
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:54,800
That’s how it is.

1622
02:18:56,440 --> 02:18:58,240
Wherever you go, I’ll find work there.

1623
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:03,640
From now on, wherever you go, I go.

1624
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:08,840
If I leave, would you come with me?

1625
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:12,880
Of course, I would.

1626
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:15,960
Even if you went to the ends
of the earth, I’d follow.

1627
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,040
Oh, That’s my girl!

1628
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:56,680
How’s your hand?

1629
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:58,920
It’s nothing.

1630
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:01,200
Nezir told me.

1631
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:05,440
I’ll make them pay
for what they did to you.

1632
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:07,000
I promise.

1633
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:09,840
But first, let’s sign.

1634
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:16,120
Come on.

1635
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:32,720
[ON-SCREEN]: ZAHİDE CALLING

1636
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:34,080
Yes, Ms. Zahide?

1637
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,960
Zahide: Mr. Ateş, Ms. Mercan is also here.

1638
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:41,680
She’s the one signing, not Mr. Haydar.

1639
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:46,880
I didn’t expect this.

1640
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:49,560
Okay, I'll be there right away.

1641
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:51,640
Alright, Mr. Ateş.

1642
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:58,280
So that’s why she insisted
on going to the company.

1643
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:01,800
You don’t know the trouble you're in.

1644
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:04,800
Haydar!

1645
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:07,280
Now that I’ve caught you,

1646
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:09,560
I won’t let you escape!

1647
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:25,880
This contract is all of our salvation.

1648
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:04,640
This agreement will benefit both sides.

1649
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,400
You won't regret it, dear.

1650
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,240
Congratulations, partner.

1651
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:21,760
For all of us.

1652
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:38,360
What have you done?
