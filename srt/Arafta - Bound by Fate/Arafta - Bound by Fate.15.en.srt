1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,720
I looked up the names in the news.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,480
They all died years
ago, around the same time.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,040
The families.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,120
Their surviving relatives.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,680
They say they fell into the
hands of human traffickers.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,000
The people in the grave
are your mother and father.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,760
Lead traces

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,880
were found in the bones.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,520
This lowlife man.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
He shot

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
my mother and father.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
Haydar.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,520
I'll kill you.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,880
Haydar!

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Come out and face me!

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Where's your husband?

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Um... He went out a little while ago.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Where's your father?

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,760
Tell me, where is he?

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,280
I don't know.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,920
Huh? Is this some mountain wilderness?

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,280
You can't treat Mercan like this!

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
-Don't! -Ateş!

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Okay, calm down!

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,720
-Stop... -Okay, Ateş. Calm down.

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,280
And you, back off, so
this doesn't get any worse.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,920
Wasn't there another place?

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,320
I told you, no one else knows about here.

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,440
It's best to leave until things calm down.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,640
Thanks, Nezir. If it weren't for you...

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Forget it now.

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,759
But they released you after
you gave your statement.

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,280
Why do you need to hide?

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,800
I can't leave my fate to chance, daughter.

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,160
They're still messing with me.

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,800
I won't be around until
the truth comes out.

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,640
I want to come see you.

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,320
It's better if you
don't come now, daughter.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You were supposed to call
Mercan once things calmed down!

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,560
Was this the thing to do while Ateş
is looking for Haydar like a madman?

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Haydar to the grave, Ateş to prison…

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,720
What are you doing? Have you gone mad?

43
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,920
You don't have the power to stop me!

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,680
Ateş, don't do it, I beg you!

45
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,320
I didn't do anything to you…

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,880
Stop lying!

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,440
I told you I won't allow this.

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,480
You'll have to walk over my corpse first.

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
I told you to get out of my way!

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,320
I won't!

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,960
Get away!

52
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,680
You want to kill my father?

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,680
You need to shoot me first.

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,240
Shoot me.

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,320
What are you waiting for? Pull the trigger!

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,840
First me, then my father.

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,480
You accuse my father of being a murderer,

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,600
like you're any different.

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,320
You're pointing a gun at a
person without even blinking.

60
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,840
You're turning into the people you blame.

61
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,480
Come on. Come on, shoot me!

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,440
What are you waiting for, pull the trigger!

63
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,920
Ateş! Calm down brother, I'm begging you.

64
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,160
Just give me the gun.

65
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,840
I'm here, it's okay.

66
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,040
Let go.

67
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,880
I'm here.

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,680
I can't reach Cemal.

69
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,200
I hope Ateş doesn't do anything crazy.

70
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,840
I hope so, too, mom. He left
the house in such anger...

71
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,240
And we still haven't heard from him.

72
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,640
My god, please protect my children.

73
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
It's Cemal.

74
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,640
Hello? I called but I couldn't reach you.

75
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,760
We're worried out of our minds about Ateş.

76
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,479
There's nothing to worry about. Haydar
has been detained and Ateş is fine.

77
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,360
We'll be home in a couple of hours.

78
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
What? He was arrested?

79
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,080
They put Haydar behind bars, huh?

80
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,880
That is such a relief to me.

81
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,440
I feel the same way, mom.
I'm glad we've overcome this.

82
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,880
For now.

83
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,560
The Ateş I know wouldn't
stop until he's killed Haydar.

84
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,720
I hope he doesn't do anything crazy.

85
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,519
I hope so too, mom.

86
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,200
We have difficult days ahead of us.

87
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,320
May god help us.

88
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,400
That Haydar doesn't deserve
to take another breath!

89
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,080
Could you calm down already?
I'm getting dizzy watching you.

90
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,840
I won't keep my calm
anymore, Cemal. I can't!

91
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,720
I don't care about our plan anymore!

92
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,719
I'll take that man's life!

93
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,656
Ateş, get it together!
You're being unreasonable.

94
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,880
I swear on my life, I'll kill him.

95
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,760
Let my arm go.

96
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,040
Okay, I'll let you go
but you need to calm down.

97
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,680
I can't calm down! Stop
telling me to calm down.

98
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,960
He took everyone I love from me!

99
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,040
He destroyed my family.

100
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm all alone in the world because of him.

101
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,919
He deserves to die,

102
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,640
more than anyone else.

103
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,479
But I'll take pity on him.

104
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,640
I'll shoot him in the head.

105
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,560
That's enough, Ateş! Do
you hear your own words?

106
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
You need to pull yourself together.

107
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,320
I can't pull myself together,
why would I do that now?

108
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,479
What are you going to do? Will
you soak your hands in blood?

109
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,560
Weren't you the one saying death
would be salvation for Haydar?

110
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,399
I changed my mind.

111
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,760
I don't care about the
plan or anything else!

112
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,496
I won't be able to rest
before I take that man's life.

113
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,480
Do you hear yourself?

114
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,616
We now have Rıza to deal
with, on top of everything.

115
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,096
We should look into that first,
see if he has anything to do with it.

116
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,000
Then we'll do whatever needs to be done.

117
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,840
Will you kill Haydar
and leave me in the lurch?

118
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,600
What about Aslı, Mrs. Müzeyyen?

119
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
You should at least think
about us, if not yourself.

120
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,800
That man betrayed us
all, do you understand?

121
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,800
I'll kill him for all of us.

122
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,200
Okay, I get it.

123
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,320
You don't care about us, but
what about your sister, Eylül?

124
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,040
What about your promise to her, Ateş?

125
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,600
Do you think Eylül would've wanted this?

126
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,640
Would Eylül want her
brother to become a murderer?

127
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,840
That's enough, Cemal.

128
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,200
It's not, Ateş.

129
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,200
It's my duty as a friend
to be honest with you.

130
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,560
I'll keep being blunt with
you, as long as I am your friend.

131
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,039
Let me tell you what Eylül would've wanted,

132
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,760
she would've wanted her
brother to keep his promise.

133
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,519
Cemal, stop talking.

134
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,800
What kind of a brother are you?
Is this how a brother would act?

135
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,160
I told you to shut up, Cemal.

136
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,520
How will you face your sister, will
you have the face to go to her grave?

137
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,720
Cemal, shut up!

138
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,040
"You accuse my father of being a
murderer, like you're any different."

139
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,520
My god, what have I done?

140
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,240
The cake tastes good, Çiçek.

141
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,920
Enjoy.

142
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,240
Eat slowly, son.

143
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,520
Çiçek, your brother has such an
appetite, he would eat a horse if he could.

144
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,400
What do we do with him, mom?

145
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,199
He never seems to get
full, he's too greedy.

146
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,280
Why are you hitting me?

147
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,160
Mom, let me ask you something.

148
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,640
You haven't made black
cabbage soup in a while.

149
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,840
Is there a problem between you? Have
you had a falling out with the soup?

150
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,360
You haven't made it in so long, why
don't you make some for tonight, huh?

151
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,760
I'll make it, son.

152
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,920
Now that we're rid of that debt,
I'll make you whatever you want.

153
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,159
Thank god for that.

154
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,560
Let's have some soup.

155
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,440
This tastes really good, Çiçek.

156
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,719
Enjoy. I made that, you know.

157
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you.

158
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,240
Malik, welcome.

159
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,440
Have some cake.

160
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,320
No, thanks. I don't
feel like it, you enjoy.

161
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,600
You're missing out, have
some. I'll get you some tea.

162
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,640
Who paid off our debt, I wonder.

163
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,760
I mean I'm grateful it's
been paid off, but who

164
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,040
would give away so much
money at a time like this?

165
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,600
I keep ruminating over it,
I can't get a moment's sleep.

166
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,000
Berat, we should figure that out.

167
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,520
Why don't you just forget about it?

168
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,280
You shouldn't fret about it, Mrs.
Binnaz. Since it was paid in confidence,

169
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,319
he obviously doesn't wnat to be found.

170
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,640
Don't you agree?

171
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,559
I guess you're right.

172
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,239
It's been paid off regardless,
we should just enjoy it.

173
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,600
Let's be happy we're
done with that business.

174
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,920
Malik, come on. Have some.

175
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,040
Have some cake.

176
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,360
No, thank you. I don't want any.

177
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,480
Oh, come on, have some.
It's really good. Come on.

178
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,040
Berat...

179
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,440
Come on, here comes the
plane. Open, here you go.

180
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,440
What do you think?

181
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:52,920
It's really good.

182
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,320
Who made it?

183
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,240
Here's the mastermind.

184
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,240
My dear sister.

185
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,760
It's really good, I can't describe it.

186
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
Enjoy.

187
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,280
We need to talk.

188
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,080
There's nothing to talk about.

189
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,959
Nothing to talk about, huh?

190
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,880
Do you realize what you've done?

191
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,960
Your dad got lucky today.

192
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,280
I can't believe it.

193
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,200
What right do you have to put
my father, put me through this?

194
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,200
Tell me, why are you doing this to us?

195
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,199
Your dad had it coming for a while.

196
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,960
You should be grateful he's alive.

197
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,360
Who are you to make that judgment,

198
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,280
who are you to decide that?

199
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,200
On top of that, you're trying to decide his

200
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,920
sentence for something
that is of no concern to you.

201
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,600
Is this your sense of justice?

202
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,160
You speak as if you know
everything but you're clueless!

203
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,880
I've seen many men like your father.

204
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,240
They've ruined so many
lives, returned to their homes,

205
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,759
as if nothing ever happened,
and went on with their lives.

206
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,919
They got away with everything.

207
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,240
What are you going to do? Find
and kill them all, one by one?

208
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
Are you a thug?

209
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,760
I wish that were the case.

210
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,599
You may not know this because
you live in that mansion,

211
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,799
but you don't have to
experience it first-hand,

212
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,399
to be able to decide their punishment.

213
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,680
Not all that live in mansions
turn out evil, Ateş Karahan.

214
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,840
I know the world is full of
evil people, I'm aware of that.

215
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,120
I'm not as naive as you think me to be.

216
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,840
You are so naive, you'd
be shocked if you knew.

217
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,480
Then tell me, show me.

218
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,280
You're always speaking
as if you know something,

219
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,160
making accusations, stop
hiding behind your words.

220
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,039
I'm sick of seeing that
judgment in your eyes.

221
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,479
Be direct with me, tell me what you know.

222
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,240
Enlighten me.

223
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,920
Don't push my limits.

224
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,559
Of course, your limits are the

225
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,600
only ones that count, not mine.

226
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,599
Okay, let's say we're all evil
and you're the only one that's good.

227
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,959
Do you not see you're becoming
as evil by acting like this?

228
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,240
You would've become a murderer
today, had I not stopped you.

229
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,440
You would've become one
of those men you despise.

230
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,520
You would've become as
dirty and merciless as them.

231
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
Killing the innocent or killing
murderers are not the same thing.

232
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,200
You're right, they're not the same.

233
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,760
But taking a life is murder
regardless of their crimes.

234
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,560
I think you know that too.

235
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,279
I have a lot of question marks in my

236
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,600
mind regarding you, a lot of questions.

237
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,919
But a murderer?

238
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,520
You can't be a murderer.

239
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,160
I saw that in your eyes.

240
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,360
Don't be so sure.

241
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,560
Do you know the difference between us?

242
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,120
You're after revenge, I'm after the truth.

243
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,880
Let's say my dad is an awful
person, you can be sure I'll do

244
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,079
everything in my power to make
sure he pays for his crimes.

245
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,680
But don't forget this,

246
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,880
I would never let you hurt my
father, I'd put my life on the line.

247
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Where is Ateş?

248
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,800
Didn't he come?

249
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,960
He's outside, speaking to Mercan.

250
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,120
Aslı, wait.

251
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,959
Just let them square accounts with

252
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,240
eact other, that'd be better for all of us.

253
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,960
I hope she doesn't provoke Ateş.

254
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,639
It will be fine as long
as we keep an eye on them.

255
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,920
It'll be really difficult
keep Ateş calm from now on.

256
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,360
He's enraged, ready to blow
up at the slightest spark.

257
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
The thing that terrifies
me is Haydar being set free.

258
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,080
Then, all hell would break loose.

259
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,840
Mr. Yaşar?

260
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,239
Can I ask you something?

261
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,520
Ask ahead.

262
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,600
Are the allegations
against Mr. Haydar true?

263
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,600
Did he really do human trafficking?

264
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,079
I've worked at this company for years,
I think I know Mr. Haydar pretty well,

265
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,719
Life has taught me not to vouch
for anyone, that I am wary about.

266
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,679
But still, I don't think it's true.

267
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
He has a stern disposition.

268
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,199
He is stern, that much is true, but
this is murder we're talking about.

269
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,599
There's no way.

270
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,520
I don't think he would, he couldn't have.

271
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,040
But you can never really know a
person, we all live in our own worlds.

272
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,960
Who knows how many people he's hurt?

273
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Keep up the good work.

274
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
What are you two whispering about?

275
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,200
We've been discussing the latest news.

276
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,840
I couldn't believe what I heard either.

277
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,480
It's been one disaster
after another for that family.

278
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,360
It's as if they have a curse placed

279
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,840
on them, nothing ever goes right.

280
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,336
I mean, it must be difficult
for Ms. Mercan as well.

281
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,440
It's her father, after all.

282
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,960
It can't be easy.

283
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,760
Mercan doesn't believe
the accusations, though.

284
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,280
She trusts her dad.

285
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,200
She trusts him, huh?

286
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,840
Let's pray her trust isn't in vain.

287
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,799
What's that supposed to mean?

288
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,160
You seem very concerned with
this subject, why is that?

289
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,520
Is it interesting to you?

290
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,760
No, I mean... I was just
curious since I know them.

291
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,920
Just because I know them.

292
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,599
So that's why.

293
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,120
I don't know, it just seemed like
you were digging into it too much.

294
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,120
No, Mr. Yaşar, you've misconstured
it. It's only because I know them.

295
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,640
So, that's the reason.

296
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,760
We were looking for you.

297
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,520
This is not the path
we decided to take, son.

298
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,640
We can't catch flame at the first spark,

299
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,240
catch fire and burn everything.

300
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,240
I gave up the name "Tahir" for that reason.

301
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,040
That is why I became "Ateş."

302
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
To burn.

303
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,440
To turn those that hurt me into ashes.

304
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,040
Do you think Haydar is worth
getting blood on your hands?

305
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,920
Don't you think it'd be such a waste?

306
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,760
I had digged my own grave when I
first decided to take this path, mom.

307
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,280
There will be no mercy from now on.

308
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,120
There will be no pity.

309
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,080
I'll destroy those who destroyed my family.

310
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,960
Either I burn or they do.

311
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,160
Those who try to justify Haydar's
actions, will meet the same fate.

312
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,719
It's as if they've formed an alliance.

313
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,160
The father kills and the daughter
hides the files to exonerate him.

314
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,239
What kind of a family is this?

315
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,040
They're unbelievable.

316
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,240
Hello?

317
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,320
I'm listening.

318
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,160
Okay, you keep monitoring the process.

319
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,800
Is it about Haydar?

320
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,400
It's our guy at the courthouse.

321
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,200
Haydar is pleading innocent.

322
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,120
The prosecutor is alleging that he has

323
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,920
evidence Haydar didn't
commit those murders.

324
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,400
Solid evidence.

325
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,080
Prison would be salvation for Haydar.

326
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,080
Freedom would be death.

327
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,120
If he had half a mind, he
wouldn't fight for his freedom.

328
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,480
I pray that they won't release that scum.

329
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,800
Or my son is going to...

330
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,280
Is there any update on Haydar's case?

331
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,240
No, Mrs. Nermin.

332
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,120
He's still in custody, the
prosecution is taking his testimony.

333
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,360
Will he be released?

334
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,280
We're doing everything-

335
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,440
Stop reading me lines, mister.

336
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,920
Get my husband out of that hole.

337
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,599
We've been paying you generously for years.

338
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,799
We've been publicly disgraced.

339
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,920
My phone hasn't stopped ringing,
everyone who has heard has called.

340
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,400
I can't even step foot outside.

341
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,560
I'm afraid of getting
jumped, do you understand?

342
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,560
Uhm... Okay, I'll be waiting for your call.

343
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,560
What are you doing here?

344
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,479
The whole country's
talking about your husband's

345
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,880
crimes, people are lined up at the door.

346
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,240
Why don't you go and give a statement?

347
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,040
Tell them about your husband's crimes.

348
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,480
I will give no statement.

349
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,399
Everything will be revealed
when Haydar is released, anyway.

350
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,839
Now, get out of my room!

351
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,760
I'd like to be alone.

352
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,720
You will be, you'll be alone.

353
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,840
When your husband goes to
prison, you'll be all alone.

354
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,960
No one will even look you in the eyes.

355
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,240
You'll perish in some alley, I suppose.

356
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,320
What if they don't release Haydar?

357
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,000
Damn it.

358
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:34,000
I'll lose everything. My
reputation, everything I have.

359
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,839
Mrs. Nermin, why don't
you take this medicine?

360
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,640
You'll feel better.

361
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,800
Put it down.

362
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,840
I hope this nightmare
is over when I wake up.

363
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,280
Dear, you go inside.

364
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,439
I have a small business
I need to take care of.

365
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,680
Okay, Nezir.

366
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,360
Okay.

367
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,839
I let you know that Ateş was leaving

368
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,920
the house, why didn't you warn Haydar?

369
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,240
I wanted to but I oculdn't make it.

370
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,080
Why do I get the feeling that you're lying?

371
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,120
Really?

372
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,680
That's interesting coming
from a liar as yourself.

373
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,240
Believe whatever you want, Aslı.

374
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,240
I don't trust you at all, Nezir.

375
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,800
You're an excuse for a man.

376
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,359
Shush.

377
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,839
Watch your words.

378
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
What if I don't?

379
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,880
When did you forget I hold all the strings?

380
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,800
Stop threatening me.

381
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,680
You should watch your step, then.

382
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,280
If you want your secret
exposed, the tables will turn.

383
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,920
If I sink, I'll take you down with me.

384
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,960
Let's give it a try, shall we?

385
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,240
We'll see then, who has more to lose.

386
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,320
Would you look at that? Another threat.

387
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,240
All of this sounds impossible to believe.

388
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,760
It's like I'm in a
neverending nightmare, Demet.

389
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,760
Mercan, everything will
be okay. Don't worry.

390
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,360
Nothing is ever okay.
It's as if time stood still.

391
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,240
How are you?

392
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,680
How do you think I am?

393
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,320
I'm doing horribly, as you can imagine.

394
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,840
Try to remain positive.

395
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,559
They'll release your father after the

396
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,520
prosecution gets his testimony, you'll see.

397
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,560
They have concrete evidence, as well.

398
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,480
Yes, I talked to the attorney.

399
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,840
I hope so, too.

400
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,439
I mean, my dad couldn't
have done something like this.

401
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,400
There must be a misundertanding.

402
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,560
Definitely.

403
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Mercan.

404
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,720
I'm always here for you.

405
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,440
I'll be here for you until the day I die.

406
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,120
If the Karahan family gets to
you, all you need to do is tell me.

407
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,440
I'll do anything I can
to protect you from them.

408
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,400
You're in the wrong place
at the wrong time, Nezir.

409
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,760
I didn't want to get in to a
fight today but here we are.

410
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,560
Do the smart thing and just leave.

411
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,320
I'm not going anywhere.

412
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,120
Mercan needs me.

413
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,920
My wife doesn't need anyone else but me.

414
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,360
Especially you.

415
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,040
Please, don't do this today.

416
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,880
Nezir, let's go.

417
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,280
Nezir! Let's go, please.

418
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,440
Okay, champ, calm down. Everything's fine.

419
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,320
You lose all senses when you
see that man, just calm down.

420
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,000
Didn't you hear what he said?

421
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,720
She needs him?

422
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,759
He's always getting in our way.

423
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,519
You're right about that.

424
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,759
He's like a boomerang, he keeps

425
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,360
coming back the more we throw him out.

426
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,080
I've had enough with your
temper, could you calm down already?

427
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,439
Give it a rest, pull it together.

428
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,600
We've had one problem after
another since the morning.

429
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,680
You're right.

430
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,880
Of course, I'm right.

431
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,719
I'm sorry about the punch.

432
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,400
That was out of line. If I
were you I'd throw two, not one.

433
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,799
So, you deserved it?

434
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,880
It's more so that I tried to get
punched than to have deserved it.

435
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,880
I know.

436
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,160
Still, don't do that again.

437
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,880
If you lose yourself, we all will.

438
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,680
I feel torn lately, Cemal.

439
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,480
Sometimes I'm Ateş,

440
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
sometimes Tahir.

441
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,560
Ateş says burn it all to the ground,

442
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,480
Tahir stops him.

443
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,239
I trust your heart and your judgement.

444
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,239
Even if you feel lost,
you'll figure it out somehow.

445
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,000
You always have, so far.

446
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
I'm not so sure, Cemal.

447
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't know if I could find my
way again, if I relived everything.

448
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,840
I really thought about shooting him,
when I had that gun pointed at Haydar.

449
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,520
Then, I remembered my mother's words.

450
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,080
She would tell me not to hurt even an ant.

451
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,040
She would tell me any life I took now,

452
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,880
would one day become a chain on my ankles.

453
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,200
Then...

454
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,960
Then, her eyes.

455
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,040
When she stood before her father,

456
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,720
the fear in her eyes.

457
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,280
She didn't fear for her life,

458
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,680
but for her father.

459
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,480
How can a person look so
brave even when she's terrified?

460
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,920
Well, of course. It's her
father even he's a criminal.

461
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,240
You put yourself in her shoes,
that's really tough, Ateş.

462
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,440
What would you have done?

463
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,360
Thank you.

464
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,680
What are you doing here?

465
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,400
Dad would always ask me that
question, when he saw me standing here.

466
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,320
He would stand over me,
just as you are right now.

467
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,560
I would insist on coming to the lake, he'd

468
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,800
never let me because I was sick, of course.

469
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,480
I was always ill growing up in my mansion

470
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,920
I only had Eylül and Tahir.

471
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,560
Then, I had no one when they left.

472
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,680
I think a child shouldn't
have to grow up alone.

473
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,720
But I have to hand it to them,

474
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,360
they always protected me.

475
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,200
I wish none of us had
to go through any of this.

476
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,680
Especially my dad.

477
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,880
He would keep watch over me.

478
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,200
Why are you telling me all of this?

479
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,600
So you understand me.

480
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,600
I'm paying my debt to them right now.

481
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,679
That's why I married you.

482
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,280
That's why I'm putting
up with this torment.

483
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,240
Don't touch my family.

484
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
You're asking the impossible of me.

485
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,600
I wouldn't want to be
the reason for your tears.

486
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,080
Ooh, bring it to me, my dear
sister. Is that sweet or salty, Çiçek?

487
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,320
It's sweet.

488
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,880
These are really good, Çiçek.

489
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,240
Enjoy, brother.

490
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,680
Malik?

491
00:42:41,681 --> 00:42:42,879
Good evening.

492
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,359
Malik, brother, welcome. Get
yourself a chair from over there.

493
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,600
Come, have a seat.

494
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,440
That's my brother.

495
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,679
I'll get you some tea, myself.

496
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,000
Thank you, brother.

497
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,040
How's it going, Malik? Did you finish up?

498
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,840
Yeah, I just got done with
work, I thought I'd come see Berat.

499
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,640
How are you doing?

500
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,960
We're fine, just having some
evening tea. You should have some too.

501
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,960
Enjoy.

502
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,480
Have some cookies too, they're sweet.

503
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,240
Çiçek made them.

504
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,480
Is that so?

505
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,560
Here you go.

506
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,680
Thanks, brother.

507
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880
Enjoy.
Thanks.

508
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,880
Have you heard anything about Mr. Haydar?

509
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,560
No, it's not certain if
he'll be released or not.

510
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
So they say.

511
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:44,320
If the allegations are true, it's horrible.

512
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,840
That's an awful crime.

513
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
And I've been paid with that money.

514
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,600
So have we, Malik.

515
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,000
We've been here since childhood,
I spent my entire life here.

516
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
That's true.
Mom?

517
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,960
Huh?

518
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,840
Why aren't you saying anything?

519
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,880
What could I say?

520
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,280
Neither the crime nor the
punishment is any of my business.

521
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,800
I feel sorry the most for Mercan.

522
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,120
She's an honest and hard working girl.

523
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,520
Mom?

524
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,080
There was a story you used
to tell us when we were little.

525
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,520
You mean the story about the orphan
boy and the evil merchant, right?

526
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yes, exactly.

527
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,600
Why don't you tell it again?

528
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,440
Once upon a time, there was
a wealthy but evil merchant.

529
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,320
He had a lot of money but no mercy.

530
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,080
He had a store and he made a lot of money.

531
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,439
One day an orphan boy with big, sweet eyes

532
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,000
walked into this merchant's store.

533
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,880
He showed him the three pennies he had,

534
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,520
he told the merchant that was the
last of his money left from his mother,

535
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,960
and asked to buy some flour.

536
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,120
The merchant, once he was the
money, looked down on the boy and said,

537
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,640
"You can't even buy dust with
that money, now get out of here!"

538
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,080
The boy, as he was leaving
the store, tripped and fell.

539
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,440
He knocked over the bag
of flour as he was falling.

540
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,200
The flour was spread all over the floor.

541
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,600
The merchant, seeing what
happened, turned to the boy and said,

542
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,320
"I don't clean up after beggars,
clean this and get out of here!"

543
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,640
The bystanders took pity
on the boy, hearing this.

544
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,480
Many years went by, and the merchant's

545
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,520
business started to struggle.

546
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,719
His goods were stolen, his ship sank

547
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,959
and he had to shut down his store.

548
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,920
He ended up hungry, on the streets.

549
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,960
After many years had passed,
the merhcant went back to his old

550
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,080
neighborhood and saw a new bakery
opened where his store used to be.

551
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,680
The bakery was prosperous.

552
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,920
Many people were going in and
out, shopping at the bakery.

553
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,919
The merchant, hungry and destitute, stepped
in front of the bakery, looked inside

554
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,680
and was shocked to see

555
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,359
that orphan boy he didn't give flour to and

556
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,880
kicked out was standing after the register.

557
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,480
He recognized the boy from his big eyes.

558
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,400
He looked into his eyes and
the boy recognized him too.

559
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,560
The boy asked, "Are you not
the evil merchant who wouldn't

560
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,320
give me flour and made me
clean up the spilled flour?"

561
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,720
He gave the man some
warm bread, still steaming.

562
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,200
He said, "You once had money but no mercy,

563
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,200
now I both have money
and a heart full of gold."

564
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,200
That's how the story goes.

565
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,680
That's a lovely story.

566
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,200
You told it really well.

567
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,319
Thank you, Mrs. Binnaz.

568
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,680
Thank you, dear.

569
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:13,240
Is that evil merchant Mr. Haydar?

570
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,720
I don't know that much, son.

571
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,879
We can't tell who is
evil and who is merciful.

572
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,000
We can only know about our own hearts.

573
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,120
Come on, have some cookies.

574
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,080
Let me have one of those.

575
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,400
Enjoy, everyone.

576
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,039
"I'm paying my debt to them,
that's why I married you.

577
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,600
That's why I'm putting
up with this torment."

578
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,960
What are you doing?

579
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,200
Kindness.

580
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,800
You fell asleep with the
book open in your hands.

581
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,400
Some people don't appreciate
kindness, I suppose.

582
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,000
Thank you.

583
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,960
Are you okay?

584
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,640
I'm fine.

585
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,920
Thank you. You saved me from falling.

586
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,200
Are you okay, dear?
I'm fine, mom.

587
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,000
Good morning.

588
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,840
Excuse me.

589
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,120
Yes?

590
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,520
Hello, Mr. Ateş.

591
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,559
Sorry to disturb you
so early in the morning.

592
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,960
I just need your signature
for the tender file.

593
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,000
You told me to remind you.

594
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,440
Are we missing anything?

595
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,640
No, everything's complete, the
only thing missing is your signature.

596
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,880
I can send the file to
your house, if you wish.

597
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,200
Hello?

598
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,799
Mr. Ateş?

599
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,280
Are you there?

600
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,120
You don't need to send it,

601
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,520
I'll stop by within the day and sign it.

602
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,799
Good morning.

603
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,200
Good morning, I have good news for you.

604
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,440
They're releasing your father.

605
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,960
Are you serious?

606
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,240
When will they release my dad?

607
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,960
You turned out to be
such a shameless woman!

608
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,680
I've warned you many
times, told you to end it!

609
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,759
But you didn't listen. You're
still giving Malik hope, aren't you?

610
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,680
No, I'm not...

611
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:10,560
Don't lie to me! I know
very well what you're doing.

612
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,360
I don't want to see you
anywhere near Malik, okay?

613
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,560
Or your mom will hear about everything.

614
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,320
You told me to break up with him and I did.

615
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,799
What more do you want from me?

616
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,440
It's not enough you break up with him,

617
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,440
you'll help me get together with him.

618
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,280
You've got to be kidding me.

619
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,239
That's off limits. I'm not going to
help you get together with the man I love.

620
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,280
Okay, as you wish.

621
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,456
Your mom and brother are at the house,
I'll go talk to them right now if you want.

622
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,519
Enough!

623
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,640
That's enough! I've had
enough of your threats.

624
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,720
What's going on here?

625
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,560
Zehra can tell you what's going on.

626
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,520
Mom.

627
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,120
What is it, dear?

628
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,720
They released Haydar.

629
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,400
Oh no.

630
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,600
What about Ateş?

631
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,240
How will we stop him?

632
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,760
Ateş, son.

633
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,759
Son, Haydar is...

634
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,840
I know.

635
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,280
Ateş.

636
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,520
Later!

637
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,520
What's going on, tell me.

638
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,760
Haydar proved he wasn't
in Istanbul on those dates.

639
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,080
It turns out, he didn't do it.

640
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,399
A gun under Rıza's name was found,

641
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,040
they're investigating that right now.

642
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,920
All the files in the house have Rıza's

643
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,920
signature, this is all we know so far.

644
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,480
That doesn't mean Haydar is innocent.

645
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,240
His hands too, are dirty.

646
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,600
I have no doubts about that.

647
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,640
Ateş.

648
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,480
Brother, let's just go
out, you'll clear your head.

649
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,080
He'll be here soon, I don't
want him to spoil your day.

650
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,320
No.

651
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,560
If Haydar has been released, I have
to square my account with him first.

652
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,080
Hello, dear viewers. We're in
front of Mr. Haydar's house right now.

653
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,600
Everyone here is waiting
to hear what happened.

654
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,480
Did you see that?

655
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,000
They've gathered like a
mob, barking like dogs.

656
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,200
But I know what to do. I'll make that
man who has cause me all this trouble pay.

657
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,840
I'll be his punishment.

658
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,119
The enemy waits in ambush.

659
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,160
If you don't make him
pay, he will make you.

660
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,240
Ateş is catching up to me.

661
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,200
I escaped narrowly now, but I
may not be so lucky next time.

662
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,520
That's why we need to get rid of Ateş.

663
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,160
As soon as possible.

664
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,880
You're right.

665
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,640
Let's take him down at the first chance.

666
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,680
I'm listening.

667
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,000
Haydar Yıldırım is approaching
the house, Mr. Cemal.

668
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,600
Okay.

669
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,319
What is it?

670
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,040
It's nothing important, don't worry.

671
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,880
Is Haydar here?

672
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,279
Don't think you're free.

673
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,520
You'll always feel my breath on your neck.

674
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,160
It doesn't matter what you
say, I'm free, I've acquitted.

675
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,320
I know very well what
kind of person you are.

676
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,200
I'll make sure everyone else
finds out as well, don't worry.

677
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,520
My dad has been acquitted
in a court of law.

678
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,320
That is the truth as long
as the opposite is proven.

679
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,800
Your truth is just a lie.

680
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,080
One day, you'll regret ever
believing this man you call your father.

681
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,080
You'll feel ashamed for supporting him.

682
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,160
I told you this before,
I'm after the truth.

683
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,240
If the truth is as you tell it,

684
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,120
I'll be the one to face
my dad and make him pay.

685
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,760
But now, it's time for your truth.

686
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,879
I'll figure out what you're hiding in your

687
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,840
past, who you are and
what you want from us.

688
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,920
I'll expose all your secrets.

689
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,800
You should definitely do that.

690
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,320
But while you're after my secrets,
what about what's right under your nose?

691
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,480
I'll do anything to protect my
family from you, Ateş Karahan.

692
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,080
Everything will change now.

693
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,360
For everyone.

694
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,560
That's a promise.

695
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,080
Everyone will find out what
kind of a man your father is.

696
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,400
I'll do it.

697
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:37,360
When that time comes, I'll have no mercy.

698
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,480
Because your father's crimes
don't deserve any mercy.

699
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,240
I'll protect my family.

700
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,480
From everyone.

701
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,159
Especially from your rage.

702
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,040
I'll do whatever it takes.

703
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,600
You already are.

704
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:09,280
You protected them knowing
fully that they're guilty.

705
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,120
Tell me something I don't know.

706
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,280
What is this?

707
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,080
This USB drive belonged to your uncle.

708
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,720
Why did you have this?

709
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,160
I know nothing about that drive.

710
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,559
All of your father and
uncle's dirty business.

711
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,200
All of the files were here, in your
hands. It was in your jewelry box.

712
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,760
What happened to your sense of
justice, your mightier than thou attitude?

713
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,000
You got dirty really fast.

714
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,120
I'm telling you, I didn't know.
It's my first time seeing it.

715
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,200
Why did you have it, if it's not yours?

716
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,360
I don't know! I'm
telling you it's not mine.

717
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,920
Why would I hide such a thing?

718
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,200
My dad was acquitted, what
are you questioning, still?

719
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,720
This doesn't justify your hiding evidence.

720
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,320
What if we hadn't found it?

721
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,520
What if Haydar was found guilty?

722
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,880
You can't manipulate
everything in your favor.

723
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,119
You're guilty as a family.

724
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,959
I didn't hide anything.

725
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,560
I'm telling you it's not
mine, what don't you understand?

726
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,400
Wait a minute, hold on.

727
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,679
Were you the ones who leaked
information to the press?

728
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,400
Of course we were.

729
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,320
I can't believe it.

730
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,680
How could you do this?

731
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,560
We did it, so what?

732
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,879
The point is not that
we gave this to the press,

733
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,040
it's your father and
uncle's dirty business.

734
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,680
And your hiding it.

735
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,880
Look, I won't bother trying
to explain myself to you.

736
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,920
Believe whatever you want, I don't care.

737
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,240
But there is something I need to tell you,

738
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,560
if I really had this, I
would've gone to the police,

739
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,480
instead of executing with
extreme prejudice like you have.

740
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,479
This is what you always do.

741
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,560
You always speak from behind shadows.

742
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,800
You're always making judgements.

743
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,080
But your identity is a secret.

744
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,480
Your past is unknown,

745
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,480
if you remain in the dark as much,
you're either a coward or a criminal.

746
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,359
But don't worry. I'll step into that

747
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,800
darkness, and figure out who you are.

748
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,560
You've spoken so well,

749
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,880
but do you even know who your family is?

750
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,760
Their past, for instance?

751
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,999
Let me give you some advice, before

752
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,960
you look into me, stop by them first.

753
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,280
"But don't worry. I'll step into that
darkness and figure out who you are."

754
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,640
Did you hide this in my room?

755
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,760
What are you talking about?

756
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,880
Why are you coming into
my room without knocking?

757
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:11,840
For this.

758
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,400
Did you put this in my room?

759
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,840
Your dad is a murderer and
you're paranoid, I suppose?

760
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,600
I have nothing to do with that.

761
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,640
Are you sure?

762
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,599
I remember some other slanders of yours.

763
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,360
I haven't forgotten about
your lie about my poisoning you.

764
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,560
Or your lie about me strangling you.

765
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,840
You've invaded our house like a nightmare.

766
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,719
I'll expose the dark side of all of
you, why you're tormenting us in this way.

767
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,520
Why didn't you just die?

768
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,360
You'll leave this house not just
because the 187 days are up but

769
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,640
because I've kicked you out.

770
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,480
Don't you dare.

771
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,440
At most, you'll talk my
ear off just as you are now.

772
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,000
Get out of my room!

773
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,480
This is not your room!

774
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,440
It's not your house either and
it never will be, do you hear me?

775
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,440
Mercan was here, we couldn't talk.

776
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,599
We couldn't finish talking, I
don't like unfinished business.

777
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,080
I'll end it one way or another.

778
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,360
Hurry up, then!

779
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,360
You may not have the time.

780
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,720
I wasn't born yesterday,

781
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,959
Haydar Yıldırım is a mountain.

782
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,919
I won't go down with a couple of blows.

783
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,720
You could only burn me
as big a man as you are.

784
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,600
Then I won't be a flame but a dynamite.

785
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,800
I won't burn but blow you into pieces!

786
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,440
You may have acquitted yourself
through whatever cahoots,

787
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:44,040
but your scum has covered you from
head to toe, you can't be rid of it.

788
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,400
When the time comes, everyone will
learn what kind of a scum you are.

789
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,640
I'll secure the real justice.

790
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,320
Your case is not closed, Haydar Yıldırım,

791
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,080
it has only just been opened.

792
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,760
Oh, I'm such a klutz.

793
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,360
Sorry, it's my fault.

794
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,400
You came out of nowhere...

795
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,240
I didn't see you.

796
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,599
What happened between you and Zehra?

797
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,480
With Zehra?

798
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,320
Nothing, nothing important.

799
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,640
But it looked important.

800
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,360
Çiçek, just tell me. What happened?

801
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,640
It's none of your business.

802
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,880
You're right.

803
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,800
Who am I to ask?

804
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,440
Malik!

805
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,600
I didn't mean it that way.

806
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:30,880
I just...

807
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,400
No, it's okay. You're right.

808
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,919
I should know my place.

809
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,159
I'm sorry.

810
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,080
I won't meddle in your business again.

811
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,280
Malik...

812
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,240
What's going on?

813
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,680
You can drive.

814
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,080
There's an important
meeting about the tender

815
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,320
at the company, I can't
deal with you right now.

816
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,199
I'm going to the company, anyway.

817
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,440
Let's just go together.

818
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,840
If you don't want me to come
with you, I'll just get a cab.

819
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,760
You're such a troublemaker.

820
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,040
Listen, just as we've discussed,

821
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,840
she'll never get away with it.

822
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,199
She shouldn't.

823
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:25,040
Yes, I'll be right out. When I'm there I'll

824
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,560
show you how to enter, how to reach her.

825
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,320
Mom?

826
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,600
You scared me to death.

827
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,720
What are you up to this time?

828
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,840
I've prepared a wonderful
surprise for Mercan.

829
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,520
What surprise?

830
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,720
Listen to me.

831
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,000
I've done my research...

832
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,760
I... I heard something like a commotion...

833
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,599
You're a grown woman.

834
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,480
Are you not ashamed of
lying or eavesdropping?

835
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,400
Although even murder didn't cause you

836
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,960
shame, this must be nothing for you.

837
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,040
You insolent woman.

838
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,240
Who knows what you're hiding?

839
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,400
I can't look into it,
dealing with my own problems.

840
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,240
Only for now.

841
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,360
Crass woman.

842
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,960
Berat!

843
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,960
Berat, are you home, son?

844
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,080
Where are you Berat?

845
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,319
I'm keeping watch to make sure
he doesn't get into trouble.

846
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,360
I can't tell if I'm a mom or a guard.

847
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,080
What's this?

848
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,960
He's still a child.

849
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,840
What business could you
have with loan sharks?

850
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,559
I don't understand how a person can be so

851
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,360
child-like, so naive
and yet so complicated?

852
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,520
My naive son.

853
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,040
Berat, you're such a child.

854
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,040
My goofy son.

855
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,279
I'll make him pay for what he's done to me.

856
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,679
I still have the strength and the

857
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,200
drive to give a man a good beating.

858
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,760
But you need to help me, Nezir.

859
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,440
If it's about Ateş, always.

860
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,359
I thought 187 days would pass in
the blink of an eye but I was wrong.

861
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,080
It's been a year and a day.

862
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,760
We need to get rid of the Karahan

863
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,680
family immediately, do you understand?

864
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,720
I don't believe a word that guy says.

865
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,680
187 days is a lie, too.

866
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,119
He's going to settle and stay here.

867
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,000
He won't go anywhere.

868
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,520
That's exactly my thought, I
fear that's what's going to happen.

869
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,320
He entered our lives out of
nowhere, took over like a nightmare.

870
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,999
His eyes are always on me, it's as if

871
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,399
he's always planning something, Nezir.

872
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,240
We have plans of our own.

873
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,320
We're not sitting idly by.

874
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,880
Just say the word and we'll
end the Karahan family right now.

875
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,960
How will we do that?

876
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,279
It'll happen, we'll do it.

877
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,400
Just leave it to me.

878
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,640
What are you thinking?

879
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,760
They will not only
leave this house, but I'll

880
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,280
also make them regret
ever stepping in here.

881
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,840
Good to hear.

882
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,480
That sounds good to me.

883
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,880
Good morning to you.

884
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,159
Good morning.

885
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,320
How are you?

886
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,159
We're fine, thank you. How are you?

887
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,640
I'm good too, thank you.

888
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,040
Are there any updates?

889
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,920
No, there aren't any updates right now.

890
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,920
Mr. Ateş, everything is ready
for our tender meeting right now,

891
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,039
it looks like we've got this in the bag.

892
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,919
I know how important this is for you.

893
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,240
Our teams have really put in
the work, everyone worked day and

894
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,759
night, so everything is in line.
You have nothing to worry about.

895
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:15,960
Good to hear.

896
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,240
There are just a couple of pointers, we
can go over them together if you'd like.

897
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:23,720
Mr. Ateş?

898
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,120
Okay, I'll get some coffee first,

899
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,880
then we'll go over all the files together.

900
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,880
Okay.

901
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,200
Sweetheart.

902
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,960
It feels wonderful to see you here.

903
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,040
Working here has been
really good for me too.

904
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,040
Demet, I have a favor to ask of you.

905
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,400
Anything you want, dear.

906
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,000
I want you to take over the interior

907
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,960
design of the "Eylül Hospital Project."

908
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,400
I'm sure you'd be the best for the job.

909
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,080
I want only the best for this project.

910
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,840
Mercan, I'm delighted.

911
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,679
I know how important
this project is for you,

912
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,800
I view it as an honor
that you want me on it.

913
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,840
But...

914
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
But?

915
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,040
I need to talk to Nezir
first, is that okay?

916
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,000
You know, because of what happened.

917
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:30,360
Since he's not a financier
for this project anymore.

918
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,440
You're right.

919
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,760
You should talk to him.

920
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,680
But you should count me on the project.

921
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,080
I'll convince my brother.

922
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,240
That's wonderful.

923
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,120
You shouldn't work alone, though.

924
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,120
Uhm... Burak?

925
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,680
You'll work together
with Burak on the project.

926
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,000
He'll help you.

927
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,760
Yes, of course. I'd love to.

928
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,799
Let's get some coffee.

929
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,800
Sure.

930
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:37,840
Berat!

931
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,160
Take a break, son.

932
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:43,080
You've been jumping around
like a fish since the morning.

933
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,280
I got dizzy.

934
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,079
Here we go, yes. It's done.

935
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,720
It's finished.

936
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,400
Wait, let me see.

937
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,639
It looks good.

938
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,280
Give it to me, that's enough.

939
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,400
Okay, I'm done.

940
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,680
Mom, let me tell you this.

941
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,640
You know,

942
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,600
now that the debt business is dealt
with, I feel like a newborn baby.

943
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,120
I finished up all the work too.

944
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,399
It's done.

945
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,640
Thank god.

946
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,960
I burned my tongue, mom. Why is it so hot?

947
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,200
Son, drink slowly.

948
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,400
The tea is scorching hot.

949
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,400
What's up with that?

950
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,240
Who's it from?

951
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,599
Tell me it's not something bad!

952
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,839
Mom, it's from a friend.

953
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:53,399
Why are you geting so
worked up over everything?

954
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,520
Calm down.

955
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,440
I remember what you put me through.

956
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,920
Have your own child, then
you'll understand why I get scared.

957
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,640
Swear it's nothing bad.

958
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:06,040
I swear it's nothing bad, mom.

959
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,759
Thank god, we have no money issues,

960
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,679
no debt problems anymore.

961
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,280
I'm relieved.

962
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,160
Berat.
Yes?

963
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:25,479
Berat, when I go to bed at
night and put my head down, I

964
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:30,360
think and I think about who
could have paid off our debt.

965
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,560
Who would do such a
thing at a time like this?

966
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,920
No one would give a single
penny to anyone nowadays.

967
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,520
Who would come and pay off our
mountain of a debt in one go?

968
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,800
You're right, mom. I'm
really curious about it too.

969
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,560
I don't understand how it happened.

970
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,520
Should I go and ask?

971
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,360
No way, you won't set
foot into that neighborhood.

972
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:56,960
Swear to me.

973
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,160
Mom, don't you think this oath
taking business is getting out of hand?

974
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,920
I can't keep swearing for everything.

975
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,320
God, give me patience.

976
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:11,120
Okay, mom. I swear, for this
and that and on whatever you want.

977
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,679
As long as you're not worried.

978
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,000
Have some of these cookies.

979
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,080
Berat?
Yes?

980
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,240
I know who paid it off.

981
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:28,720
Who?

982
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,600
It could be Mr. Cemal.

983
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,079
He knows about this type of stuff.

984
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,800
And he's a brave and honest man.

985
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,199
If he heard about this debt business from

986
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,759
somewhere, he may have
gone and paid it off.

987
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,399
You should go and thank him
some time, it would only be right.

988
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,160
You're right, mom.

989
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:48,839
If it's anyone we know,
it must be Mr. Cemal.

990
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,376
He must've heard about it and paid it off.

991
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,439
He must've handled it.

992
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,760
I should go and thank
him. I'm really thankful-

993
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,719
Ugh, my leg!

994
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:00,239
I burned myself, mom. It hurts really bad.

995
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:04,280
You clumsy man! Go put it
under water, Berat, you klutz!

996
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,279
What do I do with him?

997
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:09,920
Do we have to burn everytime,
Berat? God, give me patience.

998
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:21,520
I was looking over the details
for the hospital project,

999
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,920
and I... Mercan?

1000
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,360
Are you okay?

1001
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,640
It's not like you could feel
fine with that man around.

1002
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,439
I don't understand him at all, Demet.

1003
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,120
I can't figure him out.

1004
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,640
Is he good or evil, cruel or merciful?

1005
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,600
Is he fire or ice?

1006
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,920
Somehow, he knows everything about us.

1007
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,000
But when we look him and research him,

1008
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,600
we reach a big void or
hit a wall at some point.

1009
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:00,800
Nothing.

1010
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,360
There is practically
nothing regarding his past.

1011
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,640
You know what that means, right?

1012
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,440
Yes.

1013
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:16,360
He has such a past that
warrants absolute secrecy.

1014
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,239
It doesn't matter if he
wants to hide, what's important

1015
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,240
is if you want to uncover his secrets.

1016
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,600
Of course, I want to.

1017
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,520
Well, then, what's the problem?

1018
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,080
Are you not with this man all the time,

1019
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,960
living in the same house, working together?

1020
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,479
Mercan, I know you very well.

1021
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:44,000
There's nothing you can't do
once you put your mind to it.

1022
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,000
You'll do it, if you wish to.

1023
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,560
This is a mystery that has many loops.

1024
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,640
But I'll figure that mystery
out, one way or another. You'll see.

1025
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,640
Exactly. That's what I'm talking about.

1026
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,520
You need to start somewhere.

1027
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,760
Why don't you search through his room?

1028
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,720
There has to be something.
Some sort of clue, a trace.

1029
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,719
I have, before.

1030
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,200
I found nothing.

1031
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,640
Maybe there is something now.

1032
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:21,280
They've been so
preoccupied lately. Why don't

1033
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,920
you try your chance
again while they're busy?

1034
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,680
What do you have to lose?

1035
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,840
This is it, Mercan. It's the perfect time.

1036
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,160
Right now?

1037
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,720
Yes, Mercan. Right now.

1038
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,520
He doesn't see anything other
than that tender right now.

1039
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,240
Come on.

1040
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,920
Yes, dear, it's true.

1041
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,840
Haydar has been acquitted.

1042
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,040
It was just some people trying to
slander our name out of jealousy.

1043
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,760
But we're pure as snow.

1044
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,600
We're free, thankfully.

1045
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,680
Our enemies should watch their step now.

1046
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,400
Now it's your turn.

1047
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,040
What do you mean how is it your turn?

1048
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,080
You should give us the honor award.

1049
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,120
We've been friends for years.

1050
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,640
We've overcome serious hardships,
it'd be like a message to people, too.

1051
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:42,080
And you would be securing
next year's payment.

1052
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,000
If you say so, Nermin.

1053
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:49,120
How's Mrs. Müzeyyen doing,
give her my best, will you?

1054
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:54,520
As if I would give her anyone's best.

1055
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,280
Of course, dear. I'll
relay your message to her.

1056
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,439
Mrs. Müzeyyen made a considerable donation

1057
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,520
to our organization recently, Nermin.

1058
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,400
We'll give this year's honor award to her.

1059
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,799
I think you would agree
that it would be out

1060
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,040
of place to give the award to anyone else.

1061
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,600
I'm sorry.

1062
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:36,519
You want the honor award?
All you'll receive is dust.

1063
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,160
You can't beat me at my own game.

1064
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,720
Demet, why did I let you
convince me into doing this?

1065
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,640
It'd be the cherry on top if I got caught.

1066
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,080
Like a man who hides his whole past
would leave any sort of clue here.

1067
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,000
He has to have left something somewhere.

1068
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,920
He's human, after all.

1069
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:17,160
Although, he seems more
like a machine than human.

1070
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,680
Demet, you're going to be the death of me.

1071
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,560
Well, now that I'm here, I
should at least give it a real try.

1072
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,560
There are sounds coming
from your office, Ateş

1073
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,240
What sounds?

1074
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,200
What's this?

1075
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,560
Hello, Nezir?

1076
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,520
I remember this scene from somewhere.

1077
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,280
Yes.

1078
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,320
You caught me once before.

1079
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,440
What are you doing, yet again?

1080
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,680
Are you looking through the tender file?

1081
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:30,360
No, I wasn't going through those...

1082
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,960
I came into your office
to find something on you.

1083
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,800
There's nothing about me
in the file you're holding.

1084
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,560
It's the tender file.

1085
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:00,920
Yes, so it is.

1086
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,440
I told you once before,

1087
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,400
don't try in vain.

1088
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,840
You'll find nothing,
if I don't want you to.

1089
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,120
What's the reason for this mystery?

1090
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,040
It's just my style.

1091
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,800
If I ever see you go into my room without

1092
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,360
permission again, I won't remain so calm.

1093
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,960
You will, you can be sure of that.

1094
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,120
I won't leave you alone until
I find what I'm looking for.

1095
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,520
Then, we'll have to replay
this scene many times more.

1096
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,040
Is that what you want?

1097
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,840
Have you told our parents about me?

1098
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,200
"Let this necklace be a
symbol of our love, Çiçek.

1099
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:01,239
Don't take it off, as long as you love me.

1100
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:05,440
You'll take it off and throw it
away, when you no longer love me.

1101
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:10,120
The day I don't see this around your
neck, I'll know that it's all over."

1102
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,960
I'll love you until the day I die, Malik.

1103
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,160
I'll wear this until my last breath.

1104
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,519
Çiçek? Are you in your room, dear?

1105
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,520
Çiçek?

1106
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:43,800
What are you doing, dear?

1107
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,440
Nothing.

1108
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,960
Why do you look so sad?

1109
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,840
Did someone from the house say something?

1110
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,560
Is it Mrs. Müzeyyen?

1111
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,040
It's nothing, mom.

1112
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,239
Listen, dear.

1113
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:15,920
Back in the day, we couldn't
tell our moms anything.

1114
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,240
There were walls between us.

1115
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,600
They would shut us up the
moment we opened our mouths.

1116
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,840
I may have scared you off a little bit.

1117
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:34,039
Don't you mind me, this is
not the right way to do things.

1118
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:38,120
A person should tell their
problems to their mother first.

1119
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:44,320
A mom should be both your
consolence and your power.

1120
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,640
I hit those walls many times, dear.

1121
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:58,239
And then, I promised myself my
children wouldn't be like me, that

1122
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:02,960
they wouldn't be bruised and
wounded, alone with their problems.

1123
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:06,839
Maybe it's not the time now,

1124
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:10,360
you tell me whenever you want to tell me.

1125
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,240
Your mom is always with you.

1126
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:20,120
Both my heart and my ears
are always open for you.

1127
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,960
I don't want you to ever feel alone, dear.

1128
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:31,480
If there's one thing in this
life, that leaves a person helpless

1129
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,560
İt's loneliness.

1130
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:40,279
You're not alone, you always
have your mom, my dear daughter.

1131
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,000
Come here, come.

1132
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,520
I'm here, my beautiful girl.

1133
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,800
My precious daughter.

1134
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:07,680
Here, here. Enough
with the long face, dear.

1135
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,640
My beautiful daughter.

1136
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,720
I can't stand to see you cry.

1137
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,080
I'll be right out.

1138
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:23,480
Okay, dear.

1139
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:44,400
I wonder if my brother
will be okay with this.

1140
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,640
It's beautiful.

1141
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,520
I hope it goes well.

1142
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,640
What's got my sister in such a good mood?

1143
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,240
It's not a secret project
or something, I suppose.

1144
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:28,840
Of course it's not secret.

1145
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,600
What is it, then?

1146
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,440
Tell me.

1147
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:40,000
Mercan asked me to work with her
on the "Eylül Hospital Project".

1148
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,640
She said she couldn't
trust anyone else with it.

1149
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,920
She's right to feel
that way, don't you think?

1150
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,720
You know how diligent I am.

1151
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:56,800
Nezir, I'd like to be on this
project, if you're okay with it.

1152
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,880
It's also really important for me to be

1153
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,760
of support to Mercan at a time like this.

1154
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,880
But I'd understand if
you didn't want me to.

1155
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,560
Ateş is on this project too, after all.

1156
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:14,040
And you hate him which
you have every right to!

1157
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:20,080
But Nezir, this is Mercan's project.

1158
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,880
Please be understanding.

1159
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:28,400
Nezir?

1160
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:36,399
I'm in such a good mood today,
I'd be fine with whatever.

1161
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:40,319
And it's two of my favorite
women working together,

1162
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,079
I have to be supportive.

1163
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,200
Really?

1164
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,040
Thank you so much.

1165
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,320
Get back to work.

1166
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:21,000
By the way, Ms. Mercan, I've worked on
the files you asked me to and finished

1167
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:24,519
them, if there's anything else you'd like
me to do, I'll get them done right away.

1168
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,280
Okay, Yaşar, I'll let you know.

1169
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:31,160
You vile people! Where's my son?

1170
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:32,919
Why did you kill him?

1171
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:35,039
Ma'am, please calm
down, what are you doing?

1172
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,160
Yaşar, it's okay.

1173
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:40,920
You took my son from me, and you
go around as if nothing happened.

1174
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,479
You evil people!

1175
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:47,919
Ma'am, could you please calm
down, I understand your pain but...

1176
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,160
What do you think you understand,
you can't understand my pain!

1177
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,719
My son doesn't even have a grave!

1178
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:57,320
You killed him and didn't
even give me his body!

1179
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:05,200
You're walking on the body of my child!

1180
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:11,160
You took him and took his life,
just so you could live in prosperity!

1181
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,840
You evil people!

1182
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:31,960
These wealthy people will save
themselves, we have to fend for our own.

1183
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,119
But I'm not going to stand idly by anymore.

1184
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,400
They stole our lives.

1185
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,720
If the justice system won't
make them pay, then we will.

1186
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,120
I'm telling you because
we share the same pain.

1187
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,280
I went to face her a few days ago.

1188
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:53,720
Her father stole our lives and she
walks around as if nothing happened.

1189
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,440
The least they could do is be ashamed.

1190
01:45:56,480 --> 01:46:00,279
Go face her and ask her
to take accountability.

1191
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:03,760
That girl is just as guilty as her father.

1192
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:07,720
You're right.

1193
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,039
No one's pain is ever accounted for.

1194
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,920
Thank you so much.

1195
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,239
I'm going to shame her.

1196
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:18,240
She ruined my life, so
I'll ruin her reputation.

1197
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,760
You're all murderers!

1198
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,280
What's going on here?

1199
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:35,320
Both you and your father!

1200
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,159
Ma'am, come with me, please.

1201
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,000
You murderers!

1202
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,040
You're all murderers!

1203
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,840
Murdereres!

1204
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:53,600
Everyone, get back to work!

1205
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:08,200
He can't keep himself away from her.

1206
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,560
Hello, Malik.

1207
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:38,120
Miss Zehra?

1208
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:42,359
How's it going, Malik? Did
you have something to say to me?

1209
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:43,440
Yes.

1210
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,360
Go ahead, I'm listening.

1211
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,839
I have something very important to ask you.

1212
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,440
Please tell me the truth.

1213
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,320
I never tell lies anyway, that's sinful.

1214
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,640
Is there a problem between you and Çiçek?

1215
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:59,600
I mean, she's been really upset
lately, she's acting strange.

1216
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,719
It's not only lately she's acting
strange, she's always like that toward me.

1217
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:05,840
I've been trying to befriend
her since coming here but

1218
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:09,200
every time, I'm either faced
with criticism or a blank face.

1219
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,800
Çiçek is not that type of person.

1220
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:13,920
Something happened, you had an argument.

1221
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,240
Did you say something to upset her?

1222
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,959
Of course, you think I'm the problem.

1223
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,920
It's okay, I'm used to it.

1224
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,920
This is how it always has been everywhere.

1225
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:25,440
Must be because I have no family.

1226
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,640
I have no one to stand up for me.

1227
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:30,760
That's why they always
push me around, bully me.

1228
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,000
Everything is always my fault.

1229
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,760
It's so easy to put blame on people.

1230
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,640
It's fine, I'll be the
bad one for you, too.

1231
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:41,680
What can I say? It must be my fate.

1232
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:45,279
Okay, I'm sorry. Don't be
upset, I didn't mean it that way.

1233
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,920
I'm just trying to understand.

1234
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,320
I wish I had someone to understand me, too.

1235
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,880
I'm all alone.

1236
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,480
Please, Malik.

1237
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:02,720
Give me a moment's peace,
just for a moment console me.

1238
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,560
Okay, okay, Ms. Zehra.

1239
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,680
Thank you.

1240
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:23,880
Thank you.

1241
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:38,040
I will never be able to forget
that woman's face, her desperation.

1242
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:42,800
What an incredible pain.

1243
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,800
Losing a child.

1244
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:54,400
Not even having a grave
to cry over, to embrace.

1245
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,960
I wish there was something I could do.

1246
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,880
You got caught in the cross fire.

1247
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:14,600
I'm fine.

1248
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:18,640
I'm not the person who needs
consideration in this situation.

1249
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:22,000
Don't you dare pity me, either.

1250
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:27,480
I'd prefer real animosity
over fake compassion.

1251
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:45,200
Mr. Ateş, you need to look over a
few files for the tender meeting.

1252
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:46,640
I'll be right there.

1253
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,039
Thank you for your
consideration for this tender.

1254
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,720
We've taken your offers into account, and

1255
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,280
we'll reach a conclusion
after deliberation.

1256
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,320
Mr. Mehmet, we can begin if you're ready.

1257
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:47,199
Of course, welcome again.

1258
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,799
We can move on to the deliberation

1259
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:52,880
process based on your closed offers.

1260
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:56,840
We've had offers for this
tender from three companies.

1261
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:03,360
Dağcı Conglomerate, Yıldırım
Conglomerate and Keseroğlu Conglomerate.

1262
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,880
Our first offer is from Dağcı Conglomerate.

1263
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:21,600
The offer this company has
made is for 7 million dollars.

1264
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:28,040
Thank you, Mr. Tahsin.

1265
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:36,200
Next up, we have Yıldırım Conglomerate.

1266
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:47,480
The offer Yıldırım Conglomerate
has made is for 10 million dollars.

1267
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,720
Our last offer is from
Keseroğlu Conglomerate,

1268
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,960
the offer they have made is for...

1269
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,720
10 million and one dollars.

1270
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:22,280
In this case, Keseroğlu
Conglomerate has secured the tender.

1271
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,600
Congratulations, Mr. Nezir.

1272
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,400
Mercan must have told Nezir.

1273
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,960
Wasn't she in your office going
through your files this morning?

1274
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,480
What are you doing, yet again?

1275
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:02,440
Are you going through the tender file?

1276
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:07,240
No, I wasn't going through those...

1277
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:14,000
1 dollar, huh? Mercan goes
into your office and goes

1278
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:18,000
through your stuff on the
day of the tender and now this?

1279
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,920
They're making fun of us.

1280
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:39,960
You...

1281
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,200
You did this.

1282
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,160
Every betrayal has its consequences.

1283
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:51,400
This will have its, too.

1284
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,120
Welcome.

1285
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:07,720
Would you like something?

1286
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,960
I don't want anything.

1287
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:15,800
You're so cheerful today.

1288
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:18,080
Stop joking around.

1289
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:21,800
I don't expect you to
be funny, I expect action.

1290
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,240
Aslı, could you calm down?

1291
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,439
We still have a long way to go

1292
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:28,600
and I'm doing everything I can.

1293
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:33,960
And I will keep doing so as long
as you keep giving me information.

1294
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:37,160
You couldn't manage to do
anything if it weren't for me.

1295
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:42,600
Okay, stop your nagging and
tell me, is there any news?

1296
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,760
I have wonderful news.

1297
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,880
Use this well.

1298
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:56,120
Ateş caught Mercan going
through his office today.

1299
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:57,800
So?

1300
01:57:58,640 --> 01:57:59,960
Here it is.

1301
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:04,400
Information regarding the tender file for

1302
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:07,640
today, Ateş has been
working on this for weeks.

1303
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:12,040
Read it well.

1304
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:15,760
And make your offer based on that.

1305
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,640
And secure the tender.

1306
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,120
Capiche?

1307
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,520
Look, Aslı,

1308
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:28,400
You're either truly evil,

1309
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,880
or really in love.

1310
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:41,640
I have a lot of work to do,
I can't sit around like you.

1311
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:45,400
I think you should work
harder, don't just sit around.

1312
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,600
What's going on?

1313
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,440
Come with me.

1314
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:56,600
What are you doing?

1315
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,840
You’re the one who
told Nezir about the bid.

1316
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,840
How did Nezir know our bid?

1317
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:10,160
I don't know.

1318
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,760
He raised the bid by one
dollar, like he was mocking us.

1319
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:18,480
How would he know without you telling him?

1320
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,360
Why do you blame me for
everything? I told you, I don’t know.

1321
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,080
You don't know, huh?

1322
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:33,600
I caught you in my room on tender day. Then all
this happens, and you expect me to believe you?

1323
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:38,120
I’m going crazy. I
told you, I didn’t do it.

1324
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:41,680
I didn’t even know your bid
amount. How could I tell him?

1325
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:43,720
Don't lie.

1326
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:49,280
You were holding the tender file.

1327
02:01:54,680 --> 02:02:00,600
I didn't hide that I went into
your room to find something about you.

1328
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:03,240
What would I do with the tender file?

1329
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:12,000
I caught you in this room before.

1330
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,960
You couldn't find anything, remember?

1331
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:23,920
You came back, even though you knew
it. And you expect me to believe you?

1332
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:27,080
Well done.

1333
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,920
You did it.

1334
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:33,760
You finally found a way
to stab me in the back.

1335
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:44,480
Choose your words. I’m fed up with you constantly
accusing me without listening or understanding.

1336
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:50,320
It's my fault.

1337
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:54,000
I trusted you.

1338
02:02:55,160 --> 02:03:00,080
I should have changed the bid when I
saw you in this room. It's my fault.

1339
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:07,600
I don't stab anyone in the back.

1340
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:09,520
Including you.

1341
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,280
Despite all the things you’ve done to me.

1342
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:22,440
It’ll come out that I didn’t do it.
The truth always comes out in the end.

1343
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:26,080
The truth always comes out in the end.

1344
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:33,040
Until then, no one knows how many lives will
be hurt, how many innocents will be silenced.

1345
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:39,480
You have no idea how badly I want the remaining
159 days to be over, so I can be rid of you.

1346
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:49,320
I'm so tired of waking up
to a new nightmare everyday.

1347
02:03:52,120 --> 02:03:54,560
I wish I could believe you.

1348
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:40,760
Good job, Nezir.

1349
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:45,560
It’s the first time
we’ve hit Ateş this hard.

1350
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:48,880
We're just getting started.

1351
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:55,960
This is just a warm‑up for Ateş.
I’m going to hit him much harder.

1352
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:58,440
What is on your mind?

1353
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:01,240
You'll know when it's time.

1354
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:03,600
Everything is set.

1355
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:06,920
I won’t give him any room to breathe.

1356
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,000
I can't wait for it.

1357
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:20,400
By the way, how did you know
what Ateş was going to bid?

1358
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,880
I guessed it.

1359
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:31,320
Nice.

1360
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:38,440
I hope your guesses keep guiding
you well enough to bring about his end.

1361
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:41,320
You can be sure about that.

1362
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:45,040
I will finish him.

1363
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,760
No rest until then.

1364
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:33,600
Could Zehra have crossed Malik’s mind?

1365
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:36,560
I expect anything from that snake.

1366
02:06:37,400 --> 02:06:41,400
No, what am I saying? Malik
would never do something like that.

1367
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:43,720
He said he loves me.

1368
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:47,720
Being with another woman
in front of me? No way.

1369
02:06:57,920 --> 02:07:00,040
It's time for a break.

1370
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:02,200
I brought you some tea.

1371
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:04,240
No thanks, I won't have it.

1372
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:16,280
Talking to you felt so good, Malik.
Being left out by everyone is really hard.

1373
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:22,200
Mrs. Müzeyyen is a difficult woman. Since
she isn’t liked here, I wasn’t liked either.

1374
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:27,080
The staff kept their distance from
me, because I was her head servant.

1375
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:31,800
Do you think Mrs. Müzeyyen
is the only reason for that?

1376
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,520
I mean, I have to follow
the orders to survive.

1377
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:42,200
Special blend tea, at least try it?

1378
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:46,600
Thank you so much, I won't, I
just had some. I need to finish this.

1379
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:48,920
Good luck.

1380
02:07:48,921 --> 02:07:50,760
Thank you. You too.

1381
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:07,720
How did you know about Ateş's bid?

1382
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,280
I just guessed it.

1383
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:12,640
I'm not a fool, Nezir. Nobody is.

1384
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:16,160
Your bid made it clear
that you knew Ateş's bid.

1385
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,280
I was expecting congratulations, Mercan.

1386
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:21,600
But you are questioning me.

1387
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:24,160
Remember, we are on the same side.

1388
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,680
I don't intend to take sides with anyone.

1389
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:29,680
And I don't care about who won the tender.

1390
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:34,400
I was under suspicion, Nezir. He
accused me of leaking information to you.

1391
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:35,520
How?

1392
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:38,960
How could he do that?

1393
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:41,959
I'm sorry, I can talk to him.

1394
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:44,080
No. It is not needed.

1395
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:49,320
Instead of blaming you, he
should have taken care of his files.

1396
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:51,560
How did you learn it?

1397
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:53,360
I can't tell you that.

1398
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:56,160
Is someone from the company
giving you information?

1399
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,360
What does it matter?

1400
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:07,720
What matters for us is staying one
step ahead of Ateş and making him lose.

1401
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:10,280
Don't say "us."

1402
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:12,840
I'm being accused of theft.

1403
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:15,040
You need to tell me who did it.

1404
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:30,720
They are probably talking
about their victory.

1405
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:38,840
There are some things to handle.

1406
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:40,880
I had the file left on your desk.

1407
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:42,040
I'll handle it later.

1408
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:43,440
It can't wait.

1409
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:58,640
You don't have the
courage to face me, right?

1410
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:02,720
That's why you go behind my back.

1411
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:08,680
If you think you can take me down with
these little tricks, you’re mistaken.

1412
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:13,080
I don't care about how I win.

1413
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:15,480
I care about the result.

1414
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:18,040
There’s plenty more I’ll take from you.

1415
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,320
This is just the beginning.

1416
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:24,240
The only thing you will
ever take from me is fear.

1417
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:29,920
And you’re already living with it.

1418
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,280
You may have won this game by cheating.

1419
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,760
But this win won’t change the
defeat I have in store for you.

1420
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:45,800
I won the game.

1421
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:48,480
And you are defeated.

1422
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:55,240
If you think I’ve been defeated,
you declared victory too early.

1423
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:43,840
What are these?

1424
02:11:43,841 --> 02:11:49,720
Mrs. Mercan had some family photos framed
and asked me to put them in the living room.

1425
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,840
Okay, get back to work.

1426
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:08,600
One gone, three remain.

1427
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:21,240
What are those?

1428
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:27,080
Whose photographs are those?

1429
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:29,120
Give them to me, now.

1430
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:32,000
Why won’t you let me look?

1431
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:39,960
Here, look.

1432
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,720
You will end up in the trash.

1433
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:51,600
We'll see who ends up in it.

1434
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:13,920
Çiçek.

1435
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:15,720
Çiçek.

1436
02:13:15,721 --> 02:13:18,520
I'm here, I'm here Mrs. Nermin, what is it?

1437
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:23,320
Take this and the ones in the trash.
Clean them and bring them to my room.

1438
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:25,360
Okay, madam.

1439
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:58,680
There is a skip in the footage.

1440
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:02,560
Are these the right footages, Yaşar?

1441
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:04,640
Yes, Mrs. Mercan.

1442
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:19,680
There’s something here. Why is it skipping?

1443
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:22,360
There is a space.

1444
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:26,040
Yes, there is a space. That's
why the record is skipping.

1445
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:32,920
Whatever you do, find out why.
Check other angles if needed.

1446
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:39,280
Don’t worry at all, Mrs. Mercan. I’ll go over everything,
second by second. I’ll find out what happened.

1447
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:45,360
Let's see if this
skipping is a coincidence.

1448
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:50,000
Or if someone is trying to hide themselves.

1449
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:08,720
No, it's not working no matter how I try.
I'll call someone from IT, they'll handle it.

1450
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:10,800
Would you like me to look at it?

1451
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,239
Do you know about this?

1452
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:14,560
A little.

1453
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:47,240
How did you do that? I've been
trying for hours and couldn't do it.

1454
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:49,160
Trade secret.

1455
02:15:57,320 --> 02:16:00,520
You are amazing Burak, thank you so much.

1456
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:05,240
You're welcome. I'm going to my desk, okay?

1457
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:09,360
I'll pick them up.

1458
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:10,160
Let me help.

1459
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:11,360
I got it.

1460
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:16,600
Let me...

1461
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,880
Okay.

1462
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,920
I didn't tell anything to
Nezir, you have to believe me.

1463
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:05,640
I have no reason to believe you.

1464
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:09,680
I know you're blaming me because I went
into your room but that wasn't my intention.

1465
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:20,800
I don't want to listen anymore.

1466
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:31,520
I'll prove to you that I didn't do it.

1467
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:41,240
What is the occasion? You
never used to kiss me like this.

1468
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:46,760
I didn’t use to, but you’ve always
been my most precious, Queen Müzeyyen.

1469
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:52,960
You are the same to me, my girl. If even the tiniest
harm came to you, I’d turn the world upside down.

1470
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:55,160
Of course I know.

1471
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,360
So, tell me, what happened
to cheer you up like this?

1472
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:04,480
Ateş finally started to see
sneaky Mercan's real face.

1473
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:06,600
What did she do again?

1474
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:11,480
There was a tender we had
been working on for a long time.

1475
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:15,240
She leaked the information to Nezir.

1476
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:17,320
We lost it, thanks to her.

1477
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:19,400
What are you saying, dear?

1478
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:22,680
Wait mom, don't get angry.

1479
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:25,040
I think it's better this way.

1480
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:27,520
Ateş will stay away from her now.

1481
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:32,280
Sneaky creature. A chip off the old block

1482
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,560
Aslı.

1483
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,080
Could there be something
between Mercan and Nezir?

1484
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:41,800
I don't know.

1485
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,680
If so, they are hiding it pretty well.

1486
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:50,880
Actually, you can expect
anything from that Mercan.

1487
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:53,880
Still, keep your eyes
wide open in the office.

1488
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:57,240
This Nezir is a very
dangerous man, my dear.

1489
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:03,200
Try to keep your distance
as much as you can.

1490
02:21:05,320 --> 02:21:08,880
I hope you’re not scheming with Nezir.

1491
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:14,840
If Ateş finds out, he won’t forgive you for
collaborating with Nezir, not for shooting Mercan.

1492
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:17,960
Then not even I could save you from him.

1493
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:48,160
Are you sure Mercan did it?

1494
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:50,880
Yes.

1495
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:05,240
So, what hit you harder: Nezir winning the
tender, or Mercan stabbing you in the back?

1496
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:09,400
The issue is not losing the tender.

1497
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:13,400
I got it, brother, I got it.

1498
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:15,880
So, what does Mercan say about it?

1499
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:18,800
She said she didn't do it.

1500
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:21,200
What else could she say?

1501
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:22,840
Maybe she didn't do it?

1502
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:24,880
I caught her in my room.

1503
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,840
She was holding the file.

1504
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:32,920
I have this urge to burn
and destroy everything.

1505
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:36,640
I go crazy thinking about
her collaborating with Nezir.

1506
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:43,400
Brother, have you heard about the
story of the king who was betrayed?

1507
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:51,240
Once upon a time, there was a king who noticed on the
battlefield that the enemy could anticipate his moves.

1508
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:59,360
Returning to his palace, he sought the source of betrayal.
After testing all his commanders, only the queen remained.

1509
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:09,760
The queen failed the test, and the king, in a fit of rage, was about to
kill her, but at the last moment, he spared her and had her imprisoned.

1510
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:13,800
From that day on, he kept
all his strategies secret.

1511
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:21,600
After defeating his enemy, when he interrogated their king, he
realized that the traitor was not the queen, but his chief advisor.

1512
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:26,480
You're saying the traitor
could be one of us, then.

1513
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:28,840
That's not what I'm saying brother.

1514
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:34,680
What I'm saying is, there are a lot of employees
in that company, anyone could have read the file.

1515
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:38,800
Even Nezir and his sister were there,
one of them could have taken the file.

1516
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:47,320
If the king had given in to his rage that day,
he would have lost both his queen and the battle.

1517
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:16,000
I didn't tell Nezir anything,
you have to believe me.

1518
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:27,640
I know you're blaming me because
I went into your room but...

1519
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:30,520
I'll prove to you that I didn't do it.

1520
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:56,520
I'm alone here.

1521
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:01,560
You don't need to listen to the door.

1522
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:03,880
I wasn't listening to the door.

1523
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,040
Okay.

1524
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:21,240
If you're not listening to
the door, why are you here?

1525
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:25,400
I'm here to talk.

1526
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:27,720
About what happened today.

1527
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:36,240
I'm really sorry that you lost the tender.

1528
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:41,720
I didn't even know those
were the tender files.

1529
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:14,560
Are you not listening to me?
