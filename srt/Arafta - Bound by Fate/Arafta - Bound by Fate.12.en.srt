1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,680
If the girl was shot because of your dirty things.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,880
I'm the one who should be asking questions here, not you!

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,280
I'll find out who did this.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,560
Whoever did it will pay the price.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,280
Ever since I've known you,

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,960
I've seen you fight for everyone but yourself.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,120
This time you have to fight for yourself.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,360
If there's anything I don't know, Haydar.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
Don't be ridiculous.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,240
How quickly you forgot that loan sharks kidnapped Mercan because of your debt.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,680
It wasn't mine, Murat's debt.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,080
Even his mother shed a couple tears and then walked away.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,480
You look very tired, with blood on your head.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,400
Come on.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
Cemal will bring something to wear.

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,160
How is she, Ateş?

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,400
She didn't die.

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
my curses are upon you.

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,240
May you also be tested by the pain of losing your beloved.

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,280
even that stone you carry around as your heart

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,160
burns and scorches.

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
I wish she had died so we could have been saved.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,800
You'll see Ateş.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,280
He never leaves her side for a second.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,560
Maybe Mercan was shot because they missed you?

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,240
I don't think so.

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,120
If he wanted to shoot me, he would have done it.

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,360
He had the chance to do so.

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,640
So, according to you, the target was Mercan.

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,240
Do you know Mercan Yıldırım?

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,840
No.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,160
My wife was shot! Tell me who did it?

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,280
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,800
and these guys too.

35
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,520
Mercan... She remembered the one who shot was wearing white. That's the only information we have.

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,560
White?

37
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,120
I hate you with all my heart.

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
You'll walk away from our life.

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,000
And I will make that happen.

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,360
Ateş... Is mine.

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Do you understand?

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,000
Wake up.

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
Mercan, are you okay?

44
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Wake up.

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,600
Mercan, wake up.

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,520
What happened?

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,960
I don't know.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
Cemal.

49
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Cemal.

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,760
I'm here brother, what's going on?

51
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Hospital, now.

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,000
Man, there's no time left. How will I pay him? Nothing comes to my mind.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,280
Maybe ask for some time?

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,200
Don't you watch movies, man? You can't ask for time from a loan shark.

55
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,440
If you don't give their money back in time...

56
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,000
They will put a bullet in your ankle.

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,040
Is that so?

58
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,960
No doubt.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,520
Man, that area has no meat to absorb the bullet, it's a tiny area.

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,160
Understood? It's mostly bones, bullet would hurt a lot.

61
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,800
Would they do it?

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,240
I don't think they would.

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,320
Would they?

64
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,640
Berat?

65
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,800
Man, I found it.

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,520
I found it.
What?

67
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,040
How to make the money.

68
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,000
I understood that, but how?

69
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,840
Are you with me?
No.

70
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,480
Then you're coming.

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,760
No, brother. Who knows what kind of trouble you’re going to drag us into again?

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,520
I found the way to pay his money. It's going to be over until the morning. Let's go.

73
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Come on, let's go. -For the love of god...

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
As you see, I don't have anything, I'm fine.

75
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,160
Not yet.

76
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
You'll listen to what I say.

77
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,640
No stepping out of this bed.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,440
You'l also be careful of what you eat.

79
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,440
You should have at least let Demet come in.

80
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,440
I told her that she was welcome.

81
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,440
She decided to go with her brother.

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,960
And you tell all this it like it's normal?

83
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,200
It is.

84
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,280
Lie down now.

85
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
Lie down?

86
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,120
Mess with my sleep too?

87
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,680
That was the only one left.

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,880
Mercan, my girl… My sweet angel. We were terrified something would happen to you.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,360
We never stopped praying until we heard the good news.

90
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,200
Here, I prepared what you like.

91
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
Thanks, Sister Binnaz.

92
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,280
Get well, my dear.

93
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,160
You've always seen us as family, and I see you as a daughter.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,320
Go on, eat so you can get your strength back.

95
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,000
Thank you.

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,240
Enjoy, my dear.

97
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,120
Good evening.

98
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,240
Keep going.

99
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,520
I'm not hungry.

100
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,160
Wrong time to argue with me. Let's eat.

101
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I can eat by myself.

102
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,200
Drink water too.

103
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
As you say, sir.

104
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,600
I’ve got some business to take care of, I’ll be back. Until then, these will be finished.

105
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,400
Ms. Aslı, I threw away the bag you gave me.

106
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,160
Okay Zehra, fine.

107
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,400
Enjoy your coffee.

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,600
What bag is that?

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
Make it news, why not?

110
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,840
She's definitely hiding something, Mother Müzeyyen. She was like this as a child, her face always gave it away.

111
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,560
Don't mess with me, I'm not in the mood.

112
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,960
Have you found your necklace?

113
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,520
Right? you never take it off.

114
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
What necklace?

115
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,040
The other day...

116
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,880
It got tangled in my clothes.

117
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,680
I forgot about it after taking it off. It must be somewhere in the room.

118
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,080
Anyway, never mind it.

119
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,000
How is Mrs. Mercan? Has she remembered anything?

120
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,440
No.

121
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Still the same.

122
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,040
I had something to do on computer that I forgot about, let me handle that.

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,200
The footage has arrived. I’m emailing it to you.

124
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,960
Okay. I will check it in the room.

125
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,600
Mercan.

126
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,200
Are you okay?

127
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm trying to remember but I can't.

128
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,840
And everytime I recall that moment, it hurts even more.

129
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,240
But I won't give up.

130
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,000
I won't give up trying even if it hurts a thousand times more. I'll definitely remember.

131
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Here.

132
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,480
Don't push yourself, you will remember.

133
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,920
Whoever did it will get punished for it.

134
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,360
I...

135
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,880
I didn't want to cry, sorry.

136
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,280
I will try to be stronger.

137
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,560
You don't have to be stronger.

138
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,120
Sometimes it’s more courageous to ask for help.

139
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,360
Are you really the one to say that?

140
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,880
Do what I say, not what I do.

141
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,960
And, don't apologize for crying.

142
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,000
You should only apologize when you've done something wrong.

143
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,760
Crying is none of that.

144
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,520
In fact, it shows that your heart is not frozen.

145
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,320
And you?

146
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,800
Do you cry, or is your heart frozen?

147
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,840
Depends on the person.

148
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Some get ice.

149
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
Some get volcano.

150
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,360
I give everyone what they deserve.

151
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,080
Thing is...

152
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,960
Okay.

153
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,160
Go to sleep. I'm here.

154
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,320
Can't believe you Malik.

155
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,640
I've been calling since yesterday. Didn’t hear the first few… and the fifth?

156
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,280
You just answer that phone, and I’ll show you.

157
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,160
Have you made your decision?

158
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,120
The whole mansion came together to help Mrs. Mercan get better, and you’re still thinking about this?

159
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,240
Don’t twist the subject. Make your decision. I can't wait for you no more.

160
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,480
Next thing you know, I might catch you off guard and tell your mother everything.

161
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,840
And who knows what your mother would do?

162
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
You've got very little time, just know that.

163
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,960
Come on Malik, come on.

164
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,960
God, help me. What am I going to do?

165
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,000
Good morning.

166
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,680
Good morning.

167
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,560
Sorry, I fell asleep like this. I must have bothered you.

168
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,960
Yes, that happened.

169
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,680
It won't happen again, don't worry.

170
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,400
I saw Tahir in my dream again.

171
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,440
He was calling me, calling my name.

172
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,720
I ran towards him but he ran away.

173
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Why am I keep seeing him in my dreams?

174
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,600
There has to be a meaning.

175
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
I’m going to the village, to Durmuş. I’ll look around a bit. Maybe something will come up.

176
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,480
I'm coming too, maybe I will remember something.

177
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
I don't think so.

178
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
I think so.

179
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,960
You're not coming.

180
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm coming.

181
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,640
Come on... Where is it?

182
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,960
Disgusting.

183
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,840
Oh God, I’ve gotten myself into trouble, really...

184
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Such a tyrant.

185
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,760
Blocking the door like a guard, he didn't let us see Mercan.

186
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,480
No way, are you serious?

187
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,920
Don't ask.

188
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,680
I’m so pissed.

189
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,200
A protective character. Overprotective. Very protective.

190
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,600
He's not protective, he's a walking ego.

191
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Well, yes, maybe a little bit.

192
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:07,480
But the people talk about him. You know what they say, people talk about the effective ones, not the quiet. And the man makes them talk.

193
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,760
Depends on what he's making them talk.

194
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,360
Right.

195
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,840
Enjoy your drink.

196
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,240
Thanks. -Thanks.

197
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,760
Ms. Demet, I've sent you the e-mails you asked for.

198
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,840
Thank you so much Burak, you're so fast.

199
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,360
If there is any problem, I'm one call away.

200
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,040
Okay, thank you.

201
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,000
Thanks.

202
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,680
Enjoy.

203
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,680
You too.

204
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,040
This guy is so eager to make an impression.

205
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,160
There's something with him. Whenever we talk, he comes by. There's something, but I will figure it out.

206
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,120
I mean, but he works very hard, I trust him.

207
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,720
Sure, he works very hard. It's still up to you, I have to warn you...

208
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,240
He is from the opposite side.

209
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm just saying it, there's something with him, there is...

210
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,600
Burak, come here.

211
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,560
Yes, Mr. Haydar.

212
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,880
How is it? Are you getting used to the palce?

213
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,680
Yes, they are very helpful.

214
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,200
Nice. You are eager, I see you. You work willingly.

215
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:50,680
If you take the right steps, you’ll rise fast. Every step you take either moves you up or keeps you in place.

216
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,720
The choice is yours.

217
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,320
So, what's going on in the company lately?

218
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,320
Mr. Ateş loves to work with young people. Has he mentioned his near future plans?

219
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,920
Well, he didn't mention that to me...

220
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,240
Burak?

221
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,160
Have you prepared the documents I asked for?

222
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,560
Yes, they are in your room.

223
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,880
Okay, let's go check them again, maybe something is missing.

224
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Good luck.

225
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,040
Burak.

226
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,720
You remember we work for Mr. Ateş, right? Be careful.

227
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,160
Mr. Haydar isn't very trustworthy.

228
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,240
He’ll take what you say, use it, and then make it seem like you’re the one at fault.

229
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,880
Thank you for warning Ms. Zahide.

230
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,440
Let's see then.

231
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,840
Zahide isn’t letting new kid, Burak out of her sight. It’s like she’s put him under special protection.

232
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,240
Just as we’re about to talk, she stands there like the Gestapo.

233
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,520
There’s something about that kid, I can tell. My sixth sense is very strong, I can sense it.

234
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
I'll figure it out.

235
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,560
There's something.

236
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,240
Yaşar, can you bring the new kid's resume to me?

237
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,240
Sure, Mr. Haydar.

238
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:25,280
See? I told you there’s something going on with this kid. The man’s a veteran, he figured it out in no time. He’s a good kid, nice and all, but soon we’ll see the truth.

239
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,920
I should go and bring him the resume.

240
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,720
Okay.

241
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,520
See you.

242
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,160
Come on, reveal yourself.

243
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,160
Ateş.

244
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,720
Where did you come from?

245
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,040
I told you to wait.

246
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,280
Come.

247
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,240
If you feel uneasy, let’s head back. I’ll come later.

248
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,400
No, I'm fine.

249
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,280
Are you sure?

250
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,440
I'll kill that girl.

251
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,680
I'll do it this time. I'll finish her.

252
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
My necklace.

253
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,680
Durmuş isn’t here yet, but he told me where the key is. Should we sit for a bit?

254
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,160
Waiting hurts even more.

255
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,000
I want to face it right away.

256
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Are you sure?

257
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,160
Mercan.

258
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,640
Look how frightened she is.

259
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Are you okay?

260
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
I'm with you.

261
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,560
Mercan, sweetheart.

262
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,120
You look so pale. Are you alright, my dear?

263
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,920
I'm fine.

264
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Have we kept you waiting for too long?

265
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,120
We've just arrived.

266
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,000
Let's come in. -Come in.

267
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,120
Come in children, come in.

268
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,480
Come in, my child. Come in.

269
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Sorry, brother Malik.

270
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,280
When will you grow up, brother?

271
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,640
Just to pay off the debt.

272
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,600
You were getting yourself killed. What debt?

273
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:58,160
Man, I don’t know… I thought fighters made good money. But if you hadn’t come, I’d be done for.

274
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,160
Done for?

275
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,680
Done for life.

276
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,920
You’d be saying ‘rest in peace’ for me.

277
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,920
God forbid. Don’t say stuff like that.

278
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:17,080
Thanks, brother Malik. You really wiped them out. May God give everyone a brother like you. How do you people say? ''Shukran.''

279
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,240
Man, it's okay, but wise up already. I can’t always be with you.

280
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:31,400
Okay, don't worry about that. You fight really good. I can set up another match for you next week. We’ll earn big money, what you say?

281
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,480
Stop talking nonsense.

282
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,640
Man, I’m saying this because I care about you. You can get out of driving, it could change your life.

283
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,320
Don't care about me brother. If you keep talking, you will be my next opponent.

284
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,920
Okay, okay. But Malik...

285
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,640
Keep walking, someone's going to see us.

286
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,200
God protected our Mercan.

287
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:09,400
Well, your husband, he's true to his name. I've never seen someone burn with love like him. He was going to die from the thought of losing you.

288
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:15,720
Even in that state, he didn't fall down and took you to the hospital.

289
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,560
Mother Güllü, the food was amazing, thank you. -Glad that you liked it, my child.

290
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,600
Well done.

291
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:31,120
A true gentleman doesn't seek praise. That's a virtue. Well done.

292
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,680
We went to the mansion, but your mother...

293
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,400
And you were saying ''we can't dance.'' that day.

294
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,880
''No we can't, we can't dance.'' Right? Right?

295
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:02,400
We couldn’t take our eyes off you. That look of yours, that presence. We watched the recording over and over. It was beautiful, truly beautiful.

296
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,040
Big brother, did you record us?

297
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,040
Yes, I wanted to keep it as a memory.

298
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,280
Maybe something comes out.

299
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,840
Can I watch the recording immediately? Maybe we can find a hint.

300
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,640
Right. Maybe the one who shot me got caught on camera somehow.

301
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,440
Let's hope so. Let me bring the phone, wait.

302
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,640
Hold on, I'll bring it right away.

303
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,480
I knew you were here.

304
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,440
What do you want?

305
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
What I want is clear.

306
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,800
If we join forces, it will benefit both of us.

307
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,480
Joining forces? What the hell are you talking about?

308
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,720
My enemy is Ateş, yours is Mercan.

309
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,600
We are on the same path, that's what I meant.

310
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:30,360
If Ateş is your enemy, I'm your enemy too. I won't oppose him by joinin forces with you.

311
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,160
Fine.

312
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:39,880
You should still think about what I said. We need to act before it’s too late, or nothing we do will matter.

313
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Next thing you know, we'll be celebrating their baby.

314
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,600
Malik.

315
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,840
Take a look, brother? Is it working?

316
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,520
Drop it, man. I can do it myself.

317
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,160
No, man. Let me thank you for everything you've done.

318
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,080
Thanks to you, I didn’t get beaten.

319
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,400
Would be so bad.

320
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,520
It's okay, no big deal. Don't talk about it anymore.

321
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,120
Brother.

322
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,800
Mom is calling you.

323
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,640
What happened?

324
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,600
I don't know, go check.

325
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,120
Malik, I'll be back.

326
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,680
What happened to your face?

327
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,840
What?

328
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,440
I hit the car door, nothing serious.

329
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,920
Tell me the truth, did you fight?

330
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,760
No, what fight? I hit the car door while cleaning it. It's not serious, really.

331
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,600
Are you sure?

332
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,720
I am.

333
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,760
Fine.

334
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,560
Actually, what’s up with you, my flower?

335
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:16,200
If you knew what happened… Should I tell Zehra? Maybe not. He’s already fed up with our problems.

336
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,280
Çiçek?

337
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,360
I’m fine, really. Just, you know, stuff at home…

338
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,080
Anyway, the stove was on.

339
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,040
No, something's up with you.

340
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,600
My flower.

341
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,960
Something's up with you, I know you well.

342
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,520
But what is it?

343
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
It's really dark.

344
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,480
The phone didn't record well, it's old.

345
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,480
This.

346
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,840
What? What did you see?

347
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,960
Why isn't he here yet? I hope he hasn't changed his mind.

348
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,040
He hasn't.

349
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,760
He is a man of his word, I know him.

350
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,200
Do you think we will find it?

351
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,720
Whoever it is, sooner or later I will find them. And they'll be punished.

352
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,000
There is no escape.

353
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,160
This.

354
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,440
What? What did you see?

355
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,840
Taxi.

356
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
Who is it here for?

357
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,760
Seems like it's waiting for someone.

358
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,440
You must be tired.

359
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
I'm not tired.

360
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,640
Actually, it was nice, this way we also got to see Uncle Durmuş and Aunt Güllü.

361
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,760
I really love them, we should visit more.

362
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,200
Still, you should have stayed home.

363
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,320
Why?

364
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:40,280
You've narrowly escaped death twice. You just got out of the hospital. You've lost weight. Your face is still pale as can be. Should I keep going?

365
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,920
You’re supposed to be resting at home, but instead, you’re out here playing detective.

366
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,360
Look how much he cares about me.

367
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,320
What am I saying?

368
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,320
Are you finished?

369
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:04,880
I’m not going to make long sentences like you. I only have two words: I'm fine.

370
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,160
And I’m really bored of staying in bed.

371
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,000
This matter directly concerns me, isn’t it normal that I want to be a part of it?

372
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,760
I want to find out who shot me, as soon as possible.

373
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,240
You said two words, and you made ten sentences.

374
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,360
Yeah, it kind of turned out that way.

375
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,200
Take your medicine.

376
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,560
Do you carry my medicine with you?

377
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,000
I knew you wouldn't go home.

378
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:10,560
Because I've gotten to know you well enough to see your urge to object to everything, and just how grumpy you are.

379
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Thank you.

380
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,920
Don't get me wrong, it's not because I think of you.

381
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,280
Just because you don't pass out and get me in trouble.

382
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,600
Either way, thank you. I don't care, I'm used to it.

383
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,160
What?

384
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,280
Doing something good for me first, and then beating me up with words.

385
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,840
Where is Ateş? He's been gone for hours.

386
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,720
Where? He’s probably with Mrs. Mercan again.

387
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,040
What’s with that face?

388
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,960
What do you expect from me mom?

389
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
Ladies.

390
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,720
You found the necklace, congratulations.

391
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
Yes.

392
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,840
I dropped it in my room.

393
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,640
Sit down, child, let them get you coffee.

394
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,080
Thanks Mother Müzeyyen, I'm going out.

395
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,960
Where is Ateş?

396
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
He is busy.

397
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,080
His right-hand man never says anything.

398
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,600
Aslı.

399
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,120
Let her, Mom. She’s at her cutest again. Loves messing with me.

400
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,440
Is there any news from the men? Any progress? Maybe a hint?

401
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,400
What's up, Aslı? You didn't care about Mercan this much. You even hated her.

402
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,240
Yes, I don't care, and I still hate her.

403
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,720
What happens to Yıldırıms doesn't concern me at all.

404
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:22,640
I’m worried that Ateş might be the real target. If the threat is serious, we need to take precautions.

405
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,120
If you’re that curious, ask Ateş, he will give you the details.

406
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,960
They say lies in a family crack the walls.

407
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,320
Listening to you, I keep staring at the walls.

408
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,680
Greetings.

409
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Greetins to you.

410
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,480
Hello Mrs. Karahan.

411
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,680
Hello.

412
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,240
What would you like to drink?

413
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:25,080
Thanks big brother, I won't drink. I could barely park the car, I should check the images and get going before getting a ticket.

414
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,040
Okay.

415
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
This is the footage.

416
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,560
It's recorded from a long distance, and not clear.

417
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,840
But you saw the taxi, right?

418
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:50,760
Can you help us find the taxi from that day? The time doesn’t matter. We need to find every taxi that went in and out of the village.

419
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,400
Of course, Mr. Ateş. We will find it.

420
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,000
Appreciate it.

421
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Here’s what I’ll do, I’ll notify all the taxi stations. The driver, or any driver who knows anything, will get in touch with me. We’ll know soon who went to the village.

422
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,720
I’ll get going then, I'll notify the stations right away.

423
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,440
We owe you.

424
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,960
It’s nothing. Compared to what you’ve done for me, this is nothing.

425
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,080
Alright, take care.

426
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,280
Thank you.

427
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,440
Respectfully, ma’am.

428
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,200
I'm hungry, should we eat?

429
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,120
Sounds good.

430
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,600
I’m also starving.

431
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,120
Can we get the menu?

432
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,360
Sure.

433
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,800
What's the matter, girl? You're so quiet, and you didn't eat.

434
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,040
I had a little snack this afternoon, I’m not really feeling like eating.

435
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,720
Ateş isn’t here either. Where is he, son?

436
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,080
He's probably after the one who shot Mercan.

437
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,920
He's been wrecking himself ever since that girl got shot. We can't see his face.

438
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,560
He is not going to the office.

439
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,880
Is there any news?

440
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,320
Nothing has changed since you asked two hours ago.

441
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,520
There he is.

442
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,880
Good evening.

443
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Welcome.

444
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,720
Where were you son? You didn't come to dinner. If you’re hungry, I’ll have the table set for you.

445
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,440
Thanks Mother Müzeyyen.

446
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
We ate outside.

447
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,520
Ate out? You're breaking with tradition.

448
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,400
You wouldn't do it, you would at least inform me.

449
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,720
Whatever’s been going on, you’ve been acting differently lately.

450
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,960
I even had the Mumbar specially prepared for you.

451
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,960
It was fantastic, you missed it.

452
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,440
Excuse me, I’m going to my room. I’m a little tired.

453
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,480
So, could you find anything?

454
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:11,760
We are after the taxi driver. We will find him in no time. I'm waiting for the news.

455
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Darling, what did you do?

456
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,960
I did it again, being my usual clumsy self. Thankfully, the glass survived.

457
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,840
My stomach is really full, I'm going to lie down a bit.

458
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,920
I'll go wash my hands.

459
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,480
Pick up that glass.

460
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,440
Ateş is after the taxi driver.

461
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,240
If they find him...

462
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,960
Damn it.

463
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,160
If he finds out I shot Mercan, I’m done for.

464
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,000
No. I have to do something about it.

465
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,920
Maybe ask Cemal for help?

466
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,880
But Cemal wouldn't betray Ateş.

467
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,120
My mom.

468
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,560
Where were you all day?

469
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,480
I went to the office.

470
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,680
And, had an appointment with an old client.

471
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,240
If you're up to something, just say it. The truth will come out eventually.

472
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,240
They said you were also out all day.

473
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,920
Am I accusing you of anything?

474
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,640
No. If she finds out, she’ll tear me apart.

475
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,280
I'm ruined.

476
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,880
Calm down.

477
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,280
I need to find a solution.

478
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,960
And, I will.

479
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,800
No...

480
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,040
No... No...

481
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,440
Do you hear?
No...

482
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,760
Wake up.
No...

483
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,360
Wake up.
No...

484
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,200
Do you hear? Wake up.

485
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,400
Get up.

486
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,800
Don't do it. Don't.

487
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,680
Don't. Don't.

488
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,560
Calm down.

489
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,720
Drink.

490
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,520
Don’t be afraid, I’m with you.

491
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,120
You just had a bad dream.

492
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,040
Calm down.

493
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,400
Breathe deeply.

494
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,200
Breathe deeply.

495
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,640
It's over.

496
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,560
Are you better?

497
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,960
Thank you.

498
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,040
Lie down, come on.

499
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:59,280
Yes brother, it is my debt. Don't worry I'll pay it, I promise.

500
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:07,080
What we said is final. If you delay even a single day, there will be consequences.

501
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,440
I know your address. If you don't come, I will come and take my money.

502
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,640
Okay brother, understood. It's fine, I'll deliver your money tomorrow.

503
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Respects to you, brother.

504
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,080
Berat.

505
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,000
Mom?

506
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,080
Who are you talking to so heatedly?

507
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,160
One of my friends, Mom. We had an issue.

508
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,400
We got a bit tense. That's...

509
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,560
Mom, it's cold outside, let's go inside. Let's go.

510
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,960
There's something with you again, hope god it turns out well.

511
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,360
Don't resist, go to sleep. There's nothing to be afraid of.

512
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,480
I don't want to.

513
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,800
I'm afraid of having bad dreams again.

514
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,920
I'm here.

515
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:46,280
Can you tell me a funny moment of yours? Maybe it’ll help me clear my mind a bit.

516
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,040
There isn't much.

517
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,160
What do you mean? Isn't there any?

518
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,960
Can't you remember? Haven't you had a funny moment by this age?

519
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,880
Cemal and I were around 14-15.

520
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:19,640
There was this kid in the neighborhood. He kept bullying us all the time.

521
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:28,720
We didn’t really pay much attention to it. Not because we couldn’t deal with him, but because we didn’t want to hurt anyone.

522
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,000
But one day he did something so bad… that we’d had enough.

523
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,440
What?

524
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,560
We had a sick friend. He was very thin, weak.

525
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,840
That bully picked on him.

526
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,360
One day he beat him badly.

527
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,360
That was the moment we’d had enough.  We ambushed him.

528
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,600
And we went at him with all we have.

529
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:04,960
He never messed with us again. In fact, he would even cross the street when he saw us.

530
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,480
Do you think that's funny?

531
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,760
Look at me, am I laughing?

532
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,640
Meaning that it's not funny. In fact, sad.

533
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,160
But we enjoyed giving him a lesson.

534
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,640
Can you please tell a story that doesn't involve violence?

535
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,720
I don't know, maybe a story where you laughed so hard.

536
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,760
Don't you have such moment? Have you never laughed in your life?

537
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,520
Fine, I'll tell.

538
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,000
But this is the last one.

539
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,560
Just because you are sick.

540
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,440
Again, with Cemal, we were around 10 years old.

541
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:02,800
There was a beautiful apple tree in the neighbor’s yard. Its branches were full of big, bright red apples.

542
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,320
But we were hesitant to take any because the man was grumpy and stingy.

543
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,560
One day, we gathered all our courage and went in, climbing the tree.

544
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,960
Just as we were picking the apples, we suddenly heard a voice.

545
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,960
It was our neighbor next door.

546
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,160
Then, all of a sudden, we grabbed the apples and ran.

547
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,760
Good morning.

548
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,120
Good morning.

549
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,960
Sorry, I fell asleep before hearing the rest of the story.

550
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,400
So?

551
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,360
So what?

552
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,320
Aren’t you going to tell the rest? We left off at the most exciting part, you’d just climbed the tree.

553
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,000
You’re wondering about this first thing in the morning?

554
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,680
Yes, I am.

555
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,920
Why did you fall asleep then?

556
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:57,560
Cemal picked a couple of apples. Just then, we heard the neighbor’s voice.

557
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,960
No way.

558
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:06,200
Of course, Cemal panicked. As he tried to get down from the tree, his pants got caught on a branch.

559
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,320
He was stuck, swinging like a leaf.

560
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,280
But he wouldn’t let go of the apples, he was so determined.

561
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:20,200
I sprinted as fast as I could, but I couldn’t reach him. He fell to the ground. Luckily, we managed to escape without getting caught by the neighbor.

562
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,200
It's funny but I felt bad for Cemal.

563
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,800
I should go to work, that's enough conversation.

564
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,080
Can you also take me to the office? I'm so bored.

565
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:41,080
I'm not going there, waiting to hear from the taxi driver.

566
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,560
Etiher way, we’ll get the information today.

567
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,800
Can you also let me know?

568
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:59,760
At least say yes or no. What an unstable man. Unbelievable.

569
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,800
Aslı.

570
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,840
Where are you going this early?

571
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,240
I've got to take care of some things, mom.

572
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,800
Stop over there.

573
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,680
Okay, say what you need to say.

574
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:37,560
Eventhough you denied it, I'm sure, you are up to something.

575
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,840
You're acting weird since that girl got shot.

576
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,400
What’s up, Aslı? What’s going on?

577
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,400
What do you mean, mom?

578
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,520
Be clear, what are you implying?

579
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,040
Do you doubt me?

580
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,000
I can't believe you, mom.

581
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,240
Do you want to know the truth?

582
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,040
Fine.

583
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,360
I'll say it.

584
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,200
I haven't done anything.

585
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,000
Hello.

586
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,600
Son, I'm Berat's mother.

587
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,600
How are you, Aunt Binnaz?

588
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,320
Thank you son, we're doing okay.

589
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,640
I was trying to call Salih, but he cannot be reached.

590
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,520
Salih went to prison for fraud, Aunt Binnaz.

591
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,160
Did you say fraud?

592
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,040
No way.

593
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,600
He ripped people off, and wasted all the money.

594
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,040
Okay. Okay, son, I got it. Thanks.

595
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,080
Damn you, Berat... I’ll show you what happens now.

596
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,680
Mom, this garden is so huge. No matter how much I mow, it just never ends. I’m starving. Don’t we have anything to eat?

597
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,600
Son.

598
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,600
Are you trying to kill me?

599
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,080
I called this Salih, and he was in prison.

600
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,840
He is completely broke. Where did you find the money?

601
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,720
I took it...

602
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,520
From a friend who owed me money.

603
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,520
Owed you money?

604
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:24,040
If he owed you money, why did we go through all this hardship?

605
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,520
Nothing but lies and deceit, Berat.

606
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,200
Are you kidding with me?

607
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,840
You’d only see that much money in your dreams.

608
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,280
Did I pay it back or not?

609
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,480
What are you questioning, mom?

610
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,160
No, I understand, I just can't please you.

611
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,000
I get it. Nothing I do is ever enough.

612
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,640
This is too much, though.

613
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,800
And you try to come off as right when you’re wrong.

614
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,600
My dear god.

615
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,480
Hope god he's not in trouble.

616
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,200
What am I going to do with him?

617
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,080
Berat, Berat.

618
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,280
Demet.

619
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,000
Sweetheart.

620
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,320
I wanted to come see my friend.

621
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,320
Good thing you did.

622
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,320
Come, let's sit.

623
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,920
I was too worried about you. How are you?

624
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,160
I'm better, except the nightmares.

625
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,760
And my scar is healing well.

626
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,760
But...

627
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,600
I can still hear the gunshots.

628
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I keep getting shot in my dreams.

629
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,200
It's impossible to sleep.

630
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,120
My dear...

631
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,240
It's not easy at all.

632
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,720
Even I was affected this much, I can't imagine you.

633
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:03,240
I still can't believe what happened, everything could be over.

634
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,200
Do you know what scared me the most, after I got shot?

635
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,520
What?

636
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,040
Not from death, but from what I never got to live.

637
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,920
There are so many things I wanted to live, but never got to.

638
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:24,120
Leaving everything behind? I don't even want to think of it.

639
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,160
I don't want to die without living it to the fullest.

640
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,400
God forbid, Mercan.

641
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,560
Don't say stuff like that.

642
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,960
But this is what I feel.

643
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:42,920
Everything I’ve been through since my childhood… And what happened recently… I’ve realized life is too short to put things off.

644
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,160
What's on your mind Ateş?

645
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,760
The one who shot Mercan...

646
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,600
No rest before finding them.

647
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,840
Don’t worry, we’ll find that scoundrel.

648
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,440
Hi.

649
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,400
We have a meeting at 2 PM. You didn't forget it, right?

650
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,520
Right...

651
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,320
I forgot.

652
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,080
You seem tired, couldn't you sleep?

653
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,800
Mercan is having nightmares.

654
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,160
It affected her too much.

655
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,200
We both couldn't get sleep.

656
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,640
Of course, the poor girl nearly died.

657
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,400
Any updates from the taxi?

658
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,000
No.

659
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,840
What do you have?

660
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,280
Well, I've spread the word to everyone. It might be an unlicensed driver.

661
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,000
I should get going. Don't forget the meeting.

662
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
Cancel the meeting, Aslı.

663
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,120
I'm not coming to the office today.

664
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,960
We need to speak urgently.

665
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,400
Very important.

666
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:21,160
The circle is closing in. I need to find a way out of this.

667
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,040
You don't steal an apple from a grumpy neighbor.

668
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,720
Huh? Say something?

669
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,480
What apple? What neighbor? I don't get it.

670
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:50,640
You know, when you fell stealing apples from the neighbor’s garden as a kid?

671
01:06:53,800 --> 01:07:01,040
Tell that men to sort it out immediately. Tell them to be quick.

672
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,880
I don't have such a memory, by the way.

673
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,440
Wait a moment.

674
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,960
Will you help me?

675
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,880
For what?

676
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,600
I knew it.

677
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,200
What are you going to do with these?

678
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,720
I’ll build a swing.

679
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,200
Swing?

680
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,400
What swing?

681
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,280
That incident...

682
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,640
I mean, almost dying…

683
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,280
It really shook me.

684
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,280
I realized how close I actually was to death.

685
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:28,680
I thought about the things I left unfinished, the things I wanted but couldn’t do. The first thing that came to mind was this swing.

686
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,200
I vaguely remember.

687
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:45,200
Me, Eylül, Tahir...

688
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,480
We wanted to set up a swing.

689
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,760
We would have touched the clouds with that swing.

690
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,040
But it didn’t happen.

691
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:11,720
I held onto serums instead of the clouds.

692
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,160
My eyes touched the hospital ceiling.

693
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,520
Or the mansion...

694
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,560
My friends left too.

695
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,080
I am left all alone.

696
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,000
Anyway.

697
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,920
I wanted what I did first to be what I remember first.

698
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,040
Not only for myself.

699
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,560
But also for Eylül and Tahir.

700
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,720
Who knows...

701
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,480
Maybe Eylül feels it in her soul.

702
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:28,760
I would have done it myself, but in this state, it’s a bit too hard. That’s why I asked for your help.

703
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,080
But if you don't want to, I can understand. I'll try to do it myself.

704
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,880
Thank you.

705
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,840
Are you okay?

706
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,040
I am.

707
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,120
Do it like this.

708
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,240
Okay, I got it, I can do it.

709
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,240
For help.

710
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,520
It worked.

711
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,800
Yes.

712
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,280
Where is this girl?

713
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,960
When did you become like this?

714
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,200
How couldn't I see you?

715
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,720
When did you slip away from my hands?

716
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,760
Oh, Aslı.

717
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,720
I’ll get my hands on you, no matter what. You did something, at least it should have been worth it.

718
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,160
Thanks to you, Ateş got closer to Mercan.

719
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,240
Not too bad, I guess.

720
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,040
It's perfect.

721
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,200
So?

722
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,000
Aren’t you going to ride?

723
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,960
I won't.

724
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,480
You said it was a childhood dream.

725
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,640
Did we build it to watch?

726
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,360
Go on, get on.

727
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,720
Fine.

728
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,960
Go on, get on.

729
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:53,480
Ready to fly, we flew.

730
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,120
Here we go.

731
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,440
Sister...

732
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,080
I wish we had beautiful memories like this.

733
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,400
What happened?

734
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,280
Goodness.

735
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:51,680
I want you to research someone. He works at our company. Find something useful. His name is Burak.

736
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,360
Alright, I'm hanging up.

737
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,360
Haydar.

738
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,000
Haydar.

739
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,920
Stay away from my employees.

740
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,760
Am I supposed to ask you what to do?

741
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,760
Let's head over there, darling.

742
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:43,360
I saw you from afar. I was afraid you might do something wrong. I was afraid you’d do something wrong in anger.

743
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,560
We need to stay calm, my love.

744
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,440
We need to stay calm, and act strategically.

745
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,360
Do you hear that?

746
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,920
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

747
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,000
The clock is running.

748
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:21,520
Time moves fast, Çiçek. Your moment to decide is getting closer. Make your choice soon. I can’t wait for you any longer.

749
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,160
I can’t deal with you right now, just go. Mind your own business.

750
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,480
I said go and mind your own business.

751
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,800
Give them to me, my flower.

752
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:49,360
You seemed down yesterday, Habibti. I also sent you a message, but you didn’t reply.

753
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,280
I worried about you, is something wrong?

754
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,040
No, there's nothing.

755
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,920
It saddens me to see you like this.

756
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,640
But don't worry, I will put a smile on that beautiful face soon.

757
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:09,320
I've thought a lot, and come to a decision, I've a surprise for you.

758
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,280
What surprise?

759
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,680
I guess you won’t be able to tell, since it’s a surprise.

760
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,480
I can't tell, but you won't have to wait that much.

761
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:24,160
Fine, let it be that way. I'll go now, so no one sees us together, okay?

762
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,200
Okay.

763
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,400
Okay, see you. -See you.

764
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,240
Why did you go like that? Did something happen?

765
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,960
It's nothing.

766
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,440
It's nothing.

767
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,360
Yes, Cemal?

768
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,640
We found the taxi driver, brother.

769
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,880
Okay, send me the location, I'm coming.

770
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,080
I'm coming too.

771
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,120
No, you're not.

772
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,240
I am.

773
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,240
I'd drop you off, but I don't have time to deal with it.

774
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,680
Since you came all the way to me, it must be really important.

775
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:46,480
I need to talk to you about something, but first, I want to ask a question.

776
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,880
Is your offer still valid?

777
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,760
Who did you pick up from that village? Where did you take them?

778
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,640
I can't say it, it would get me into trouble.

779
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,840
If you don’t talk, that’s when you’ll really get into trouble.

780
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,880
Speak.

781
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,600
Okay, calm down, I'll speak.

782
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,040
A middle-aged man.

783
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,280
And his name...

784
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:12,120
If you help me, your position in the company strengthens. You'll earn three times of what you make right now.

785
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,000
I don’t care about money or power. You’re going to give me my Mercan.

786
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,160
He's a man by the name of Abbas Güler, Cemal.

787
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,800
Who is that?

788
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,480
I don't know. We'll find out.

789
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,840
I'll send you the location.

790
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,440
I'll be home soon, give the man's information to the police.

791
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,600
Okay, I'm on it. Don't worry.

792
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,800
"Abbas Güler?"

793
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,400
I feel like I know that name from somewhere.

794
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,640
One moment.

795
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,440
I remember now.

796
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,120
I'd terminated him,

797
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,120
for harrasing a female employee.

798
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,160
He was a very troubled man.

799
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,440
When did this happen?

800
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,800
It's been a while, it was when I first started working.

801
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,640
Isn't it weird that this is happening

802
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:39,200
after all that time has passed?

803
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:44,000
It is weird but... He'd threatened me when I fired him.

804
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:47,240
So he'd been biding his time.

805
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:55,200
I'll give you a ride home, then I'll find that lowlife and make him pay.

806
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,080
No, I'm coming with you.

807
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,640
We're going home.

808
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,080
Will you not have breakfast, Haydar?

809
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,920
No, I'll have a coffee and leave.

810
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,760
Thank god, life has gone back to normal at home.

811
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,960
Ateş has been very attentive towards Mercan.

812
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,760
If Mercan plays her cards right and establishes some control over him...

813
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,080
We won't have any more issues.

814
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,240
Mercan wouldn't do such a thing.

815
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,480
And that Müzeyyen is such a snake,

816
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,000
do you think she would let that happen?

817
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,560
You leave that demon to me.

818
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,760
It's Rıza calling.

819
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,160
Why would he?

820
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,200
Yes, Rıza?

821
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:31,080
Haydar, I'm sorry to hear what happened.

822
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,080
Why didn't you tell me?

823
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,840
I'm getting offended,

824
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,960
I'm her uncle after all.

825
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,480
How is my niece, is she okay?

826
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:41,360
Mercan... Mercan is okay but

827
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,920
I'm not available right now, can we speak later?

828
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,640
Wait, don't hang up now.

829
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,120
I'll pay a visit to you as soon as I can, okay?

830
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,880
Okay, you're welcome to.

831
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,440
I need to hang up now,

832
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,200
I have a meeting.

833
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,760
Okay, talk to you later.

834
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,280
Is he coming here?

835
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,760
He was asking if Mercan was okay.

836
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,920
I don't want him to come over, Haydar.

837
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,240
Everytime he comes he causes trouble.

838
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,320
And he knows too much about the past.

839
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,120
It's not like I want him to come.

840
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,680
Am I supposed to tell him not to come?

841
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,880
Be a little reasonable.

842
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,400
He didn't even come to Murat's funeral, how dare he show up now?

843
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,520
He must be up to something.

844
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,960
I'm warning you.

845
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,080
Get out.

846
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,800
I'm telling you I'll come with you, why don't you listen to me?

847
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:39,240
You've gotten too bold, go home.

848
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,320
He went back to his default settings, what a bully.

849
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,400
Snot.

850
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,800
You guys be careful.

851
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,960
Mom?

852
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,840
Where's the missing bullet?

853
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,880
Where is it?

854
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,040
How should I know?

855
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,960
Mom, please let me be, leave the room.

856
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,000
Don't play with me!

857
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,840
What are you plotting?

858
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:48,040
I used that bullet to kill Mercan!

859
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,800
I wish I'd used them all on her!

860
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,920
I can't stand that girl any longer.

861
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,560
Now you know.

862
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,600
Are you satisfied?

863
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:01,680
You dumb girl!

864
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,800
How could you do something like this?

865
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,120
I get that you had no concern for me but how could you not think of yourself?

866
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,600
Your future, your career!

867
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,680
I don't care about anything anymore!

868
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,240
I want that girl dead.

869
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:21,360
But I see now that you're siding with her now, just like Ateş.

870
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,480
I do not care at all whether that snake lives or dies!

871
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:27,280
But you can not be the one pulling the trigger!

872
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:33,360
What happens when people find out you're the culprit?

873
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,480
Ateş would find the culprit eventually.

874
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:42,400
Don't worry. Nezir took care of everything.

875
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,920
You're fraternizing with the enemy?

876
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:59,400
Nezir is a scumbag, he could blackmail you into doing anything!

877
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,480
I did it for Ateş!

878
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,560
For the man I love.

879
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,960
I'm telling you to shut up.

880
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,160
I won't shut up, mom!

881
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,480
I'm in love with him!

882
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,960
And I have no regrets.

883
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,440
I would do anything for him.

884
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,320
I'd kill myself if I had to...

885
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,720
I told you to shut up! Shut up!

886
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,680
I don't want to hear anything of the sort from you again.

887
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:32,360
You won't even think about it, did you hear me?

888
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,480
You're going to put that love out.

889
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,960
Why aren't you supporting me, mom?

890
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,200
I can't live without him.

891
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:50,160
I can't stand to see him with another woman every day.

892
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,320
I feel like I'm about to lose my mind.

893
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,880
You will harden your heart if you have to,

894
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,240
you won't show it even if you writher in pain.

895
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:12,680
Aslı, you're going to erase Ateş from your mind.

896
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,400
You have to erase him!

897
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,440
My daughter can't be so weak.

898
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,280
This is not how I raised you to be.

899
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,960
I'm not you, mom.

900
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,160
I'll follow my heart.

901
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,520
Whatever the cost.

902
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,080
You're the one who is weak.

903
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:49,240
Is anyone home?

904
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,480
If we have the right man, he'll be in hiding for a while.

905
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,960
We need to find that man.

906
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,320
How can we know he won't do it again?

907
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,360
We should remain in touch with the police.

908
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:28,080
He's obviously not home but we know his name now.

909
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,600
That makes our job is easier.

910
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:31,360
Let's go.

911
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,880
You haven't turned yourself in yet?

912
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,560
And didn't I tell you not to call me, you idiot?

913
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:28,680
Man, I've changed my mind, I don't want to be a part of this.

914
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

915
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,160
You can't switch up now.

916
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,560
This job is not easy, I already had qualms about it at the beginning.

917
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,280
Ateş and his men were here, they found me.

918
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:42,040
They'll tear me to pieces before ever going to the police.

919
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,440
Listen, Abbas.

920
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,560
I've paid you a truck load of money, you can't chicken out now.

921
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,240
I've accepted going only to jail, not to my death.

922
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:54,000
This Ateş is so well-connected, he wouldn't leave me alone even in jail.

923
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,720
I have nothing to fall back on.

924
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:00,840
Abbas, get over yourself. I'll protect you.

925
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,240
I'll be your death if you make a wrong move.

926
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,800
If that's the case, I want double the money, Nezir.

927
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,280
If you don't accept, I won't own up to the crime.

928
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,880
Think about it and let me know.

929
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:23,640
You greedy man.

930
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,120
Hello?

931
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:33,360
Don't let Abbas out of your sight.

932
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,440
He's going to switch up on us, wait for my call.

933
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:52,200
Would you like something, Mrs. Müzeyyen?

934
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,640
No, mind your business.

935
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,040
You keep getting in my way.

936
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,640
Don't feel bad.

937
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:07,520
Things like this happen, sometimes.

938
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,720
We can sometimes face hardships we don't deserve.

939
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,120
There's not much to do about it.

940
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:19,280
That's the reality we live in.

941
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,040
Çiçek?

942
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,840
Are you ready for your surprise tomorrow?

943
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,120
I'm ready. Where are we going?

944
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,680
Well, that's the surprise. You'll see when we get there.

945
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,840
"Make up your mind already. I can't wait for you any longer."

946
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:58,440
"What if I slip up one day and tell your mom everything?"

947
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,800
"I don't know what your mom would do with you after that."

948
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,200
"You don't have much time."

949
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,640
Do we have to go?

950
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:07,440
I don't want any pushback, we're going out tomorrow.

951
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,960
Your time's up.

952
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:25,760
Tomorrow's your last day, Miss Çiçek.

953
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:30,640
I was worried about you,

954
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:32,960
I called you many times, you didn't answer.

955
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,080
Here I am.

956
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,760
Why would you worry?

957
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,240
Did you find the guy?

958
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:44,000
No, we didn't find him.

959
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,080
But we're after him.

960
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:51,520
Why are you here, it's cold outside?

961
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,920
Why haven't you gone to bed?

962
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,160
Why aren't you resting?

963
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,680
Okay, don't start scolding me.

964
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,360
Go inside.

965
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:07,800
Go.

966
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,440
It's my fault for worrying and waiting for you.

967
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,040
Why are you being so mean?

968
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,560
She was just worried about you.

969
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:34,960
Did I say something funny?

970
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,360
Berat?

971
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,960
Berat, are you home, son?

972
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,200
Berat, where have you been, son?

973
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,840
I just stepped out to get some air, mom.

974
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,600
I forgot my phone.

975
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,480
I'll take that. I'll be outside.

976
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,520
Berat, you weasel.

977
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,920
What are you up to this time?

978
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:21,280
I'd like to kill you right here and now.

979
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,920
What are you doing?

980
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,080
You scared me to death.

981
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:53,000
Why would you sneak in?

982
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,040
What are you doing here?

983
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,480
I just got hungry.

984
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,040
Why? Is eating forbidden too?

985
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,000
Leave it.

986
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,880
Don't bend down when you're injured.

987
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,960
What were you going to do with these?

988
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:22,320
I don't know. I just took out whatever I found.

989
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,400
Leave it to me. I'll make something.

990
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:26,960
Really?

991
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:29,600
Watch and see.

992
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,680
Okay, whatever you say.

993
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,960
You didn't tell me what happened today.

994
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,440
You'll catch that guy, right?

995
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,080
Of course.

996
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:02,080
Just heed my word until we do,

997
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:04,080
don't leave the house.

998
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:08,200
It's difficult for you to listen to anyone,

999
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:09,880
I know but, try anyway.

1000
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:12,680
I'm always getting scolded.

1001
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,120
I'd never told you before,

1002
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:04,800
that I liked cheese with jam.

1003
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:07,640
How did you know?

1004
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:09,920
I didn't.

1005
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,240
I just made it because I like it this way.

1006
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,040
Not everything's about you.

1007
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,680
It's good.

1008
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:53,280
But needs a little improvement.

1009
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,240
I'm still hungry.

1010
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,320
We'll make another one.

1011
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,440
You said you didn't like it,

1012
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,280
but you want another one.

1013
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,000
I didn't say I didn't like it.

1014
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,720
I just said it needed improvement.

1015
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,880
Sure, whatever you say.

1016
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:35,880
Here you go.

1017
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:40,520
I can't eat so much, late at night.

1018
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:45,400
I don't eat much at nights.

1019
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,920
Maybe you should watch it as well.

1020
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,040
Good night.

1021
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:25,240
Thank you.

1022
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:31,960
Mr. Ateş doesn't eat at night.

1023
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:03,120
We found Abbas' sister's house. I'm waiting for you.

1024
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I'll be there in a few minutes.

1025
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:19,760
Good morning.

1026
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:22,400
Good morning.

1027
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:28,040
I saw Tahir in my dream again.

1028
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:36,400
I would dream about Tahir and Eylül constantly

1029
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:39,240
when I was unconscious at the hospital.

1030
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:43,320
I don't know why but I think about them all the time.

1031
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:49,920
It's as if they're trying to tell me something.

1032
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,960
Or maybe it's just my feelings.

1033
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:02,680
Where are you going?

1034
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,560
I have things to do.

1035
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:07,440
What are you looking for?

1036
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:10,440
I can't find one of my cuff links.

1037
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,760
I'd put it away.

1038
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:14,880
I found it on the floor and put it here.

1039
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,520
Mom?

1040
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:25,840
I have no one else but you.

1041
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:29,240
Please don't be upset with me.

1042
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:34,160
If you turn your back on me too,

1043
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,360
I'll be lost.

1044
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:39,320
Please.

1045
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:48,080
You will never do something so crazy ever again.

1046
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:50,000
I promise.

1047
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:53,280
I won't take a single step without your permission.

1048
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:59,000
We need to figure out this Nezir business first.

1049
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,640
We can't trust him.

1050
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,440
He'll get his dues for a any favor he does.

1051
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:04,800
Okay.

1052
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,760
Don't think I forgot what you said about Ateş.

1053
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:13,840
There is no way, accept that.

1054
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,840
I'll create such a way, you'll see.

1055
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:05,320
It's this house.

1056
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,400
But before we go in, Abbas may be inside,

1057
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:10,720
keep your temper under control, Ateş.

1058
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,840
I hope he is.

1059
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,240
I'll kill him.

1060
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:17,240
It hasn't even been five minutes since I told you to keep calm, bro.

1061
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:29,600
Where is Abbas?

1062
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:30,720
Abbas?

1063
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:35,600
Why would that lowlife be here? There's no one inside.

1064
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:37,080
It's just me.

1065
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:07,600
She's lying.

1066
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:15,120
There were a coat and men's shoes inside.

1067
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:23,440
I won't turn myself in before I get that money, don't worry.

1068
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,320
Cemal, go! I'll circle around the back.

1069
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:30,080
I swear he just jumped in front of me, it wasn't my fault, I swear!

1070
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:31,160
Okay, calm down.

1071
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:32,640
You saw what I happened!

1072
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:34,360
Okay, calm down, have a seat.

1073
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:35,640
Sit.

1074
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:39,040
Tell me! Why did you shoot Mercan?

1075
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:43,600
Speak!

1076
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,040
Damn it!

1077
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:55,040
Ateş, are you okay?

1078
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:57,840
I'm okay, it's fine.

1079
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,560
What happened to you?

1080
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:54,560
Why are you home at this time, son?

1081
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,960
Ateş, what happened?

1082
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:03,160
Ateş, are you okay?

1083
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,360
Don't panic.

1084
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,920
It's just a scratch.

1085
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,360
What do you mean just a scratch?

1086
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:12,560
We lost Abbas.

1087
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:21,240
He got hit by a car just as we caught him.

1088
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,160
He died before he could talk.

1089
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,600
It's obvious why he did it.

1090
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:40,000
It was revenge for firing him.

1091
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,680
You should've left it to the police.

1092
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,360
Thank god, you're fine.

1093
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:05,200
They're calling from the company.

1094
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,080
If something happens to my son because of you,

1095
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:20,880
I'll bury you alive under this house.

1096
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:21,840
Let me go.

1097
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:23,440
I'll bury you alive.

1098
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,560
Welcome.

1099
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:05,880
Thank you.

1100
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:10,400
What a pretty place.

1101
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:12,560
I'm glad you like it.

1102
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:15,480
You look so smart.

1103
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:22,280
You're beautiful, as always.

1104
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,680
Have a seat.

1105
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:31,240
Thank you.

1106
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,560
Let me.

1107
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:56,320
You've been really down lately.

1108
02:04:57,600 --> 02:05:00,600
That Berat business really upset you.

1109
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:03,720
I just wanted to see you happy.

1110
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:08,200
And of course, I wanted it to be just the two of us.

1111
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:10,720
You're so sweet.

1112
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:14,640
I didn't know you were such a romantic.

1113
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:17,960
I didn't think I was either,

1114
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,240
until meeting you.

1115
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:25,760
Çiçek.

1116
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:34,280
I want today to be a special day for us.

1117
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:53,080
Berat?

1118
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:57,640
Let's see what you're up to now.

1119
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:17,240
This is your first and last reminder, Berat.

1120
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:19,920
You'll pay the first installment in a week.

1121
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:22,280
There is no delaying with us, son.

1122
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:25,320
And if there is, then the payment doubles.

1123
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:27,000
He went to a loan shark.

1124
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:30,040
What are we going to do, we're doomed!

1125
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:35,120
What do I do? What are we going to do now?

1126
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:44,640
What have you done, Berat?

1127
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:46,160
What have you done?

1128
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:47,960
What are you talking about, mom?

1129
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,440
You went to a loan shark.

1130
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:52,720
No, I didn't.

1131
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:55,560
Don't lie to me, Berat. I saw the message they sent.

1132
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:56,920
Look what it says here.

1133
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:59,440
It says this is your first and last reminder,

1134
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:02,080
that your debt doubles if you don't pay, Berat!

1135
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,960
Berat, what have you done?

1136
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:08,520
What are we going to do?

1137
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,720
I had no other choice, mom.

1138
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:15,760
I didn't do this for myself.

1139
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:17,520
I did everything for you,

1140
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:19,600
for us, for Çiçek.

1141
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:23,120
Son, do you think going to a loan shark is a joke?

1142
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:25,320
Don't you know about these guys, don't you

1143
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:27,360
remember what happened to Murat, Berat?

1144
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:30,360
What are we going to do now?

1145
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:33,520
What can we do now?

1146
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:39,200
Mom? Mom! Okay, calm down, please.

1147
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:41,240
Calm down, mom.

1148
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:42,880
They'll kill us all.

1149
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,680
They're going to kill us, Berat.

1150
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,560
Do you remember these?

1151
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,480
Let me remind you.

1152
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:39,040
One day, a kid showed up in front of me,

1153
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:40,320
wearing these clothes.

1154
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:46,600
A kid in terrible condition, on the brink of death.

1155
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,560
He got better,

1156
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:55,680
and he cried that they'd killed his sister, asked me for help.

1157
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:05,880
It wasn't just his clothes in terrible condition,

1158
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:08,520
but his soul, his world, everything was in shambles.

1159
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:18,520
He had nowhere to go and no one to take care of him.

1160
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:35,360
And that woman embraced that orphan,

1161
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:37,320
helpless boy and surrounded him with love.

1162
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:42,360
She opened her door for him.

1163
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:47,320
But that woman knew that the boy's wounds would not heal.

1164
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,880
She asked him,

1165
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:54,440
"what do you want from me to put out the fire inside you, son?"

1166
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:57,880
Now, tell me.

1167
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:02,600
It's been years but that wasn't a day to be forgotten.

1168
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:10,600
What did the boy ask of that woman, Ateş?

1169
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:22,200
I want to take revenge

1170
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:24,680
on Haydar, his whole family.

1171
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:43,920
I'm not sure if you still want the same thing or not, son.

1172
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,520
Nothing's changed.

1173
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:02,400
That boy still wants the same thing.

1174
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:07,920
And no one can stop him.

1175
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,120
You haven't touched your plate, Çiçek.

1176
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:25,680
Do you not like it?

1177
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:28,800
No, it's not that. I like it.

1178
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:30,800
I like it but...

1179
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:35,440
Something's up with you.

1180
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:41,440
Malik, we need to talk.

1181
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:43,520
Let me speak first.

1182
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:51,080
Çiçek, look.

1183
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:55,520
Seeing you so on edge and sad really upsets me.

1184
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:00,160
I don't want you to be afraid of anything,

1185
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:01,280
as long as I'm here.

1186
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:06,200
My love for you runs so deep

1187
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:10,760
I promise to protect you until the day I die.

1188
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:11,840
Malik...

1189
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:13,360
I know you're upset about your family.

1190
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:16,400
I'll figure everything out.

1191
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:17,880
I promise.

1192
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:26,840
Malik, I want to break up.

1193
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:48,240
What are you saying, Çiçek?

1194
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:51,760
Mom wouldn't approve, Malik.

1195
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:56,040
This relationship has been a mistake all along.

1196
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:00,680
We're already struggling as a family,

1197
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:03,240
I can't put this on them on top of everything.

1198
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:11,560
Çiçek, listen. We love each other, don't we?

1199
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:15,480
Why wouldn't your mom approve? If you love me and I love you,

1200
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:17,600
we'll overcome everything together,

1201
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:19,800
we can figure everything out together, Çiçek.

1202
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:24,040
Goodbye, Malik.

1203
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:24,920
Çiçek!

1204
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:52,440
Let me see your wound.

1205
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:05,200
Are those your childhood clothes?

1206
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,480
That doesn't concern you.

1207
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:12,480
I was just curious.

1208
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:15,000
What were you so curious about?

1209
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:21,480
The awful childhood I had without a mom or dad,

1210
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:28,160
or how I managed to survive despite all the pain I've endured?

1211
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:34,120
Don't worry, it's all gone now.

1212
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:40,800
It doesn't seem to have passed completely.

1213
02:16:42,640 --> 02:16:44,640
You're still affected by the past.

1214
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:52,320
You've risked your life for me,

1215
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:54,080
don't do that again.

1216
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:14,920
This was Tahir's favorite color.

1217
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,840
He'd lost his whole family, just like you.

1218
02:17:27,880 --> 02:17:31,280
I hope he's been as lucky as you are to have built a good life for himself.

1219
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:37,280
Who knows.

1220
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:42,200
Maybe he's okay now.

1221
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:46,280
I hope so.

1222
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:22,520
The man died, Nezir.

1223
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:24,480
I know.

1224
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,880
Mr. Nezir, it's done.

1225
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:37,160
It was a clean job, don't worry.

1226
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:39,800
Whatever your order is I'm ready, Mr. Nezir.

1227
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,480
I know, I heard about it.

1228
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:49,520
What if it comes out that he's innocent?

1229
02:18:50,720 --> 02:18:53,400
I'm diligent with what I do, Aslı.

1230
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:55,200
This Abbas is not a random man.

1231
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,200
Mercan had fired that lowlife from the company.

1232
02:18:58,240 --> 02:19:00,160
Ateş wouldn't suspect anything.

1233
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:01,040
Be at ease.

1234
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:02,560
Okay.

1235
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:06,560
If we're done with this business, what is out next move?

1236
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:09,120
It's time to pay up, Aslı.

1237
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:14,440
You know I want Mercan.

1238
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:16,520
You'll bring her to me.

1239
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:21,800
But she won't get as much as a scratch.

1240
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,880
If you hurt her, I won't be so understanding with you.

1241
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:31,040
Okay, I'll bring her to you.

1242
02:19:59,000 --> 02:19:59,920
What is it?

1243
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:03,920
I...

1244
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:07,960
I'm going to look for Tahir.

1245
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:11,640
Would you help me?

1246
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:15,760
It'd be easier to find him, if you helped.

1247
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,040
Hello, everyone.

1248
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:34,800
Rıza...

1249
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:39,280
You're not going to welcome me, brother?

1250
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:50,000
Uncle Rıza!

1251
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:52,480
My dear niece!

1252
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:56,480
My beautiful niece.

1253
02:21:56,480 --> 02:21:57,840
I missed you.

1254
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:37,800
There's no one here, Eylül.

1255
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:39,320
Let's go.

1256
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:44,640
Where are you off to?

1257
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:47,040
Didn't I tell to not to leave the tool shed?

1258
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:49,880
We're leaving.

1259
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:51,200
Go back inside, come on.

1260
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:52,760
Go inside, you're not going anywhere.

1261
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:54,560
Go.

1262
02:22:57,440 --> 02:23:02,280
Don't get cross with me or I swear I'll break your legs, okay?

1263
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,440
Quiet! Shush.

1264
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:34,840
This must be our son in law, huh?

1265
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:02,920
I know you.
