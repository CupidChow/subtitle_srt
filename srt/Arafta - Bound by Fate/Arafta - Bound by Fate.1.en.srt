Truth does not dwell in the brilliance of light, but hides in the darkness of shadow.
Like love it eludes the eye, yet resounds through the deepest chambers of the heart.

Episode 1

4
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,000
"187 DAYS AGO"

5
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,760
Run! Hurry! This way!

6
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,440
You can’t escape anymore!

7
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,840
You won’t get away!

8
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,640
Run! This way!

9
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Mercan!

10
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,000
You know you can’t escape!

11
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,280
A rookie fish caught in the nets?

12
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
No, no.

13
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
A water nymph.

14
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,800
What are you doing on my boat?

15
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,960
Hold on!

16
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,680
There's no need. I can handle it.

17
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
I said hold on!

18
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
I’ll get you out.

19
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
What are you doing?!

20
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
I'm holding you.

21
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Let go!

22
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,960
What do you think you're doing?

23
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
You said let go.

24
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
And I did.

25
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,960
I need to get back to shore.

26
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Turn around, now!

27
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,520
Nope. I’ve got things to do.

28
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Hey!

29
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
I’m talking to you.

30
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,400
Look at me!

31
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,920
I'm talking to you. Don't
you hear me? Turn back!

32
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Can’t hear you!

33
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Turn back!
What?

34
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,200
I have to go back.

35
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,560
My family will be worried.
Don't you understand?

36
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,616
Let go! What do you think you're doing?

37
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,240
I'm telling you to turn back!

38
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,360
I’m the captain of this boat.

39
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,920
You’re a stowaway.

40
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,480
That means I make the rules.

41
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,560
Got it?

42
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,720
Your family can wait a little longer.

43
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,960
And why were you hiding, huh?

44
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,800
Start by explaining that!

45
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,640
That’s none of your business.

46
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,200
If it’s my boat, it is my business.

47
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,880
Stop! What are you doing?

48
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,400
Kidnapping Haydar Yıldırım’s daughter, huh?

49
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,920
I’ll make them all regret it.

50
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,240
If she’s hurt even a little,
I’ll tear this city apart.

51
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,680
Aunt Nermin, take this.

52
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,280
Thank you, sweetheart.

53
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,680
You should go home, it’s late.

54
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
We’ll call you if anything happens.

55
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,480
No way, Aunt Nermin.

56
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,120
I can't leave before Mercan’s
found? She’s my sister.

57
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,560
I’m not going anywhere
until I know she’s okay.

58
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,360
Thank you, sweetheart.

59
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,920
Mercan!

60
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,640
You know you can’t escape.

61
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,360
I’m going to catch you.

62
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,600
No stopping till we find her.

63
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,160
I’ll make her regret it.

64
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,640
Move faster… this way!

65
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,800
Run! This way.

66
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
You idiot!

67
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,800
You couldn’t even handle one girl!

68
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,080
-But, bro... -Enough!

69
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Go that way.

70
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,640
Let me know if you find the girl.

71
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
You’ve got nowhere left to run.

72
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,960
Is anyone there?!

73
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
Somebody help me!

74
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,240
Help!

75
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,360
Don’t waste your breath.

76
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,080
No one can hear you out here.

77
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Stay back!

78
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,560
Don’t come any closer!

79
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,080
Any news, brother?

80
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
What did you do?

81
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,640
The police are searching everywhere.

82
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,760
We’ve sent out our men too.

83
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,440
We’ll find her, don’t worry.

84
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Come here, you!

85
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Uncle Haydar!

86
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,720
-Haydar, stop! -Don’t you dare interfere!

87
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Move back!

88
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,240
What kind of mess did you drag us into?

89
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Huh!

90
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,920
Dad, I’m sorry I messed up. If I’d
known, I never would’ve gotten involved.

91
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Look, I'll kill you right now.

92
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
I'll kill you.

93
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,800
How can you go to a loan shark
without asking me, you idiot, huh?!

94
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,880
Do you see what you’ve dragged us into?!

95
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,520
Dad, please forgive me. I swear I
wouldn’t have done it if I’d known.

96
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,640
You better pray we find your sister.

97
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,560
Anything happens to my
daughter, I’ll dig two graves.

98
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,720
You hear me?!

99
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Uncle Haydar.

100
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Uncle Haydar.

101
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,520
Come on, let’s talk over here.

102
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,240
Oh, my son. Are you okay?

103
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,160
I really didn’t expect
this from you, Uncle Haydar.

104
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,560
Was it really worth it for a few bucks?

105
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,840
If you’d accepted my offer,
none of this would’ve happened.

106
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,520
Is it any better now?

107
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,760
Nezir,

108
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,800
do they ever listen?

109
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,520
I told them so many times.

110
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,040
But Mercan’s stubbornness…

111
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
All right.

112
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,200
First we find Mercan. Then we talk.

113
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,960
Clearly, we need to rethink everything.

114
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,600
You.

115
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Take my hand.

116
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
(Stunned) You?

117
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,560
Come on, hop on!

118
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,080
Hurry up

119
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,320
or you'll be left here.

120
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
You’re such a klutz.

121
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,440
You’re the klutz!

122
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Why did we stop?

123
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
We’re staying here.

124
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
No way.

125
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,360
We can't stay here.

126
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,640
I don’t think you get a vote.

127
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,880
It’s almost dark.

128
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,920
There’s no way we’ll find the path
now. We’ll have to wait for morning.

129
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,440
You think we can make
it through the night here?

130
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,920
The horse is gone!

131
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,400
My God, what am I going to do
with this man in this darkness?

132
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,560
Don’t be scared.

133
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,840
They won’t find us here.

134
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,720
I’m not scared!

135
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,960
Sure looks that way.

136
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,160
Why would you leave
your phone on the horse?

137
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,000
Sorry.

138
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,920
I didn’t expect you to spook
my horse and make it bolt.

139
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,640
As if I did it deliberately?

140
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Who were those men?

141
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,800
How do they know you?

142
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,840
I don’t know them.

143
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
They sure seemed to know you.

144
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,600
I said I don’t know them.

145
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
What about you? Small world.

146
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,040
What were you doing there?

147
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
How did you find me?

148
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Your screams.

149
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,600
First on the boat, now here.

150
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,440
Bit too much of a
coincidence, don’t you think?

151
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,680
I don’t recall inviting you onto my boat.

152
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,400
Or maybe it’s fate.

153
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,000
It’s a little swollen,

154
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,920
but nothing serious.

155
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Still hurts!

156
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,960
Don’t come any closer!

157
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Don't touch me!

158
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,640
What do you think you're doing?

159
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,800
I’m wrapping your ankle.

160
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,560
What did you think I was doing?

161
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,280
Sit here.

162
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,480
I can’t stay here. I want to leave.

163
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,560
I said I want to leave!

164
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,560
Suit yourself.

165
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,360
I’m not holding you here.
The exit’s right there.

166
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,720
There’s nothing to be afraid of.

167
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,560
We don’t stop until we find that girl.

168
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,200
She’s going to regret this.

169
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,320
Be careful!

170
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,320
Search everywhere! Find her!

171
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Shush.

172
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,440
There's nobody here! Run! This way!

173
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,760
Still want to leave?

174
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,240
Still off. God, I’m going to lose it.

175
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,800
It's off.

176
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
He's not answering.

177
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,360
That’s enough, dear. Okay?

178
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,240
He turned off his phone.

179
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,560
How can you be so calm, Mom?

180
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Mrs. Müzeyyen...

181
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,320
this shopping list you gave me.

182
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,840
That's taken care of.

183
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,840
I left the eggplants in the kitchen.
But they forgot the turnip juice.

184
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,200
They’ll send it.

185
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,520
So, there's no problem.

186
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,440
Alright, son. Thank you.

187
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,120
Unbelievable!

188
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,320
Ates is missing and you’re talking
about eggplants and turnip juice?

189
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,560
Come now, Aslı.

190
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,240
Didn’t he say, on his way out,

191
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,360
not to worry if we couldn’t reach him?

192
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,560
So we’re just not supposed to worry?

193
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
I mean… yeah.

194
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,080
Aslı!

195
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Enough already!

196
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Okay, Mom, but we still
don’t know what’s going on.

197
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,720
If something were wrong, we’d know.

198
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,520
You need to stay calm. We all do.

199
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,360
We have to get used to this.

200
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,760
Come closer. You’ll freeze over there.

201
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,160
I misunderstood, okay...

202
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,160
Thanks.

203
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
For what?

204
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,240
You risked your life for me.

205
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,400
Don’t make a big deal out of it.

206
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,200
I’d have done the same for anyone.

207
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Grumpy thing.

208
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,120
Isn’t it strange?

209
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
What is?

210
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Fire.

211
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,400
Watching it calms me.

212
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,360
It’s like a heartbeat in the dark.

213
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,840
It destroys,

214
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,200
but it also gives life.

215
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,840
Stand near it and you’re warm,

216
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,640
touch it and it burns.

217
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,040
It’s terrifying,

218
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,320
yet somehow comforting.

219
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,400
In its eyes, there’s both rage

220
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,040
and a warmth that invites you in.

221
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,240
Like... it’s stuck between worlds.

222
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What's your name?

223
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Ates.

224
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,480
-I’m... -I’m not interested in your name.

225
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,400
Grumpy and weird.

226
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,040
Just like fire.

227
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,080
My family must be worried sick.

228
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,760
My dad’s probably lost his mind.

229
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,960
He’s probably turned
Istanbul upside down by now.

230
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,080
Do you have family?

231
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,000
Tell me about yourself.

232
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Wait, are you seriously going to sleep?

233
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Shush.

234
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Quiet.

235
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,400
You better sleep.

236
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,720
No way! I’m not closing
my eyes in these conditions.

237
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,840
Suit yourself.

238
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,880
Savage. Jerk.

239
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,560
Did you say something?

240
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,680
No, I didn't.

241
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Hey,

242
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
are you asleep?

243
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,600
I will be, if you let me.

244
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,080
I don’t even know how it happened.

245
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,400
I never fall asleep like that.

246
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,200
I must’ve just dozed off.

247
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,640
Would it kill you to say something?

248
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,480
You say something?

249
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,120
How are we going to get out of this place?

250
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
He’s back.

251
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
Oh, thank God.

252
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,200
-What was his name again? -Gölge.

253
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,040
Welcome back, Gölge.

254
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,400
The phone?

255
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,520
Where's the phone?

256
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Hello, Dad?

257
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,440
I’m okay.

258
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,800
Wait, wait. Calm down.

259
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Just come to the place I tell you, okay?

260
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,440
It all happened so fast,
Dad… They blocked my car…

261
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,360
I ran away. They followed me.

262
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
So,

263
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,640
where are they?

264
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,200
We’re in the right place, aren’t we?

265
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,960
This is the spot Mercan mentioned.

266
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
My sweetheart!

267
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,320
-Sweetheart. -Dad!

268
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Darling.

269
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
Praise be.

270
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,560
We were scared to death, sweetheart.

271
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Thank God.

272
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,280
I was so worried about you. I was scared.

273
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Darling...

274
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,120
They didn’t hurt you?

275
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
You’re okay?

276
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,480
I’m fine, don’t worry.

277
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,360
You saved my daughter, young man.

278
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
We owe you.

279
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,400
Anyone would’ve done the same.

280
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,880
We don’t like being in debt.

281
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,000
We settle our scores.

282
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,520
A simple thank-you isn’t enough.

283
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,680
No arguments.

284
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,680
I’ll send you the time and address.

285
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,320
You and your family are invited
to dinner at the mansion tonight.

286
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,480
Alright.

287
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
Let’s go then.

288
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,040
Come on, sweetheart.

289
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Come on.

290
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Come, my sweetheart.

291
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,080
-You're okay, right? -I'm fine.

292
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,600
I need to stop by the office.

293
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,560
I’ll come by later and pick up Demet.

294
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
You get some rest.

295
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,040
Okay. Thanks.

296
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,640
Sweetheart!

297
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,400
Sweetheart.

298
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,840
I was so worried about you.

299
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,520
Are you alright?

300
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,560
I’m fine, Mom.

301
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,240
Mercan, are you alright?

302
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,280
I’m sorry.

303
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,400
Don’t be. We’ll get through this.

304
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,240
I was dying of worry!

305
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,680
You’re telling me every single detail.

306
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
Okay.

307
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,680
Let's talk to Mercan first.

308
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,480
She’ll come to you after.

309
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,760
Come on, sweetheart.

310
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,040
Let's go, darling.

311
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,720
Son?

312
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Sweetheart.

313
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,520
- Welcome home.
- Good to be back, Müzeyyen Ana.

314
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,640
Why do you turn off your phone?

315
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,000
(Playful) Missed me that much?

316
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,000
She chewed our ears off all night.

317
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Didn’t I tell you not to worry about me?

318
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,800
Oh, don’t mind her, son.

319
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,880
Forget all that. Just
tell us what happened.

320
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,520
I met Haydar Yıldırım.

321
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,880
He invited all of us to dinner tonight.

322
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,320
-I spoke with Nezir. -Dad, don’t.

323
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,280
Sweetheart, don’t cut me off. Listen to me.

324
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,160
Look, I listened to you,

325
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,720
gave it time.

326
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,920
But now you see, we’re out of time.

327
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,760
Just a little longer, Dad.

328
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,200
The project’s done. I’m
meeting with investors.

329
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,120
Someone will eventualy take it.

330
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,160
Darling, the ship’s
sunk, the oars are gone.

331
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,600
It's over.

332
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,080
This isn’t child’s play. What
if something had happened to you?

333
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,040
Do we need to lose
someone to wake up? Enough.

334
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,200
I’ve listened to you long enough.

335
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,840
Now it’s my turn.

336
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,960
I don’t want to marry Nezir.

337
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,200
This isn’t about what you want anymore.

338
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,480
We’re out of options.

339
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,720
But if you marry him,
he’ll pay off our debt.

340
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,920
I don’t want to force you into marriage.

341
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,080
Thanks to your useless
brother, we’re in this hole.

342
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,720
We have no other way out.

343
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,840
Also,

344
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,320
Nezir’s a good man.

345
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,600
You’ll grow to love him.

346
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,840
Dad, what are you saying?

347
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,920
You can’t order someone to love.

348
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
No, Dad.

349
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,640
It's impossible.

350
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,240
I won’t marry him.

351
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,200
Ask anything else, just not this.

352
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,840
Is that so?

353
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,680
Is this your final word?

354
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,080
It is.

355
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,480
Fine. Okay.

356
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,960
Alright then, have it your way!

357
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,440
-Dad, what are you doing? -Stop! Stay back.

358
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,840
You’ve made your decision.
Now I’ll make mine.

359
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,520
Dad! Put the gun down. What are you doing?

360
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,520
Don't.

361
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,000
Stay back.

362
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,320
What’s all this yelling?

363
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,320
Haydar! What are you doing?

364
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,960
She's made her decision. Now it's my turn.

365
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,880
Mom, say something!

366
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,920
What are you doing, dad?! Put it down.

367
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,840
Get out. Get out!

368
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,600
Haydar, please, I beg you.

369
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,200
You rejected it. Didn't you?

370
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,120
It's all because of you.

371
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,680
Because your life is more valuable.

372
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,320
Enough!

373
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,880
Fine! Whatever you want. Fine.

374
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,160
I’ll marry him.

375
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,800
Haydar...

376
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,080
Haydar, are you insane? What did you do?

377
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,320
- Were you really going to kill yourself?
- Yeah, I was going to kill myself.

378
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360
Don’t be ridiculous.

379
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,800
What other way was there to convince her?

380
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,080
Don’t you have a tissue or something?

381
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,480
Faking tears is harder than I thought.

382
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,240
My God, help me.

383
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,880
Help me.

384
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,920
Mercan, what happened?

385
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,880
Are you going to tell me what’s going on?

386
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I’m getting married.

387
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,440
What?

388
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,880
To who?

389
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,760
Your brother.

390
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,240
Am I supposed to be happy or heartbroken?

391
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,040
What are you putting me through?

392
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,280
You said you wouldn’t marry him.

393
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,000
You said you didn’t love him.

394
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,000
I don’t love him, anyway.

395
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,800
But I have no choice.

396
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,360
I tried everything just
to pay off that debt.

397
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,720
You know I did.

398
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,520
But I failed.

399
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,480
Ah, Murat Abi…

400
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,280
Sweetheart, you know
how much you mean to me.

401
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,960
Whatever you decide, I’ll stand by you.

402
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,560
And don’t be afraid of my brother.

403
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,080
He may seem harsh, but
he’s a good man deep down.

404
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,080
You know he changed after our parents died.

405
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,320
Life made him angry.

406
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,720
But I know he loves you.

407
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,720
He’d never hurt someone he cares about.

408
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,640
He won’t hurt you, I promise.

409
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,680
Don’t waste your breath.

410
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,160
There’s no sentence
that can ease this pain.

411
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,600
That was quick, brother.

412
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,160
Must’ve overdone it on the kebab.

413
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,720
It weighed me down.

414
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,880
Sure it did.

415
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,320
You hit like I’m your enemy, bro.

416
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,000
If we wanted to play
games, we’d go to the park.

417
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,680
Let’s not get into all that.

418
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,440
You haven’t said anything about last night.

419
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,640
How’d it go? What did you talk about?

420
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,040
Nothing.

421
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,240
You go get ready. I’ll take
a quick dip and be right back.

422
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,320
Alright, bro.

423
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,120
Go cool off, at least.

424
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,560
Nezir, welcome dear.

425
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,280
Thank you.

426
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,800
I can’t tell you how happy I am.

427
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,840
Brother! Congratulations.

428
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,520
Well then. All the best.

429
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,960
Thank you.

430
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,480
You look beautiful.

431
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,440
Thanks.

432
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,280
For you.

433
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,200
That’s not necessary.

434
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,040
Thank you.

435
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,280
Let me see. Oh, how elegant.

436
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,120
He’s got taste.

437
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,160
I’ve started the paperwork.

438
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,200
We’ll have a quick civil ceremony soon.

439
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,240
I’ve waited for this day for so long.

440
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,200
I’m so happy.

441
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,440
What business do we have
with people God-knows-who?

442
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,680
Who knows what kind of types will show up.

443
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,440
Probably tasteless, uncultured.

444
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,520
They’re here!

445
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,880
Son?

446
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,560
Welcome.

447
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,560
-Welcome. -Hello.

448
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,200
Welcome.

449
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,600
Welcome.

450
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,720
Pleased to meet you.

451
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,160
Let's head to the table.

452
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,360
Please.

453
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,680
So we owe you our daughter’s life.

454
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,040
Mercan is our pride and joy.

455
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,960
We can’t thank you enough.

456
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,760
And you are…?

457
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,560
You wouldn’t know us. We’ve
been abroad for a long time.

458
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,640
Just returned.

459
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,160
We’re here now.

460
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,960
You must be his mother.

461
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,080
She’s like a mother to me.

462
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,240
I owe her my life.

463
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,920
Is that so?

464
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,560
How lovely.

465
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,720
We’ve never crossed
paths, that’s why I asked.

466
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,960
Seems like we’ll be seeing
each other more often now.

467
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,480
What do you do, young man?

468
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,880
I’m a civil engineer.

469
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,960
Working on a new investment project.

470
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,680
Is that so?

471
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,240
So we're in the same field.

472
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,920
If we can help in any way, don’t hesitate.

473
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,000
Everyone knows us. We carry weight.

474
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,320
Thank you.

475
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,480
Binnaz, start the service!

476
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,560
I believe you're Mr. Ates's sister.

477
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,800
I'm not.

478
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
She's my daughter.

479
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,440
They grew up together.

480
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,560
Enjoy it.

481
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,280
Thank you.

482
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,760
Thank you.

483
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,920
Thanks.

484
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,200
Any time.

485
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,160
Well, now that we’re all friends,
there’s a wedding coming up.

486
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,520
My daughter is marrying Nezir Keseroğlu.

487
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,960
We hope to see you there.

488
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,560
Congratulations.

489
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,960
Thank you.

490
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,120
How wonderful. Congratulations.

491
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,400
Enjoy your meal. Let’s
not let the soup cool down.

492
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,920
3 DAYS LATER...

493
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,400
Bring the hairdresser
to the room, let her wait.

494
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,840
Have the flowers arrived?

495
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,640
Good.

496
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,400
You know where to place them.

497
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,080
I don’t want anything going wrong.

498
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,240
Sweetheart, honestly, I can’t
tell if you’re the bride or I am.

499
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,840
Took you forever to get ready.

500
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,040
I’ve run myself ragged
trying to get everything done.

501
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,720
You didn’t even bother
with a wedding dress.

502
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,840
I told you none of this was necessary.

503
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,800
I didn’t even want this marriage, anyway.

504
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,480
Come now, give me a break.

505
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,760
If it were up to you,
we’d be a laughingstock.

506
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,080
Fine, I won’t say anything.

507
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,720
Just fix that face. Enough already.

508
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,120
Dad…

509
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,320
There has to be another way.

510
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,360
Sweetheart, accept it.
Can we please move on?

511
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,280
Your wedding is about to start.

512
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,400
Come on.

513
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,000
Ah! They’re here. They're here.

514
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,400
Come on. Come on, sweetheart.

515
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,400
My God, let there be a miracle, please.

516
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,040
Don’t let this marriage happen.

517
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,200
Please, my God.

518
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,720
I didn’t get a chance
to say it among others…

519
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,400
You look beautiful.

520
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,840
I know you didn’t want a wedding gown.

521
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,760
You're right. It all happened fast.

522
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,040
Come on.

523
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,680
Everyone's waiting for us.

524
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,240
You’re about to become my bride.

525
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,840
I don’t love you, Nezir.

526
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,160
You know that, right?

527
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,720
I know.

528
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,680
Then why?

529
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,680
Why marry a woman who doesn’t love you?

530
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,680
I’m not a patient man.

531
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,800
But when it comes to you,

532
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,080
I’d wait a lifetime.

533
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,960
One day you’ll love me.

534
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,320
I’ll make you love me.

535
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,640
And I’ll wait for that day.

536
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,040
I don’t understand.

537
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,080
Why force me with money? Like
I’m something to be bought.

538
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,280
Would you have married me any other way?

539
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,680
Never.

540
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,040
The fact that you want
someone you had to buy…

541
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,040
that hurts even more.

542
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,440
Mr. Nezir Keseroğlu,

543
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,480
Without any pressure,

544
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,040
of your own free will,

545
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,000
do you take Ms. Mercan
Yıldırım to be your lawful wife?

546
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,920
I do.

547
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,720
Ms. Mercan Yıldırım,

548
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,000
Without any pressure,

549
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,720
of your own free will,

550
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,920
do you take Mr. Nezir Keseroğlu
to be your lawful husband?

551
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,840
Please let this be a
nightmare. Let me wake up.

552
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,120
Dad, what have you done to me?

553
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,800
You?

554
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,440
What the hell is this?

555
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,760
Son?!

556
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,520
-Stop it! -Take it easy, old man!

557
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,480
-Come on! -What are you doing?!

558
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,720
Just move it!

559
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,160
You can't take her.

560
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,280
I'm not asking for permission.

561
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,920
Let go! Let go! What
are you doing?! Let go!

562
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,480
Let go!

563
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,680
Step back, you jerk!

564
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,560
You're going to pay for this!

565
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,120
Let go of my arm! What
do you think you’re doing?

566
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,840
-Get in the car. -I won't! Let go of me!

567
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,000
Let go of me!

568
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,800
I'm telling you to let go of me!

569
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,280
Put me down!

570
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,560
Shush. Be quiet.

571
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,680
Damn you, Ateş!

572
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,560
Nezir.

573
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,640
Nezir! Nezir!

574
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Damn it!

575
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,080
Are you insane?

576
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,720
What do you think you’re doing? My
father and Nezir won’t let this go!

577
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,320
I’ll destroy you, jerk!

578
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,400
You think you can steal
Mercan from her wedding?

579
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,200
They're shooting! Stop the car!

580
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,040
I’ll kill you, man!
I’ll be the one to end you.

581
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,640
You'll see. I’ll feed
your corpse to the dogs!

582
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,600
Ugh!

583
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,360
Damn it!

584
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,080
Damn it!

585
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,600
I said stop!

586
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,880
Fine. Look, I’m calm. I’m listening.

587
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,000
Why did you do this? Why did you take me?

588
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,960
Did you want to get married to that man?

589
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,320
What’s it to you? What’s it to you?

590
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:49,520
Whether I do or don’t!
Who the hell are you?!

591
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,640
Maybe I’m your savior. Maybe
I’m your executioner. Who knows?

592
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,560
You didn’t want to marry that man.

593
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,720
How do you know I didn’t?

594
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,280
I saw it in your eyes.

595
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,880
So I’m offering you another choice.

596
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,480
What choice?

597
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,640
What are you talking about?

598
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,640
If you want to find out get in the car.

599
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,040
What the hell!

600
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,200
They took my daughter right in front of me.

601
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,960
From her own wedding!

602
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:29,640
Find them. Bring them to me.

603
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:33,680
We’ve sent men everywhere.
We’ll find them, Dad.

604
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,920
Shush.

605
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,920
I have an offer.

606
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,760
Listen to me if you want
to protect your family.

607
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,520
Let’s hear what he has to say.

608
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,320
I know you’re drowning in debt.

609
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,760
I’m offering to pay it all off.

610
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,800
But I have conditions.

611
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,960
187 days.

612
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,920
187 days where everything
you have belongs to me.

613
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,160
Whatever I say goes.

614
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,440
No objections.

615
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,640
If you do what I ask

616
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,760
which is entirely up to me,

617
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:49,560
then at the end of those 187 days,
I’ll return everything I’ve taken.

618
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,960
You’ll go back to your
lives as if nothing happened.

619
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,360
One more condition.

620
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,320
I’ll marry your daughter.

621
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,520
At the end of the deal, I’ll divorce her.

622
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,120
In the pursuit of justice,

623
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,000
one loses his light.

624
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,520
He becomes trapped in darkness.

625
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,760
And slowly,

626
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,120
he goes blind to time itself.

627
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,160
But the wheels of
justice have begun to turn.

628
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,320
Patience has conquered time.

629
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,640
Now all that’s left inside
me is a firestorm of rage.

630
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,960
For the hell they made me live,

631
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,840
I’ll take their heaven.

632
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,640
From the ashes, a fire has risen.

633
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,680
And it will burn anyone who touches it

634
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,760
and everyone who caused it.

635
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,240
I’ll leave you in limbo.

636
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,800
You are not serious, are you?

637
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,880
Do you want to marry me for 187 days?

638
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,880
My offer is valid until tomorrow.

639
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,080
The time is running out.

640
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:36,240
You must have realized
it could be done by force.

641
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,680
Won't be able to force me to do anything.

642
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:50,560
What?

643
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,720
Did you propose to Haydar's daughter?

644
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,200
How could you do that?

645
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,000
There was no other way to eliminate Nezir.

646
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,520
If we look we could find a way.

647
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,280
I can't believe you, Ateş.

648
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,360
We didn’t start down this path like this.

649
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,560
This wasn't the plan.

650
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,400
Now the plan has changed.

651
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,880
Does someone marry for revenge, Ateş?

652
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,680
With someone whom you don't love.

653
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,880
Is this a game?

654
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,920
Moreover, with Haydar's daughter.

655
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,800
Cemal, say something too.

656
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,360
What can I say Aslı?

657
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,160
It is what it is.

658
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:29,360
No way.

659
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,336
There's no way this can happen.

660
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,360
I don't approve either.

661
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,360
It will happen, Müzeyyen mother.

662
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,160
It has to happen.

663
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,600
What kind of offer is this?

664
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,440
The man is clearly mocking us.

665
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,600
187 days.

666
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,960
Of course, we'll find out the
problem. Then I'll know what to do.

667
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,280
Calm down please.

668
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,240
While we stay calm, let's
pray that Nezir doesn't give up.

669
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,680
Whatever he does. We
don't need him anymore.

670
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,280
There is a better offer.

671
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,560
Don't look at me like that.

672
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,400
Haydar, It's worth thinking about.

673
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,360
Let's not rush into it.

674
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,520
No way. We should find out
who they are and what they are.

675
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,760
Let's see if what they say is true.

676
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,400
What will you investigate?

677
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,560
We promised to Nezir.

678
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,560
Son, forget about the Nezir for now.

679
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,720
We will endure for 187 days.

680
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,280
Then everything will be ours again.

681
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,280
Enough. Enough.

682
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,160
Are you aware of what you're saying?

683
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,680
Whoever makes the
better offer I will marry.

684
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,440
Like a piece of property
for sale in a tender.

685
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Right?

686
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,680
What are you arguing knowing
that I don't want to marry?

687
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,840
The man says he'll divorce her in days.

688
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,840
I can't believe.

689
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,480
You choose a death for
me from among the deaths.

690
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,840
You will notice me when you decide.

691
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,680
Mercan. Are you okay?

692
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,120
There's nothing, right?

693
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,120
Scoundrel didn't harm Mercan right?

694
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,240
We argue in vain.

695
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,040
I've made my decision.

696
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:13,160
Everyone better get used to it.

697
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,680
No, son, I can't get used to it.

698
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,520
Honestly, the more I think
the more the worse I feel.

699
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,560
Let's not drag the topic any further.

700
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,080
Let it drag on if it must.

701
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,160
Can't make desicions on your own.

702
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,120
We have all laid our hands on the gold.

703
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:32,160
Alright. Anyone with reservations
can be out of the plan.

704
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,600
Applies to everyone.

705
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,560
Okay, everyone just calm down.

706
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,880
If we start like this,
we won't see the end.

707
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,040
At least you could have asked us, son.

708
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:47,520
We could have talked.

709
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,040
If I had asked, would
you let me mother Müzeyyen?

710
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,840
This one is running wild,
causing chaos everywhere.

711
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,680
Why don't you stop him?

712
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,080
I was wondering when it will be my turn.

713
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:04,960
I want to understand how
it always ends up on me. God.

714
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,720
If you are done, shall
we get back to the work?

715
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:13,440
I'm sorry. I acted a bit impulsively.

716
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:15,840
But you don't say thet again.

717
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:17,840
I'm always by your side.

718
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:21,840
Also, this is my war too.

719
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:25,280
Okay.

720
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,080
Will you add marriage as a
condition to the partnership agreement?

721
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,680
I hope they won't accept.

722
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,280
What?

723
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,920
Don't expect me to hide my feelings.

724
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:45,400
They will accept. They are greedy.

725
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:47,960
They will.

726
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,160
I'll make them accept.

727
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:56,440
There isn't other way.

728
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,760
Damn, he stole the girl
I was going to marry.

729
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,160
He says that he will marry her.

730
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,000
Damn, I'm going to kill that man!

731
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,120
Nezir. Nezir, stop.

732
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,160
-Let me go! -Nezir!
Nezir!

733
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:31,800
It doesn't work that way Nezir.

734
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,480
Don't cut off your nose to spite your face.

735
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,280
Neighter profit nor loss matters to me.

736
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,760
Ateş will pay for this.

737
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,160
Mercan is my daughter.

738
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,440
If necessary, I'll take care of her. Okay?

739
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:48,400
If necessary. What is this now?

740
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,560
Look. You made a promise. Keep it.

741
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,320
Let’s not argue either.

742
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,856
I entrusted my daughter to you
and you couldn't take care of her.

743
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,280
What are you showing off?

744
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,560
Understood.

745
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,360
Everything has changed.

746
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:11,640
But be sure that I won't give up Mercan.

747
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,480
Okay? I won't give up.

748
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,920
Nezir. Nezir.

749
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,320
Nezir. Nezir.

750
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,280
Don't mind them.

751
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:37,560
Mercan will not accept
that man's offer. Understand?

752
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,720
Understand. I will handle it.

753
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,400
What am I living through Demet?

754
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,280
Why am I experiencing these?

755
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,680
It will pass, dear. It will pass.

756
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,400
It won't pass.

757
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,800
It gets worse every day.

758
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:36,680
I need to find a solution.

759
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:46,280
Where to Mercan?

760
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:06,400
Mother Müzeyyen was dropped to the mall.
Aslı is at the office for the contract.

761
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,400
Cemal. Cemal with his brother. As always.

762
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,280
These are today's topics.

763
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:15,920
It is good for them to away from home.

764
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:17,680
What are you doing?

765
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:19,960
Just passing time.

766
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,760
Has your guest arrived?

767
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,160
They should be here any time.

768
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:34,120
Talk of the devil and he is sure
to appear. It would be rude for them.

769
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,440
Let's talk man to man Ateş Karahan.

770
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:06,680
Okay. Nezir Keseroğlu.

771
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,920
You kidnapped my bride.

772
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,920
Of course it has a price.

773
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:18,280
If you be a man and beg
for forgiveness, that's okay.

774
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,680
Or else, I won't be
responsible for what happens.

775
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,240
Do you wonder what will happen?

776
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:34,160
I am excited brother. It is the
most exciting part of the movie.

777
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:42,720
Look Nezir. You came to
my home and threaten us.

778
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:47,360
Be careful. Or your end will be bad.

779
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,280
I don't talk nonsense.

780
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,400
Is this what you have?

781
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,440
We have talked enough.

782
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,320
Now go away.

783
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:20,800
What happens here?

784
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:24,640
What are you doing?

785
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,320
What are you doing here?

786
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,320
What are you doing here?

787
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,280
What are those guns? Are you out of minds?

788
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,200
He will pay what he has done to you.

789
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,320
He didn't do anything.

790
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,600
Please go Nezir.

791
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,360
I said go.

792
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,640
Let's go together.

793
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,560
Don't touch to my bride.

794
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,720
Or you will burn.

795
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,440
I'm staying here.

796
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:04,920
Please go.

797
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:09,440
Okay.

798
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:11,840
I will.

799
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:16,640
We will talk later.

800
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,320
Okay.

801
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,080
Let's meet soon.

802
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,640
Come with me.

803
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,400
What was that?

804
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:37,280
You ask the wrong guy.

805
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,280
Are you out of minds?

806
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:43,080
Would you shot each others
if I wasn't here? That's all?

807
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,560
Whatever needed to happen, would happen.

808
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,080
Is that all? That's it?

809
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,040
Why did you interrupt our excitement?

810
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:56,560
I want to talk.

811
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,760
I came to ask you to remove
the marriage requirement.

812
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,120
I have a better offer.

813
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:08,880
No. I won't accept.

814
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,160
Talk is over.

815
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,960
Where are you? We need to talk.

816
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,560
Are you here?

817
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,440
I need only five minutes.

818
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,000
Are you here? I'm coming.

819
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,000
What are you doing here?

820
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,160
Let me go.

821
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,800
What are you doing? Are
you a bully or something?

822
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,120
What are you doing?

823
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,960
You're the one who broke into
my house and caused trouble.

824
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:01,960
I didn't do anything.

825
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,480
I'm looking for you.

826
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Why?

827
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,920
I said that I want to
talk to you if you remember.

828
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,400
I said that no, if you remember.

829
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,960
Walk, get out.

830
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,320
I won't take your time.

831
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,080
Listen to me just two minutes.

832
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:40,120
Instead of marrying a person you've
just met, I have a professional offer.

833
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:46,880
As the person proposed to, don't
I have the right to say something?

834
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:51,720
Listen to me just two minutes, please.

835
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,720
Don't you give up?

836
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,040
Just two minutes. Then leave.

837
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,840
I have good projects.

838
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,280
We couldn't implement since
we couldn't find the resources.

839
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:13,160
Since you want to be a partner,
we won't have trouble with it.

840
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:17,320
They are high-profit projects,
as well as prestigious ones.

841
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Get to the point.

842
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,480
If you remove the marriage condition

843
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,360
I will give you the projects
with all their rights.

844
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,560
I work very hard, day and night.

845
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,560
I promise that you'll never regret.

846
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:33,920
No way.

847
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,640
The two minutes are up. Now leave.

848
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:41,640
Why?

849
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,520
I don't understand why you insist.

850
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:46,240
First you kidnapped
me, then proposed to me.

851
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,760
Why?

852
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,160
What didn't you understand?

853
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,200
It's just business.

854
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:52,600
Business.

855
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,960
187 days of marriage and business.

856
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,080
Why 187 days?

857
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,080
I made a better offer
than Nezir for winning.

858
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:04,880
For winning.

859
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:07,800
For winning, you marry someone
that you'll divorce, don't you?

860
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:09,720
Yes.

861
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:11,960
I did my offer and it's over.

862
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:14,800
Whether you accept it or not.

863
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:17,560
What are you questioning?

864
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,120
You say "Marry me." to someone
that you've just met. Is it normal?

865
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,200
Did you put too much
meaning into this offer?

866
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:40,400
How can I give meaning to such a marriage?

867
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,640
It's obvious that you aren't serious.

868
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,280
That's a ridiculous 187 days.

869
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:55,280
Maybe I'm serious.

870
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:58,120
Really serious.

871
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:04,200
The talk is over.

872
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,160
You can leave.

873
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:13,880
You know what?

874
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:15,960
I said maybe.

875
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,360
Maybe he is a good
person and understands me.

876
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,280
But I was wrong.

877
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,400
You aren't different from Nezir.

878
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:24,960
You are the same.

879
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:05,760
Come on.

880
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,080
Walk.

881
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:11,120
I can drop you.

882
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,080
I can go.

883
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,560
I said walk.

884
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:16,840
I will drop you.

885
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:25,200
May nothing bad happen to you.

886
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:28,400
What could be worse than you?

887
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,880
I said walk.

888
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,520
I'll drop the car off at the station.

889
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,320
Don't bother, Mr. Ateş. I'll take it.

890
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:03,000
No, I will drop.

891
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:06,200
I see the guys too.

892
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,360
What are you doing?

893
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,280
What are you doing?

894
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:35,400
Stop, I will take off.

895
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,360
Stop.

896
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:43,960
Stop or I'll jump out of the car.

897
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:53,640
Let me go.

898
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:54,720
Stay calm.

899
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,680
Sit quietly.

900
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:16,640
What do you think you're doing?

901
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,960
I'm teaching you that
you can't argue with me.

902
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:41,560
Mercan.

903
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:44,360
Mercan.

904
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:50,120
Why don't you leave me alone?

905
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:52,360
Leave me alone.

906
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:54,280
What were you doing there?

907
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,480
What did you talk with that man?

908
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,600
Mercan.

909
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,320
Answer.

910
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,160
What did you talk? Why is he following you?

911
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:09,640
I'm sorry.

912
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:13,600
I didn't want to yell.

913
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:15,200
I'm sorry, forgive me.

914
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:16,440
But I'm very nervous.

915
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:18,600
Okay, let's not drag it out.

916
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:20,080
Mercan.

917
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:23,240
Please understand me.

918
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:25,960
We couldn't talk.

919
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,400
I want to know what you are thinking.

920
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:32,680
What does it matter what I think?

921
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,600
Other people are thinking for me anyway.

922
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:06,760
Everyone looks gloomy.

923
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:09,000
There's something ominous.

924
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,640
Should we pour lead?

925
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,560
Let's pour mother.

926
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:17,240
I'm exhausted.

927
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:21,480
He found the right time to take leave.

928
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:23,640
I'm the one left with all the work.

929
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:27,800
I wish he would come back
so you could relax, right?

930
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:35,080
God damn.

931
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:38,640
There's no end to the noise
and commotion at that mansion.

932
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,480
There was trouble in the garden again.

933
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:44,800
Tell me what happened.

934
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:49,880
Mr. Nezir and lady Mercan were arguing.

935
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:52,880
I guess it was about the other guy.

936
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,480
Mr. Nezir were asking what they had talked.

937
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:58,920
I wonder what they talked.

938
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:01,480
I don't know.

939
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:05,560
However, he is burning away as his name.

940
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:09,320
I'm telling you. Things
are going to heat up more.

941
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:11,600
We'll see what will happen.

942
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:14,320
What will happen to us?

943
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,040
I haven't been paid for months.

944
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,480
We are working for peanuts.

945
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:23,760
Don't worry mom, I'm looking for a new job.

946
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:28,640
I'll check again if
there is a new one or not.

947
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:33,360
I wish our routine wouldn't be disrupted.

948
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,640
We'll be there soon mother Müzeyyen.

949
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:58,800
We chatted with friends.

950
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,400
She made dolma.

951
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,720
You eat. We'll eat when we come.

952
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:09,120
Do you want something?

953
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:11,160
Okay. See you.

954
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:14,400
She made stuffed meatballs.

955
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,800
Oh god. Brother walk fast.

956
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:18,600
The smell hit me.

957
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:20,960
They won't eat without us.

958
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,720
Yes. She can't eat without us.

959
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:33,080
Did you come out of a surprise egg?

960
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:40,280
What is it guys?

961
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,520
Mr. Nezir send greetings.

962
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:49,040
What do we do? I'm very hungry.

963
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:53,240
It's not right to ignore a greeting.

964
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:55,440
You're right.

965
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:46,600
I owe you a debt of gratitude, brother.

966
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:48,560
This Nezir is stubborn.

967
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:50,600
He sends his guys all the time.

968
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:55,880
If he wants to play, we can play.

969
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,600
Let's go. I'm hungry.

970
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,320
Here my lady.

971
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:11,720
Put it on the middle.

972
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:20,360
It is delicious my lady.
You put your foot in it.

973
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Haven't they come?

974
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:24,720
They are about to come.

975
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:27,880
Zehra, bring the salad and
şalgam. Don't forget the spicy one.

976
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:29,280
Okay my lady.

977
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:33,400
Desserts are delicious.
Ateş will love them.

978
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:36,440
We couldn't talk today.

979
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:39,080
You overreacted Ateş's marriage.

980
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:41,160
What about you?

981
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,960
What should I do mom? Should I be happy?

982
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:45,600
I don't understand.

983
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:47,360
You understand.

984
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,400
Aslı.

985
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:53,200
If you have any dream
about Ateş, forget it.

986
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:57,040
We talked these before and I warned you.

987
02:04:57,200 --> 02:04:58,200
I said no.

988
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:00,960
You said no.

989
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:02,200
You said it was childish.

990
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,480
I trusted you and said okay.

991
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:06,160
Right dear?

992
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:08,920
I remember all of them mom.

993
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:12,200
I don't have anything to
say different from then.

994
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:14,680
I don't have any feeling for Ateş.

995
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:17,640
Okay. The way you overreacted today.

996
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:19,960
What should I've done?

997
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:22,720
Should I have watched him make
a mistake right before my eyes?

998
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:25,360
Let's drop the subject please.

999
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:26,640
I think so too.

1000
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:28,840
But I'm watching you, know that.

1001
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:34,360
Brother. Do you see what I see?

1002
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:39,000
What is this table? Thank you so much.

1003
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:44,960
Thank you. Nobody makes
this better than you.

1004
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,360
What happened to your face?

1005
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
What happened?

1006
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:53,280
Zehra, bring ice right now.

1007
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:55,440
Are you okay?

1008
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:56,760
Nothing to exaggerate.

1009
02:05:58,080 --> 02:05:59,280
Got through unscathed.

1010
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:02,480
It's because of this girl, isn't it?

1011
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,480
What does that have to do with the girl?

1012
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:09,040
You know me.

1013
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:12,160
I couldn't stand it when two jerks
started talking, so I got into a fight.

1014
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:16,600
I knew that.

1015
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:19,480
That man's daughter will
bring trouble upon us.

1016
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:23,320
Don't marry her Ateş. Please
give up. I beg you give up.

1017
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:30,520
We had no choice but to take
this path. There's no turning back.

1018
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:33,400
Look, what a beautiful table.

1019
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:37,200
You made delicious dinner with your hands.

1020
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,480
Let's eat our dinner with enjoyment. Okay?

1021
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:41,360
What an enjoyment.

1022
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,600
We'll wash our hands and come then.

1023
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,760
Okay. Come on.

1024
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:52,000
I don't understand how you
extricate yourself from the situation.

1025
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:54,720
I couldn't teach you
how to keep your guard up.

1026
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:57,480
Brother.

1027
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:00,160
I think you don't try to teach me.

1028
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:02,280
How?

1029
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:05,840
Okay.

1030
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:09,000
You investigate anyway.

1031
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:15,760
Okay. Thank you.

1032
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,480
What happened? What is he saying?

1033
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:27,040
It is what Ateş told us.

1034
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:29,960
The man says the same thing. It was true.

1035
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:32,640
Good.

1036
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,600
They have money thank god.

1037
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:42,400
But, there isn't anything before 2015.

1038
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:47,280
Doesn't a person have a past, a lineage?

1039
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,360
They are as if they weren't alive.

1040
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:50,920
Haydar.

1041
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:53,480
You're looking for
reasons to be suspicious.

1042
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:57,520
Their offer is good. Forget the rest.

1043
02:07:58,400 --> 02:07:59,400
Nermin.

1044
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:02,160
I didn't turn my hair white in vain.

1045
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:05,680
Is 187 days even a reasonable offer?

1046
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:08,720
Even this number is enough for me to doubt.

1047
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,160
There's something about that
man that doesn't sit right with me.

1048
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:21,440
Murat. Son.

1049
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:32,960
Murat. Son.

1050
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,920
What have they done to you?

1051
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,440
May god curse the one who did that.

1052
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,320
What on earth is happening to us?

1053
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:52,360
Calm down for two minutes mother.

1054
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:54,160
God damn it calm down.

1055
02:08:58,840 --> 02:08:59,840
Brother.

1056
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:02,720
What happened to you? Are you okay?

1057
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:07,880
He isn't okay.

1058
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:09,160
He isn't okay.

1059
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:15,080
They will kill my son.

1060
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,000
Our struggle isn't over.

1061
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:24,400
What they want?

1062
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:34,000
We have to pay until tomorrow noon.

1063
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:35,200
Or else.

1064
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:37,720
Haydar.

1065
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,080
Haydar do something.

1066
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:41,080
Let it be over.

1067
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,280
I'm sick of it.

1068
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:48,800
I have my heart in my boots.

1069
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:52,680
They will kill my son.

1070
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:58,440
Okay.

1071
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:04,520
Call Nezir.

1072
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:06,840
Let's get this done.

1073
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:10,681
He can come tomorrow and
start the marriage preparations.

1074
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:17,160
Call Nezir.

1075
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:19,440
Let's get this done.

1076
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,281
He can come tomorrow and
start the marriage preparations.

1077
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:39,080
On one side, my family.

1078
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,400
The other side, the
marriage that I don't want.

1079
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:43,640
I'm at purgatory.

1080
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:45,960
God, lead the way.

1081
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Who is there?

1082
02:11:58,560 --> 02:11:59,560
Brother is that you?

1083
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:20,160
How could you find me?

1084
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:23,720
There is nobody that I
want to find and can't find.

1085
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:26,640
Who are you?

1086
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:28,880
Ateş Karahan, for a long time.

1087
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:33,400
Why are you here?

1088
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:36,840
I bring your car.

1089
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:38,080
It works.

1090
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:49,240
It wasn't necessary

1091
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:50,760
I could do it.

1092
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:53,800
Thanks anyway.

1093
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:00,160
Stop, one minute.

1094
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:09,920
I know that we talked.

1095
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:11,880
It wasn't good but.

1096
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,920
This is my last chance.

1097
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:17,320
Everything will change tomorrow.

1098
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:19,720
Please.

1099
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:22,720
Please remove the marriage requirement.

1100
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:24,800
I can sign the aggreement right now.

1101
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:26,640
I do whatever you want.

1102
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,320
I work hard. Day and night.

1103
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:29,720
Without any breath.

1104
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:33,800
Don't say no right away.

1105
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:35,800
Think again.

1106
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:38,160
Please.

1107
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:39,320
Please help me.

1108
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:41,720
No.

1109
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:46,840
Without marriage, no aggreement.

1110
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:28,560
Bake Murat's favorite
muffins for the breakfast.

1111
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:30,480
Okay my lady.

1112
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:32,840
Put one more plate to the table.

1113
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:34,240
Nezir will come.

1114
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:36,240
Haydar.

1115
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:37,800
What time did Nezir say he would come?

1116
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:39,120
They will come soon.

1117
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:41,080
They will apply for marriage today.

1118
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:44,240
Okay.

1119
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:46,000
Let's hope there won't be any problems.

1120
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:48,400
Did Mercan wake up?

1121
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:51,040
She woke up long ago. She went for a walk.

1122
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:52,920
Interesting.

1123
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:55,560
This girl makes me
die. What's the walk now?

1124
02:14:58,520 --> 02:14:59,520
I'm going to call.

1125
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:36,360
Are you following me?

1126
02:16:37,680 --> 02:16:38,680
Coincidence.

1127
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I'm sure it is.

1128
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:47,640
Our time is up.

1129
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:50,560
I need the answer.

1130
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:53,720
You will get it. Don't worry.

1131
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:16,600
I've been having bad days lately.

1132
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:18,720
Today is bad also.

1133
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:21,680
I don't have any hope for further.

1134
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:25,880
But there is something good.

1135
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:29,240
I won't see you again either.

1136
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:32,560
Don't be sure.

1137
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:49,456
Haydar will come to
an agreement with Nezir.

1138
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:50,480
Did you do what I said?

1139
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:52,360
I did. Waiting for the result.

1140
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:53,800
We will learn soon.

1141
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,160
Okay.

1142
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:57,000
Will there be any problem?

1143
02:17:57,480 --> 02:17:59,760
Brother, I'm sorry but it can happen.

1144
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:23,680
Ateş's offer was more appealing.

1145
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:25,520
Never mind.

1146
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:32,120
We are being saved.

1147
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:33,800
This is the important one.

1148
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:42,080
Where is Nezir?

1149
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:46,960
I don't know.

1150
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:50,440
No money has been deposited.

1151
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:53,360
He said that he would send in half an hour.

1152
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:56,240
Call him again.

1153
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:13,160
Welcome.

1154
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:25,920
Time is up.

1155
02:20:29,360 --> 02:20:30,360
What is your answer?

1156
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:36,720
Your offer did not suit us, Mr. Ateş.

1157
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:45,520
My daughter will marry Nezir.

1158
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:51,760
Don't make any problem.

1159
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,160
You understand what I meant.

1160
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:00,720
Do you think that too?

1161
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:04,720
You know what I think.

1162
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:18,256
Nezir was at the police station, dad.

1163
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:19,440
He is under investigation.

1164
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:20,880
His accounts have been seized.

1165
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:31,880
What? What are you talking about son?

1166
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:38,160
Oh my godness.

1167
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:42,920
What will we do Haydar?

1168
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:50,040
Let's not keep you any longer then.

1169
02:21:58,200 --> 02:21:59,760
Haydar. He is going, Haydar.

1170
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,480
One minute.

1171
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:19,240
Handled it smoothly.

1172
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:47,000
We accept your offer.

1173
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:58,080
With all conditions.

1174
02:23:07,720 --> 02:23:08,200
He is dead.

1175
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:09,920
He is dead, don't ask him again.

1176
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:11,760
Understand?

1177
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:13,440
You will do what I say.

1178
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:14,680
Say something.

1179
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:15,880
Say something.

1180
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:18,920
I'll make you regret doing this.

1181
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,600
You make me regret.

1182
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:25,080
You make me regret.

1183
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:26,600
Me.

1184
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:30,640
Make me regret.

1185
02:23:33,400 --> 02:23:34,400
Look at that boy.

1186
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:37,120
He will make me regret.

1187
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:42,480
The settlement day has come.

1188
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:37,720
With all conditions.

1189
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:46,920
Yes.

1190
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,480
My daughter will accept.

1191
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:02,360
She will marry you.

1192
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:47,080
This is a war.

1193
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:50,320
This fire was lit to turn
your paradise into hell.

1194
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,000
This is a war.

1195
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:56,680
And I walk fearlessly into this fire.

1196
02:25:57,240 --> 02:25:58,520
Without thinking about my end.

1197
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:02,960
There isn't turning back.

1198
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:08,680
When everything is over, there will
be neither ashes nor smoke left behind.
