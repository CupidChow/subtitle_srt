1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,880
Where's the missing bullet?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,160
How should I know?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,600
What are you plotting?

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,800
I used that bullet to kill Mercan!

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,040
This job is not easy, I already had qualms about it at the beginning.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,480
Ateş and his men were here, they found me.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,000
Listen, Abbas.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,120
I've paid you a truck load of money, you can't chicken out now.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,560
Where is Abbas?

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,680
Abbas?

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,560
Why would that lowlife be here? There's no one inside.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,040
It's just me.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
I won't turn myself in before I get that money, don't worry.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,360
Cemal, go! I'll circle around the back.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,240
If something happens to my son because of you,

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,040
I'll bury you alive under this house.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,000
Let me go.

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,600
I'll bury you alive.

19
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,800
I know you.

20
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,120
It's at the tip of my tongue but I can't think of it.

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,040
I lived abroad for a long time.

22
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,040
I would've remembered if we had met.

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,360
I don't forget easily.

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,840
Okay, if you say so.

25
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
I'm Rıza Yıldırım.

26
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,800
I am this beautiful girl's uncle.

27
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,400
It's not that I wasn't invited to your wedding,

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,760
I couldn't come because I had important business.

29
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,040
Uncle, you must be tired. Let's go have a seat.

30
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm going to my office.

31
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,640
Do not disturb me unless there's an emergency.

32
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,960
My memory is never mistaken.

33
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,240
This is not the first time I'm seeing him.

34
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,440
Once I get some rest,

35
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,200
I'll remember how I know him, who he is.

36
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,640
Uncle, let's have a seat.

37
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,040
Let's, dear.

38
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,640
Son, what if Rıza recognizes you?

39
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,880
Let's hope not.

40
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,720
This is a risk we willingly took.

41
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,080
Haydar and Nermin could've recognized me as well when we first started this game.

42
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,920
But he didn't.

43
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,000
But if he does, we'll take care of him.

44
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,720
Rıza is a cunning man.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,560
All of you, watch your step.

46
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,280
Don't ever slip up because he wouldn't miss a thing.

47
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
Where were you?

48
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,400
I... I had something to do.

49
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,760
You're not forgetting your part, are you Aslı?

50
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,160
We'll fire Nezir when we catch a single misstep.

51
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,920
Is there a problem?

52
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,960
No, don't worry. I'm keeping my eye on him.

53
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,160
Brother, what will we do about Rıza?

54
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,720
For now, nothing.

55
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,760
We go on with our plan.

56
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
"I know you,

57
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,520
It's at the tip of my tongue but I can't think of it."

58
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,640
I had to do this.

59
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Mom wouldn't have approved of this relationship at a time like this.

60
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Çiçek!

61
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,120
Çiçek.

62
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,760
Wait a minute.

63
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,760
What happened all of a sudden, Çiçek?

64
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,520
We have to talk, you can't just walk away.

65
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,000
Talk to me, don't I at least deserve to know the reason?

66
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,160
I have nothing else to say, let me go.

67
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,920
Çiçek, are we not in love?

68
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,280
We had made a promise to each other, you can't just end it and walk away.

69
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,280
Say something.

70
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,440
Please.

71
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,040
We fooled each other Malik.

72
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,360
First ourselves, then one another.

73
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,680
It's time to wake up.

74
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440
I've woken up.

75
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,120
I faced the truth.

76
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
You, too, should wake up.

77
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,120
There's no other way.

78
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,120
Çiçek, what are you saying?

79
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,440
Goodbye.

80
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,560
Çiçek, don't go.

81
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,240
"Get out of my way!"

82
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,160
"Let go!"

83
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,400
"Let her go!" "Brother! Let me go!" "Get away!"

84
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,560
Come in.

85
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,760
What was that about?

86
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm busy if you're here to chat.

87
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,040
I wouldn't have come to you if I wanted to chat.

88
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,760
I would find more sociable, good-humored company.

89
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Why are you here then?

90
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,840
Your attitude toward my uncle.

91
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,520
Don't you think you were rude, is that how you treat guests?

92
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,800
I don't like self-invited guests.

93
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,680
That's one.

94
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,840
And two, I treat everyone the way they deserve to be treated.

95
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,520
If you invite guests over without asking me,

96
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
you'll deal with the consequences.

97
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,000
It's like talking to a brick wall.

98
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,280
Jerk.

99
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
You didn't give me an answer on Tahir.

100
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,320
Will you help me or not?

101
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,360
I have more important stuff going on right now.

102
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,720
We'll look into it later.

103
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,440
Later won't do.

104
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,720
I want to find him now.

105
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,600
Why are you looking at me like that?

106
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,040
Did I say something funny?

107
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,760
I think it's weird.

108
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
You met him as a child,

109
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,640
didn't look for him for years.

110
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,480
Now you remember him and can't wait to find him.

111
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,440
Is this Tahir really that important to you?

112
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,320
He is.

113
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,600
If a person made you smile, made you feel safe,

114
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,040
you should repay that kindness.

115
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,560
That's what it means to be a friend.

116
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,440
Yes, Tahir is really important and dear to me.

117
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,360
And also, I don't appreciate your cold sarcasm.

118
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,960
I especially dislike it when it's toward my loved ones.

119
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,120
Will you help me or not?

120
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
Should I go ahead and find him myself?

121
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,440
You haven't fully healed yet.

122
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,520
You should rest instead of going on some search.

123
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,680
Okay, it seems like I have my answer.

124
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,600
Do as I say, naughty kitten.

125
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
Retract your claws once in a while.

126
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,000
"Tahir is really important and dear to me."

127
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,880
I've missed this house, brother.

128
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,240
Look at this scenery.

129
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,000
Why are you here, Rıza?

130
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,120
Haydar, I'm your brother.

131
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,440
I'm getting offended.

132
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,000
Stop spinning a tale and tell me why you're here.

133
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,920
I'm in trouble.

134
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
There are men after me.

135
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
I need money.

136
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,760
I knew it.

137
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
Why else would you be here?

138
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,920
If you're uncomfortable with my being here,

139
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,160
just give me the money and I'll go.

140
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,680
How dare you ask me for money? I have none to give you.

141
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,560
Figure it out on your own.

142
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,400
Is that so?

143
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,920
What a brother.

144
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,040
What a brother you turned out to be.

145
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,320
They say loyalty is dead but I never believed, brother.

146
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Turns out, it's true.

147
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,000
Stop your nonsense.

148
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,560
I was just reminiscing our old days, brother.

149
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
Do you remember,

150
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,880
what your brother did for you?

151
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,600
I'd saved you when you went bankrupt with your human trafficking business.

152
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,880
I'd done all your dirty work including murder

153
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,360
and helped you to save your skin.

154
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,680
So, Haydar,

155
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,720
What I'm saying is,

156
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,400
Either you give me the money or...

157
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Or what? What would you do, huh?

158
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,520
Don't you dare threaten me, I'll kill you.

159
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,600
Do you hear me?

160
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,720
You definitely would.

161
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,720
You would kill your own brother without hesitation.

162
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,320
But you won't.

163
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,080
Because all the files from your

164
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,640
human trafficking are in my posession.

165
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,240
You're bluffing!

166
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

167
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,320
If you don't give me the money, where those files would go,

168
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,720
who they would reach, I can't really say for certain either, dear brother.

169
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,320
What kind of a brother are you?

170
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,880
Not even an enemy of mine would do this to me.

171
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,200
This is the little brother a brother like you deserves.

172
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,240
What did you expect?

173
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,680
I think we're a perfect match.

174
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,600
If you don't have any money, ask your wealthy son-in-law.

175
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,520
If you're too prideful and can't ask for the money,

176
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,280
I will ask him myself, no problem.

177
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,720
And I'll tell him about you,

178
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,120
so he'll know how skillful a father in law he has.

179
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,160
Reflect on this and make your decision.

180
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,920
In the mean time, I'll go see my niece whom

181
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,880
I've missed very much, dear brother.

182
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,440
Damn it.

183
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,160
Damn it!

184
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,320
What are you doing here?

185
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,360
What do you want?

186
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,160
I'm here to see if you've made the right decision.

187
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,800
Go away.

188
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,920
Answer me.

189
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,320
My answer is here.

190
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,200
Look at my eyes all puffy from crying, that's your answer.

191
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,040
How should I know why you've been crying?

192
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,760
Do you want to hear it?

193
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,080
Okay, as you wish, I'll put it into words for you.

194
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,080
Yes, I broke up with him.

195
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,440
I left that man whom I love.

196
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,760
Are you happy now?

197
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,880
Are you satisfied?

198
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,880
Yes, I'm delighted. So what?

199
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,520
Go! Get out of here.

200
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,040
What are you doing, Mercan?

201
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,680
I'm trying to find a childhood friend.

202
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
Tahir Aslan.

203
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,600
I'm looking to see if he's on social media.

204
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,760
Which Tahir?

205
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,560
You should remember him.

206
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,680
You know that kid...

207
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,120
He had a sister named Eylül.

208
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,440
Yeah, I remember that kid.

209
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,960
Do you know where he is?

210
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Have you heard anything about him?

211
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,120
No, I haven't, dear. I don't know anything.

212
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,560
Mercan, this is not the time for this. We have a lot going on.

213
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,040
Who even is Tahir? Forget about him.

214
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,760
Hearing that Eylül passed away has been a big enough blow on me.

215
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,840
Isn't it natural I want to know what happened to Tahir?

216
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,200
I've lost one friend.

217
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,920
I should at least find the other one.

218
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,160
Of course you should, my dear niece. Look for him, find him.

219
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,280
Don't mind your father.

220
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,280
I'll help you, if you need help.

221
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,800
We had sent their belongings to

222
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,800
the summer house, Ms. Mercan.

223
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,240
Although, those poor kids didn't have many belongings.

224
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,200
Ms. Binnaz, is it your place to speak on this?

225
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,720
You just do your job.

226
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,880
Dad!

227
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,120
You're right, Mr. Haydar.

228
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,520
She didn't say anything wrong, why are you yelling at her?

229
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,040
I'll go look through their stuff, maybe I'll find something.

230
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,560
Your daughter is very determined.

231
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,520
She'll find something eventually, even if not today.

232
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,160
You should think about how you'll

233
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,680
explain yourself once she does.

234
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,080
Where to?

235
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,320
I'm going to the summer house.

236
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,840
They put Tahir's stuff there, maybe I'll find something.

237
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,600
You can't go anywhere.

238
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,400
I've already told you but I guess it wasn't clear.

239
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,120
This is too important for me to wait.

240
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,200
I'll be quick, I won't tire myself out.

241
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,520
You had forgotten about him for years,

242
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,800
just act as though that's still the case.

243
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,200
And you can't go anywhere until you've healed fully.

244
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,520
I didn't even know Eylül had died until now.

245
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,880
I feel like something will happen to Tahir if I keep waiting.

246
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,040
Don't look at me like that.

247
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,080
I know it's weird but that's just how I feel.

248
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,560
I'm sure he doesn't need your help.

249
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,280
And you're in no state to help someone else right now.

250
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,560
Go back inside.

251
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm only going to the summer house, I'll be right back. Why won't you let me?

252
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,680
I told you to go inside.

253
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,880
Like I could rest with these question marks.

254
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,080
He's cruel even when he's being considerate.

255
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,440
Don't whine.

256
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,440
He's so crude.

257
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,960
Burak.

258
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,680
Yes, Mr. Nezir?

259
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,800
What is this?

260
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,560
These numbers aren't even half the costs.

261
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,920
Yes, I just noticed myself. I was just waiting for your meeting to end.

262
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,760
You're saying you made a mistake? You won't make those anymore.

263
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,480
Are we clear?

264
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,840
I don't want any more mistakes.

265
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
What's going on here?

266
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,080
What do you think?

267
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
We're surrounded by incompetent people, trying to do business.

268
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,560
Hello?

269
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,400
How are you?

270
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,760
Forget the formalities.

271
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,880
Okay.

272
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,120
Mercan wants to go to the summer house.

273
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,280
Ateş stopped her for now.

274
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,200
But you know how stubborn she is.

275
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,320
If she goes there, Ateş will follow her.

276
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,800
You wouldn't want them to be alone in a house, would you?

277
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,760
Would I want that? Of course not.

278
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,400
Okay, I'll do what needs to be done.

279
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,920
It's all for us, Ateş.

280
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,560
I'm doing everything for us.

281
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,880
I shouldn't leave the field for a second.

282
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,200
Nezir, what are you doing?

283
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Huh?

284
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
I'm making a phone call.

285
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,400
I can see that, I'm asking what was with the yelling.

286
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,440
Yes, Nezir?

287
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,720
I wanted to know how you were doing.

288
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,480
How are you?

289
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,360
Thanks, I'm feeling better.

290
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,920
I'm happy to hear you're better. I'm going down to the coast side.

291
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,600
Getting some sea air would be nice, would you like to come with me?

292
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,160
Well, maybe not the coast but...

293
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,120
We can go wherever you'd like, it's okay.

294
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,440
I need to go to the summer house to check something.

295
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
Could you take me there?

296
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,640
Okay, I'll be right out. You can start getting ready.

297
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,920
Thank you.

298
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,040
Well done, Ms. Aslı.

299
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,160
We're right on track.

300
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,120
I told you I would go.

301
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,080
"Tahir is really important and dear to me."

302
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,000
What happened? Are you tired already?

303
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,080
We're just begining.

304
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,640
I know you.

305
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,360
Are you okay?

306
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm okay, I'm still alive.

307
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,560
I'm a bit preoccupied, sorry.

308
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,280
Yeah, I could tell.

309
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,080
I should be thankful I don't have you as an enemy.

310
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,840
Mercan.

311
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,120
Do you think she could find something on Tahir?

312
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,000
I don't think so.

313
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,880
But she's really head-strong.

314
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,640
We should take some precautions, just in case.

315
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,600
What kind of precautions are you thinking?

316
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,000
I have a few ideas.

317
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,120
How do I know those scars?

318
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,960
It couldn't be.

319
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,680
My god, please hear and fulfill my prayers.

320
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,280
I'm terrified that my son's going to be torn to pieces by those loan sharks.

321
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,400
My god, please protect me and my son, hear our prayers.

322
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,920
What are we going to do?

323
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,120
Oh no! No! The soup is ruined.

324
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,840
What have I have done!

325
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,520
This kitchen can't just put out food without any trouble, I assume.

326
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,960
I'm surprised how you messed up, soup is a beginner's level dish.

327
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,040
Zehra, you come and go, making snide comments, you don't help out.

328
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,600
Either help out or get out of my way, I can't deal with you right now.

329
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm going to leave anyway. I was looking for Berat, where is he?

330
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,000
We need to prepare Mr. Rıza's room. There are things to be carried.

331
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,920
Berat isn't home?

332
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,960
Where is he?

333
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,480
Did he leave the house?

334
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,080
How am I going to find him now?

335
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
What am I going to do?

336
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,440
Berat!

337
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,400
What is it, mom? Did something happen, are you okay?

338
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,400
Berat, don't you ever leave the house, okay?

339
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,760
If those men find you, they'll tear you to pieces.

340
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,640
Okay, mom. Don't worry.

341
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,520
But I'm worried, son.

342
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,200
Promise me you won't go out.

343
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,720
Okay, I promise I won't go out.

344
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,640
Say it again.

345
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,000
Okay, mom. I promise I won't leave.

346
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,600
Come, come here. Calm down, mom.

347
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,200
My beautiful mother.

348
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,480
You won't go out, right?

349
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,560
Okay, mom, I won't go out.

350
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Mercan.

351
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,760
I got this for you.

352
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,440
You should remain positive.

353
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,800
So you'll heal quickly.

354
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,680
Thanks, Nezir but I don't want it.

355
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
Come on, let's go.

356
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,400
What is it?

357
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,440
You look tense.

358
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,840
Everything's fine. Let's just go.

359
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,760
You're the boss.

360
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,760
After you, ma'am.

361
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,400
Here's your collagen drink.

362
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,520
Thank you, dear.

363
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,120
Enjoy, ma'am.

364
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,360
I'll be having this every morning from now on.

365
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,360
It's good for the skin.

366
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,640
Would you like some collagen, dear?

367
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,720
I can't deal with your nonsense.

368
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,960
We have a million problems.

369
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,760
It's Rıza, right?

370
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,480
Of course it is. He threatened me with the past.

371
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,560
He's asking for money.

372
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,440
Apparently he has files on the human trafficking business.

373
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,120
He must have stored them just in case of moments like this.

374
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
What?

375
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,920
I need to get those files, Nermin or I can't rid myself of Rıza.

376
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Where could he have hidden them?

377
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,840
Do you think they're at his house?

378
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,040
I don't think so.

379
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,480
He has a lot of enemies, he wouldn't keep them close by.

380
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,920
The summer house.

381
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
He went there all the time.

382
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,120
You're right. He'd go there whenever he was in trouble.

383
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,520
You keep him busy at home. Let me know if he wants to go out, okay?

384
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,640
Okay, don't worry.

385
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,840
Thank you for bringing me here, Nezir.

386
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm the one who called.

387
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,920
It wasn't in vain when I said I'm always with you.

388
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,960
You ask and I do. That's our deal.

389
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,600
You.

390
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,600
You'll leave just as you came.

391
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,120
We're here to...

392
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,840
I came with Mercan, I'll leave with her.

393
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,320
Nezir.

394
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,960
You should go.

395
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,840
Thank you again for bringing me.

396
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,200
You've brought nothing but trouble for everyone,

397
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,480
especially Mercan, since you showed up.

398
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,800
But you'll leave.

399
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,000
For good.

400
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,880
Please.

401
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,680
I'm leaving to avoid upsetting you.

402
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,480
Someone should consider her, right?

403
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,960
Call me if something happens.

404
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,520
Her phone's off to everyone but me.

405
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,720
Don't keep your hopes up.

406
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,760
Why don't you ever listen?

407
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,600
Didn't I tell you to rest at home?

408
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,480
And with Nezir too...

409
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,320
Why are you always doing something behind my back?

410
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,120
Because of you.

411
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,200
If you had helped me, I wouldn't have

412
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
come here with Nezir, behind your back.

413
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,160
If you remember, I first asked you

414
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,680
for help but you declined.

415
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,840
I don't want to see that man around you.

416
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,800
Are you doing this out of spite?

417
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,960
Get your finger out of my face.

418
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
Don't provoke me.

419
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,840
That's not possible.

420
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,880
You're looking for reasons to get angry.

421
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,920
You're pushing my limits.

422
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,240
Search wherever you want,

423
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,000
then we'll go straight home.

424
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,200
Okay.

425
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,880
I'll be really quick.

426
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,040
"Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop."

427
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,120
Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.

428
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,520
Tahir!

429
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,640
Can I play too? It's so pretty.

430
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,600
My dad gave this to me.

431
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,960
It's really special.

432
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,720
But if you like it so much, you can have it.

433
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,720
Thank you! You're a great friend.

434
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,880
Bend down, I'll give you a kiss.

435
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,160
Come on, play with it.

436
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,080
Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.

437
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,760
Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.

438
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,960
Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.

439
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,920
What's that?

440
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,480
I don't know.

441
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,600
I found it here.

442
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,320
Whose horse was this?

443
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,640
I don't remember my brother ever playing with this.

444
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,480
Maybe...

445
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,720
I don't remember.

446
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,560
I'll check the cabinets in the living room and then we can leave, is that okay?

447
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,160
Yes, Cemal?

448
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,880
Okay, leave the rest to me.

449
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,560
I couldn't find anything.

450
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,240
See, I was quick just like I promised.

451
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,480
So, you can trust me.

452
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,440
Now that we're here, check all the rooms.

453
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,960
So we don't have to come here again.

454
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,120
Okay, if you say so.

455
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,520
Look, I found this.

456
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,080
This belonged to Tahir.

457
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,920
He would wear this and go around looking like an orange.

458
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,360
There's not much left from them.

459
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,920
How sad.

460
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,280
That's enough.

461
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,560
Let's go.

462
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,720
Aslı, answer.

463
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
Answer.

464
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,120
What?

465
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,560
Are you playing me?

466
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,360
What are you talking about, what do you mean?

467
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,080
Don't you dare play with me, Aslı.

468
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,760
Don't make an enemy out of me.

469
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,080
This is not what we agreed on.

470
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

471
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,120
What are you saying?

472
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,880
Why didn't you tell me Ateş would come?

473
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,520
What?

474
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,440
Ateş was at the summer house?

475
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,240
Don't play dumb.

476
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,800
He was already there when I arrived.

477
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,880
I didn't know.

478
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,440
Don't you ever, ever put me in this position again, Aslı.

479
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,880
What is it, Nermin?

480
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,720
I called you because I was worried, Haydar.

481
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,120
I'm guessing you couldn't find anything, that's why you're angry.

482
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,520
I looked everywhere,

483
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,920
searched every nook and crevice, found nothing.

484
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,000
Where could they be?

485
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,320
I was certain they'd be there.

486
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,720
Where could he hide them?

487
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,080
If only I knew where he stayed,

488
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,680
he never stays in one place, he's lives like a nomad.

489
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,400
Forget it. It looks like someone's been here already.

490
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,600
It must've been Mercan. She said she was going to the summer house.

491
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,440
She's obsessed with finding this Tahir.

492
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,680
That must be it.

493
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,640
There's nothing else to do.

494
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,080
You should come back home, don't stay out late.

495
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,080
I'm going to stroll around for a bit.

496
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,600
You'll catch a cold.

497
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,680
I can't deal with your cold too.

498
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,320
I have a coat on, I'll be fine.

499
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,720
I'll walk.

500
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,800
It can't be.

501
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,080
It is him.

502
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,000
There's no way.

503
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,760
There is no way. Is he Tahir?

504
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,760
What is going on?

505
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,200
Hadn't he died?

506
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,880
Did you go to the summer house?

507
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,520
Yes.

508
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,360
Why didn't you let us know?

509
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,840
What happened brother, did you handle it?

510
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,720
Wow, you never miss, huh?

511
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,920
Haydar wouldn't have gone there for no reason.

512
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,160
You called right on time. We were just about to leave.

513
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,280
We barely made it, brother.

514
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,280
Haydar was on his way.

515
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,760
The thing we're looking for may be in this CD, mom.

516
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,400
It looks like we're almost at the finish line.

517
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,160
My brave son.

518
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,480
This man does the dirtiest work.

519
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,520
He must've ruined many lives with his human trafficking.

520
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,520
He never bloodied his hands either.

521
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,240
If we could find some proof,

522
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,800
that would really further our case.

523
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,280
This is Rıza.

524
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,680
Haydar's brother.

525
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,480
He has all the files.

526
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,280
He's keeping them as leverage over Haydar, as far as I know.

527
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,440
What do you think would happen if we left him penniless?

528
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,920
He would try his hand with Haydar.

529
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,760
He looks just the type to do such a thing.

530
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,800
Rıza would blackmail Haydar,

531
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,840
Haydar would try to get the files,

532
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,280
but we'll act faster than them.

533
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,880
They'll be their own undoing.

534
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,240
Just like all other criminals.

535
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,360
How would that Rıza know how to put a password on a file?

536
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,040
Like he has nothing to think about other than password protection.

537
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,520
Don't worry, surely we'll crack it.

538
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,440
You remember that tech kid? I'll give him a call, maybe he'll crack it.

539
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,320
Give it a go, maybe it'll work out.

540
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,280
Talk to her about this Tahir business before you go.

541
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,400
Let's deal with it before any trouble arises.

542
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,320
It's gone on long enough.

543
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,920
Okay, brother. I'll talk to Mercan.

544
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,320
What will Cemal talk about with the murderer's daughter?

545
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,800
What are you planning?

546
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,280
May I have a seat?

547
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,680
Yes, of course.

548
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,520
Ateş asked me to look into someone named Tahir Aslan.

549
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,520
And I did my part.

550
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,840
I looked into him.

551
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,080
I even asked my friends in goverment agencies.

552
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,480
Yes?

553
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,320
Tahir...

554
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,240
He was in a car accident ten years ago.

555
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,920
He sadly couldn't make it.

556
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,800
How could he?

557
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,440
That can't be.

558
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,880
That's what happened.

559
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,120
I wouldn't have wanted to come

560
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,920
and tell you such a thing if I wasn't sure.

561
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,000
He's someone you care about, after all.

562
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,560
It was difficult for me to tell you.

563
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,000
That's life.

564
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,640
This was his fate.

565
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,800
My condolences.

566
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,200
Eylül... Eylül was my friend,

567
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,280
and Tahir was my prince, a protector.

568
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,920
I didn't just lose them,

569
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,080
but also my childhood.

570
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,560
Without even saying goodbye.

571
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,560
That's what happened, mom.

572
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,480
Well done, son.

573
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,720
She'll stop looking for Tahir, I guess.

574
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,960
He's actually right in front of her, if only she knew.

575
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,360
I'll go, check the kitchen.

576
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,720
Are you okay?

577
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,680
It really is you, I'm sure.

578
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,040
In the flesh.

579
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,080
What is this about?

580
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,800
Did you think I wouldn't remember you?

581
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,680
Tahir.

582
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,360
I'm Ateş.

583
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,920
Ateş Karahan.

584
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,600
Yes, you're a new person. I can see that.

585
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,880
But you're name is Tahir.

586
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,120
I saw that child the other night, when I looked into your eyes.

587
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,360
You still have the same gaze.

588
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,800
A person is born, he grows up and grows old.

589
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,360
The eyes however, the gaze, never change.

590
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,920
These are Tahir's eyes.

591
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,760
Tahir is dead.

592
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,280
Cemal showed me the news on his death.

593
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,320
My friend is dead.

594
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,640
How did you find out?

595
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,280
It was a hit-and-run.

596
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,200
The deceased was Tahir Aslan.

597
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,480
But there's no picture, no other information.

598
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,560
How can we know for sure it was the Tahir we're looking for?

599
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,640
Your uncle is right.

600
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,760
Maybe it's not the same Tahir.

601
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,760
Maybe Tahir isn't dead.

602
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,760
Maybe he's right under our noses.

603
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,080
Maybe he wanted to disappear himself, who knows?

604
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,920
He was a brave kid.

605
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,000
Who knows where he is, what he's doing now.

606
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,840
Is that really possible?

607
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,440
I've seen what kind of things are possible

608
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,560
in this life with my own eyes, my dear niece.

609
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,560
I've even seen the dead come back to life.

610
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,000
They tell you someone is dead one minute, and the next

611
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,320
he's standing right in front of you, in the flesh.

612
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,280
I hope that's the case.

613
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,240
Look at me, don't be sad. If he's alive, we'll find him, okay?

614
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,120
You search for him.

615
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,000
I have more important stuff going on.

616
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,280
We will search for him.

617
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,000
We'll ease Mercan's mind as well

618
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,480
but I need to talk to my brother first.

619
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,680
Son, what have you done?

620
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,920
Ateş, are you okay?

621
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,760
We have a big problem.

622
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,720
Tell us what happened already, Ateş.

623
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,440
Big enough to hurt yourself?

624
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,520
I knew what happened when I saw you leave in anger.

625
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,880
It's Rıza, right?

626
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,320
It is Rıza.

627
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,680
Nothing! I can't think straight!

628
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,560
Calm down, Haydar. You can't deal with Rıza in this state.

629
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,400
How do I calm down, Nermin? How do I keep calm?

630
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,840
He kept records of everything, we don't even know what.

631
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,640
I can't think of a single hiding place.

632
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,200
It's Rıza we're talking about, Haydar. He may just be bluffing.

633
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,120
He was always in your shadow.

634
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,600
Now, he wants to get back at you.

635
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,440
He is not even half as smart as you.

636
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,600
You're not the kind of man to lose to him.

637
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,040
I'm not sure, Nermin. He may have the upper hand this time.

638
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,200
He doesn't. Not even a little bit.

639
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,760
We'll figure it where he hid them if we think hard enough.

640
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,920
You're his older brother.

641
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,160
You'll figure out where he hid them.

642
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,040
I don't know, Nermin. I don't know!

643
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,840
There's one thing I know for certain.

644
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,760
If we don't keep an eye on him he'll ruin each and every one of us.

645
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,600
And how will you manage to do that, brother?

646
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,920
What can you do, Haydar? Will you have me killed?

647
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,200
I was here to give you some good news but I guess it wasn't meant to be.

648
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,360
I need to think about it now.

649
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,720
Either you give me those files willingly...

650
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,960
Stop right there, brother. You're pushing it.

651
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,240
Those files are my life insurance.

652
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,920
Especially from now on.

653
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,320
Haydar!

654
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,480
Uncle? Do you know something about Tahir?

655
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,440
Maybe I do, dear. I might.

656
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,320
But first, I need to talk to Ateş about something important.

657
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,800
Something really important.

658
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,080
Rıza!

659
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,880
What does uncle Rıza have to do with him?

660
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,000
Dad!

661
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,480
He's talking nonsense again.

662
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,000
What's going on, dad?

663
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,600
Nothing, dear.

664
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,000
Hello?

665
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,000
Okay, I'll pay you back, I'll pay you back double.

666
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,240
But you need to help me out first.

667
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:28,640
Hey.

668
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,040
Hello, Emine? It's me, Binnaz, again.

669
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,880
We talked in the morning about that debt business.

670
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,080
Do you think you can help me out?

671
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,640
Okay, I understand, Emine.

672
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,920
No, no, don't feel bad. Thank you anyway.

673
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,000
Yeah, you're right. Everyone's struggling nowadays.

674
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,800
Don't be ridiculous, Emine! Why would I be upset with you?

675
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:08,400
Okay, thank you very much. Take care, bye.

676
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,480
My god help me, please.

677
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,080
One door closes and another opens. All mighty

678
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,720
and powerful god, pleease hear my prayers.

679
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,160
Help me, god.

680
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,600
Send us a saving grace.

681
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,320
How could this happen, how?

682
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,800
No, no one would believe him.

683
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,840
We can't chance it.

684
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,560
If he tells Haydar, he'll get suspicious

685
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,120
even if he doesn't believe it.

686
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,600
Rıza is a money hungry man.

687
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,360
All he cares about is money. He'll stop talking if you pay him enough.

688
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,680
I don't think he'll tell Haydar anything

689
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,200
for now because he's trying to get money.

690
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,560
But we need to be careful.

691
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,880
These people are blinded by evil, Ateş.

692
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,000
They might hurt you.

693
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,360
No one can hurt me.

694
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,200
He doesn't have the guts to hurt Ateş

695
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,520
It's from the company.

696
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,280
We sent that CD from the summer house, right?

697
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,440
I sent it with one of the guys, we'll get results soon enough.

698
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,560
We brought him to cause trouble for Haydar, but he's caused us all the trouble.

699
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,520
Every one of them is evil, they're lowlives.

700
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,360
Hello?

701
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,200
Okay.

702
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,840
It's one of our guys in the house.

703
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,400
Rıza had a phone call and took off in a hurry.

704
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,000
He acted sooner than I thought.

705
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,720
I didn't know you were in here.

706
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,520
It's okay.

707
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,720
What did you do to your hand again?

708
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,760
It's nothing serious.

709
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,240
How a person can hurt himself so often, I don't understand.

710
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,040
Stop whining.

711
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,760
You missed a button.

712
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,640
Let me help you.

713
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,760
Uhm... Uncle Rıza had said he'd talk to you,

714
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,480
have you talked yet?

715
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,040
No.

716
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,520
It seemed like he knew something about Tahir.

717
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,800
But that news says he's dead, it's as if...

718
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,280
I'm not interested at all, actually.

719
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,320
I'm bored with it.

720
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,800
Well, get used to it.

721
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,360
Things are getting really strange.

722
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,520
First, you look into him and then, act like you don't care at all.

723
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,200
Yes?

724
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,960
I'll be right there.

725
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,240
Where are you going?

726
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,760
Oh no! What am I doing, I'm really losing it!

727
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,040
It's okay mom, leave it. I'll clean it up.

728
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,920
My god.

729
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,040
Dear, what have I done, do you see? I can't keep it straight.

730
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,120
Be careful, don't burn yourself.

731
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:28,920
Okay.

732
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,680
Çiçek, Çiçek?

733
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,560
Is Mrs. Müzeyyen home?

734
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,960
I just saw her in the living room, why?

735
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,000
I have something to tell her.

736
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,840
What will you tell her?

737
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,200
God, give me patience.

738
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,120
Mom, just tell me. You got me curious.

739
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,680
Çiçek, what is it to you? What's with the curiosity?

740
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:51,000
You just clean this up before Zehra comes and scolds us.

741
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,080
Come on, Çiçek.

742
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,600
Okay, fine.

743
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,360
Watch your hand, be careful.

744
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,000
I'm going to ask her if she could borrow me money.

745
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,360
I have no other option.

746
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,040
We need to deal with this before Ateş's identity is exposed.

747
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,160
If we wait any longer...

748
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,840
Ateş will find a way. We should keep waiting.

749
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,480
Mom.

750
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,240
He recognized Ateş at first glance.

751
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,320
He could tell Haydar.

752
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,760
If he does, he can hurt Ateş before we ever get a chance to do something.

753
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,920
Don't you think about doing something stupid on your own.

754
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,000
We saw your last plan.

755
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,120
Fell into Nezir's lap.

756
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,600
Did I say something wrong?

757
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,840
Move out of my way.

758
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,160
You all have your head in the clouds.

759
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,360
Here's your coffee, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

760
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,320
Why did you bring it, where's Zehra?

761
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,880
I wanted to bring it.

762
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,880
Mrs. Müzeyyen, I actually wanted to talk to you about...

763
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,920
Do you call this a coffee?

764
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,480
What are you doing here if you can't even manage to make coffee?

765
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,480
Tell Zehra to make my coffee.

766
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,560
Yes, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

767
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,000
They're useless.

768
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,800
You're reckless, reckless.

769
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,800
Wow.

770
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:08,080
The Tahir Mercan is looking for, has been under her nose all along.

771
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:21,240
And that Tahir became her husband but my niece has no idea.

772
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,200
Look at you, Tahir.

773
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,640
But let me say this, she's determined to find you.

774
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,920
Who would've thought, Tahir?

775
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Tahir became the great businessman Ateş Karahan, huh?

776
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,880
Who would've thought you'd become a great man?

777
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,920
I'm really curious about one thing.

778
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:04,120
How did you become so wealthy, so powerful?

779
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,960
Let's just say I got lucky.

780
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,800
And I'm smart, of course.

781
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,680
You're not to be underestimated.

782
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,160
I got that.

783
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,960
You took everything from a man like Haydar Yıldırım.

784
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,680
Not everyone can manage such a thing.

785
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,120
What do you want?

786
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,240
Get to the point.

787
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,920
To the point?

788
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,120
Okay, here's my point.

789
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,720
You'll make a big payment to me in exchange for your secret.

790
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,280
And I won't tell a soul that you're Tahir Aslan.

791
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,040
I'll tell Mercan that the news is true and put

792
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,360
a rest to this Tahir business once and for all.

793
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:08,320
I won't give you even a cent.

794
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,120
Do whatever you want.

795
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,840
You're reckless.

796
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,320
Hey!
Let me go!

797
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,440
I told you to let go!

798
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,480
Get away, get off of me!

799
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:48,640
Let me go! I told you to let go!

800
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:51,760
Go! You're coming with us.

801
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,240
Mom.

802
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,600
I just tasted the dishes in the kitchen,

803
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,960
you really knocked it out of the park this time.

804
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,120
I did my best, dear.

805
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,000
Ateş won't be joining us at dinner, don't put out a plate for him.

806
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,160
Ms. Mercan told us, Ms. Aslı.

807
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,360
So you're playing the lady of the house, Ms. Mercan?

808
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,560
But neither this house, nor Ateş is yours.

809
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,240
I'll knock this into your head somehow.

810
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:23,480
What is it?

811
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:27,640
What is it, Aslı? What's with the attitude?

812
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,240
Could it be because you keep calling me?

813
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,200
I can't talk to you all day, you know that, right?

814
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,320
Don't you dare get smart with me, Aslı.

815
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:43,320
Did you forget how I saved you? I'll call by the minute if I have to.

816
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,000
And you'll answer.

817
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,720
I told you I'll figure everything out.

818
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,200
Leave me alone, already.

819
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,560
Who were you speaking to, Aslı?

820
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,360
No one.

821
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,000
Wrong number.

822
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:11,000
Do you think I'm stupid? Who were you speaking to?

823
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,080
That's enough mom. You watch my every step.

824
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,120
Can't I have a moment's peace?

825
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,400
Why don't you trust me?

826
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,160
You know very well why I don't.

827
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,120
Don't get me started now.

828
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:30,840
The moment I leave you alone, you make inexplicable mistakes.

829
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,640
I guess I underestimated you.

830
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,600
I guess you did.

831
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,960
What did you think would happen?

832
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,760
That I'd get on my knees and beg you to not say anything?

833
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,640
You're not a little kid anymore.

834
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,960
I remember, back then, you were as stubborn,

835
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:40,920
and head-strong a child as you are now.

836
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,160
Did I tell you to hit him? You ruined everything.

837
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,400
What are you staring at? Huh?

838
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,520
Mind your business.

839
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:06,000
Do you see how he's staring, brother?

840
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,560
If you don't knock sense into him now, he'll become trouble in the future.

841
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,240
He tried to manhandle Murat just now.

842
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,200
What are you saying?

843
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,320
Apparently Murat hit his sister.

844
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,320
He wwould have beat the life out of Murat if I weren't there.

845
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,720
You little...

846
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,040
What did I tell you?

847
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,000
Who do you think you're hitting, huh?

848
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,120
Who are you to hit him?

849
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,680
Huh? You won't do that again!

850
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,280
I told you to stay away from Murat!

851
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,960
Didn't I?

852
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,960
Who are you to stare at me? Lower your gaze, don't you dare look at me!

853
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,360
Your gaze always annoyed me.

854
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:09,320
When I saw those scars on your back...

855
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,000
I knew for sure.

856
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:16,200
I'm not going to talk of the past with a man like you.

857
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:21,760
I want all the information you have on Haydar.

858
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:34,160
Listen, we can cut a deal between us.

859
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,600
Your problem is with Haydar.

860
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,960
And I have enough information to end him.

861
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,920
Technology is weird.

862
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:54,360
So much information can fit into such a small thing.

863
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:00,680
If you mean the CD at the summer house, we already have it.

864
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,880
We'll have it cracked in no time.

865
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,200
That's old.

866
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,680
Don't try in vain, it doesn't work anyway.

867
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:24,480
Like I said, it needs to be a fair exchange.

868
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,360
I won't have a seat at a table of murderers.

869
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:10,640
Especially with a lowlife like you.

870
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,480
If you're saying you won't give me any money,

871
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,440
but you'll find it on your own, I don't think so.

872
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,000
Don't keep your hopes up.

873
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,240
You'll never find it.

874
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,040
Don't be so sure.

875
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,720
If you have half a mind, you'll give it yourself.

876
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:43,720
Or they'll go the grave alongside you.

877
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,000
It's up to you.

878
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,280
You couldn't.

879
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,520
Because you're not a murderer.

880
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:05,920
If you were, Haydar would already be six feet under.

881
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,760
You don't have the compulsion to kill.

882
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,160
I won't dirty my hands with your or Haydar's blood.

883
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,600
But I can deliver you to the men after you.

884
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,200
I'm talking about the men you told about your

885
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,400
plan to ambush me before you left the house.

886
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,600
I'll just give you to them.

887
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,440
Now, do you understand?

888
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,040
I'm the reason you're penniless.

889
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:22,640
I'm the reason you're here.

890
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,520
Just like your brother.

891
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:35,680
I am the reason for everything.

892
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,120
You'll end up dead whichever path you choose.

893
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,440
Think carefully.

894
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,760
You're late, where were you?

895
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,920
What's this?

896
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,280
Are you interrogating me like a regular wife?

897
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,000
I think you got a bit too into your role.

898
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,320
Just so you know,

899
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,400
ours is not a real marriage.

900
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,720
I just asked out of curiosity.

901
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,640
And don't think I was out here waiting for you.

902
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,240
I can't reach my uncle, his phone is off.

903
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,520
He left the house in a hurry.

904
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,360
I was waiting for him.

905
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,720
Something may have happened to him.

906
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,320
I haven't been able to reach him in a while.

907
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:29,440
Why would I care about him?

908
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,280
How much do you think you know your uncle?

909
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,160
What does he do, where does he live?

910
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:41,000
I mean, he doesn't really work a 9-to-5.

911
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,120
He never stays in one place for long.

912
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,040
You don't know what he does,

913
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,080
You don't know where he lives,

914
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:56,120
but you worry about him because he's not answering his phone.

915
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,720
You're either really gullible, or you're a really good actor.

916
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,040
I don't probe into anyone's life, that's why.

917
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,080
He left saying he was going to talk to you.

918
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,280
I'm going to take a walk.

919
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,480
What walk this late at night, son?

920
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,800
It's late, come on. Let's go inside.

921
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,160
Çiçek, you tidy up here.

922
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,760
Malik, good night to you.

923
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,840
Good night.

924
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:55,680
Good night, Malik.
Good night.

925
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,400
Çiçek.

926
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,080
I haven't even been sleeping trying to figure out why.

927
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,680
If I've hurt you without realizing...

928
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,280
whatever I've done, whatever my mistake is...

929
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,560
Whatever you say, I've made up my mind.

930
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,680
We should both move on.

931
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:31,120
We just weren't destined to be.

932
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,560
Listen, this is the last time I come to you.

933
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,400
I'm standing in front of you for the last time.

934
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:41,680
Why did you do this, why did you break up with me?

935
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,200
There's no turning back after this.

936
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,280
Please, talk to me, tell me.

937
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,880
Stop pushing it.

938
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,960
Stop asking.

939
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,880
I don't love you anymore.

940
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,760
Don't press it any longer, Malik.

941
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,400
Where are you, uncle?

942
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,760
Good night.

943
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:45,800
Good night.

944
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,880
Could you turn off the light?

945
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,760
I'm working.

946
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:29,840
I'm fed up with your bullying.

947
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,680
Don't push it.

948
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:48,120
Hello?

949
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:51,200
I'm disturbed by the noise just as you are by the light.

950
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:52,360
Go and talk outside.

951
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,080
I was going to, anyway.

952
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,600
Easy!

953
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,360
I'm listening.

954
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:10,680
He told the truth, the CD doesn't work.

955
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,400
It's empty, anyway.

956
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,920
The guy that looked into the CD,

957
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,760
he says that it was tempered with.

958
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:21,280
Rıza must have left it as a decoy because he knew Haydar would look for it.

959
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,640
He tried to play him in his way.

960
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:27,040
The reason the CD has Haydar written on it is to intimidate him.

961
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:31,880
Rıza is persistent on not talking, he hasn't said a single word in hours.

962
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,400
He will eventually.

963
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:37,120
He'll surely figure out he can't escapce you.

964
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:41,040
Don't worry, no one has managed to do that yet.

965
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,120
He can't escape.

966
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,960
We'll talk in the morning.

967
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,040
Okay.

968
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,600
Try again if you'd like.

969
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,920
You crude, annoying man.

970
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,400
Hello, Nezir?

971
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:18,080
Rıza hasn't come home, he's not answering his phone either.

972
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,680
He's a big man, why are you so worried?

973
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,520
It's not him I care about, I'd be happy if he died.

974
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,280
He's going to destroy everything to get money.

975
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,320
He has some files.

976
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,880
He's threatening me with giving them to Ateş.

977
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,480
Some files?

978
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,880
What files does he have?

979
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,640
Just some files of past businesses I had.

980
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,360
He's going to try his hand with Ateş

981
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,840
because he couldn't get money from me.

982
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,880
If Ateş is involved, everything changes.

983
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:49,360
I wouldn't want him to get leverage over you.

984
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,960
That's why I called you.

985
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,400
Mercan is looking for her uncle too.

986
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:58,600
Let me see what I can do.

987
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:00,240
We'll be in touch.

988
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,640
I'll do anything if it's for Mercan.

989
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:37,320
Rıza hasn't said a word since yesterday. He turned out to be a tough nut to crack.

990
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,200
But don't worry, we'll handle it.

991
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,440
Everyone has a weakness.

992
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,600
I'll go get changed and get back to him.

993
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,240
Okay.

994
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,920
I'm going to the company.

995
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,480
Cemal.

996
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,920
My uncle didn't come home last night, have you seen him?

997
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,680
Have I seen your uncle...

998
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,760
No, I haven't. Why, did something happen?

999
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:06,680
Why would we care about your uncle?

1000
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,280
Why don't you ask your parents?

1001
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,760
You're so sweet in the mornings.

1002
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,240
You little...

1003
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,360
Aslı!

1004
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,840
She should know her place, then.

1005
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,360
Aslı, let's go.

1006
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:20,760
Come.

1007
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,960
Come on, we're going to the company.

1008
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,960
We'll talk later.

1009
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,200
I wish a miracle would happen and that girl would disappear.

1010
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:36,920
What have you done with Rıza?

1011
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,480
You're keeping it from me, too?

1012
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,320
Don't be ridiculous, why would I?

1013
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:48,360
We're trying to get him to talk about Haydar, to no avail.

1014
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,840
What did you do, did you leave him alone?

1015
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,760
No, a few of our guys are there. I'll go back myself, soon.

1016
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,520
Where is he?

1017
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,880
He's locked in a warehouse.

1018
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:04,480
Cemal?

1019
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,760
Don't leave before telling me, okay?

1020
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:13,120
I can't find a file Ateş gave me, he'll get mad at me if he finds out.

1021
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,040
Okay, we'll search for it together.

1022
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:31,520
Yes, Aslı?

1023
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,880
Nezir, I have some news that

1024
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,840
will make you into a hero for Mercan.

1025
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,200
Rıza hasn't been around since yesterday.

1026
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,120
I know, I heard.

1027
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:45,880
If you tell Mercan where Rıza is before Ateş does,

1028
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,960
you'll reap the rewards of being a hero.

1029
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,440
Not Ateş.

1030
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:53,760
Where is he?

1031
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,720
I'm going to send you the location.

1032
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:58,880
Well done, Aslı.

1033
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:01,920
Our partnership has finally paid off.

1034
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,720
If she's here, Nezir will show up soon to cause me trouble.

1035
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:32,920
Good morning to you!

1036
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:34,280
Good morning.

1037
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,240
I'll get some coffee and go to my office.

1038
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:41,720
See you later.

1039
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,680
I'll go get some coffee too.

1040
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:47,040
You stay Burak, let's have a chat.

1041
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,800
Okay.

1042
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:55,160
Listen, if you're interested in Ms. Demet, you should forget about it.

1043
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,120
Bury it in your heart.

1044
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:58,400
Why would I?

1045
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,480
Why do you think? Her brother.

1046
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:07,040
Listen, if you ever slight Mr. Nezir, he'll take you somewhere remote and deserted

1047
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,680
and bury you there.

1048
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:11,720
No one would ever find you. Do you understand?

1049
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:13,960
Do you think he would?

1050
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,200
Definitely.

1051
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,280
Huh.

1052
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:24,320
Forget it, Burak. Let's go over the material for the meeting.

1053
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,560
Okay, then.

1054
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,440
Where is Mr. Nezir?

1055
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,120
He's in the meeting room.

1056
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,280
Don't feign surprise.

1057
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:53,720
If you know me at all, you should've

1058
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,160
guessed I'd come and talk to you.

1059
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:57,720
How should I know?

1060
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,440
I'm not psychic.

1061
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,040
I know about your deal with Aslı.

1062
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:07,520
You saved her from trouble, thank you for that.

1063
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:14,520
But if you have any intention of causing my daughter any other trouble,

1064
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,680
don't you dare.

1065
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,760
Are you threatening me?

1066
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:22,640
That's weird.

1067
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:26,520
I should be the one threatening you, don't you think?

1068
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,640
Don't play with me.

1069
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,520
Do I look like a woman who'd lose to someone like you?

1070
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,240
Listen to me.

1071
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:45,120
Your daughter tried to kill Mercan.

1072
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,960
I saved her face.

1073
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:52,680
You're here trying to intimidate me when you should feel thankful.

1074
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,880
How ungrateful.

1075
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:58,400
And you're her partner in crime.

1076
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:02,280
You knowingly didn't say anything, you were opportunist.

1077
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,680
And don't you forget, Nezir,

1078
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:09,320
I'll save my daughter from all kinds of trouble.

1079
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:16,080
If you back her into a corner and force her do your dirty work,

1080
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,640
you'll pay such a high prize,

1081
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,480
no one would be able to pull you off my hands.

1082
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,080
Don't you think something strange is going on?

1083
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,640
He said he knew where Tahir was,

1084
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:18,320
but he left saying he needed to talk to you first.

1085
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,600
Then, he disappeared.

1086
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:26,000
He didn't even get a chance to speak to you.

1087
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,560
I don't know, it seems a little weird.

1088
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,240
So?

1089
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,320
The meeting's about to begin, let's go.

1090
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:43,280
Mercan.

1091
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,560
Can we talk?

1092
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,760
Your dad said your uncle has disappeared.

1093
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,000
I've done a little research.

1094
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,120
Your uncle is at this address.

1095
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:13,120
We can go together if you'd like.

1096
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:21,600
Nezir found uncle Rıza's location.

1097
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:27,840
The meeting's about to start.

1098
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,000
You'll go later.

1099
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:32,640
Later won't do.

1100
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,600
My uncle has been gone since yesterday.

1101
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,400
I don't care about the meeting.

1102
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,800
Give it to me.

1103
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:02,840
Okay.

1104
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:06,960
Let's go.

1105
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,560
We'll go together.

1106
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:27,200
I won't let you play the hero this time, Ateş.

1107
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:38,320
Is there somethin wrong, why are you so angry?

1108
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,880
I'm trying to find your uncle instead of doing my job.

1109
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,280
You should've gone to the meeting, I would've gone on my own.

1110
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,920
There's no way.

1111
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,760
How did Nezir find your uncle's location?

1112
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:56,840
How should I know?

1113
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:02,920
Hello, Haydar?

1114
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:05,440
Go to the address I'll text you.

1115
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,360
Rıza is there.

1116
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:08,560
Ateş will be on his way now.

1117
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,800
You should be there before him.

1118
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:13,160
Don't you forget this favor.

1119
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,840
Why aren't you answering your phone?

1120
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,800
I didn't have it on me, I was helping Aslı...

1121
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,520
I won't be going to the meeting.

1122
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:30,400
I called to let you know.

1123
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:35,240
They found Rıza's location.

1124
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,240
We're going there.

1125
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:39,000
Okay, brother.

1126
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,280
I'll call the guys now, we'll get Rıza out of the warehouse.

1127
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,280
They'll get there before you arrive.

1128
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,120
Okay.

1129
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:50,920
Let's go already.

1130
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,320
How did it get there?

1131
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:16,880
Why didn't you move it further while you were at it?

1132
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:37,520
Buddy, could you get me a glass of water, I'm parched.

1133
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,520
Why would my uncle be somewhere like this?

1134
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,600
Let's go back.

1135
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:51,000
There's no one here.

1136
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:55,240
No, let's look inside.

1137
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,480
It doesn't look safe.

1138
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,240
There's no one around.

1139
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,400
Let's go.

1140
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,400
Come on.

1141
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:23,120
Uncle!

1142
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,560
Are you okay?

1143
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,240
I'm okay, I'm fine.

1144
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:39,800
What happened to you?

1145
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:47,320
Don't worry, I took care of it.

1146
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:01,480
Ateş Karahan is here too.

1147
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:05,880
Uncle, what's going on?

1148
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:07,800
What's going on here?

1149
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,120
I had to deal with some people

1150
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:14,120
who didn't know I'm not one to mess with.

1151
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,320
I was thinking about the promise I'd made to

1152
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:41,000
my niece about Tahir, who could keep me here?

1153
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:54,400
Mercan, my dear niece.

1154
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:12,320
The Tahir you're looking for...

1155
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:44,360
If you're checking in because you're curious about me.

1156
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,160
I'm  better, don't worry.

1157
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:47,540
Good.

1158
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:49,980
Life

1159
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,480
goes on.

1160
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,560
Even the losses don't stop it.

1161
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,480
They couldn't find out who did it, right?

1162
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:02,700
No.

1163
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:10,680
I'm listening, uncle.

1164
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,560
What are you going to say?

1165
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,120
The Tahir you're looking for

1166
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:23,720
is alive.

1167
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:27,300
What?

1168
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:10,440
Haydar.

1169
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:12,640
Uncle.

1170
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:14,380
Uncle.

1171
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:16,240
Uncle.

1172
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:27,880
My only wish is that whoever did this get caught as soon as possible.

1173
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,360
The perpetrator of this murder must not go unpunished.

1174
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:33,680
Don't worry, it won't.

1175
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,720
Everyone pays the price for what they do in the end.

1176
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:43,800
If only you knew what your father did.

1177
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:56,120
Did you hear that Tahir is alive?

1178
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:03,880
What can I do?

1179
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,840
Be happy.

1180
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:09,400
He is alive.

1181
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:11,400
What was the news I read?

1182
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:13,280
You're asking too many questions.

1183
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:15,680
Don't you think it's strange?

1184
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:18,560
I don't have time for this right now.

1185
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:20,160
I have more important things to do.

1186
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:33,600
What is the situation?

1187
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:36,020
Okay.

1188
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:39,760
So, does the police have any evident?

1189
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:42,500
Okay.

1190
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:44,760
Okay, keep following up on the matter.

1191
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,200
Call me immediately if there are any developments.

1192
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:50,800
Stupid Rıza.

1193
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:54,680
He thought you could blackmail me and get money out of me.

1194
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:57,920
Well, you're dead now.

1195
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:01,800
Well, just try falling once.

1196
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:07,880
Even your brother will pounce on you like a vulture.

1197
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:11,760
He never knew his brother.

1198
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:12,840
Never.

1199
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,160
He brought it on himself.

1200
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:19,080
He made the mistake of his life.

1201
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:24,600
I wouldn't feel sorry even if it were my own brother trying to stab me in the back.

1202
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:25,960
I don't feel sorry.

1203
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:27,100
Yes.

1204
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:29,800
If you feel sorry you'll end up in a sorry state.

1205
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:32,580
My dear.

1206
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,160
You did what you had to do.

1207
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:37,640
Don't doubt yourself.

1208
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,000
Now focus on the future.

1209
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:43,640
Do whatever it takes to regain your former strength.

1210
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:45,620
Look.

1211
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:48,520
You've neutralized the threat of Rıza.

1212
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,480
Now it's time for the others.

1213
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:55,240
I can't say I got rid of it completely.

1214
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:58,680
Rıza left behind a ticking time bomb.

1215
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:00,760
I need to find those documents.

1216
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:04,120
The worst part is, I have no idea what he hid or where he hid it.

1217
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:07,760
Maybe he was bluffing to get money.

1218
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:10,520
Hopefully so.

1219
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:13,200
Anyway.

1220
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:14,480
I'm out.

1221
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:16,360
Where are you going at this hour?

1222
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,280
I'm going to spend some time outside.

1223
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:20,840
I'm bored at home.

1224
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,600
I've neglected the square too much.

1225
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,680
I'll make an appearance.

1226
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,960
See you dear.

1227
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:47,020
Understand.

1228
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:48,560
Find the address immediately.

1229
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:49,960
Okay, I'll wait for the news.

1230
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:54,640
Anything?

1231
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:57,280
Rıza came to Istanbul a week ago.

1232
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:01,380
Really?

1233
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,320
So he was around here somewhere.

1234
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:05,380
Yes.

1235
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:07,720
I told the guys. They're looking into where he stayed.

1236
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:12,280
I had some herbal tea prepared.

1237
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:13,680
Drink up, for healing.

1238
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:16,000
You haven't been taking care of yourself lately.

1239
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:17,960
You know I don't like it.

1240
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,520
This is taking too long.

1241
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:27,440
We need to get those documents as soon as possible.

1242
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:33,360
We don't even know what we're looking for.

1243
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,000
It's a complete mystery.

1244
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:37,200
I think we do know.

1245
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:39,960
Rıza said it himself that night. He said technology and something.

1246
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:44,080
I think we're looking for a USB.

1247
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:45,600
We'll find it, of course.

1248
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:47,880
We have to.

1249
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:52,240
Once we know what's inside, everything else will be easier.

1250
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,360
Should we ask his beloved nephew?

1251
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:56,720
Maybe she knows.

1252
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:01,800
The men are on the job.

1253
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:06,760
Because of me.

1254
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:09,600
I shouldn't have left them alone.

1255
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,280
Thank god nothing happened to them.

1256
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,120
Don't blame yourself.

1257
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:19,720
The real question is

1258
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:22,320
how did Haydar find that place?

1259
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:30,000
Maybe he's having Mercan followed.

1260
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:35,840
The man shot his own brother.

1261
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:40,080
I'm not surprised at all.

1262
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:42,880
Haydar is a very ruthless man.

1263
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,320
He can destroy anyone

1264
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:47,000
for his own gain.

1265
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:52,680
Even those closest to him.

1266
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:02,160
I'm waiting for you in the backyard.

1267
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:03,800
Come here right now.

1268
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:08,600
Did something happen?

1269
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,400
This has shaken me up.

1270
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:18,520
I'm going out for some fresh air.

1271
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:44,640
My heart can't bear to see you like this.

1272
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:47,080
Come on, listen to your mother. Let's go to a hospital.

1273
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:50,240
No way, mom.

1274
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,960
Then the police will get involved.

1275
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:55,600
I'll be in big trouble.

1276
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:58,880
What are we going to do? How are we going to get out of this?

1277
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:04,120
I'm so scared, son.

1278
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:07,040
These men are blind with rage.

1279
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:12,920
They stopped us on the road and beat us up.

1280
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:14,680
Next time, they might try to kill you.

1281
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:16,520
God bless you.

1282
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:24,000
How are you, brother?

1283
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:27,800
Hope you're feeling better.

1284
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:30,160
I'm better.

1285
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:33,680
I still can't believe you.

1286
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:36,000
How could you keep something like this from me?

1287
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:42,440
Was I supposed to find out about the loan shark after my brother got beaten up?

1288
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:49,120
We didn't tell you so that you don't worry.

1289
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:52,480
What good would it do anyway?

1290
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:58,160
All the work at the mansion is left to you, I feel bad.

1291
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:59,880
I can't leave your brother like this and come.

1292
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,960
Don't worry about me, mom. Take care of my brother.

1293
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:13,560
I'll leave before Zehra notices I'm gone.

1294
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:15,300
Okay.

1295
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:19,000
You eat these and I'll walk her out.

1296
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:20,260
Okay mom.

1297
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:31,320
Berat.

1298
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:43,280
Are you crazy?

1299
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:44,680
What are you doing here?

1300
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:48,760
If someone sees, it will become apparent that I am collaborating with you.

1301
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:51,080
Then you'll answer my calls.

1302
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:53,760
I've called you so many times over the past two days.

1303
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:55,120
Why didn't you answer?

1304
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:57,880
We made an agreement with you.

1305
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:01,480
When I call, that phone will be answered.

1306
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:02,800
Whatever I want will be done.

1307
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,120
Otherwise, you know what will happen.

1308
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:08,040
I'll let you know when I find out something.

1309
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:13,040
Come on, go now before anyone sees you.

1310
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:17,840
Now I'm done.

1311
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:24,800
What are you doing here?

1312
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:28,880
I was just passing by, so I stopped in.

1313
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:31,960
What's going on, Aslı?

1314
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:37,000
What are you doing with this guy?

1315
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:39,000
Ms. Aslı.

1316
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,240
If you don't want to say it, I will.

1317
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:44,800
There's nothing to say.

1318
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:45,560
I.
Enough.

1319
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:49,920
Why did you come?

1320
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:54,680
I couldn't reach Ms. Aslı's phone.

1321
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:57,200
I came to tell her something.

1322
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:08,040
My client wants to have a meeting today regarding the project we're working on.

1323
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:10,040
There are some issues with the contracts.

1324
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:14,120
I need Ms. Aslı's opinion as a lawyer.

1325
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:19,500
Good.

1326
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:21,160
You told.

1327
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:25,040
Go away.

1328
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:34,680
Stay away from him Aslı.

1329
02:11:58,560 --> 02:11:59,520
Can we talk?

1330
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:02,560
Not now. I have something to do.

1331
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:09,360
We will talk.

1332
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:17,800
It won't take long. Please listen to me.

1333
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:21,840
What was that newspaper article about?

1334
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:23,960
How should I know?

1335
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,000
It's a case of mistaken identity, something else.

1336
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:29,140
And.

1337
02:12:29,560 --> 02:12:31,240
Who knows if your uncle was telling the truth.

1338
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:33,400
Stop asking me about it.

1339
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:39,760
I'm not done talking yet.

1340
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:42,620
Sorry.

1341
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:52,560
It can't be that simple.

1342
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:54,760
I think there's something fishy going on.

1343
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,840
This issue is getting old.

1344
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:58,520
Tahir this, Tahir that.

1345
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:00,600
Don't you have anything else to do?

1346
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:03,360
I'm done with him.

1347
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:05,560
So much mystery.

1348
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,120
Conflicting information.

1349
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:08,680
I feel.

1350
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:10,880
There's something else going on here.

1351
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:15,120
And I'm determined to find out the truth.

1352
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:17,200
Ateş, come here.

1353
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:20,300
Okay.

1354
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:21,560
Do it.

1355
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:27,440
Go ahead.

1356
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:30,680
Help me or not,

1357
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:32,880
I'm going to solve this mystery.

1358
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:47,200
She won't let go.

1359
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:50,320
What happened Cemal?

1360
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:52,800
We found address from where Rıza was staying.

1361
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:54,480
A shady neighborhood.

1362
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:56,360
Let's go without wasting any time.

1363
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:12,880
Here comes the feisty princess again.

1364
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:24,160
Where are you going?

1365
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:25,280
I have something to do.

1366
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:27,080
What is this?

1367
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:31,480
I have some questions in my mind.

1368
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:32,960
I'm going to search the answers.

1369
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,560
Where do you search them?

1370
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:38,440
In the old neighborhood where Tahir lived.

1371
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,240
I'll start over.

1372
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:43,320
I'll solve the mystery.

1373
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:47,480
You're going nowhere.

1374
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:49,220
I'll.

1375
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:51,600
You won't.

1376
02:14:52,640 --> 02:14:53,280
I'll go.

1377
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:56,680
Neither you nor anyone else can stand in the way.

1378
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:00,200
Ateş.

1379
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:02,480
Let's go, we're losing time.

1380
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:08,640
Ateş you go.

1381
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:10,920
I'll handle her, don't worry.

1382
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:12,200
No.

1383
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:14,880
In it together.

1384
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:16,560
Okay, you stay.

1385
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:17,640
I'll go and come.

1386
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:21,820
Come on.

1387
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:23,560
Let's go.

1388
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:33,360
I'll come too.

1389
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:35,380
Come on.

1390
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:03,760
Mom, this is no joke.

1391
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:05,640
What if they do something bad.

1392
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:07,520
What happened?

1393
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:09,680
I'm thinking of Mr. Murat.

1394
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:12,040
They tried to kidnap Mercan.

1395
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:13,480
God bless.

1396
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:17,000
I know this won't end well either.

1397
02:16:17,320 --> 02:16:19,200
But I have nothing.

1398
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:20,920
I asked my friends and family.

1399
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:24,280
They don't have anything either. They're all struggling.

1400
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:27,280
Should I get a second job?

1401
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:30,080
We'll save whatever we can earn and pay off the debt.

1402
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:34,040
You're struggling with the housework. How will you manage two jobs?

1403
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:35,800
I'll manage.

1404
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:38,320
As long as we get rid of this trouble.

1405
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:40,920
I don't want my brother to suffer again.

1406
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:43,040
My dear daughter.

1407
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:46,960
This debt won't be paid off in a few.

1408
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,880
And you don't go out either. God forbid.

1409
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:53,720
I'll find a solution.

1410
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:56,480
Go on, get back to your duties.

1411
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:57,320
Okay mom.

1412
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:10,120
It's not like that.

1413
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:12,440
Isn't her Mrs. Nermin?

1414
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:16,520
This is her.

1415
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:19,680
Who is she?

1416
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:21,440
Mr. Haydar's wife.

1417
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,000
She doesn't visit the company very often.

1418
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:25,000
I wonder why.

1419
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:29,200
So it seems we are going through exceptional times as a company.

1420
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:37,320
Mrs. Nermin, welcome. It's really good to see you.

1421
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:39,440
Thanks Yaşar.

1422
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,640
I want a coffee.

1423
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:50,760
Don't look at me like that.

1424
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:52,120
Tell them to make coffee.

1425
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:53,280
Mrs. Nermin.

1426
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:54,720
It's not his job.

1427
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:56,840
No problem, Mrs. Zahide.

1428
02:17:57,480 --> 02:17:58,000
I'll tell.

1429
02:17:58,600 --> 02:17:59,160
Non-sugar?

1430
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:01,400
Yes, non-sugar.

1431
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:07,240
Mrs. Nermin, this is Mr. Ateş's room.

1432
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:08,480
I can handle.

1433
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:10,120
God.

1434
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:12,920
If Mr. Ateş come, he'll be really angry.

1435
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:18,520
Burak, com to your senses.

1436
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:21,080
I'll go and make coffee.

1437
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:22,120
Non-sugar.

1438
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:25,480
God.

1439
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:28,120
It'll bad.

1440
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:41,720
You look here, I'll look there.

1441
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:46,080
This place stinks like a corpse.

1442
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:03,840
Smells so bad.

1443
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:06,200
Let's get it over with as soon as possible.

1444
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:33,160
What is this?

1445
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:35,260
What?

1446
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:40,320
I thought it was a box, but it was a book.

1447
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:41,960
Did you find anything?

1448
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:43,440
No, I didn't.

1449
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:46,840
Do you eat hazelnut?

1450
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:50,600
Are you left-handed?

1451
02:19:51,640 --> 02:19:52,140
No.

1452
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:54,000
Why didn't you open your other hand then?

1453
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:56,440
The environment is dirty, Cemal.

1454
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,360
And you're still talking about nuts.

1455
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:00,460
Anyway.

1456
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:01,640
Search little more.

1457
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:29,440
Let's go, there is nothing here.

1458
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:15,560
How do you know this place?

1459
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:20,800
Tahir told me.

1460
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:23,840
One of the few things that remain in my mind.

1461
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:39,440
After all these years,

1462
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:42,280
what do you expect to find here?

1463
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:46,400
You're right, it's been a long time.

1464
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:50,040
But it's still worth a try. Maybe I'll find out something about Tahir.

1465
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:54,000
Goal!

1466
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:56,200
Yes, this is it!

1467
02:22:56,800 --> 02:22:58,440
-Yes, goal. -This is it.

1468
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:06,520
Tahir, dinner is ready. Come home.

1469
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:07,800
Okay mom.

1470
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:48,040
Which one is the Tahir family's house?

1471
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:53,400
Are you okay?

1472
02:23:59,080 --> 02:23:59,680
Nothing.

1473
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,760
I think you drank your coffee, Aunt Nermin.

1474
02:24:22,600 --> 02:24:23,960
I'm really hungry.

1475
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:26,760
There's a nice restaurant nearby.

1476
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:28,600
Come on, let's go eat together.

1477
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:30,680
Look Demet.

1478
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:33,320
Look, I understand why you're trying to get rid of me.

1479
02:24:34,120 --> 02:24:35,400
I'm not stupid.

1480
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:36,720
But don't forget,

1481
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:38,600
this company is ours.

1482
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:41,920
My husband built it with his own hands.

1483
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:45,960
This chair belongs to my husband.

1484
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:47,960
Which means it belongs to me.

1485
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:51,120
Relax.

1486
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:53,920
I have every right to sit here.

1487
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:56,640
Of course you have the right, Aunt Nermin.

1488
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:59,440
Don't get me wrong. I don't mean to offend you.

1489
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:02,480
I just don't want to cause any trouble.

1490
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:06,800
Problems are part of my life, Demet.

1491
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:17,080
Get that woman out of here.

1492
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:18,400
Here comes the trouble.

1493
02:25:19,480 --> 02:25:20,680
There's no peace here either.

1494
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:23,600
Come on, out of here.

1495
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:27,400
I know the way.

1496
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:29,160
I'll go myself.

1497
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:44,880
Do you recognize the children in this photo? They used to live on this street.

1498
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:49,640
Are you sure?

1499
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,420
Okay.

1500
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:01,220
Excuse me?

1501
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:03,560
Do you recognize the children in this photo?

1502
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:06,520
No, I don't.

1503
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:14,140
Brother.

1504
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:16,840
Hello, may it be easy.

1505
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:19,520
Do you recognize the children?

1506
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:20,840
No.

1507
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:22,800
Are you sure?

1508
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:25,440
Okay, thanks.

1509
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:26,260
You're welcome.

1510
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:29,000
Sorry, hello.

1511
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:31,400
Do you recognize the children in this photo?

1512
02:26:32,520 --> 02:26:33,560
They lived here.

1513
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,520
I didn't see.

1514
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:37,880
Have a look again.

1515
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:39,640
No, we didn't.

1516
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:40,760
Okay.

1517
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:41,700
Thanks.

1518
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:51,360
Nobody knows anything.

1519
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:57,120
What did you expect?

1520
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:00,240
Years have passed.

1521
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:06,560
You won't get anywhere like this. Let's go now.

1522
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:11,800
Guys.

1523
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:13,760
I saw you from the window.

1524
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:15,360
Are you looking for someone?

1525
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:18,320
Yes.

1526
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:25,240
Do you recognize the children in this photo? They used to live on this street.

1527
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:31,120
Their faces have been erased. Nothing can be understood.

1528
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:36,320
They are Tahir and Eylül.

1529
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,400
Could you remember?

1530
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:41,160
Tahir and Eylül.

1531
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:42,560
Yes.

1532
02:27:43,320 --> 02:27:44,600
I remembered Tahir.

1533
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:46,880
Esma and Selim's son.

1534
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:50,600
He was a bold, fiery child.

1535
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,360
Esma and Selim later had a daughter as well.

1536
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:28,360
I didn't see Ateş's car.

1537
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:29,800
I guess they haven't come back yet.

1538
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:33,840
The foul smell from Rıza's house has gotten into my clothes.

1539
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:36,240
I'm going to take a shower and change my clothes.

1540
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:37,680
We'll talk later.

1541
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:38,300
Okay.

1542
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:40,160
I'll call Ateş and see where they are.

1543
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:52,240
I'll take care of this

1544
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:53,720
while that girl isn't around.

1545
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:04,760
Let's see what's inside.

1546
02:29:21,160 --> 02:29:22,080
How is this possible?

1547
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:35,040
If I use this wisely.

1548
02:29:35,960 --> 02:29:37,480
Two worlds come together,

1549
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:39,640
yet they cannot come together.

1550
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:48,840
I forgot the milk. Damn Çiçek.
