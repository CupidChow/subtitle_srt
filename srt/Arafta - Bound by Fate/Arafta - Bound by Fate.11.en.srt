1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
Cemal, I won't be coming tonight.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,520
Mercan is with me.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Nobody should worry.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,760
I talked to Ateş. He can't come tonight.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,480
Why can't he come?

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,320
Work stuff, Aslı. You know.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,440
That girl is with him, isn't she?

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,960
Newlywed couple. They must be spending some time alone, it seems.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,000
Eh! That's good.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,200
The kids couldn't even go on a honeymoon.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,800
Enough! Shut up!

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,640
Why did you get so angry?

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,680
Let me give you a little advice.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,160
Whatever your wife says, just say she’s right.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,840
Don’t oppose her.

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,800
Look at this.

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,360
I won’t let you have Ateş.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,880
I’ll ruin you!

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,160
I’ll make you regret being born.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,840
Why did Nezir send you a photo?

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,200
What business do you have with him?

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,560
He offered me something.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,720
Stay away from him Aslı.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,520
We are the strong ones.

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,160
We don't need him.

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,200
I'm not leaving it anyone from now on.

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,880
I'll take care of it.

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,400
My Lord has given you the most beautiful gift, your other half.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,360
You will give each other not just a home, but a life.

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,960
I'll get my hands dirty if I have to get rid of them.

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,880
Their fun is coming to an end.

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,600
They're at the end.

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,120
Their end will be very painful.

34
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,960
Those who live long

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,800
live up to a hundred years.

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,120
Come and tire yourself out in this world, crazy heart.

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,120
Durmuş.

38
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,160
Why do we need a grave for now?

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,280
Turn on a music and

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,640
lift our spirits.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,800
Doctor.

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,280
Doctor.

43
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,240
Come here.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
What happened?

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,600
She was shot.

46
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,400
With a gun. She lost a lot of blood

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,240
Take her to the operating room immediately.

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,200
Resist.

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,760
Put on an oxygen mask.

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Let's open the vein. Quickly.

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,600
Resist.

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,760
Hang in there, you'll be okay.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,080
I'm here.

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm here.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,160
Don't worry, you'll be okay.

56
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,080
Look at me.

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,720
Don't.

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,840
Don't close your eyes.

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,120
Her pulse is dropping.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,360
Hurry up.

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,680
What is that mean?

62
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,160
Careful.

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,640
You cannot enter; we will take the necessary action.

64
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,960
Mercan.

65
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,120
Mercan.

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,040
Don't.

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
She'll be okay.

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,320
I'm going.

69
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,520
Don't you have breakfast?

70
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,000
No, I'll eat out.

71
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,400
Cemal is calling.

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,160
Why?

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,320
Yes.

74
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,360
Haydar.

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,240
Ateş called me.

76
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,120
I have to tell you something.

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
What did he want to report?

78
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:24,920
Mercan.

79
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,760
Mercan was shot.

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,640
What?

81
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,280
How?

82
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,120
Who did this?

83
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,560
Where is she?

84
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,800
She is at hospital. I'm going there right now.

85
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,400
Who was shot Haydar?

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,720
Okay. I'll come there.

87
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,440
Haydar, who was shot?

88
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,960
Mercan.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,760
Did she die?

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,440
Did she die?

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,680
Haydar, answer me.

92
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,240
Okay.

93
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,280
Okay, let Demet know.

94
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,080
Come on.

95
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,760
First you ruined my son.

96
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
Now my daughter.

97
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,280
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
You are ominous people.

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,440
Ever since you walked through that door, nothing good has happened to us!

100
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,400
Nermin, it's not the time.

101
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,360
If anything happens to Mercan.

102
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,240
Why is she shouting?

103
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,440
I don't know.

104
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,880
I guess something happened to Mercan. She's talking nonsense.

105
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,680
Ateş is calling.

106
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,400
Ateş.

107
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,520
Why am I afraid something will happen to her?

108
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:51,960
Why?

109
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,200
What kind of man are you?

110
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
You can't protect the woman beside you.

111
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,040
If even a single strand of Mercan's hair is harmed

112
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,440
If you touch me again

113
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,520
I'll kill you.

114
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,800
She is a Karahan.

115
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,160
I'll make sure anyone who harms a single strand of her hair pays for it.

116
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,760
Not you.

117
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,560
I'll.

118
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,800
Nezir.

119
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,280
It's not the time.

120
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,320
How is she?

121
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,920
Nobody says anything.

122
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
My son had died.

123
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
I can't bear same pain.

124
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,560
Okay.

125
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Come aunt Nermin.

126
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,040
Mercan doesn't give up easily.

127
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
Your daughter is strong.

128
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,640
How did it happen? Who did this?

129
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,120
You will tell me who did it and why.

130
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,160
What are you talking about?

131
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,440
If the girl was shot because of your dirty things.

132
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm the one who should be asking questions here, not you!

133
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,040
I'll find out who did this.

134
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,320
Whoever did it will pay the price.

135
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,800
Pray.

136
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,840
Don't let it touch you.

137
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,000
No one can touch Ateş Karahan's wife.

138
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
No one can touch Ateş Karahan's wife.

139
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,480
Son.

140
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,280
Are you okay?

141
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,160
Did anything happen to you?

142
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,240
For heaven's sake, be careful, son.

143
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,960
This family's troubles never end.

144
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,200
It's clear they're all in the swamp.

145
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,960
Their son and daughter.

146
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,400
Müzeyyen mother stop.

147
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,080
There's someone fighting for her life inside.

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,240
Even now

149
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,560
you're still spewing hatred.

150
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,080
Have some fear of God.

151
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,320
Fear of God.

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,400
Nermin.

153
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,920
She's deliberately provoking you.

154
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,640
Calm down.

155
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,640
Did the truth hurt?

156
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,120
Mother Müzeyyen stop.

157
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,480
You have child too.

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,960
Be nice.

159
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,800
Ateş.

160
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,040
Are you okay?

161
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:17,880
I'm okay.

162
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,800
The operation was good.

163
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,720
Thank God.

164
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,280
Thank God.

165
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,480
We performed the procedure.

166
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,320
But the risk has not yet passed.

167
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,040
The situation is stable at the moment,

168
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,480
she will remain under observation in intensive care for a while.

169
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,040
Can we see?

170
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,480
Only if it's the closest one and very short.

171
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:49,960
I'm her father.
I'm her husband.

172
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,960
Come with me.

173
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,760
It was our right to see our daughter.

174
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,800
Not his.

175
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,440
He has fully embraced being a husband.

176
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,040
Wake up.

177
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,200
Wake up and challenge me again.

178
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,720
Do you hear me?

179
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,320
No one has ever stood up to me like you have.

180
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,480
You are the bravest woman I know.

181
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,280
Ever since I've known you,

182
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,960
I've seen you fight for everyone but yourself.

183
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,840
This time you have to fight for yourself.

184
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,720
Don't give up.

185
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,160
This place is very beautiful.

186
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,000
This place is very beautiful  Ateş.

187
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,520
I want to stay here.

188
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,600
I haven't felt this peaceful in a long time.

189
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,000
It's not time yet.

190
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,120
You can't stay here.

191
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,000
I need you.

192
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,000
I need you.

193
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
We would have kept Eylül's name alive together.

194
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,720
Don't turn your back on your dreams.

195
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,200
Your visit time is up.

196
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,840
Now she needs to rest.

197
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,040
Okay.

198
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,520
I'm here.

199
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
I know that you'll wake up.

200
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,600
My feet are hurt.

201
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,760
Mother.

202
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
Mrs. Mercan was shot.

203
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,840
What?

204
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,560
Was she shot?

205
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,960
What are you saying?

206
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,880
What happened?

207
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,440
I don't know mother.

208
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,400
They went to the hospital.

209
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,600
We'll know when they come.

210
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,680
God, Çiçek.

211
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,920
How could someone like Mrs. Mercan get into trouble?

212
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,080
God, bless Mercan.

213
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,840
I hope mother, nothing bad will happen.

214
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,040
Amen.

215
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,600
I don't think it has anything to do with me.

216
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,760
If there's anything I don't know, Haydar.

217
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Don't be ridiculous.

218
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,120
Shut up.
Nermin will hear you now.

219
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,960
How quickly you forgot that loan sharks kidnapped Mercan because of your debt.

220
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,400
It wasn't mine, Murat's debt.

221
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,360
Could Şahin's family

222
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,840
have suspected you?

223
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,120
The man suddenly disappeared.

224
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,480
I don't think so.

225
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,520
If I find the person who did this.

226
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,280
Uncle Haydar.

227
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,880
Can you talk to the doctors and arrange for Aunt Nermin to see Mercan?

228
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,440
I want to see my daughter.

229
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,560
You heard it too, Nermin, they let one person see.

230
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,120
With his parents around, why would it be up to him?

231
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,440
You'll be nervous if we stay here any longer. Let's go home.

232
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,360
Are you crazy?

233
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,680
Are we leaving without seeing Mercan?

234
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,680
The best thing to do is go and talk to the doctor in detail.

235
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,600
That way, Aunt Nermin will feel better too.

236
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,960
There's no point in waiting around for nothing.

237
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,520
Let's go.

238
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,320
Where are the others?

239
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,760
They haven't been around for a while, they must have gone home.

240
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,400
Well, let's go now.

241
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,360
I'm staying here.

242
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,840
Son, your mother and father are gone, why would you stay?

243
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,000
Mom is right, Ateş.

244
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,040
Even his mother shed a couple tears and then walked away.

245
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,440
You look very tired, with blood on your head.

246
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,360
Come on.

247
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,120
Cemal will bring something to wear.

248
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,120
How is she, Ateş?

249
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,360
She didn't die.

250
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
The surgery went well.

251
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,640
She'll be in intensive care for a while.

252
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,240
Cemal, take her home, mother Müzeyyen.

253
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,880
Mercan Haydar's daughter.

254
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,280
If she was shot that's their problem. Not yours.

255
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,680
Did you learn anything, Cemal?

256
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,720
No.

257
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
I asked the neighbors near the house where you stayed.

258
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,200
I even talked to the guys at the coffee shop.

259
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,960
No one saw or heard anything.

260
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,160
Find the person who did this, Cemal.

261
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,680
Don't worry.

262
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,280
I'll find even if it's in a needle's eye.

263
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,360
Don't leave Aslı and mother Müzeyyen alone tonight.

264
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,760
We don't know who shot Mercan.

265
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,600
Let's take precautions.

266
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,760
Don't let your mind stay at home. Don't worry.

267
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,560
You'll see, Mercan will be herself again soon.

268
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,440
What are you doing?

269
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,840
I'll find the person who did this to you.

270
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,320
Can you hear?

271
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,280
Yes.

272
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,840
This is the sound of water.

273
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,160
What does it say?

274
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,520
I'll tell you when the time comes.

275
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,120
It's as if the world breathes only for us.

276
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,120
Let time stand still here.

277
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,600
The lake,

278
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,280
the boat,

279
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,280
and us.

280
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,920
Like a fairy tale.

281
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,880
I'll be here until you wake up.

282
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,840
Open your eyes, come on.

283
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,680
It's compassion.

284
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,520
nothing else.

285
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,360
Why else would he care so much about that stupid girl?

286
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,720
She's Haydar's daughter.

287
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,120
What does Ateş have with her?

288
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,720
What if this incident brings them closer?

289
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,800
I wish she were dead.

290
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,920
I'm such a fool.

291
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,640
I couldn't do it.

292
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,600
What if Mercan saw me?

293
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,040
Ateş will never forgive me.

294
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,760
What are you talking to yourself about?

295
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,240
I can hear you from the hallway.

296
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,720
I.

297
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,680
I'm not saying anything mom.

298
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,840
You're messing things up.

299
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,880
What are you talking about?

300
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,120
Don't deny it.

301
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,680
I gave birth to you.

302
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,320
I know your heart.

303
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,680
Mom, what are you talking about?

304
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,120
Be honest.

305
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,480
Where were you all day?

306
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,080
I went to company.

307
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,040
I also went to meet with one of my former clients.

308
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,520
If you've done something wrong, admit it.

309
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,600
Otherwise, it will come out one way or another.

310
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,560
Weren't you at home either?

311
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,840
Am I accusing you of something?

312
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,520
No.

313
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,440
This can't go on.

314
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,720
I can't live in fear.

315
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,960
I need to get away from Mercan.

316
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,400
Do they live here?

317
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,320
Such a big home.

318
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,040
They were both so humble.

319
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,240
They didn't look down on our poor home at all.

320
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,840
They are good people.

321
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,680
Good evening.

322
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,680
Good evening.

323
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,720
Who were you looking at?

324
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,280
We came for Mercan.

325
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,080
The poor girl was shot in our house.

326
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,280
We were so worried, honestly.

327
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,840
We tried to call Ateş but we couldn't reach him.

328
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,560
Mrs. Mercan and Mr. Ateş are still in the hospital.

329
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,280
Please, let us offer you a cup of coffee.

330
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Thank you so much.

331
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,480
Thank you.

332
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,160
Mrs. Mercan was shot in their house.

333
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,160
They came because they were curious.

334
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,720
Mrs. Müzeyyen is Mr. Ateş's mother.

335
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,680
We are so sorry for you.

336
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,280
We are deeply saddened by what has happened.

337
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,280
May God save them.

338
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,400
Your son and daughter-in-law are both young gems.

339
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,160
May God have mercy on Mercan's youth.

340
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,880
May God grant her a long life with healing.

341
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,320
We had brought something for Mercan.

342
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,720
For the sake of healing

343
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,840
Mercan is in the hospital.

344
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,600
They'll come when she gets out.

345
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,800
I'll take it, auntie.

346
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,520
Thank you.

347
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,960
Take care.

348
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,920
Good evening.

349
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,760
Let's go.

350
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,720
What kind of woman is this?

351
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,960
She's like a worst nightmare.

352
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,280
Poor girl. God bless her.

353
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,480
Still nothing.

354
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,520
Son, did you talk to Malik? Maybe he found out something.

355
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
He doesn't know anything.

356
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,000
They only said she was in intensive care.

357
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,600
An angelic girl. Who could possibly have anything against her?

358
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,400
She never hurts or upsets anyone.

359
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,840
Mother.

360
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Ever since the Karahans moved into this house, they haven't seen a happy day.

361
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,040
First Murat, now Mercan.

362
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,280
Whoever did this, may their hands be broken!

363
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,240
Oh my, God forbid.

364
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,640
She'll get well soon.

365
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,200
Amen.

366
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,840
Poor Mrs. Mercan. I'm sorry for her.

367
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,920
She never received any love from her mother.

368
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,600
Always struggle, always injustice.

369
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,640
What about Mrs. Müzeyyen?

370
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
I can't comprehend that cruelty.

371
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,000
The woman with a frozen heart.

372
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,680
Real frozen heart.

373
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,000
Anyway.

374
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,000
Instead of talking about them,

375
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,880
let's pray.

376
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,560
May God accept them.

377
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
I'll wander around a bit. I'm feeling suffocated.

378
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,360
Looks like we won't be getting any sleep until morning.

379
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,680
I hope we can get good news as soon as possible.

380
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,640
I hope mom.

381
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,840
I hope.

382
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,880
You have to return to life.

383
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,320
You have a life left unfinished out there.

384
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,640
Books left unfinished.

385
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,520
Words left unsaid.

386
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,480
The projects you want to do.

387
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,240
You still have a lot of work to do.

388
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,200
You can't just leave like that.

389
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
What about the hospital?

390
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,080
Remember the lakefront we went to look at land?

391
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,920
You liked it there.

392
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,280
If you want, we can go again.

393
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,280
You can watch the lake again.

394
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,400
You can order whatever food you want again.

395
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,120
But first, you need to wake up.

396
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,560
You always insist on everything.

397
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,960
Open your eyes in spite of

398
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,720
those who did this to you.

399
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,000
I'll find who did this.

400
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,040
I promise.

401
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,320
Okay doctor.

402
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,000
We are waiting to hear from you. Thank you.

403
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,760
What does he say?

404
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,160
Still same.

405
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
She is in intensive care.

406
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,240
Shouldn't he have come to his senses by now?

407
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,400
Who would have thought

408
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,280
my son would die in the prime of his life.

409
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,360
What if Mercan dies too?

410
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,760
What would I do Demet?

411
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,920
No, we sinned.

412
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,160
Such disasters

413
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,640
don't happen.

414
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,240
We did something bad.

415
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,920
Stop talking nonsense.

416
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,720
Your son brought trouble upon himself.

417
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,520
Aunt Nermin.

418
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,960
Let's get you to your room.

419
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,160
Getting some rest will do you good.

420
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
I committed all my sins to

421
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,720
survive, to be treated like a man.

422
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,400
I don't regret any of them.

423
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,920
If you don't crush others, you'll be crushed, Nezir!

424
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,640
It's always like this.

425
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,280
What's the point of living if you can't get what you want.

426
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,720
So you won't feel sorry for anyone.

427
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,200
Yes.

428
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,440
Hopefully, as Ateş said, this matter won't affect me.

429
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,000
Don't you have a job?

430
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,520
May God accept it.

431
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,600
Amen.

432
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,040
May God grant that Mrs. Mercan recovers her health soon.

433
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,120
Amen mom.

434
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,080
Her life is still in danger, her condition seems bad

435
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,920
What are you saying?

436
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,600
Mrs. Mercan is strong. She will get through this too.

437
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,320
She has many loved ones.

438
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,280
Their prays and good wishes will lift her up.

439
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,040
Did I say something wrong?

440
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,680
Hopefully it will pass.

441
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,920
Don't talk as if I didn't want to!

442
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:46,960
Anyway.

443
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,160
Mrs. Müzeyyen said, “Don't let them spread out,

444
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,920
don't mess up the house.”

445
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,640
Why is the order of the house be disrupted?

446
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,400
You can make excuses like, “We're hurting,” or whatever.

447
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,200
Anyway.

448
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,640
Do your job.

449
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,520
This woman is driving me crazy.

450
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,800
Mrs. Mercan is still in intensive care.

451
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,080
Still not awake.

452
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,840
That's life.

453
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,480
It hangs by a thread.

454
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,360
Money, possessions.

455
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,160
None of it saves you.

456
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,920
Mr. Ateş.

457
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,000
He has all that money,

458
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
but his hands are tied.

459
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,560
What matters is living peacefully and safely.

460
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,720
Let this be a lesson to us.

461
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,480
Let's not bother ourselves.

462
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,280
As long as we're alive and well.

463
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,760
You said well.

464
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,760
Come on, wake up, please.

465
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,280
Ateş, how is she?

466
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,480
Nothing has changed.

467
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,920
My mind is still with you. You didn't want anyone else by your side.

468
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,040
Never mind me. Did you find anything?

469
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,840
No.

470
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,760
It's a bit difficult for us since there are no security cameras

471
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,440
We'll find out who it is.

472
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,360
Don't worry.

473
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,120
If necessary, we'll go door to door, Cemal.

474
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,040
Someone must have seen something.

475
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,680
A strange car that caught their attention.

476
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,800
We'll take care of it. Don't worry.

477
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,000
You take care of Mercan.

478
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,640
It's worrying that she still hasn't woken up.

479
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
I can't wrap my head around it.

480
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,560
She was so happy that day.

481
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,640
Zehra.

482
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,160
Don't put the others.

483
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,760
I want to enjoy breakfast on my own.

484
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,480
Okay.

485
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,520
Where is the Çakallı Menemen?

486
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,000
I waited for you for the service, I'll bring it right away.

487
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,960
What are you doing standing over me?

488
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,560
Go have breakfast somewhere else!

489
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,480
As a mother whose heart is burning,

490
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,960
my curses are upon you.

491
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,560
May you also be tested by the pain of losing your beloved.

492
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,680
Experience such pain that

493
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,480
even that stone you carry around as your heart

494
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,360
burns and scorches.

495
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:41,880
What is a stone?

496
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,720
This heart has passed through pain and become a mighty mountain.

497
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,000
No fire can touch it,

498
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,080
no wind can move it from its place now.

499
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,000
Don't be sure.

500
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,160
Before you know it,

501
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,560
the ground has shifted

502
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,040
and the mountain you trusted has crumbled.

503
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,880
Here, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

504
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,720
Burak.

505
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,480
That's all I need.

506
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,120
Thank you Burak.

507
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,480
You're welcome Ms. Demet.

508
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,440
Ms. Demet.

509
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,680
How is Mrs. Mercan?

510
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,960
Well.

511
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,800
I'm afraid to even ask,

512
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,720
how is Mrs. Mercan?

513
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,200
Burak was asking her too.

514
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,840
The surgery went well,

515
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,240
but he hasn't woken up yet.

516
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,040
She is so young.

517
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,960
She will wake up and recover. Don't worry.

518
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,640
I couldn't sleep a wink.

519
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,200
I wouldn't be this upset

520
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,800
if it were my own sister.

521
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,040
She is a very good person. She treats all of us here like family.

522
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,320
Mr. Ateş is also devastated.

523
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,480
He was at the hospital all night.

524
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,320
All company employees are very worried.

525
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,880
I hope she returns safely to us as soon as possible.

526
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,200
She will. I know it.

527
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,480
She is strong.

528
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,400
I hope.

529
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,280
How is the coffee, Ms. Demet?

530
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,360
Thank you so much Burak, really.

531
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,800
You're welcome.

532
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,120
Is there any change in my wife's condition?

533
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,960
There are no changes yet.

534
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,680
Run. Hurry up.

535
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,840
What's going on? What are you doing here?

536
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,280
The patient died. She had a cardiac arrest.

537
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,640
Mercan.

538
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,200
You can't go.

539
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,080
You can't go.

540
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,040
God please.

541
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,720
Please don't let anything happen to her.

542
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,440
Electroshock device, prepare 150 immediately!

543
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,400
Make it 200.

544
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,320
What's going on?

545
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:58,520
Why?

546
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
When did you arrive?

547
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,320
I had just arrived.

548
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,520
Doctors were rushing around.

549
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,840
My hands and feet were shaking.

550
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:19,920
God.

551
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,760
Please spare my only remaining child.

552
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,320
If I lose my only remaining child, I won't be able to live.

553
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,160
That won't happen, Nermin.

554
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Pull yourself together.

555
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,680
Mercan will come back to us.

556
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,920
Please don't give up, Aunt Nermin.

557
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,840
Mercan is the most resilient person I know.

558
00:59:59,160 --> 00:59:59,760
You'll see.

559
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,120
She'll walk out that door safe and sound. I have no doubt about it.

560
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,080
I hope.

561
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,120
Don't.

562
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,920
Don't do this to me.

563
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,560
We're trying one last time. 300.

564
01:00:59,120 --> 01:00:59,920
Hold on to life.

565
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,200
Don't.

566
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,200
The patient responded.

567
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:24,880
She turned to the sinus.

568
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,160
The rest is up to you.

569
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,200
Thank god.

570
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,200
How is she?

571
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,200
Please, I'll give you the information outside.

572
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,080
She is currently in critical condition.

573
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,840
However, she responded to our intervention. Her vital functions have returned.

574
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,360
Her condition is currently stable.

575
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,240
She will remain under close observation for a while longer.

576
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,040
Thank god.

577
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,600
I've told you.

578
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,200
I told you Mercan wouldn't leave us.

579
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,640
She didn't die.

580
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,720
So why did this happen?

581
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,080
We believe that Mrs. Mercan reflexively stopped the device.

582
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,240
This is a situation we occasionally encounter in unconscious patients.

583
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,080
Everything is fine now.

584
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,280
We will wait for her to wake up.

585
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,600
Thanks.

586
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:52,720
Get well soon.

587
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,160
Thank you.

588
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,880
You heard, thankfully, everything is fine.

589
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,160
Why did you come, Aslı?

590
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,720
Why would I come, Ateş?

591
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,800
I was curious about you.

592
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,160
You were at the door when she got worse.

593
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:17,760
Did you see anything?

594
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:19,680
I.

595
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,920
What can I see?

596
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,000
I had just arrived.

597
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,960
As soon as I arrived, I got caught up in a rush.

598
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,800
I really didn't understand what was going on.

599
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,600
You saw how I was.

600
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,320
Is there anything I can do for you?

601
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,440
No.

602
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:49,720
Go back to the mansion.

603
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,560
I will find whoever did this to you.

604
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,440
I will punish them with my own hands.

605
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,760
I will make them regret ever being born.

606
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,520
Do you remember?

607
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,600
Once when you were a child, you fell off your bike.

608
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,960
I  asked, “Does it hurt?”

609
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,800
You said, “If you were always by my side,

610
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,720
it wouldn't hurt, Tahir. I'd get better right away.

611
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,400
Now I'm right here.

612
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,000
Wake up.

613
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,840
Get better soon.

614
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,440
Tahir.

615
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,120
You finally woke up.

616
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,760
Our patient has woken up.

617
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,840
I'll let the doctor know right away.

618
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:54,360
Okay.

619
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:57,440
What happened to me?

620
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,160
Something bad happened.

621
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,320
But you're okay now.

622
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,480
You're safe.

623
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,360
Don't be afraid.

624
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,920
Let's see. Is everything okay?

625
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,400
Can you hear me, Mrs. Mercan?

626
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,600
How are you feeling?

627
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,880
Sleepy.

628
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,200
Lethargic.

629
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,800
It's normal to feel this way.

630
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,720
You've just woken up from a deep sleep.

631
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,000
How is it going?

632
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,800
Conscious.

633
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,560
Vital signs are normal.

634
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,920
But your spouse is more fragile due to the organ transplant surgery they underwent.

635
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,080
Is it because of the organ transplant?

636
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,000
Yes. That's why extra care is

637
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,360
needed during the recovery process.

638
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,680
We will act accordingly to meet this need.

639
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,400
Take care.

640
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:24,880
Get well.

641
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,040
Your spouse is more fragile due to the organ transplant surgery they underwent.

642
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,120
Good news.

643
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,000
Mrs. Mercan just came to.

644
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,240
She's conscious.

645
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,120
And her initial reactions are positive.

646
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,600
Thank you doctor.

647
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,360
She'll be okay.

648
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,120
Thanks.

649
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,320
Finally.

650
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,080
Finally.

651
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,040
God heard my voice.

652
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,240
God spared my only remaining child.

653
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,880
My daughter has come back to life.

654
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,920
Now we must be steadfast and stand tall, as befits us.

655
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,680
Let us make our enemies even more miserable.

656
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,920
What is this?

657
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,360
Look at that chair.

658
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,840
Would it work here?

659
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,520
This place needs to be organized.

660
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,320
They know nothing about cleanliness or order.

661
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,360
The flowers haven't been watered, they've dried up.

662
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,560
There's no one coming, so I can't find out what's going on.

663
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,200
Where were you, my dear?

664
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:37,720
What did you do?

665
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,080
Don't you dare say you went to visit Mercan.

666
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,920
Do you think I should visit that snake?

667
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,480
I went to see Ateş.

668
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:52,920
Look.

669
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,240
Have they found the person who shot Mercan?

670
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,320
Mom, you're asking questions about the afterlife again.

671
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,600
How should I know?

672
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,160
She didn't die.

673
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,440
I wish she had died so we could have been saved.

674
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:08,960
You'll see Ateş.

675
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,440
He never leaves her side for a second.

676
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,000
What we feared has come to pass.

677
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,560
I warned you repeatedly.

678
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,640
I said this, it didn't work.

679
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,680
Look.

680
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,760
Now we're seeing the results.

681
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,240
Let me arrange your pillow.

682
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,200
Well.

683
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,280
I'm thirsty.

684
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:22,720
I'll give.

685
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:26,600
Thanks.

686
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:31,840
Why?

687
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,880
Who shot me and why?

688
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,640
Didn't you see who did?

689
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,880
I didn't hurt anyone.

690
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,160
Why would anyone do that?

691
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:53,440
We don't know.

692
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,400
Not yet.

693
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,200
But trust me.

694
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:04,840
I'll find.

695
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,480
I'll find them and make them pay.

696
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,120
Don't worry about that.

697
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,520
Just focus on getting better.

698
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,200
But how?

699
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,440
I forbade you to ask questions.

700
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,320
You tire yourself out by talking.

701
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,200
Are you in pain?

702
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,240
I'll call the doctor.

703
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,440
No need.

704
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,360
Are you sure?

705
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,760
I'm stunned.

706
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,720
You like this.

707
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,080
So thoughtful.

708
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,080
So caring.

709
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,160
Good, but.

710
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,360
What about you?

711
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,360
You're grumpy even when you're sick.

712
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,440
What you call attention is the doctor's instructions to me.

713
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,040
You've had an organ transplant.

714
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:28,840
I didn't know.

715
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:33,160
Yes.

716
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,200
When I was little.

717
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,920
I don't even remember it clearly.

718
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,480
It's like a dream.

719
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,040
More like a nightmare.

720
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,000
You're awake.

721
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,680
Good. It's time for your medication.

722
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:11,960
Take it.

723
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,040
Do you need help?

724
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,160
Are you okay?

725
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,680
God spared Mrs. Mercan for her family. Thank God.

726
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:49,400
If she had lost her daughter too, she would have been completely devastated.

727
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,160
She would never have recovered.

728
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,360
Mr. Ateş was also very upset.

729
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,480
The man was heartbroken.

730
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,080
Well, she is his wife.

731
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,120
It's not easy.

732
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,200
That's what marriage is like. That signature binds hearts together.

733
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,720
Come on now. Don't keep me waiting.

734
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,520
I had a vow.

735
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,720
I'll offer lokma for the sake of Mrs. Mercan.

736
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,840
I'll help you too, Mom.

737
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,080
Who is this?

738
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,400
I guess there is need a car. Let me take a look at this.

739
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,040
I'll hang up.

740
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,440
It's none of your business.

741
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,600
I thought there was an urgent message from the hospital.

742
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:51,920
Çiçek.

743
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,600
Bring the large frying pan from the kitchen in the mansion.

744
01:18:59,160 --> 01:18:59,760
What happened?

745
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:00,920
I don't know.

746
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,560
Mom.

747
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:39,520
Dear.

748
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,400
You scared us so much.

749
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:44,840
How are you now?

750
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:46,960
I'm feeling better, Dad.

751
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,320
Of course, whose daughter?

752
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,040
She will be fine.

753
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,720
Thank god.

754
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,480
You're a Yıldırım.

755
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,280
My daughter will pull herself together and get back.

756
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,600
She won't make happy the Karahans.

757
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,080
I'm not in the mood to think about such things, Mom.

758
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,080
Dear.

759
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,240
Did you see the person who shot you?

760
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:16,560
I.

761
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,200
I don't remember.

762
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,760
Maybe if I rest a little.

763
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,120
Of course, rest, my dear.

764
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,080
Thank God.

765
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,600
I'm so glad to see you.

766
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,800
Rest now.

767
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,800
Get yourself together.

768
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,640
And then we'll talk about these things.

769
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,920
We'll come back with your mom.

770
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,160
Come on.

771
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,520
Get well soon.

772
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,640
You gave us a scare.

773
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,240
But thank goodness you're okay.

774
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,440
Thanks Cemal.

775
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,000
Are you okay?

776
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,440
Do you want something?

777
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,240
I'm okay.

778
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,640
I don't want anything, thank you.

779
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:58,600
Well done, good job.

780
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,440
Son, where were you?

781
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,400
I was praying aunt Binnaz.

782
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,840
Good for you.

783
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,800
May it be easy.

784
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,200
You've made so much.

785
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,440
Who's going to eat all these bites?

786
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,920
We are doing this for the sake of Mrs. Mercan.

787
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:21,320
With their prays, she will get back on her feet soon.

788
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,000
I hope.

789
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,520
Amen.

790
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,200
Delicious.

791
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:27,640
Well done.

792
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:29,720
Bon Appetit.

793
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:41,920
What's going on here?

794
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,600
We did it for Mrs. Mercan.

795
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,080
She went through a lot.

796
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,000
Why wasn't I informed? Who did you ask before doing this?

797
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,760
We do it for the sake of charity.

798
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,440
It's not up to you to do good deeds.

799
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,360
I am the mistress of this house.

800
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,000
Nothing will be done without my knowledge.

801
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,440
If the feet become the head, there will be no order or discipline left.

802
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,960
Don't waste time on trivial matters.

803
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,760
Everyone get back to work.

804
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,440
I want a nice dinner tonight.

805
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,240
Make some stuffed eggplant to go with the menu I gave you.

806
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,880
When it's cooked, don't forget to add lemon, garlic, and dried mint on top.

807
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,120
Okay.

808
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,440
What kind of hatred is this?

809
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,720
If Mrs. Mercan died, she would fry her halva with her own hands out of joy.

810
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,080
Don't listen to that fool.

811
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,240
Let's do our good deed.

812
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,240
They distribute it in front of the mosque.

813
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,160
Okay.

814
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,360
Okay mom.

815
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,840
God accepts our prays.

816
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,640
I brought tea. Drink it.

817
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,440
Thanks.

818
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,880
Would you like to listen for a bit?

819
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,360
I'm okay.

820
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,080
Still no progress?

821
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,080
Not yet.

822
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,680
I've got Haydar and his enemies on my radar.

823
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,640
Let's see who crossed the line.

824
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,200
Let's continue our research.

825
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,680
There's something that bothers me.

826
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,040
There's another unknown we need to solve here.

827
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,680
Were you the target, or was it Mercan?

828
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,400
Maybe Mercan was shot because they missed you?

829
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,080
I don't think so.

830
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,960
If he wanted to shoot me, he would have done it.

831
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,200
He had the chance to do so.

832
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,480
So, according to you, the target was Mercan.

833
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:01,840
An amateur hand.

834
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,160
He missed.

835
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,400
Thank God.

836
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,760
If the person pulling the trigger had been a professional,

837
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,400
he wouldn't be alive now.

838
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:15,800
God forbid.

839
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,080
I don't remember ever seeing you like this before.

840
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,320
How?
Tired.

841
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,320
Sad.

842
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:26,840
Helpless.

843
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,360
Tired.

844
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,440
Sad.

845
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,440
Helpless.

846
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,120
Me?

847
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,680
Don't get angry right away.

848
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,440
We had years together. I know you.

849
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,960
There's clearly a problem.

850
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,920
A problem you can't even admit to yourself.

851
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,840
If there's something troubling you, tell me.

852
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:45,680
Nothing.

853
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,640
You're imagining things.

854
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,320
Really I am.

855
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,320
Why am I so worried?

856
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:54,640
Yes.

857
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,240
Okay.

858
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:00,960
What?

859
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,800
The children found someone who had a grudge against Haydar.

860
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,000
Is the address clear?
Yes.

861
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,720
Send it to me. I'll go and take care of it.

862
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,040
Let me handle it, brother.

863
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:09,640
I said send me.

864
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,320
I'm leaving this place in your care.

865
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,400
Who is the deliverer?

866
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,080
I don't know.

867
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,440
Tell them to make me some coffee.

868
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,280
Of course, Mr. Haydar. Anything else you need?

869
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,880
Make it foamy.

870
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,080
What was your name?

871
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,360
Burak Yücel.

872
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:52,920
Burak Yücel.

873
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,320
What are you doing?

874
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,520
-Weekly reports? -Yes, weekly reports.

875
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,360
Look at him.

876
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,040
His daughter is on her deathbed, and he comes to work.

877
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,560
And he asked for coffee.

878
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,400
He said foamy.

879
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,720
It's so insensitive.

880
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,640
Anyway.

881
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,120
Just got here?

882
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,600
I dropped Nermin off at home first.

883
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,800
While Ateş isn't here, let's see what we can do.

884
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,600
You seem very cautious. Is everything okay?

885
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,400
Walls have ears.

886
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,000
There are too many ears around these days.

887
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:36,320
Who is that?

888
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,360
Let's take care of it right away.

889
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:39,600
We will.

890
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,560
We'll see. But not now. When the time comes.

891
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,400
Once I'm done with my work,

892
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,440
I'll take care of the mole

893
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,520
and whoever put it on my trail.

894
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:55,480
Yes.

895
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:58,560
Okay, I'm coming.

896
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,240
You just got here. Where are you rushing off to?

897
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,880
Our guys found someone they suspect shot Mercan.

898
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:06,880
I'm going there.

899
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,080
Okay. Let me know.

900
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:09,760
Okay.

901
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,400
Who are you looking at, buddy?

902
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,520
I won't talk to you.

903
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:43,800
Stop barking.

904
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,880
Your owner can come.

905
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,800
I'm here, don't you like it?

906
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:50,680
I don't like it.

907
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,080
Which one of you İlyas?

908
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:28,720
Speak.

909
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,800
He is. I swear he.

910
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,120
I'm not lying.

911
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,280
Do you know Mercan Yıldırım?

912
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:39,880
No.

913
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,280
I haven't heard of her.

914
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,040
My wife was shot! Tell me who did it?

915
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,040
Tell me.

916
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:46,840
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you

917
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,360
and these guys too.

918
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,680
I swear to God, I don't know.

919
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,080
Okay.

920
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:53,760
What if I say Haydar Yıldırım?

921
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:55,400
My wife's father.

922
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:56,720
Maybe that name rings a bell.

923
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:57,880
I know him.

924
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,960
We had a feud before.

925
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,560
But we settled our issue.

926
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,120
Haven't seen him in a long time.

927
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,720
Shooting a woman is against our code.

928
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,320
That's how we were taught.

929
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,000
Look.

930
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,480
Tell me true.

931
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,520
Are you done?

932
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,080
If I find out something,

933
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,080
I'll come back.

934
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,000
Then I won't be so lenient.

935
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,160
No, brother. Honestly, we don't know anything.

936
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,640
You're always behind.

937
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,160
Don't waste your energy.

938
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,800
The person you're looking for isn't here.

939
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,080
If you borrow from a loan shark, this is what you get.

940
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,800
I'll tell you something.

941
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:25,960
From my land.

942
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:30,760
I'm translating.

943
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,560
Those who don't consult anyone will regret it in the end.

944
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:35,400
What does borrowing from a moneylender mean?

945
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,600
Did I have any other choice?

946
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,040
If I hadn't paid, we would have lost our job

947
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,600
and faced foreclosure.

948
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,480
This is better, right?

949
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,280
You handed yourself over to the mafia.

950
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,160
How are you going to find that much money?

951
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,320
I wish I had knew.

952
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,960
If I can't find it, you'll have to distribute my halva behind my back.

953
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,440
Stop talking nonsense.

954
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,680
We will find a solution.

955
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:08,280
Malik.

956
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:09,440
Man.

957
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,760
If you were the son of a wealthy sheikh, I would borrow money from you.

958
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,920
But I'm not, right?

959
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,360
You're shooting bullets at pennies just like us.

960
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,720
I swear I would pay my debt down to the last penny.

961
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,240
It would have been okay if you hadn't paid.

962
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,800
You don't have any money, so of course you'll talk like that.

963
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,320
I'd pay, don't worry.

964
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,880
You jerk.

965
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:34,240
Come on.

966
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,640
Come on, let's leave before Mrs. Müzeyyen notices we're gone.

967
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:43,160
Put here.

968
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,320
But we have finished, it was good.

969
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:55,920
Yes.

970
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:57,600
It was good.

971
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,760
Any news?

972
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:15,120
Everything's just as you left it.

973
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,120
Mercan is fine.

974
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:18,840
How are you, really?

975
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:19,800
I'm fine.

976
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:22,960
It wasn't Ilyas who pulled the trigger.

977
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,000
They don't know anything.

978
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,960
Then keep investigating, brother.

979
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,360
You're tired too. Go home and get some rest. I'll stay here.

980
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:32,800
Take care.

981
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,600
Thank you. I'll handle.

982
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,280
How long have you been gone? Where were you?

983
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,760
I had a small task to do. I took care of it.

984
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,560
Why?

985
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:05,520
Did you wonder?

986
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:12,800
Did you miss me?

987
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:17,880
Of course.

988
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,360
Come on.

989
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,400
It's time to eat. Come on, let's straighten you.

990
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:24,320
Give me your hand.

991
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,080
What happened to your hand?

992
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,320
It's no big deal.

993
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,920
Don't worry about it. Come on, eat your dinner.

994
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,000
I won't eat until you tell me what happened.

995
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,640
Besides, you're badly injured. You need a bandage

996
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:55,840
Nurse!

997
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:57,920
Nurse!

998
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:14,920
Okay.

999
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,040
Don't make a fuss.

1000
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:31,320
We got into a fight with a guy I suspected shot you.

1001
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,160
But he didn't do it.

1002
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,400
We're looking into it.

1003
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:39,160
Is that all?

1004
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,600
You're not hiding anything from me, are you?

1005
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:43,200
No.

1006
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:48,920
Okay.

1007
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,280
Now go and get your hand bandaged. Otherwise, you'll get an infection.

1008
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,440
Okay.

1009
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,080
But after you finish your meal.

1010
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,040
I don't want.

1011
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:39,480
Leva it to me.

1012
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,080
His behavior is fine.

1013
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,280
But his eyes.

1014
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,480
Like he's going to hit someone.

1015
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,160
What kind of person are you?

1016
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,680
One minute like this, the next like that.

1017
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,120
I don't understand.

1018
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:27,960
You eat too.

1019
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:29,120
I'm full.

1020
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,720
You're a terrible liar.

1021
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:36,800
Don't be stubborn,

1022
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,240
take a few bites.

1023
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,800
And don't forget what Uncle Durmuş said.

1024
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,240
You'll say “Okay.” Otherwise, you'll get a headache.

1025
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:18,960
Can we come?

1026
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,720
Of course.

1027
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:03,400
Mercan.

1028
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:18,640
What happened?

1029
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:20,000
Are you okay?

1030
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:23,040
No.

1031
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,480
No, I'm okay.

1032
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:29,760
I'm okay.

1033
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,280
I've been thinking about you since yesterday.

1034
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,360
When I heard the news, I felt like I'd been hit in the head.

1035
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,280
Wouldn't it be better if we didn't bring this up?

1036
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:49,840
You're right.

1037
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:51,920
I was thoughtless.

1038
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:06,360
My dear friend.

1039
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,320
I'm glad to see you.

1040
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:10,000
I'm fine, don't worry.

1041
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,080
I was sure you would get better.

1042
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,160
I never doubted it for a moment.

1043
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,040
Because I know how strong you are.

1044
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,600
My mind has been on you since yesterday.

1045
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,840
haven't been able to sleep at all.

1046
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,680
Sleep is forbidden to me until I find the murderer who shot you.

1047
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,520
I will catch that murderer and make him pay.

1048
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,200
I'll catch him.

1049
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,040
I'll make him pay.

1050
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,520
Let's not tire our patient any further.

1051
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:49,560
Let's leave quietly.

1052
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,400
Now get some good rest, dear.

1053
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,720
We'll come visit you again.

1054
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:01,720
Okay?

1055
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,360
Okay Demet, see you.

1056
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,480
Get well soon.

1057
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,320
If you need anything, I'm at your service.

1058
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:11,680
Thanks.

1059
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:21,480
Come on.

1060
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,320
Go now, someone can see us.

1061
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:47,800
I want to see you more.

1062
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,640
My mother can come.

1063
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:54,040
They won't come. They're at the mansion, cleaning it.

1064
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,240
That's why we can stay little more.

1065
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,720
Okay.

1066
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:04,480
Malik.

1067
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,040
Well, life is good to you.

1068
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:13,440
What do you mean?

1069
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,960
I mean you've opened a shop in a good location.

1070
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,520
You've got everything you could want.

1071
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,520
You've taken the good boy.

1072
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,200
Don't be ridiculous. There's nothing like that.

1073
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,520
Should I believe you or what I see?

1074
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,760
And you had the nerve to play games with me.

1075
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:31,640
I was embarrassed.

1076
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,640
I was too embarrassed to tell you.

1077
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,920
Please keep this between us.

1078
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,080
I'll do whatever you want.

1079
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,920
If necessary, I'll take care of your business too.

1080
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:41,760
No, I won't.

1081
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,080
I'm not a simple servant like you.

1082
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,560
I'm Mrs. Müzeyyen's chief assistant.

1083
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,920
I'm her right-hand woman. She trusts me completely.

1084
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:52,480
If you want me to keep my mouth shut, you'll have to do something.

1085
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,160
I told you, I'll do whatever you want.

1086
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:59,440
You'll leave Malik.

1087
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:04,840
What?

1088
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:06,840
What are you saying?

1089
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:10,360
Either you break up,

1090
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:13,440
or I'll go tell your mother right now. She'll break you up.

1091
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,200
Then the whole mansion will hear about what you.

1092
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,360
I don't know what happens after that.

1093
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:35,960
You think the rest.

1094
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,280
Did you get your hand bandaged?

1095
01:45:59,400 --> 01:45:59,840
I did.

1096
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,480
Don't worry, it's just a small cut.

1097
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:04,600
I'm doing it. It's out of my hands.

1098
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:17,160
So it's an open wound after all. It could get infected. That's why.

1099
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,160
My hair is tangled.

1100
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:33,360
Enough.

1101
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,600
Okay.

1102
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:37,720
Thank you.

1103
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:47,760
Are you in pain?

1104
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:49,040
I can call the nurse.

1105
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:51,000
No need. It happens sometimes.

1106
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:01,680
What are you thinking about?

1107
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:08,160
That moment when I was close to death.

1108
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,360
There's a fine line between life and death.

1109
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:20,920
Like.

1110
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,360
It's like you're in limbo.

1111
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:29,920
You're caught between two worlds.

1112
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:40,800
Life really is a gift given to us.

1113
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:45,520
I'm going to do the things I wanted to do but couldn't.

1114
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,360
I won't put anything off anymore.

1115
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:53,240
Because.

1116
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:57,400
I don't know if there will be a tomorrow.

1117
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,520
I want you to promise me something.

1118
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,800
This might be the first and last thing I ask of you.

1119
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,080
Eylül Hospital.

1120
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,280
If anything happens to me,

1121
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:38,040
please finish the unfinished project.

1122
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:40,080
Open that hospital.

1123
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,800
It's a symbol that I haven't forgotten her.

1124
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:50,800
You should get well soon and complete the project.

1125
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:00,000
I'm sure your friend would want that too.

1126
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,360
This won't do. I'll call the nurse.

1127
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,920
Could Mercan have seen me?

1128
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,440
No.

1129
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,080
If she had, she would have said so.

1130
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,440
Maybe she doesn't remember.

1131
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:38,480
What if she does remember?

1132
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,920
Then I'll be finished.

1133
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,200
I'll lose Ateş forever.

1134
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,360
No. That won't happen.

1135
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,440
Besides, it was dark.

1136
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,280
She couldn't have seen from that distance.

1137
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:57,240
I know.

1138
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,600
Know what?

1139
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:09,320
I know what you are doing.

1140
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:17,880
You're fixated on something again, talking to yourself.

1141
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,480
You look tense. Is something wrong?

1142
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:23,520
No.

1143
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:24,640
I'm okay.

1144
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:27,760
I get it. There is something.

1145
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,640
I was thinking about what happened.

1146
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:32,960
Everything just piled up.

1147
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:34,520
What's the matter?

1148
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,360
Why did Mercan getting shot affect you so much?

1149
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:40,880
It's not that Cemal.

1150
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,200
Even though I hate her,

1151
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,000
I was a little shaken.

1152
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,280
Seeing her like that today.

1153
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,080
Don't worry.

1154
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:50,760
Mercan is fine.

1155
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,960
It'll be even better if we find the killer who did this to her.

1156
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:57,320
I hope so.

1157
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,120
It was a tiring day.

1158
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:02,560
I'm going to bed.

1159
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:04,320
Good night.

1160
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:05,400
Good night.

1161
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,120
How are you now?

1162
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:30,960
Better.

1163
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:32,880
Do you need anything?

1164
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,040
Could you raise the head of the bed a little?

1165
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,000
Something very strange happened.

1166
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:10,920
What?

1167
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:14,240
I saw Tahir in my dream.

1168
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,000
He held my hands.

1169
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,440
“I'll always be with you,” he said.

1170
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,160
Is that all he said?

1171
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:29,880
I don't know.

1172
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,960
That's all I remember.

1173
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,160
What was Tahir like?

1174
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:37,640
He was sincere in what he said.

1175
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:39,720
And he was happy.

1176
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:44,200
Was he really the happy?

1177
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:49,760
I mean.

1178
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:53,360
If he was happy, why did he run away?

1179
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,720
Why did he disappear?

1180
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:58,920
I don't know.

1181
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,800
I'll ask him when I find him.

1182
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,200
Why didn't he call all this time?

1183
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:11,200
Where is he now?

1184
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:45,880
Here, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

1185
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:54,640
Bring there.

1186
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:56,120
I'll drink there.

1187
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,640
Zehra, tell Aslı to call Ateş.

1188
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,480
I tried calling him but couldn't reach him. I'm worried.

1189
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,640
I'll tell her right away, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

1190
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:25,880
Don't worry, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

1191
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:28,400
He's with Mercan.

1192
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:35,200
He's been such a good husband to my daughter.

1193
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,800
He takes such good care of Mercan.

1194
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,160
How dare you?

1195
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:59,200
You can't drink coffee like that in front of me!

1196
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:03,400
Zehra.

1197
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:12,600
Tell Aslı what I said. Then clean up this mess.

1198
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,360
I'm sorry.

1199
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,120
You suffered because of me.

1200
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:25,640
It's okay.

1201
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:27,840
You leave it.

1202
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:30,640
Tell Çiçek to clean it up.

1203
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,400
We gave Mrs. Mercan painkillers so she could sleep comfortably.

1204
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:42,920
Thank you.

1205
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:44,040
You're welcome.

1206
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,720
I'm as close to you as Tahir,

1207
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:56,400
but as far away as Ateş.

1208
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:02,200
If I were close,

1209
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:04,920
I'd hurt you.

1210
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:11,760
I am hurting you.

1211
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:20,000
If I were Tahir.

1212
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,040
What would I do if I were Tahir?

1213
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,280
What would I do?

1214
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:29,920
I saw.

1215
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,000
I saw.

1216
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:38,240
What? You saw what?

1217
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,320
What did you see?

1218
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:50,320
I remembered.

1219
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,640
Don't push yourself.

1220
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:37,560
There’s nothing better than coming home.

1221
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:47,120
My girl.

1222
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:52,480
My girl.

1223
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:56,240
Are you okay, girl?

1224
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:57,680
I'm okay dad.

1225
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,520
Welcome.

1226
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,440
Any updates?

1227
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:19,520
Not yet.

1228
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:26,120
For now.

1229
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:37,760
Only a small detail that Mercan remembers.

1230
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,480
The one who shot me...

1231
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:58,640
The one who shot me had white clothes.

1232
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:02,520
Did you see anything else? Maybe their face?

1233
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:09,600
I don't remember anything. All I saw was white clothes. No face, no body. Nothing else. I don’t remember.

1234
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:29,440
Thank God… Are you okay, my girl?

1235
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:31,040
I’m okay, Sister Binnaz.

1236
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:45,880
She's back again. She's grabbing all the attention, I bet she enjoys it.

1237
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:50,440
Annoying little thing.

1238
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:54,360
Get well soon, Mrs. Mercan.	-Thank you, dear.

1239
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:56,720
Wishing you a speedy recovery.

1240
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:58,080
Get well soon.

1241
02:03:58,400 --> 02:03:59,720
Thank you.

1242
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:44,640
What is it? What's the matter?

1243
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:47,680
Nothing.

1244
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,240
I'm fine.

1245
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:51,080
Okay.

1246
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,080
Where's your necklace, dear?

1247
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:04,960
Must be somewhere in the room.

1248
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,880
You never take it off though?

1249
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:10,320
I took it off as you see, mom.

1250
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,640
My girl.

1251
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:22,760
Let's go to your bed. Don't stand around here.

1252
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:28,560
I missed the home so much. The garden... I want to breathe fresh air.

1253
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:31,000
Dear, you just got back on your feet. Maybe don’t push yourself?

1254
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,200
No, Dad. I’ll walk around a bit.

1255
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:34,320
Okay then.

1256
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,720
Yes, Mr. Enver?

1257
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:43,960
Good afternoon, Mr. Ateş. You wanted to be kept updated on Mrs. Mercan’s case.

1258
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:50,680
Unfortunately, there’s no progress yet. But rest assured, the investigation is ongoing intensively. 	I wanted to call and inform you personally.

1259
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:53,200
Okay. Thank you.

1260
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,680
What are you doing?

1261
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:20,320
Are you okay?

1262
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:26,320
What are you doing?

1263
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:32,800
Taking you to the room before you injure yourself.

1264
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,880
How could you carry her in your arms?

1265
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:16,040
I hate this girl.

1266
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:24,240
Okay, you can put me down, I've got my arms and legs. No big deal.

1267
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:40,080
I've got it.

1268
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:46,920
No leaving this room until you're fully recovered.

1269
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:51,640
I don't care if you want to go out to the garden.

1270
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:54,000
How can I recover without getting fresh air?

1271
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:57,560
Don't worry, we can open the windows.

1272
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:10,040
Whatever... It's better than the hospital.

1273
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:18,880
There's nothing like being home, even it's a prison.

1274
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,560
Dear?

1275
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:34,240
Mercan... Thank god you're well. Go on, rest well, my girl.

1276
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:40,520
How can anyone get better seeing him, anyway…

1277
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:46,760
But at least he protects you.

1278
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:50,000
And he took good care of you at the hospital.

1279
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:55,720
He even carried you in his arms.

1280
02:08:55,880 --> 02:08:56,840
Nermin.

1281
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:59,240
What? Am I lying, Haydar?

1282
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:02,520
Darling, what would you like me to have made for you?

1283
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:08,200
Let’s have a nice bone broth made, Haydar.

1284
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:10,920
It may smell, but it gives strength.

1285
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:24,040
Oh thank God, really. Thank God a thousand times.

1286
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:26,240
She has God's mercy on her.

1287
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:29,160
Exactly, my girl. It's a gun, not a joke.

1288
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:34,480
The one who shot is still unknown. I swear it's a crime movie.

1289
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:36,680
Whoever did it, may their hands break.

1290
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:37,560
Amen.

1291
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:40,120
May them face the worst.

1292
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:40,920
Amen.

1293
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:44,040
Actually, may them miss the lottery jackpot by one number.

1294
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:44,840
What?

1295
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:47,880
I mean, mom...

1296
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,000
You know being broke is worse than being shot. That’s the truth.

1297
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:56,280
Go away, kid, stop talking nonsense. Stay off my feet.

1298
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:59,920
Yes, brother you should go away. Stay off the feet. Go on.

1299
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:00,960
I'm going?

1300
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,040
Yes, go on.

1301
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:03,720
Look, I'm going.

1302
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:04,800
I'm out.

1303
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:06,080
Go.
Çiçek.

1304
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:10,360
Let's prepare the food Mrs. Mercan likes the most.

1305
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,200
Let her eat and get well.

1306
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:15,200
Oh, do you see how drained she is, in just two days?

1307
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,600
She nearly died. it’s not easy at all.

1308
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,120
Çiçek.

1309
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:23,080
Is there any tea?

1310
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:25,200
Yes brother, yes there is.

1311
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:26,680
Give me a cup please.

1312
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:29,160
Brother's lovely sister.

1313
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,160
Give it to him so he can shut up.

1314
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:44,480
Okay. Got it, thank you.

1315
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:50,120
There was someone I hadn’t talked to, so I called them. They hadn’t seen anything either.

1316
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:51,040
Why though?

1317
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:56,960
Mercan... She remembered the one who shot was wearing white. That's the only information we have.

1318
02:10:57,680 --> 02:10:59,000
White?

1319
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:04,080
I mean, everyone can wear white.

1320
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:07,720
Sure... But at least we have a starting point.

1321
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:11,200
No way. She couldn't have seen.

1322
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:13,560
She'll remember slowly.

1323
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:18,880
I think you shouldn’t push her too much to remember.

1324
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:22,560
Too much pressure would traumatize her.

1325
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:26,320
Oh really? Since when did you care about Mercan this much?

1326
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:31,720
I don't care about that girl at all. I care about you.

1327
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:35,000
She is traumatized at the moment.

1328
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:41,840
If you pressure her to remember, she could make up some nonsense and get you in trouble.

1329
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:46,040
We don't fear trouble.

1330
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:54,880
The only thing I think is to find the one who did it, and make them pay.

1331
02:11:56,440 --> 02:11:59,120
It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack, brother.

1332
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:03,440
I'll burn that haystack if necessary, and still find the needle.

1333
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:10,280
I’m the only one to make the Yıldırım family pay.

1334
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:16,440
And there is a time for that.

1335
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:20,680
No one can deal with my gameplan.

1336
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:25,480
I should go check on my mother.

1337
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:38,080
What is this mess? Don't put them like this, oh god.

1338
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:43,080
Let's see what is here...

1339
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,720
This is also dirty.

1340
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:52,080
And this one too.

1341
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,240
What are you doing here?

1342
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:06,360
Well, Ms. Aslı, I was just sorting the laundry.

1343
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:08,720
No need, get out.

1344
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:10,120
Okay.

1345
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:24,160
What are you still doing here? Why are you not out?

1346
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:28,600
Sorry, I dropped it. I’ll pick it up right away.

1347
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,040
Mrs. Binnaz.

1348
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:34,000
Bring them to me.

1349
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:49,320
Don't take my clothes without permission again.

1350
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:52,200
Do I take these?

1351
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:22,800
Where is your necklace, dear?

1352
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:25,600
You never took it off.

1353
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:30,160
My necklace.

1354
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:00,320
Where is it?

1355
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:05,160
What am I going to do now?

1356
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:09,640
Or...?

1357
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:12,160
Did I drop it there?

1358
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,720
Who will find my necklace?

1359
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:22,240
Ateş knows it. He knows my necklace.

1360
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:30,280
Calm down.

1361
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:34,640
Calm down Aslı. You're a very smart girl.

1362
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:36,840
Think calmly.

1363
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:42,200
I'll get away with this.

1364
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:51,600
No news from Haydar’s enemies either, right?

1365
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:52,840
No, brother.

1366
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:57,280
Knocked on the friendly doors, broke the enemy doors, but there is nothing.

1367
02:15:58,760 --> 02:16:00,600
Security cameras on the village road?

1368
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:05,560
I've spoken, we should hear about it in any moment. I'm also getting the gas station cameras checked.

1369
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:17,040
We came to visit the patient.

1370
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:20,160
Please.

1371
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:23,880
Don’t make things difficult at a time like this.

1372
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:28,400
As you said, she is a patient. Patient needs to rest.

1373
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:33,640
You can't stop me from seeing Mercan, even if you stand here like a castle wall.

1374
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:36,320
Already stopped you.

1375
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:42,720
Who the hell you think you are?

1376
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:45,760
Step aside.

1377
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:50,440
I think it's safer for you to stay outside.

1378
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:56,800
You have no right to this.

1379
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,160
Yes, I do.

1380
02:16:58,440 --> 02:17:00,720
Only you can come in.

1381
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:02,760
Not your brother.

1382
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:07,240
What's that nonsense?

1383
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:09,680
I'm not going in if my brother can't.

1384
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:11,000
Fine.

1385
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:12,760
Your choice.

1386
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:21,320
Brother, let's go.

1387
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:23,720
I said get out of my way.

1388
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:30,640
What's going on?

1389
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:33,360
Who's shouting like that?

1390
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:52,320
You can't do everything you want.

1391
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:56,960
Mom?

1392
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:05,120
Çiçek.

1393
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,840
My decision regarding you won’t allow you to pass this line.

1394
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:42,880
There is no big deal.

1395
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:44,920
It's the same Nezir.

1396
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,400
I'll show you who is the deal.

1397
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:49,480
You better cut it out.

1398
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:53,440
The patient needs to rest.

1399
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:55,600
And you should go.

1400
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:59,600
Never mind brother, let's go.

1401
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:03,200
The more we let it slide, the more they push us.

1402
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:07,320
Brother. We can call Mercan.

1403
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:10,400
I can do anything for Mercan.

1404
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:14,960
I'll be back. I'll be back to run over you.

1405
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:52,760
I hate you with all my heart.

1406
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:09,200
You'll walk away from our life.

1407
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:12,640
And I will make that happen.

1408
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:37,880
Ateş... Is mine.

1409
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:40,080
Do you understand?

1410
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:46,040
He... Is mine.
