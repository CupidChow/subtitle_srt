1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,200
Take off that rag.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,320
Mother Müzeyyen.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,320
Look at what the great Haydar
Yıldırım’s daughter has come to.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,520
The vile thing that woman did…

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,680
We have to make it up to Mercan.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,440
Ateş Karahan.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,240
Face me if you are a
man. Look, I am all alone.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,200
I won’t let you have Mercan.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,640
She is my wife now.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,120
If I ever see you near her again...

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,600
I’ll make you pay the heaviest
price you’ll ever face in this life.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,920
You’d sell anything
for money, wouldn’t you?

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,200
Even your honor, your dignity.

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,320
Now, look at my eyes again.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
What do you see?

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,639
I’ll show you what it means to
take Nezir Keseroglu out of the game.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,760
I swear we did our part.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,240
Kept our word.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,200
Have you fulfilled your
wifely duties to my son?

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,080
I won't answer that.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,640
Brother you were right, Mercan's fingerprints
aren’t on the gun. So, if only Murat was there…

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,320
She fooled me.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,880
Murat.

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,720
Let go of my son. -What's going on?

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,840
Don't.

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,360
Let go of my brother. -Don't.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
Murat shot Ateş.

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,320
My son?

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,760
Mom, calm down. Brother is doing what’s needed. No
one gets away with what they’ve done, don’t worry.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,440
Are we supposed to embrace Mercan just
because she didn’t pull the trigger?

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,760
What she's done was wrong,
but that's not our priority now.

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,400
Brother I'm so scared.

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,640
Don't be scared, I'm here. Don't.

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,160
What are you doing here?

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,600
Looking for information about you.

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,320
There were enough people going behind
my back. You weren't necessary Nezir.

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,720
Mercan, I didn't have bad
intentions. I just wanted to help.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,080
Go.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,280
These people are the
lowest of the low, Cemal.

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
They’re so rotten they’ll steal someone
else’s life just to live their own in comfort.

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
This can't be you brother.
You couldn’t have done this.

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,600
You can't be a murderer.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120
I watched a video.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,920
You were arguing with a girl.

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,640
I asked you who it was.

46
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Was it Ateş?

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,200
Yes, it was him.

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Your son killed a young girl.

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,080
Did you think you could
sweep it under the rug?

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,200
The brother you're standing
up for stabbed me from the back.

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
On top of that, he let you take the blame.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,120
Dad, do something.

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,240
He doesn't intend on keeping
silent, since he showed it to ther.

54
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,120
Shame on you.

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,920
He's not the type to be easily distracted.

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,680
But Haydar's daughter,

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,880
Our job is to add fuel to
the fire when it's needed.

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,320
Is Murat going to pay for it in the end?

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,600
Why don't we hand him to the police?

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,360
Sweet pea, what happened all of a sudden?

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,240
I caught a cold.

62
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,640
Nothing serious.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,960
I also got prescribed.

64
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,440
Why didn't you call us?

65
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
There was no need.

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
He, was with me.

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,800
We'll leave you to rest.

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,880
I'll make the maid cook you some soup.

69
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,760
It'll make you feel better.

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,240
Take your meds and rest well.

71
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,320
Get well soon.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,120
One thing after another, I don't get it.

73
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,320
You've gone through a lot.

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,160
I don't get it either, Demet.

75
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,760
Life threw everything unexpected at me.

76
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,160
I fear that it'll get even worse.

77
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,120
Because it gets worse everyday.

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Especially today.

79
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
That video keeps flashing before my eyes.

80
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,240
I keep telling myself he wouldn't...

81
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
I say that I'm fine but I'm not.

82
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,360
How can one be?

83
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Rest well.

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
We'll talk later.

85
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,760
I don't know what to believe anymore.

86
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,000
Cook the soup you used to,
when they were kids, Binnaz.

87
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,400
It'll make her feel better.

88
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,400
I sent Berat to get free-range chicken.

89
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,816
As soon as he comes back, I'll do it.

90
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,560
She'll better instantly after
drinking it, don't you worry.

91
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,240
Very well.

92
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,480
It's hard to have a
child you're ashamed of.

93
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
There are worse.

94
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,280
Wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.

95
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
What's wrong with my children?

96
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,280
What's not wrong?

97
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,080
Your son is a murderer.

98
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,360
And your daughter did
arrenged marriage for money.

99
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,400
Both have neither honor,

100
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
nor pride.

101
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,280
I hope your children disappoint you too.

102
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,840
Your days are counted.

103
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,200
Enjoy it while it lasts.

104
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
I hate your guts.

105
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,520
Where the hell did you come from?

106
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,200
Get a hold of yourself.

107
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,960
Now isn't the time.

108
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Aslı?

109
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Well, I was,

110
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
here to leave some cookies.

111
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,440
I was leaving, since you were gone.

112
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Thanks.

113
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,920
I should leave.

114
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,240
If she woke up and saw me,

115
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,880
she would freak out.

116
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Alright.

117
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Good night.

118
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
You look so innocent.

119
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,880
Your face was wet with sweat.

120
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,160
You probably have a fever.

121
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Stay down.

122
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,600
Why are you here?

123
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,960
Shouldn't you be grateful?

124
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,520
Why are you taking care of me?

125
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,840
So that your toy would get well faster?

126
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,280
I won't let anything of mine get hurt.

127
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm not yours.

128
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,920
I never will be.

129
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,840
Don't you ever learn your lesson, Nezir?

130
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,000
You still have the bruise I gave you.

131
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
You're here for more?

132
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,880
You know exactly why I'm here.

133
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,480
You stole something from me.

134
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,360
That's thievery.

135
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,240
And you have the nerve to ask me why?

136
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,640
The guy who kept the video to blackmail,
instead of giving it to the police

137
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,680
tries to teach me morals?

138
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,400
It's your vulgarity against my justice.

139
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,000
You'll beg for mercy,

140
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,960
from Ateş Karahan.

141
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,240
You're going to delete that video, Ateş.

142
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
I'll figure your plans out.

143
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,400
You, who couldn't even keep
a video hidden, will do that?

144
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
You're going to...

145
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm not going to regret anything.

146
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Piss off.

147
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
You'll see.

148
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
You'll see.

149
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,520
You'll do anything to prove
you're right, won't you?

150
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,160
You think I care about that?

151
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,280
Proving myself to you?

152
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,400
You think so highly of yourself.

153
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,960
I only care about justice.

154
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Let go of me.

155
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,440
You can't even stand up.

156
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
You're sick.

157
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,960
I won't argue with you like this.

158
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Get well soon.

159
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,360
I'm not your caretaker.

160
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,640
Don't you see, he's lying.

161
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,320
She has her eye on him.

162
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,640
Wicked witch.

163
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,120
She's also dumb.

164
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,960
Why would she believe him?

165
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,680
You have to trust the person you love.

166
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,000
Don't you have emotions brother?

167
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,360
She's just jealous.

168
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
She can't help it.

169
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Again, look.

170
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,240
Look at her acting hurt.

171
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,480
What do you know anyway?

172
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,280
My feet hurt.

173
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Mom.

174
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,400
Take a seat, mom.

175
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,000
Are you okay, mom?

176
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,960
I'm beat, son.

177
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Come, take a seat.

178
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,920
Would you like some tea?

179
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,320
I'm good.

180
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,160
I'll catch a breath and go to bed.

181
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,200
How is Mercan?

182
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,960
Good, good.

183
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,560
She ate the soup.

184
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,680
Hopefully she'll get better tomorrow.

185
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,880
No wonder. She went through a lot.

186
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,800
There are things happening at the mansion.

187
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,200
I don't what, but we'll
hear of it soon enough.

188
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,560
It's always something with them.

189
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,376
Do you want me to fix something up for you?

190
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,880
I ate already, I'll go to bed.

191
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,680
If you say so.

192
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,200
Alright, sleep well.

193
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,560
You too. You too.

194
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,320
I'll go to bed too.

195
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,600
They'll break up anyway.

196
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,240
The girl doesn't deserve him.

197
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,680
Good night.

198
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,920
Really, brother?

199
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,040
Just go to sleep.

200
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,400
Spewing nonsense.

201
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,480
What do you even know about?

202
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Frigid.

203
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,240
My mom and brother are home.

204
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Go away.

205
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,840
No, I've missed you.

206
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Come out.

207
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,760
I miss you, come out.

208
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,200
Why are you here?

209
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,760
I wanted wish you good night.

210
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,720
You said it, you can go.

211
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
But you didn't.

212
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,280
Good night.

213
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,800
Dream of me.

214
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay, go already.
Okay.

215
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Come on.
Okay.

216
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Go already.
I'm going.

217
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,840
Silly, go.

218
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
They won't break up.

219
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,560
I only care about justice.

220
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,880
You seem better.

221
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,120
I know you don't care about me.

222
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,040
You don't have to act like it.

223
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,640
I couldn't care less.

224
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,640
I don't want to see anyone else around you.

225
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,560
That's strike two.

226
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Be glad you're sick.

227
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Whatever.

228
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Jerk.

229
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,640
I say, I have a word with Ateş too.

230
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,440
I told you, he wouldn't listen.

231
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,520
Why would he listen to you?

232
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,440
Nobody would think of you as a man.

233
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,320
I curse the day you were born.

234
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,600
Everything is at stake because of you.

235
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,640
I can't compensate for the money.

236
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,120
You won't be paying for my sin either.

237
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,160
When have you ever taken
responsibility for anything?

238
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,920
I can't seem to like Zehra.

239
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,760
She's always around you. It annoys me.

240
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,560
I baked this for you, Malik.

241
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,960
I looked up the recipe online.

242
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,080
A local delight from your home.

243
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,520
You must've missed it.

244
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,360
What smells so good?

245
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,480
Let me see.

246
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Tastes good.

247
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,920
Run from the fight,

248
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
eat for the life.

249
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,840
Did you make it?

250
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,240
Yes, I did.

251
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,280
Tastes good, thanks.

252
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,200
Enjoy.

253
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,600
I'm going to the hardware store, Malik.

254
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,360
I need to get some things.

255
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Got it?

256
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll take that for the road.

257
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,160
Berat, wait for me.

258
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,160
You've put too much oil.

259
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,560
Enjoy.

260
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,960
The nerve of her,

261
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,600
to go after my man.

262
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,280
What are you hiding?

263
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Nothing.

264
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Give me the phone.

265
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Give it.
Let go.

266
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,200
You have a conscience after all.

267
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,680
You know very well that he killed her.

268
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,800
You just wouldn't like to admit it.

269
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,720
You're a hypocrite just like your family.

270
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,520
So you're not sleeping in the same bed.

271
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,040
That wasn't very nice of you, just now.

272
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,360
Darling,

273
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,960
it was rude.

274
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,880
She baked it.

275
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,680
You have to give her credit for the effort.

276
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,200
You're too nice for your own good.

277
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,240
Girls like Zehra use
that to their advantage.

278
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,040
No way.

279
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Besides,

280
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,120
I only have eyes for you.

281
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,800
Good.

282
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,560
Otherwise I would gauge them out.

283
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
You won't need to.

284
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
I won't need to.

285
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,280
We need to talk.

286
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,480
No, we don't.

287
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,640
I did nothing to Betül.

288
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,120
You're just quick to judge.

289
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,480
The video shows otherwise.

290
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,000
Listen to me for once.

291
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Let me explain.

292
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,000
It's not what it looks like. I'm innocent.

293
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,280
How much lower will you go?

294
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,840
How many times will you
make a fool of yourself?

295
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,080
You killed an innocent girl.

296
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,040
There's no going back.

297
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
You'll pay for it in prison.

298
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,920
I won't go to prison for
a girl who's already dead.

299
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,720
What do you gain from it?

300
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,200
You'll go to prison,

301
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,440
and she'll rest in peace.

302
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,720
This time I won't let
you frame somebody else.

303
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,080
You won't prove anything with that video.

304
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,320
It only takes one good lawyer.

305
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,560
You are short-tempered, right?

306
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,600
You were on that day too.

307
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,640
What did that poor girl do to make you mad?

308
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,160
She didn't get,

309
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,240
that it was over and she needed to shut up.

310
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,040
So I punished her for it.

311
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,760
You're a murderer.

312
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,920
I did no such thing.

313
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,280
What do you want, Ateş?

314
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,920
What's on your mind?

315
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
It's not for me,

316
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,960
but for her to decide.

317
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,480
Go away. Leave us alone!

318
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Leave us.

319
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,760
How can you cover up something like this?

320
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,080
How could you cover up a murder?

321
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,000
I just found out, myself.

322
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,560
You just found out? Then
what did you do about it?

323
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,776
I had to keep silent.
What else could I have done?

324
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,200
You could have told me the truth, dad.

325
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,680
Mercan, sweetheart, listen to me.

326
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,600
Your dad had to protect
your brother, our family...

327
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,000
Enough! You're a woman.

328
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,720
How would you feel if
it were your daughter?

329
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,360
I don't want to listen
to any more of your lies.

330
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,760
You tricked me again.

331
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,720
I found out that my
brother is a murderer...

332
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,280
From a man who bought
me as if I were property.

333
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,760
What have I ever done to you?
What did I do to deserve this?

334
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,640
What did you want from that innocent
girl? What did you want from her?

335
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,040
How could you hurt her?
How could you do this?

336
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,880
I'm so sorry.

337
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Stop. I don't want to hear another word.

338
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,600
She's going to be the death of us.

339
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:50,040
I'm so sick of your lies!
You will never fool me again.

340
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,039
From now on, I won't do
what you want me to do.

341
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,480
I'll do what's right.

342
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,680
Brother, what will we do now?

343
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,960
We'll wait.

344
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,480
Ateş, son, what do you mean by waiting?

345
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,040
How can you leave such an important
decision up to the daughter of our enemy?

346
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,280
Let's call the police and
have that murderer arrested.

347
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,280
I know what I'm doing,
mom. You don't need to worry.

348
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,840
I detonated a grenade right
in the lap of the Yıldırım family.

349
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,680
There's no way they'll
get out of this unscathed.

350
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,160
How can you be so sure? Mercan
protected her brother once before,

351
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,800
how do you know she won't do it again?

352
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,560
She might choose to remain silent instead

353
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,240
of reporting the murder to the police.

354
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,720
That won't happen. She'll
turn her brother in herself.

355
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,560
What if she doesn't?

356
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,440
Then I will turn him in myself.

357
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,639
Why sould we take such a risk? I think
we should give the footage to the police

358
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,440
and take down the Yıldırım
family once and for all.

359
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,360
We will. But we will do it my way.

360
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,160
You've lost your way, son.
You forgot your purpose.

361
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,840
It's like there's a
different Ateş in front of me.

362
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,960
Where is the Tahir who
was flaming with vengeance?

363
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,480
I haven't forgotten anything.
I remember everything.

364
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,720
Eylül, my dear sister.

365
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,440
They killed her.

366
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,959
I'm going to make each
and every one of them pay.

367
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,399
Of course you will. We
will make them pay together.

368
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,919
We'll take our revenge
on them for Eylül's murder.

369
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,560
But not now. We'll
abide our time, patiently.

370
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,360
You're mistaken, mom.

371
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,839
I'm the same Tahir. The
same one with no forgiveness

372
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,000
for what's been done to her sister.

373
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,799
The Tahir who is ready to burn those

374
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,760
responsible for her
death, in the same fire.

375
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,560
Mercan, sweetheart?

376
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,840
Will you really turn your
own brother in to the police?

377
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,960
He is your blood, your brother.

378
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,520
How can you let him rot in prison?

379
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,760
Won't you feel guilty?

380
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,400
A little girl was murdered, mom.

381
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,440
A young life was stolen.

382
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,200
Do you not feel guilty that
such a crime has gone unpunished?

383
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:23,280
What Murat did is inexcusable. But turning
him in will not bring that girl back.

384
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,240
I, however, will have lost a child.

385
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,680
And you'll have lost your brother.

386
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,480
That girl had a family too, mom. Her dad...

387
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,200
Mercan, don't do this, I'm begging you.

388
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,120
Your brother can't survive in prison.

389
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,360
He would rot away, he'd die in prison.

390
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,080
Mercan, I know you. You couldn't
send your brother to his death.

391
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,520
You couldn't have the
heart to do that to him.

392
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,520
You couldn't wreck your own family.

393
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,400
Why did you leave the decision up to me?

394
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,000
Why didn't you turn him in yourself?

395
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,440
You let yourself into my room without
permission. You watched the footage yourself.

396
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,000
This is your burden now.

397
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,280
You found it, you carry it.

398
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,800
Why are you doing this to me?

399
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,600
Why are you torturing me?

400
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,120
What have I ever done to you?

401
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,040
I'm not the one torturing
you, it's your brother.

402
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,840
He is the one who killed that
girl, and made it look like a suicide.

403
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,880
It is up to you to decide what
to do with the truth you uncovered.

404
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,120
Life can challenge us with
difficult tests, sometimes.

405
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,360
This one's yours.

406
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,880
You either turn away from the
truth and keep living with this burden

407
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,000
or you do what's right.

408
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,520
Even if it hurts the people you love.

409
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,520
I hope you experience what
you put me through, one day.

410
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,920
I hope you're tested with
your loved ones, as well.

411
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,440
What's this?

412
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,840
I brought you flowers. Sorry
they're not nearly as beautiful as you.

413
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,400
What are you doing here?

414
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,080
I was looking for you.

415
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,200
What for?

416
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,640
He's about to go shopping, he
wanted to ask if the list was ready.

417
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,000
Yes, I came for the list.

418
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,280
It's ready. Here it is.

419
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,520
Here you go.

420
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,880
Take it.

421
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,320
What are you standing around for?

422
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,240
Don't you have anything to do?

423
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,800
Come on, back to work.

424
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,800
Çiçek, you too. Keep working.

425
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,080
Mom, can you come and help me?

426
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,680
You haven't left yet?

427
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,320
Who could have thrown
these flowers on the ground?

428
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,680
It must be Mrs. Nermin. I
should put these in water.

429
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,600
That's a sugar bowl, not a vase.

430
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,600
Mercan?

431
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,680
You won't do this to me, will you?

432
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,280
You wouldn't turn you brother in?

433
00:47:52,560 --> 00:48:00,560
My brother... Since when have
you been such a bad person?

434
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,560
Were you always this bad
and I just couldn't see it?

435
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,880
A young girl, so full of life, died.

436
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,720
And you didn't even turn around to look.

437
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,520
You kept living, having fun.

438
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,920
As if nothing ever happened.

439
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,640
I don't understand how you
could've done something like this.

440
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,000
How is it a person fears her
own brother, her own family?

441
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,400
I'm scared of you.

442
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,040
I'm afraid of what you're capable of.

443
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,200
I'm constantly questioning
how bad you can get.

444
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,720
I have to stop this.

445
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,040
I have no other option.

446
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,840
I swear it was an accident, Mercan.

447
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,480
I was frightened, I didn't know what to do.

448
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,160
Do you think I feel no remorse?

449
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,600
I've felt pangs of
consciense everyday since.

450
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,120
I promise you, your brother is not
as bad a man as you think him to be.

451
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,560
Give me a chance to redeem myself.

452
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,120
Do not let me rot away in prison.

453
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,520
I can't survive within
those four walls, Mercan.

454
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,360
I don't want to talk any longer.

455
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Leave me alone.

456
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,920
Mercan, I...

457
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,160
Don't.

458
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,960
Just don't.

459
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,680
Okay, as you wish.

460
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,400
Just know that no matter what happens

461
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,440
I love you, so much.

462
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,640
Don't forget that.

463
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,040
What am I going to do?

464
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,880
What should I do?

465
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,320
We're done with this phase of the plan.

466
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,280
On to the next one.

467
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,480
Let's see what Mercan will do.

468
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,800
Her family won't leave her alone.

469
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,160
They'll play to her emotions,
try to manipulate her.

470
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,160
If she gives in to her emotions,
she might make the wrong decision.

471
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,680
I'll keep an eye on her.

472
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,120
Brother, you know I trust you.

473
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,600
I'm sure you have reasons for your methods.

474
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,000
Thank you.

475
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,400
I'm going to step inside. We'll talk later.

476
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,120
Where are you going?

477
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,720
That's none of your business.

478
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,200
It is my business.

479
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,680
Please, just leave it. I don't
feel like arguing with you.

480
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,480
I'm telling you again. I really
don't feel like getting into it.

481
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,479
You proved your point.
You exposed the truth.

482
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,760
What more do you want?

483
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,840
Please let me be.

484
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,320
Let me leave.

485
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,640
Cemal, we have a problem.

486
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,120
Is it Mercan?

487
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,520
Yes, she is going to
talk to the girl's father.

488
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,439
I'm going to try and catch up to her.
If she finds out I know the girl's father,

489
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,720
things will get messy.

490
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,559
You're in charge until I get back.

491
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,600
I'll take care of everything, don't worry.

492
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,320
What are we going to do?
How do we get out of this?

493
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,400
Here comes the troublemaker.

494
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,840
What are you staring at?

495
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,880
What have you brought this
family other than trouble?

496
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,360
I can't keep up with cleaning
up the messes you make.

497
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,640
There's no point crying over spilled milk.

498
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,200
We need to think about how
we'll get out of this mess.

499
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,600
If we can't stop Mercan,
Murat will go to prison.

500
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,120
He's not our son, but a monster!

501
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,760
I should turn him in and see
to it myself that he is punished.

502
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,440
But it would be a disgrace, I
have to think about our reputation.

503
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,039
Your obsession with our reputation has

504
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,840
been our downfall from the beginning.

505
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,400
You care more for your
reputation than for your own son!

506
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,760
For years, I bent over
backwards to please you.

507
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,080
I thought you'd love me if
I could something of myself.

508
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,920
I thought maybe you'd hug me for once

509
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,640
and say "Well done, son."

510
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,000
But it was all useless.

511
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,200
The more I tried to win your
favor, the more I fell out of it.

512
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,440
You're the one who
turned me into a monster!

513
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,840
Could you please calm down?

514
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,360
This is not the time to argue.

515
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,440
And what have you ever
done to deserve such praise?

516
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,040
What have you ever succeeded?

517
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,840
Don't act like I'm responsible
for your incompetency.

518
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,920
Don't you dare!

519
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,280
Okay, you're right.

520
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,240
I've disgraced you, ruined your reputation.

521
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,800
I am gravely regretful, Haydar Yıldırım.

522
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,040
I'm sorry I wasn't a worthy
son to you or my mother,

523
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,640
or a worthy brother to my sister.

524
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,000
But you too, owe me an apology.

525
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,720
Because it is you who
have created this monster!

526
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,200
Son!

527
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,440
Look at the pot calling the kettle black.

528
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,160
Haydar, I am begging you to save my son.

529
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Welcome. You can sit
over here, if you'd like.

530
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,880
Thank you.

531
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,120
Go ahead.

532
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,920
What would you like?

533
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,000
I would like a sandwich, please.

534
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,680
Just a sandwich?

535
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,840
Yes.

536
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,440
Okay.

537
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,880
She's here.

538
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,680
This is the girl you talked about, right?

539
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,480
She's very beautiful.

540
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,160
She's nice and all...

541
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,200
But why are you hiding that I know you,

542
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,360
asking me to lie to her?

543
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,440
I'll tell you later.

544
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,240
You must have your reasons.

545
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,920
Mümtaz Abi,

546
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,680
she liked her sandwich bread
toasted when she was a child,

547
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,880
even a little burnt.

548
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,080
Don't worry, son. I'll make
one exactly to her liking.

549
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,240
Ateş must be head over heels for this girl.

550
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,920
What are you doing here?

551
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,320
I guessed this is where you'd be

552
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,120
Why are you here?

553
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,640
I don't know.

554
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,600
It's a feeling difficult to identify.

555
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,920
I guess I just wanted to come and see.

556
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,680
I wanted to see where that lost life began.

557
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,800
I'm going to make a phone
call, I'll be right back.

558
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,960
Here you go, dear.

559
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,720
Thank you.

560
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,480
What is it?

561
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,440
Why did you call me here all of a sudden?

562
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,720
We're going to end this Murat business.

563
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,040
How?

564
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,080
We're going to kill him.

565
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,120
Kill Murat?

566
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,840
We're going to fake his death
and make it look like an accident.

567
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,440
Then, we'll smuggle him out of
the country with a fake passport.

568
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,000
I need your connections to do this.

569
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,000
What about Ateş?

570
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,439
What will we do about him?

571
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,480
I haven't had the time to figure that out.

572
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,720
We'll find a way, somehow.

573
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,000
We don't have much time,
we need to act quickly.

574
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,680
He is your son, after
all. Can you really do this?

575
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,479
Do you know where Ateş is?

576
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,880
He went out with Mercan.

577
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,520
They went out together?

578
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,920
Where to?

579
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,040
Everything's a mess and they went out?

580
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,216
For how long will we
go on like this, Cemal?

581
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,440
Does any part of what
happened seem normal to you?

582
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,480
Aslı...

583
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,800
He has his reasons, right?

584
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,000
It's like talking to a brick wall.

585
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,240
Those are still dirty.

586
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,040
Wash them faster, then.

587
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,199
The medicine must be for Mrs. Müzeyyen.

588
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,920
I had a feeling that something was up.

589
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,520
What happened?

590
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,639
Murat has caused some trouble again.

591
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,160
What has he done this time?

592
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,280
I have that guy pegged.

593
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,520
He's caused one incident
after another his entire life.

594
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,800
I wonder who he takes after.

595
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,120
God knows.

596
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,720
Mr. Murat and Ms. Mercan are so different.

597
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,199
They have nothing in common.

598
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,600
One of them is an angel
and the other is a devil.

599
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,680
He was such a tyrant.

600
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,320
I don't get it. Ms.
Mercan dotes on her brother.

601
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,640
How does that work?

602
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,839
Poor Mercan was always ill growing
up, they never let her out of her room.

603
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,000
She never saw her brother's tyranny.

604
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,280
But, to be fair, Mr. Murat loved Mercan,

605
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,200
he was very protective.

606
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,880
They are siblings after
all, he may be a bad person

607
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,280
but he's her brother.

608
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,120
You can't choose your siblings.

609
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,560
That much is true.

610
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,080
Enough chitchatting.

611
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,120
Çiçek, finish those up and
help me put these bags away.

612
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,400
Okay.

613
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,160
I just hope Ms. Mercan doesn't
end up bearing the brunt of it again.

614
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,400
She bears the burden
no matter what happens.

615
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,800
I feel sorry for her.

616
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,399
You're right about that.
She's been through so much.

617
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,640
I'm praying for her.

618
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,720
Me too.

619
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,840
My head is killing me.

620
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,160
Where is that medicine?
What's taking them so long?

621
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,640
Here you go, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

622
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,080
Would you like anything else?

623
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,920
Where is Ateş?

624
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,680
He went out with Mercan.

625
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,480
That's weird. Where did they go?

626
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,440
I don't know. Cemal
isn't telling me either.

627
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,959
This is ridiculuous.

628
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,760
We're just waiting around
for Mercan to make up her mind.

629
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,960
This girl has made Ateş
soft. She's confusing him.

630
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,280
The Ateş I know would
have pulled the trigger

631
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,440
on the Yıldırım family long ago.

632
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,960
If he goes on like this,
he'll forget all about

633
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,519
why we came here, our revenge.

634
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,640
I would never let that happen.

635
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,000
I know what to do.

636
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,720
Here you go.

637
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,240
Thank you.

638
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,800
It is crispy, exactly how you like it.

639
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,200
How do you know how I like my sandwich?

640
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,440
Eat it before it gets cold.

641
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,280
That's my daughter.

642
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,640
She liked her bread crispy just like you.

643
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,959
She'd stand next to me
while I made her a sandwich.

644
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,000
She'd ask for the bread to be extra crispy.

645
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,600
Her mother died giving birth to her.

646
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:53,360
I raised her on my own.

647
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,600
I had many plans for my daughter.

648
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,400
She was going to study
medicine, become a doctor.

649
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:08,280
One day, I got a painful phone
call that put an end to those plans.

650
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
They told me my daughter
had committed suicide.

651
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,840
I didn't want to believe it.

652
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,800
My daughter was full of life.

653
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,400
Why would she want to kill herself?

654
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,240
They murdered her and
then, they covered it up.

655
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,080
If I had found the person responsible

656
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,360
for this, I'd have killed them myself.

657
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,960
How could you do this
brother, how could you?

658
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,840
I'm sorry.

659
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,920
I burdened you with my grief.

660
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,800
The pain in your heart

661
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,760
spills out of your mouth sometimes.

662
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,280
Seeing a girl as sweet as yourself,

663
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,199
whose inner beauty shines through,

664
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,880
I couldn't help but open my heart to you.

665
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,320
Forgive me.

666
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,960
Look at me. Don't cry.

667
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,120
I don't like whiny people.

668
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,320
Please, go away.

669
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,800
Stay away from me.

670
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,679
Why are you still here? Go away!

671
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,520
I told you to go away! Go! Leave!

672
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,560
It's so hard to bear the truth.

673
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,040
It's a heavy burden to carry.

674
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,040
How do I erase those
smiling eyes from my mind?

675
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,960
How do I forget the
pain in her father's eyes?

676
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,280
How can I forget?

677
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,800
What's the password?

678
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,480
What could it be?

679
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,360
Eylül?

680
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,720
When was her birthday?

681
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,320
It was you?

682
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,120
Did you find the footage?

683
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,360
I found it.

684
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,160
We'll show them now.

685
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,120
Why did you turn?

686
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,840
Are we not going home?

687
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,520
We need to stop by somewhere first.

688
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,560
I'm listening.

689
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,560
Bro, I just talked to our source.

690
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,320
Apparently, Haydar is planning
to smuggle Murat abroad.

691
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,280
They even had a fake passport prepared.

692
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,040
We took the necessary precautions.

693
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,560
There's nothing to worry
about. We're keeping an eye out.

694
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,880
Okay. Let me know if anything happens.

695
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,680
I'm done with work for today. I
thought I'd get some fresh air.

696
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,199
Yeah? I'm almost done.

697
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,439
Is that so? Then we'll get it together.

698
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,560
Get what?

699
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,240
Fresh Air. What else would it be?

700
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,919
Oh, you mean fresh air.

701
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,439
Let me finish up here, then we'll go out.

702
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
Okay.

703
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,360
Çiçek?

704
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,400
Hey. If you're looking for Çiçek...

705
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,760
Nevermind her. Are you cleaning the car?

706
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,640
Yes, inside and out.

707
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,719
Inside and out, huh?

708
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,520
You must be tired.

709
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,480
Why don't you take a
break, we'll chat a little.

710
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,680
No, I can't break anything.

711
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,440
I have plans, I have to finish up quickly.

712
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,960
What a workaholic.

713
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,200
Where did she run off to?

714
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,800
Çiçek?

715
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,919
You know she's clearly after you, right?

716
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,920
She's not after me,
she left me behind. See?

717
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,879
Why are we here?

718
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,400
To get some sea air.

719
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,800
We needed it.

720
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,240
Especially you.

721
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,160
You had a hard day.

722
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,680
Could we get some bagels?

723
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,600
Thank you.

724
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,680
Enjoy.

725
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,600
I'm not hungry.

726
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,520
It's not for us, it's for the seagulls.

727
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,720
You know, ever since I was a little
girl, I've always gone to feed the birds

728
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,240
whenever I felt sad.

729
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,320
Is that so?

730
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:40,080
I know it's weird but
it makes me feel better.

731
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,559
Mercan, look. I caught a bird.

732
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,719
It's so cute.

733
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,800
Do you want to feed it?

734
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,120
Sure.

735
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,160
Here you go.

736
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,000
What should we name it?

737
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,559
Cottonball?

738
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,840
That's a pretty name.

739
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,040
There's something about
you that puzzles me.

740
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,000
Sometimes, I see compassion in your eyes

741
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,560
that you can't stop from seeping through.

742
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,440
And I think to myself, "There is
a good person behind that mask."

743
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,840
And then, you go back to your cruel ways.

744
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,200
You stop being good.

745
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,840
I really don't get it.

746
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,240
It's as if there is
something, a reason that

747
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,600
keeps you from being good, makes you cruel.

748
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,759
I've chosen a side.

749
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,000
I'd actually made my
decision at the beginning.

750
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,120
I have to do what's right.

751
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,760
I can't just ignore all
the pain that was caused.

752
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,200
My only fear is

753
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,720
the price I'll pay for this decision.

754
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,640
Sometimes when you choose a
path, you have to sacrifice others.

755
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,640
Real courage shows itself when
you're ready to pay the price

756
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,280
for the decision you make.

757
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,640
Let's go back home,

758
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,120
and put an end to this chaos.

759
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,280
The footage of the murder.

760
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,840
It's on social media.

761
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,960
Everyone has seen it now.

762
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,016
What "time" are you talking
about? We don't have any time.

763
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,480
You're a public disgrace.

764
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,280
I demand you to take down
that video at once! Delete it!

765
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:31,440
We're ruined, Haydar.

766
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,839
It was you. You did this.
Only you had that video.

767
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,880
You posted it. You'll pay for
this, you'll pay for all of this.

768
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:26,839
I knew it. I knew my
daugther wouldn't kill herself.

769
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,360
She was full of life.
She was going to live.

770
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:34,080
That bastard took my daughter
away from me, murdered her.

771
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,160
He will never get away with this, never!

772
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:45,480
I'll make him pay.
He'll pay for everything.

773
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,480
Make him pay, make them regret everything.

774
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,720
Where is Murat? I don't know.

775
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,920
Where is he? I told you, I don't know.

776
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:04,000
Are you satisfied? This
is all because of you.

777
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,520
You couldn't just get
on that boat and leave.

778
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,720
If you had left, so would Nezir
and there would be no video in sight.

779
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:15,400
But your life is more valuable
than all of ours, isn't it?

780
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,640
Your rules, your principles...

781
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:22,679
You and your obstinacy. You're selfish.

782
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,119
Do you not love us at all?

783
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,040
Have you no mercy?

784
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,680
You're a traitor.

785
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,559
Enough!

786
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,839
Where is your murderer son?

787
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,839
Tell me where you have him hiding.

788
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,960
Speak! Tell us where my brother is.

789
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,679
I can't believe the things you've done.

790
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,840
I can't even recognize you.

791
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,840
I wish I had never seen
you in such disgrace.

792
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,320
Who could have leaked that footage?

793
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,240
My entire plan fell through.

794
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,719
The only person I can think of is Nezir.

795
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:29,480
No, I don't think so.

796
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,880
If he had any intention, he
would have done this long ago.

797
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,680
Bro, even a worm will turn.

798
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,040
He's playing his last hand.

799
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,280
What happened now? Everyone's a mess.

800
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,000
Where's Mrs. Müzeyyen?

801
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,280
I don't know. She said she
had things to do and left.

802
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,680
What things?

803
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,520
What is it, Nazım?

804
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,000
Okay, you should keep an eye out.

805
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,080
Let me know what happens.

806
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,999
They couldn't find Murat.
But they'll keep on looking.

807
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,160
He didn't go to his hide-out.

808
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:24,359
This is our game, my game.
There is no place for surprises

809
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,080
or other actors in my game.

810
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,159
We gave our hand away this time,

811
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:33,440
but I'll never lose control again.

812
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,919
I worked day and night for years,
dealt with all kinds of trouble.

813
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,680
All for my disgrace of a son to
demolish everything in one move.

814
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,896
Nothing is enough for him. He
can't get enough of the damage.

815
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,600
He caused so much trouble
and it still isn't enough.

816
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,840
I rue the day he was born.

817
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,040
What a man I am!

818
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,080
You've made your bed, now lie in it.

819
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,120
What do you mean by that?

820
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,440
It's our son you're talking about.

821
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,840
He is not my son!

822
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:12,280
My son is going to run and save himself.

823
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,120
What about us? Where will we run to?

824
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,040
How will we claw our way out of this hole?

825
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,120
What is it, Nezir?

826
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,520
Murat still hasn't shown up,

827
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,360
he's not answering his phone. He's gone.

828
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,720
What do you mean gone? Where would he go?

829
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,320
I put together a complete escape
plan, and he still can't manage to run.

830
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,600
Haydar, find my son.

831
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,720
Find Murat, Haydar.

832
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,960
You're going to be the death of me.

833
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,280
You'll manage to do what my enemies
failed to do. Congrats, well done!

834
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,400
You posted that video, didn't you?

835
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,680
Was this your genius plan?

836
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,000
What exactly have you gained?

837
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,920
Cemal, you guys should have a little walk.

838
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:30,000
I'm not going anywhere. I've
never seen someone so shameless.

839
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:33,200
I have to hear this. I want to
see how shameless a person can be.

840
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,320
Aslı!

841
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,919
What? Did I say something wrong?

842
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,199
She helped her brother escape,
now she's here trying to play us.

843
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,200
Leave us, Aslı. Just go.

844
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:46,480
You're not afraid of anything,
yet, you can't admit to this?

845
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,280
Just admit it,

846
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,120
admit that you're such a small man.

847
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:53,320
Go scream at someone else,
I don't have time for this.

848
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,640
If something happens to my brother...

849
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,520
What would you do, tell me.

850
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,800
What could you possibly do to me?

851
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,920
Tell me.

852
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,200
You'll find out when it's time.

853
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,119
Don't ever underestimate
someone you've hurt.

854
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,200
You would be surprised.

855
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,600
None of you could hurt me.

856
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,680
Neither you nor your family.

857
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,440
If you want to know what
happened to your brother,

858
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,200
ask your mom and dad who've
been going behind your back.

859
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I'll give you a clue.

860
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:35,000
They'll partner up with Nezir
and help him flee the country.

861
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,599
Does that sound familiar? And you know why?

862
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:45,520
They don't care that an
innocent girl was murdered.

863
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:50,040
All they care about is their
reputation or the lack thereof.

864
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,360
If you have the guts to face
the truth, go on and ask them.

865
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,080
I feel pity for you.

866
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,920
There is only one person
who is honest with you.

867
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,040
And that person is the
man you hate, Ateş Karahan.

868
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,640
Is this true?

869
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,920
What's going on, Mercan?

870
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,320
Are you okay, dear?

871
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,520
Is it true you're trying to
smuggle my brother out of the country?

872
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,760
This comes as a shock to you?

873
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,080
Mercan...

874
01:29:54,081 --> 01:29:55,840
Hold on a second, Haydar.

875
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,640
I want to hear her idea
on what we were to do.

876
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,280
Was I supposed to just sit
and watch him go to prison?

877
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,320
Why don't I cuff him
myself, while we're at it.

878
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,160
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

879
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,840
You don't care about my brother,

880
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,919
you only care about yourselves.

881
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,800
If you cared for him, you would help

882
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,879
him face the consequences of his crime.

883
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,080
You wouldn't help him escape.

884
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,080
You'll understand when you become a mother.

885
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,839
I won't understand even when I'm a mother.

886
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,040
Because the children I raise
wouldn't become murderers.

887
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,120
It's him. He did this. Had
he not posted that video,

888
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,920
none of this would've happened.

889
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,640
You did this.

890
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,720
You can't enough of watching us suffer.

891
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,160
Stop your whining.

892
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,040
Leave my son alone.

893
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,120
I posted that video.

894
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,520
I exposed your son's
bloody hands to everyone.

895
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,120
How could you do this?

896
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,016
Did you not care at all
about the consequences?

897
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:02,640
My brother...

898
01:31:02,641 --> 01:31:05,600
I'll tear you to pieces. I'll kill you.

899
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,840
If my son gets so much as
a scratch, I'll kill you.

900
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,640
Get away from her! Let go!

901
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,440
Look! Look at your mother!
Look how uncivil you are!

902
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,559
I'll kill you! Let go, Mrs. Müzeyyen!

903
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,320
What are you doing?

904
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:21,080
Enough!

905
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:25,200
All of you, shut up!

906
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,040
Leave the room.

907
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,640
These people... Shush!

908
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,360
You have no idea what happened.

909
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,520
I feel sorry for all of them.

910
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,000
What do we do about Murat?

911
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,640
About Murat? I don't
feel sorry for him at all.

912
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,976
Just as he didn't feel sorry for that girl.

913
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,840
Don't say that. They gave us these jobs.

914
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,200
Their sins don't concern us.

915
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,056
Especially the ones of the
biggest sinner, Mr. Haydar.

916
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,920
He made the biggest
mistake at the beginning.

917
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,880
Now, he's facing the consequences.

918
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,720
Mom, do you know something?

919
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,320
I don't know anything.

920
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,000
I only pray they'll recieve forgiveness.

921
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,960
I'm really confused, what really happened?

922
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,480
Apparently, Murat killed a girl years ago.

923
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,680
And Mrs. Müzeyyen posted the
footage of that murder online.

924
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:46,120
Are you gossiping again?

925
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,840
Zehra, don't joke around. People
have enough to deal with, already.

926
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,360
It is not the time to make fun.

927
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,480
Mom, what did I tell you?

928
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,600
Didn't I tell you I had a plan?

929
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:09,921
Didn't I say I would play
each of them against the other,

930
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,320
that I would expose their animosity?

931
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,160
Why did you act before consulting with me?

932
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,080
I should've done even more.

933
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,679
Haydar killed my husband, my newborn.

934
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,920
Their blood is on their hands.

935
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:27,880
Their son for my son. I
don't pity them at all.

936
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,760
I told you years ago, when
we first got on this path,

937
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,960
that we'd destroy them
the fisrt chance we got.

938
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,880
You want to play games.

939
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:48,319
I don't have time for games.
Every morning I wake up to hell,

940
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,920
knowing that I'll see them.

941
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:52,360
This is not a game, Mom.

942
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,160
This is torture.

943
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,880
You want to shoot them dead,

944
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:01,400
I want to see them begging to be killed.

945
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,600
Because on the path that I chose,

946
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,640
dying will be their salvation.

947
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,520
Okay, brother. Calm down.

948
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,040
Mrs. Müzeyyen, you too.

949
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,680
I agree. Mom, Ateş,

950
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:16,160
what are you doing?

951
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,400
They're not worth getting worked up over.

952
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,480
This is exactly what they want.

953
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,920
We need to be able to depend on

954
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,040
each other, now more than ever.

955
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,280
Let's not get all worked up
because of these lowlives, please.

956
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,280
Cemal, call all your men.

957
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,640
Tell them all that we have to find Murat,

958
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,680
that they can't return empty handed.

959
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,800
We'll find him, brother. Don't worry.

960
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:52,720
Hello, Nazım? We need more men.

961
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,880
Ateş.

962
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,320
Don't be so hard on my mom.
She's not as patient as you.

963
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:08,320
She's been waiting for this
day for much longer than you have.

964
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,080
I don't understand what we're
still waiting for, either but...

965
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,640
He's gone now.

966
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,120
How did Mom find the footage?

967
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,080
You've disappointed me.

968
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,000
That's the last thing
I'd want, you know that.

969
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,280
I just couldn't wait any longer.

970
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,120
I'm sorry.

971
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,840
It won't happen again, Ateş.

972
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,680
Take good care of Mom, Aslı.

973
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,760
I have deep respect for her.

974
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,519
But for me, nothing runs deeper

975
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,720
than my thirst for revenge.

976
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,760
Where are you going?

977
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,959
You'll answer when I ask you a question.

978
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,240
Where are you going?

979
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,760
To look for my brother.

980
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,400
I'll find him even if I have
to search every nook and crevice.

981
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,600
Follow me.

982
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,160
What are you doing?

983
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,200
Get in.

984
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,080
I'm not coming with you.

985
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:42,120
If you weren't so stubborn, you'd
see that you're slowing both of us down.

986
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:45,080
You still haven't figured
out your word means nothing?

987
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:46,120
Let go.

988
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,760
Either you get into my car,

989
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,800
or you'll go nowehere.

990
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,320
Haven't you learned?

991
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:01,200
If I tell you to get in, you get in.

992
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,880
You have no other option.

993
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,200
We'll meet at the office.

994
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,480
You.

995
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,360
Where's my brother, Nezir?

996
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,000
Where is Murat?

997
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,960
What is this? Did you
partner up for a home raid?

998
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:15,000
We know about your plan to
smuggle Murat of the country.

999
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,400
Tell me where he is.

1000
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:20,520
It's true. We're doing
this out of love for him.

1001
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:25,119
But he didn't show up at the meeting point.

1002
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,680
I don't know where he is.

1003
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:28,120
Quit your lying.

1004
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,560
Tell me where you hid that murderer.

1005
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,360
And you?

1006
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,880
With this man?

1007
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,760
I wouldn't expect this of you, Mercan.

1008
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:47,040
Shut up.

1009
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,759
Get in your car,

1010
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,320
and get out of here.

1011
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,960
What's going on?

1012
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,040
What's all this ruckus?

1013
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,320
Don't get involved, Demet.

1014
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,159
You come to our home and
pick a fight with my brother

1015
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,920
and you expect me not to get involved?

1016
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,919
Does that make sense to you, Mercan?

1017
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,799
All of this chaos for what?

1018
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,280
Are we not friends?

1019
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,040
You have every right to say that.

1020
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,080
I'm really sorry.

1021
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,600
But I need to find my brother.
I don't have any time to lose.

1022
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,040
Come on, let's go.

1023
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,880
Demet, I'm really
sorry. Please, understand.

1024
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:06,199
We checked every place he could be,

1025
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,960
he's nowhere to be found.

1026
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:14,360
Thank you for not pushing me.

1027
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:17,120
Home is the last place
I'd want to be right now.

1028
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:23,559
My childhood home, my family...

1029
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:26,440
They all feel so unfamiliar now.

1030
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:28,720
I can't recognize any of them.

1031
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:32,800
We should find Murat first.
Everyone is looking for him,

1032
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:34,040
including the police.

1033
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:42,920
Hello, Cemal.

1034
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,040
Any news on Murat?

1035
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,040
Okay. Keep looking.

1036
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,599
Why didn't you tell me

1037
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,760
it wasn't you who posted that video?

1038
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:37,960
I don't like to explain myself.

1039
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,079
I can't wrap my head around it.

1040
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:47,200
How could my brother do such a thing?

1041
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,519
While we were worrying about our debts and

1042
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:54,520
loan sharks, there was a
much bigger storm brewing.

1043
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,560
A murder of all things...

1044
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:04,319
How could my brother

1045
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,440
have killed a person, a woman..?

1046
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,320
I can't wrap my head around it.

1047
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,600
I can't believe it.

1048
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,640
I don't know what to think.

1049
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:24,080
The problem is not with them, but with you.

1050
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,920
The world is a dangerous place.

1051
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,720
People are bad. You
should get used to that.

1052
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,599
It would be torturous to

1053
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,960
constantly expect the worst from people.

1054
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,880
How can you keep living

1055
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,040
without loving and trusting people?

1056
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,440
You have to hold on to something,

1057
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,800
hold on to someone.

1058
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,800
You hold on to yourself.

1059
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,880
That's the only thing
that won't disappoint you.

1060
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:15,600
If you're okay with being
shaken up with every step you take,

1061
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:17,280
keep living as you are.

1062
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:28,639
Even if I'm disappointed,
even if I get shaken up,

1063
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:34,280
I'd much rather pay the price
of love than live without it.

1064
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:41,280
Because there are people who

1065
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:45,320
deserve to be loved in this world.

1066
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,280
Not every person can be bad.

1067
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,880
Not every person can be wrong.

1068
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,159
For every evil in this world,

1069
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,440
there is something good.

1070
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:40,720
"I'd rather pay the price
of love than live without it."

1071
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:21,600
We fell asleep.

1072
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:27,040
Good morning.

1073
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:36,160
You gave me your jacket,
you must've been cold.

1074
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:37,480
I don't get cold.

1075
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,960
I have high endurance.

1076
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,480
"You hold on to yourself, that's the

1077
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,679
only thing that won't disappoint you."

1078
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,040
Strange man.

1079
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:46,600
Yaşar.

1080
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:50,560
Welcome, Mr. Nezir.

1081
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:51,360
Thank you.

1082
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,160
I was in the area, I thought I'd stop by.

1083
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,800
Ms. Mercan isn't here
today. She didn't show up.

1084
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,360
Is that so?

1085
01:49:58,361 --> 01:49:59,480
Yes.

1086
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,599
I hear everyone's delighted

1087
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,880
to have Ateş as their boss.

1088
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,880
Yaşar, I need a favor.

1089
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,960
It's actually a favor for Mercan.

1090
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,520
For Ms. Mercan?

1091
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,240
I need copies of the company reports

1092
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,160
and contracts of the last five years.

1093
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,120
You need the copies?

1094
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:26,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Nezir but I can't do that.

1095
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:29,640
If the word got out, I'd be in big trouble.

1096
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,800
I suppose you forgot who I am when

1097
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:36,840
a new player entered the field.

1098
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:40,720
You'll get in big trouble if
you don't get me those copies.

1099
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:46,240
Once the dust settles down,

1100
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,440
Ateş will be gone, one way or another.

1101
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,360
We'll get rid of him eventually.

1102
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,080
But I'll always be around.

1103
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,720
So, choose your friends wisely.

1104
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,960
I'll check the records

1105
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,440
and let you know what I can do.

1106
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,960
See? Now we're seeing eye to eye.

1107
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:14,360
I'm rejoiced.

1108
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,760
Let me see those reports.

1109
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,360
I can't think straight.

1110
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:43,160
I don't know where to go, or what to do.

1111
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,520
Is there anywhere we haven't searched?

1112
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,920
Calm down and try to think.

1113
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,800
Maybe there's an old
friend or an ex-girlfriend?

1114
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,480
We'll go search wherever you can think of.

1115
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:01,600
Riva! We had a house in
Riva that we rarely stayed at.

1116
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:04,720
Murat would go there whenever
he and dad had a go at each other.

1117
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:08,160
What are you doing?

1118
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:16,040
I wish you'd stop asking me that.

1119
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:45,000
Do you need any help, Çiçek?

1120
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,640
We got off on the wrong foot.

1121
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,200
But I think you'd like me if you knew me.

1122
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:58,120
I'm not so mean and cruel.

1123
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:03,040
I'm being honest, I have a heart of gold.

1124
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,360
I don't like being
alone, there's also that.

1125
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:14,320
I've been waiting for
years for the right man,

1126
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,920
so I could settle down but no luck.

1127
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,679
She must've hit her head or something.

1128
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:20,920
I knew we'd get along the moment I met you.

1129
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:22,360
You seem really cool.

1130
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,960
I can tell you're close with Malik.

1131
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,040
That's why I came to talk to you.

1132
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,440
I felt it the moment I met Malik.

1133
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:34,040
No, we're not...

1134
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:36,080
You're obviously good friends.

1135
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,199
I felt that he was the "one."

1136
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,240
The man I'd been waiting
for, all these years.

1137
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,640
I was looking around for him,
when he was right in front of me.

1138
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:52,600
I was thinking...

1139
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,800
Maybe you could talk to
Malik, see if he's interested.

1140
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,120
You could put in a good word for me.

1141
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,640
And maybe you could help us meet in secret.

1142
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,400
Do me this one favor?

1143
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,120
Murat, please come out if you're in there.

1144
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,160
Murat!

1145
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,400
If he saw you at the
door, he wouldn't come out.

1146
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,479
Murat, please come out.

1147
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,040
I'm here to help you, trust me.

1148
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:58,040
He's not here, let's not waste time.

1149
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,920
We should keep looking.

1150
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,280
He's here.

1151
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,880
Murat, I know you're in there.

1152
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:14,920
Come out already.

1153
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:16,960
Just come out and I'll help you.

1154
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:19,040
Murat!

1155
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:21,800
Walk out like a man.

1156
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:23,960
We're not playing hide and seek.

1157
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,839
It's over, I'm ruined.

1158
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:30,920
Murat?

1159
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:33,160
Murat!

1160
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:47,440
You did this! You caused
this, you merciless man!

1161
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:52,720
You don't even know what mercy means.

1162
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:56,360
My life ended because of you
and you still dare to speak!

1163
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:58,600
Stop, don't hit him! Don't!

1164
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,760
Turn yourself in.

1165
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,800
You have no other option.

1166
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:06,960
Murat...

1167
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,880
You can run and hide all you want,
but you can't escape your sentence.

1168
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:13,240
You'll eventually be found.

1169
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,839
Confess to the crime, turn yourself in.

1170
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:18,520
Trust me, you'll feel the
weight lifting off your shoulders.

1171
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,400
You can do this.

1172
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:24,480
A part of me still believes in you.

1173
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:28,760
But if you don't confess,
you'll have killed not only Betül

1174
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,120
but also the part of
me that believes in you.

1175
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,680
Don't take my brother away from me.

1176
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,360
I would never leave you.

1177
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,080
Okay, I'll turn myself in.

1178
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:53,960
But first, I want to go
home and say goodbye to mom.

1179
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,840
I want to say goodbye to dad.

1180
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:01,240
Let's go.

1181
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,360
Come with me.

1182
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:22,960
My son!

1183
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:25,600
Everything's going to be okay.

1184
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,960
Stay strong, okay?

1185
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,079
Don't do this. Have some compassion.

1186
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,320
Save him.

1187
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,960
There is only one thing
that will save your son.

1188
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,640
And that is prison.

1189
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:53,000
Please reconsider. I'll do whatever...

1190
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:54,480
There is nothing to consider, mom.

1191
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:57,280
I've made my decision.

1192
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,680
I'll turn myself in and
receive my punishment.

1193
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:47,960
Forgive me, dad.

1194
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,520
I couldn't be the son you deserved.

1195
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:54,960
Alright.

1196
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,640
It's okay.

1197
01:59:57,680 --> 02:00:01,520
Stand tall. Be strong.

1198
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:07,320
I'll hire the best lawyers
for you, I'll get you out.

1199
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:12,080
This is only the beginning.

1200
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:16,480
He lost his company, his home, his son.

1201
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,960
I won't stop until he loses everything.

1202
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:45,360
Thank you for everything.

1203
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:03,520
It's all my fault. I'm the
reason you married that man

1204
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:06,880
even though you don't love him.

1205
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:12,800
Forgive me, Mercan.

1206
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,920
I could never be as strong as you.

1207
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,440
But I will from now on.

1208
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:23,959
I will change.

1209
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:26,759
Once I serve my sentence and return home,

1210
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:28,000
we'll start over.

1211
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:30,240
I promise you, my dear sister.

1212
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:33,240
I won't mess everything up this time.

1213
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:37,960
I believe in you, Murat.

1214
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,600
I've always got your back.

1215
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:43,320
Today, you're the
strongest you've ever been.

1216
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:53,160
They both have Haydar's
blood running in their veins.

1217
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:55,600
They're bad seeds, Ateş.

1218
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,800
They'll never run out of favors.

1219
02:01:58,200 --> 02:01:59,920
Don't have any expectations.

1220
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,880
Wrap this up, so we can go.

1221
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:13,440
Take this gun, then.

1222
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:17,959
Take this and make him pay.

1223
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:20,200
They took your child from you,

1224
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:22,680
you take theirs from them.

1225
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:27,320
Or you won't be able to face
your daughter in the afterlife.

1226
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:50,239
I kept my promise, my dear girl.

1227
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:53,480
You can finally rest in peace.

1228
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:03,560
Murat!

1229
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:05,960
Mr. Mümtaz, what have you done?

1230
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,520
Come on, we need to go.

1231
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:13,280
Murat? Murat, no!

1232
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:15,320
Haydar!

1233
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,359
No, not today.

1234
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:21,520
This is your strongest day. No, not today!

1235
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:24,920
You promised you wouldn't mess this up.

1236
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:27,240
Please don't die today.

1237
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:31,560
Please, hang on! Murat!

1238
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:34,400
Tahir, I'm in pain.

1239
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:38,320
Tahir!

1240
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,296
Come on! We're going to the doctor's.

1241
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:42,536
I'll take her to a doctor, let go.

1242
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,560
Let go of my sister!

1243
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:45,399
Get away!

1244
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:46,560
Let her go! Let my sister go!

1245
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:48,800
Murat.

1246
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,519
Please don't go!

1247
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,680
Tahir! Brother!

1248
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:53,840
Let go!
I told you to let go.

1249
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:56,360
Get away!

1250
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:04,040
Tahir! Let go! I want my brother!

1251
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:06,880
Leave it, let's go.

1252
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:10,440
Let me go! I want my brother!

1253
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,999
No, no!

1254
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,399
Let my sister go! Let her go!

1255
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:16,880
Bring her back!

1256
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:20,320
Murat, brother!

1257
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,799
Hang on, I'm begging you.

1258
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:27,360
Please, please! Not today!

1259
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:30,040
I'm begging you, please!

1260
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:31,760
Please.

1261
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:41,039
My name is Tahir.

1262
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:44,800
I'm here to avenge my sister.

1263
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:49,640
I wanted you to die knowing this.

1264
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:54,119
Murat! My dear brother!

1265
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:55,320
Tah...

1266
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:58,560
No! Murat!

1267
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:02,520
Murat!

1268
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:04,040
My son!

1269
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:06,760
Murat! My son!

1270
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:08,920
My son!

1271
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,240
My God!

1272
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:14,040
My God! My God!

1273
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:19,960
Brother!

1274
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:21,600
Brother!

1275
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:23,440
Murat!

1276
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:26,680
My son!

1277
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:29,960
My son!

1278
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:34,760
I lived through this pain, too.

1279
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:02,600
My brother is dying because of you!

1280
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:04,640
My family is ruined because of you!

1281
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:08,160
This was your plan all
along! You played so well.

1282
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,520
Don't you ever forget this moment!

1283
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,520
Because I never will.

1284
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,919
I am your now your sworn enemy!

1285
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:21,120
We're enemies!

1286
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:24,520
You should fear me from now on.

1287
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,800
Did you hear me?

1288
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:28,120
Fear me!

1289
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:34,040
Each breath I take is an
oath, and each oath is a step.

1290
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:38,000
In the end, you'll burn just as much as me.
