1
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,120
That's not going to happen.

2
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,120
Now get out of my home.

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,840
Come on brother, let's go.

4
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,120
You go to the workroom.

5
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,560
What are you waiting for?

6
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,480
So… we’ve taken the first step
in our partnership, haven’t we?

7
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,480
The rest will be even be more solid.

8
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,040
Best of luck with it.

9
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,280
Don’t celebrate too soon.

10
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,600
I get the final word.

11
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Cemal, cancel the shipment.

12
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,640
Clear the place immediately.

13
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,120
No! You can’t do that!

14
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,360
What the hell’s going on?

15
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,520
Cancel what? How can you do that?

16
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,000
We’re running a business here!

17
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,960
It’s a good deal… It benefits you too.

18
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,360
Do you even know what the shipment is?

19
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
These men are going behind your back.

20
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,320
They’re smuggling weapons

21
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,880
and you call it a good deal?

22
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,800
What are you talking about? Weapons?

23
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,920
Just a minute.

24
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,680
Dad… this can’t be true, right?

25
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,960
What kind of nonsense is this?

26
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
What are you talking about?

27
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,480
No… There must be some mistake.

28
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,360
Yes, there is a mistake.

29
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,640
Look, these two are the wrong ones.

30
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
Completely wrong, from head to toe.

31
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
How is this possible?

32
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,960
Don’t ask me. Ask them.

33
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,240
I didn’t know anything!

34
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
It obviously is a setup.

35
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,560
Whose setup is this?

36
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,800
Şahin?

37
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,720
If he’s behind it, I’ll make him pay.

38
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
Whoever it is, we’ll find out.

39
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,000
Nobody’s ever walked
away from us without paying.

40
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,200
So that’s why he’s been after us…

41
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,040
-But I... -Get out!

42
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,520
You stay.

43
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,720
You send one out, keep one in.

44
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
Who the hell do you think you are?

45
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,160
Easy, Nezir. Don’t lose it.

46
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,240
I don’t like repeating myself.

47
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,360
But since you don’t
understand, I’ll say it again.

48
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,720
Get out.

49
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,520
Out.

50
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,640
We’re still partners.

51
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,920
We’ll meet again.

52
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
Disgraceful!

53
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,520
If she broke one door, I’ll break them all!

54
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,920
I’ll tear this place down!

55
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,760
What is it this time?

56
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,480
Your murderous daughter
smashed the doors and ran off!

57
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,000
You think I’ll let that slide?

58
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,160
Enough already!

59
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,280
Stop calling her a killer!

60
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,880
Only one body came out of this house

61
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,720
My son! Because of you!

62
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,920
Your son took a life and lost his own.

63
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,280
That’s justice.

64
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,680
I had nothing to do with it.

65
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,480
You didn’t pull the trigger,

66
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,320
but you paved the way.

67
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,840
All of you have blood on your hands.

68
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
Watch your mouth, woman!

69
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,320
Don’t you dare act tough in my house!

70
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
Even if Mercan goes to hell,

71
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,560
I’ll drag her deeper. Deeper!

72
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,240
You hear me?

73
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,160
How do I know you didn’t lie
just to cancel the shipment?

74
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,560
Look at this.

75
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,240
What?

76
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,120
I said look.

77
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
I can’t believe this…

78
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,120
I don’t talk nonsense.

79
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,920
The sooner you learn that,
the less time you’ll waste.

80
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,920
That way you won’t get
dragged into shady business.

81
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,040
Why didn’t you use this to get me arrested?

82
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
The signatures are mine.

83
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,000
It’s not like you grew softer… so why?

84
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,280
I don’t mix business with emotion.

85
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,240
Neither for you nor your family...

86
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,400
I stopped this mess because
I care about my reputation.

87
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,880
I won’t let you drag
my name through the mud.

88
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,960
Of course it’s about Ateş Karahan again.

89
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,960
Is anyone surprised?

90
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,880
Just thinking about my
name saved you from prison.

91
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,280
Look...

92
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,240
you said it yourself:

93
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,680
"Ateş Karahan."

94
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,520
You,

95
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,400
from now on,

96
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,640
whether in the company or outside it,
you do nothing without telling me first.

97
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,600
Or what?

98
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,400
You’ll lock me in a room?

99
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
Go ahead. I’ll find a way out.

100
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,760
Will you burn me again?

101
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,960
I’ve already burned once.

102
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,480
I can burn again. It’s fine.

103
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,320
What you’ve done hurts far worse.

104
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,280
You wounded my pride.

105
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,840
What more can you do?

106
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,920
Kill me?

107
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,200
Go ahead

108
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,960
if it helps you.

109
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,640
Because a life without
pride is useless to me.

110
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,280
Even if you lock me up…

111
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,200
break me… shatter me… burn me…

112
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,640
I’ll still run from you.

113
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,720
Because every time I see your face,

114
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,000
I lose faith in humanity.

115
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,480
I wish you didn't live through any of this.

116
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,040
Pick up the phone, damn it! Pick up!

117
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,120
Bastard.

118
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,680
What was that, Dad?

119
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,560
That scumbag Şahin tricked us.

120
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,440
Would I knowingly put my
own daughter in harm’s way?

121
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,280
See. I’m calling him. He won’t answer!

122
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,080
I warned you, Dad!

123
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,720
You said Nezir was involved!

124
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,280
Nezir’s ruined too, because of us.

125
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,120
But I’ll settle accounts with Ateş! I will.

126
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,840
What does he have to do with it?

127
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Without him, I wouldn’t just be in prison.

128
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
I’d be branded a weapons smuggler!

129
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,960
We’ll see soon enough what his part is.

130
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,280
Maybe he’s the one who set us up.

131
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,520
Look, dear. Trust your father.

132
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,200
From now on, I’ll tread carefully.

133
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,760
I promise.

134
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,400
Once I find Şahin, I'll
settle accounts with him.

135
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,000
Looks like another
civil war broke out, here.

136
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,040
I don’t want Nezir here.

137
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,600
Aslı, go through the contract carefully.

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,160
There must be a loophole
or something we can use.

139
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,680
Fine, I’ll check.

140
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,960
But why cancel the shipment?

141
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
We had Haydar and Nezir in our grasp.

142
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,040
You could’ve put them behind bars.

143
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,400
Cemal just said "we
canceled it" and nothing more.

144
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,800
Haydar or Mercan, what’s the difference?

145
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,760
You should’ve had Mercan locked up.

146
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,440
- What makes her so special?
- Because I said so, Aslı.

147
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Send that man out of my company.

148
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,240
Fine.

149
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
You asked for me, Mr. Ateş?

150
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,200
Aslı will check the contract. Help her.

151
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,320
If I need help, I’ll ask.

152
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,800
We told Aslı it wasn’t
Mercan who poisoned her.

153
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,680
But she still thinks it was.

154
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,280
Everyone will find out eventually.

155
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,880
What about the weapons?

156
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,400
All taken care of.

157
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,000
Şahin’s being sent abroad.

158
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,840
No trace left behind.

159
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,320
Be careful. This is important.

160
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,360
A weed we despise keeps
growing in our own backyard.

161
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,160
Now we’re stuck with Nezir as a partner.

162
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,880
Ms. Şükran,

163
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, Yaşar.

164
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,280
Did Ms. Aslı leave? Did you see?

165
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,920
She left.

166
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,600
What are those?

167
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,120
Files? What kind of files?

168
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,120
You know, the kind you put papers in!

169
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,000
Why do you ask, Ms. Zahide?

170
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,320
She took some home to work on.

171
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,240
Why did you ask?

172
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,560
Which ones did she take?

173
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,160
I don’t know.

174
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,120
And even if I did, I wouldn’t tell you.

175
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,800
If you’re so curious, ask her yourself!

176
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,960
God help you with this woman.

177
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,840
You keep bumping into everyone
like a bumper car! Clumsy!

178
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,920
Mercan! Mercan!

179
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,680
It's been a rough day

180
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,680
Şahin totally set us up.

181
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,360
But we’re not giving up.

182
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,040
We’ll get rid of Ateş.

183
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,520
If it weren’t for him, we’d
probably be in prison right now.

184
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,560
He already locked you up in your own house.

185
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,920
Don’t forget that, Mercan.

186
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,880
New project?

187
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
Come on, let me drive you home.

188
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,560
You can tell me about it on the way.

189
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,760
No, thanks.

190
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,680
Fine. Let’s go.

191
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,080
There was no need.

192
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,040
Ateş, slow down!

193
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,120
Nezir, slow down!

194
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,160
Go inside.

195
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
Ateş, what’s going on now?

196
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,440
Come on, Aslı. Ateş, calm down!

197
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,320
I am calm.

198
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,240
Thanks for the ride, Nezir.

199
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,360
Anytime. We’ll be seeing
each other more often now.

200
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,200
What's going on?

201
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,960
What’s this about seeing each other?

202
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,720
We’re partners now.

203
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,160
Mercan and I will be working together.

204
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,520
Working together?

205
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,840
Who the hell are you to work with my wife?

206
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,200
See you later, Mercan. I’ll call you.

207
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,920
Don’t overstep around here.

208
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,960
Didn't I tell you, not
to see that man again!

209
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,480
And I told you, I will!

210
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,960
Don’t you understand plain words?

211
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,360
Yours aren’t words.

212
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,720
You’re just yelling and shoving me around!

213
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,680
Say it again.

214
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,560
No need to repeat.

215
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
You heard me.

216
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,120
I treat everyone as they deserve.

217
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,880
That man is not trustworthy.

218
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,080
And you are?

219
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,760
What do I know about you?

220
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,000
Nothing!

221
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Demet and Nezir are childhood friends.

222
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,000
For someone I’ll never lay
eyes on again after the divorce...

223
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,840
Even for someone I can't stand seeing now,

224
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,240
I won’t cut ties with them.

225
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
The Karahans will leave
this mansion one day.

226
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,120
But they’ll always be in my life.

227
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,160
You’ll be in my life as long as I want.

228
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,240
Oh really?

229
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,160
My arm.

230
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,520
Who do you think you are, defying
your husband and running off?

231
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,080
Please step aside.

232
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,960
I don’t have the strength for this.

233
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,120
Mother, come on…

234
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
What’s going on now?

235
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,600
Leave my daughter alone!

236
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,200
Don’t count on it!

237
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,560
She’ll answer for everything she’s done.

238
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,080
Mercan, what happened to your hand?

239
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,640
It’s nothing, Mom. Let’s just go.

240
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,080
You’re not going anywhere.

241
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,360
She didn't do it.

242
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,720
She’s innocent.

243
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,520
Aslı wasn’t poisoned by her.

244
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,560
If not her, then who?!

245
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,040
Enough! End this now!

246
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Dad, take Mom out of here.

247
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,400
Then who did it?

248
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,040
Come on.

249
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,400
Now you know what losing a
child feels like, Ms. Müzeyyen.

250
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,400
It was you?

251
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,160
All that shouting...
just to cover your guilt!

252
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,640
What are you doing?! Let go!

253
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,160
-Ms. Müzeyyen. -I'm gonna...

254
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
What are you doing?!

255
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,840
Let go!

256
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,640
Enough! No more incidents from now on!

257
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,760
Mother Müzeyyen,

258
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,600
Please leave it to me.

259
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,920
Please, don’t... All
of your cards are frozen.

260
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,160
And the monthly payments
from the company are canceled.

261
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,360
Your car…

262
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,640
gone too.

263
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,800
Argh!

264
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,760
I lose my child and I’m punished too?

265
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,040
What a fine world!

266
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,520
We had an agreement, Karahan.

267
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,240
Clear boundaries.

268
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,840
Don’t cross them!

269
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,640
Not Karahan.

270
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,200
Ateş Karahan.

271
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,560
And your daughter’s husband.

272
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,840
Your son in law.

273
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,040
No one sets limits for me.

274
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,040
I decide who, when,

275
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,480
and how much I burn.

276
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,840
Only 187 days.

277
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,520
The only thing you can do is

278
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,840
be grateful I stopped here.

279
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,280
You know what happened.

280
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,880
Come on.

281
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,400
Don’t think you can fool
Ateş and get away with it.

282
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,560
This isn’t over.

283
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,000
I don’t understand why slander me.

284
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,400
And I won’t try to.

285
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,600
I lied.

286
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,800
What do I say if Ateş asks.

287
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,960
Will you stop?

288
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,840
Can you stop for a minute?

289
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,240
Please stop.

290
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,160
Why did you stop so suddenly?

291
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,120
You asked me to stop?

292
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,800
What did you want to say?

293
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,880
How long have you known the truth?

294
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,640
Thanks for not letting them blame me.

295
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,000
But… I don’t want my mother hurt.

296
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,440
So we forgive your mother?

297
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,240
That’s not what I mean.

298
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,120
You know what I’ve been through.

299
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
It could happen to her too.

300
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,000
I just want you to prevent that.

301
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,760
I’ve already paid enough.

302
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,480
You paid because she sacrificed you.

303
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,120
Because she hid behind you.

304
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,360
Why didn’t you tell the truth?

305
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,840
Did you you listen to me?

306
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
Heard me?

307
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,320
I said over and over it wasn’t me.

308
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,440
None of you believed me.

309
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,720
You punished me every way.

310
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,520
Could I let you do the same to my mother?

311
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,600
Even if she hides behind me

312
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,080
even if she throws me into
the fire she’s my mother.

313
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,840
Would you?

314
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,560
Would you ruin your
mother to save yourself?

315
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,640
You wouldn’t. I know.

316
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,720
Just like me, you’d be
willing to ruin for your family.

317
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,280
You know the real wound isn’t here.

318
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,480
It’s here.

319
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,160
What are you doing?

320
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,120
Let go of my arm!

321
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,520
Get your hand of off me!

322
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,920
You're hurting my arm! Let go!

323
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,920
Shameless girl!

324
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,440
How dare you poison my daughter!

325
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,600
Ignorant fool! doesn't know who I am!

326
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,440
I’ll...

327
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,880
Didn’t you say you knew who did it?

328
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,120
You said it was the girl?

329
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Mother, was I thinking straight?

330
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,920
Also, mother or daughter,
what difference does it make?

331
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,240
If she had the chance,
she’d to be out to get me.

332
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,920
Maybe she didn’t, only because
she was too busy chasing Ateş.

333
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,160
That’s true! They’re all the same.

334
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,880
Crush them. Chew them up and spit them out.

335
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,280
If Ateş allows it…

336
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,040
Every time we try, he shields her.

337
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,400
Ateş canceled the shipment
because Mercan signed, not Haydar.

338
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,080
Thanks to her, the whole
plan collapsed in a second.

339
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,880
Ms. Binnaz,

340
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,000
maybe you should think again?

341
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,000
Don’t start too, Malik.
I don’t want to hurt you.

342
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,200
I told you, man.

343
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,760
She won’t change her mind.

344
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,760
It’s time to talk.

345
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,080
Then we’ll see our path.

346
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,080
We need to clear out the annex too.

347
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,240
So much work…

348
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,240
Man, I wanted to give it a try.

349
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,800
♪? ♪

350
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,240
How’s it going?

351
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,600
Not much.

352
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,000
I’m trying to figure out

353
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,240
how to get through Mercan’s
rescue operation with minimal damage.

354
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,400
But I can’t even
understand what I’m reading.

355
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,240
That girl has a hand in it.

356
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,720
The words are crashing down on me.

357
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,840
You know Ateş.

358
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,880
He has his own sense of justice.

359
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,120
He acts on it.

360
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,400
He couldn’t bring himself to do it.

361
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,920
And to me he was right.

362
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,560
That's what I don’t get. Why?

363
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,200
Because he didn’t know what happened.

364
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,200
Just like he didn’t know you were poisoned.

365
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,920
But you spoke as if you were sure.

366
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,040
I thought so, what’s wrong with that?

367
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,240
It matters, Aslı.

368
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,400
If you’re sure, it’s one thing.
If you’re not, it’s another.

369
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,520
- So now you’re defending her too?
- Not defending.

370
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,800
Just giving her due.

371
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,800
We’ve all treated her badly for days.

372
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,280
Oh, poor princess.

373
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,920
Why don’t you go apologize too?

374
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,080
Why not.

375
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,680
Why did you drag me here?

376
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,480
Take this.

377
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,200
Change your dressing.

378
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,320
For this?

379
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,000
Stop staring. Just take it.

380
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,120
Put it on your hand.

381
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,880
No need… I can.

382
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,320
How do you like it?

383
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,600
Does it help?

384
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,600
Does it ease your conscience?

385
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,720
What are you doing Ateş?

386
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,880
Do you have a cream for
the wounds in my soul?

387
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,840
Do you?

388
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,800
I’ve been searching for that for years.

389
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,640
If you find it, give me some too.

390
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,840
Thanks… for the cream.

391
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,120
How do you like it?

392
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,960
Does it help?

393
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,200
Does it ease your conscience?

394
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,160
If you have time, may we talk, Mr. Ateş?

395
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,400
Of course.

396
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,520
I wanted to talk to you too.

397
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,680
Good you came.

398
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,440
Did we do something wrong again?

399
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,200
No. Nothing wrong.

400
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,600
You go first.

401
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,280
Well… Mr. Ateş, how can I say it,

402
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,400
um, you know what happened.

403
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,440
We’ve decided to leave the mansion.

404
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,920
After everything, we thought
it would be better for everyone.

405
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,960
But we’ll keep working
until you find replacements.

406
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,360
We won’t leave you stranded.

407
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,760
You’re not going anywhere.

408
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,920
Yes, things happened that shouldn’t have.

409
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,640
In anger and worry, hearts were hurt.

410
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,960
-If we made mistakes... -Please,
don’t say that, Mr. Ateş.

411
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,600
No mistakes, Mr. Ateş.

412
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,080
Of course not!

413
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,960
Then it’s settled.

414
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,600
The kitchen is yours, as always.

415
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,760
Everyone stays.

416
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,240
That’s what I want.

417
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,320
Please.

418
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,480
Very well, Mr. Ateş. Thank you.

419
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,880
CALLING NEZİR

420
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,800
How are you?

421
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,840
Fine…

422
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,000
What a question.

423
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,240
I want to say something.

424
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,080
I accused you unfairly.

425
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,960
God forgives everything

426
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,120
but not wronging another.

427
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,200
I wronged you.

428
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,600
God won’t forgive me, I know.

429
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,920
But maybe you can.

430
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,800
Even if you don’t,

431
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,960
I owed you an apology.

432
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,520
I didn’t want to keep it inside.

433
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,280
If we called the innocent guilty,

434
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,280
we must also come and apologize.

435
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,880
I…

436
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,240
Thank you.

437
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,320
So this is the balm
for wounds of the heart.

438
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
Hello, Nezir.

439
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,720
Mercan, perfect timing.

440
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,360
I was just thinking of you.

441
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,880
I don’t understand.

442
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,560
I was thinking about the project.

443
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,080
I’ve got ideas you’ll like.

444
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,760
In fact, that’s why I called.

445
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,280
I’m not sure I want to
go through with it anymore.

446
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,840
I acted out of anger.

447
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,480
Ateş saved me that day

448
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
by canceling the shipment.

449
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,520
He even saved you and my father.

450
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,960
And he still trusts me.

451
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,680
He didn’t revoke my signature rights.

452
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,000
Mercan, you’re making a mistake!

453
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,400
He saved himself, not us.

454
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,000
Maybe.

455
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,720
But if I fight, I want to fight
without becoming the bad guy.

456
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,040
I know I signed the project…

457
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,400
but what if we find another way?

458
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,400
At least let’s think about it.

459
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,440
Whatever you want, we’ll do.

460
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,160
I’m always with you.

461
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,000
In every battle.

462
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,760
Yes. We did the right thing.

463
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,800
Now there’s only one thing left...

464
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,080
to find that other way.

465
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,120
Aslı!

466
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,240
Are you going to tell me what happened?

467
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,800
Nothing happened.

468
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,600
I thought it was her.

469
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,000
I trusted your word and
look what I put her through!

470
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,160
Is treating her badly
such a problem for you?

471
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,800
Don’t twist this.

472
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,160
I saw Mercan in the kitchen.

473
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,640
When I left, she gave me
a filthy look and smirked.

474
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,520
So of course she was the
first one I thought of.

475
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,560
You spoke with such certainty.

476
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,320
You mislead me.

477
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,640
I almost died!

478
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,320
I was wrong,

479
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,680
what could I do?

480
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,240
We came here to hurt them,

481
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,200
and now for one Yıldırım you’re hurting me.

482
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,200
Fine, fine…

483
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,560
But I don’t want this happening again.

484
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,560
Aslı, it’s time for your medicine.

485
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,960
Ateş, I don’t understand, son.

486
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,000
What’s Mercan different from Murat,

487
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,600
Haydar, or Nermin?

488
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,360
You know the difference.

489
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,840
We made this plan for Haydar.

490
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,360
If I hadn’t intervened,

491
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,800
our own game would have weakened us.

492
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,760
Now Haydar is still asleep,

493
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,800
guard down.

494
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,120
If you say so.

495
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,760
But remember…

496
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,760
pitying your enemy only
makes you weep in the end.

497
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
So be it.

498
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,960
This game needs a mother’s hand.

499
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,680
Let me guess.

500
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,640
Berat?

501
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,840
Shameless!

502
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,560
Are my hands that big?

503
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,080
It was only a joke, my Çiçek.

504
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,840
Don't get mad at me.

505
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,880
If you can’t joke with the
one you love, what’s the point?

506
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,160
Okay, now I’ve got wonderful news.

507
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,400
Yes?

508
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,080
Mr. Ateş wants us to stay.

509
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,040
-We’re not leaving! -Really?

510
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,640
Wait, Çiçek. Someone will see us.

511
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,200
Well...

512
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,320
-Really? -We’re not leaving!

513
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,640
-Really? -Yes.

514
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,120
I knew it.

515
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
And she denied it, liar!

516
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,760
I even asked her for help.

517
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,280
Her twisted mouth gave it away.

518
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,000
Laugh while you can, Cinderella.

519
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,480
Let’s see if you’re still
laughing when your mother finds out.

520
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,200
Why are you lingering around?

521
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,360
Ms. Müzeyyen, why do you keep coming at me?

522
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,440
Look at me.

523
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,080
These eyes see with experience.

524
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,200
I see inside you.

525
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,840
Don’t think it’s over.

526
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,160
Your turn hasn’t even come yet.

527
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,560
Let me go.

528
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,200
Life taught us well about
the devils behind angels.

529
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,960
We’ve seen plenty like you.

530
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,360
What I see in your eyes isn’t experience.

531
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,400
It’s only hate!

532
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,120
What's going on here?

533
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,120
It’s proven she didn’t
do it, Mother Müzeyyen.

534
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,280
Why keep going?

535
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,280
When her mask slips, you
won’t like what’s underneath.

536
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,080
Let’s see a doctor.

537
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,200
To avoid further problems.

538
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,920
Don’t risk infection.

539
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,040
It’s nothing.

540
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,400
I wish you’d show more...

541
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,080
of the good man inside you.

542
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,560
What are you trying to do?

543
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,640
You try to smother him
with anger, with force,

544
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,880
but it doesn't work.

545
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,280
He resists you.

546
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,680
He must be strong.

547
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,920
I’ve got work.

548
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,600
Ms. Müzeyyen is something.

549
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,040
God forbid.

550
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,680
It’s a relief nothing
worse happened to the girl.

551
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,280
Trying to kill someone.
What kind of madness is that?

552
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,760
Have they always been like
this? I just don’t get it.

553
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,600
Honestly, Mom, Ms. Müzeyyen
has messed with everyone’s head.

554
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,640
I just hope it’s not our turn next.

555
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,080
God forbid.

556
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,640
Hello.

557
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,440
Thanks, son.

558
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,680
You heard, right?

559
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,120
We’re staying.

560
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,960
I heard, Ms. Binnaz. I’m so glad.

561
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,600
Mr. Ateş wouldn’t let you go.

562
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,640
He won our hearts.

563
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,520
He’s always good to the staff.

564
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,200
Yes.

565
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,920
But Ms. Mercan paid the price.

566
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,400
Innocent, yet that woman
did terrible things to her.

567
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,640
So, Malik, when’s the wedding?

568
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,120
What wedding?

569
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,760
What else?

570
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,560
The girl you love.

571
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,520
What’s it to you?

572
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,400
That’s private. Please.

573
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,000
So you won’t say it, just
string her along in secret?

574
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,600
-What? -Not acceptable!

575
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,360
What is "stringing along"?

576
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,400
If I were her mother, I’d
marry you off by month’s end.

577
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,080
Or shoot you in the foot.

578
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,760
Come on. Really?

579
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,280
- You’d marry off your daughter right away?
- Of course. That’s how we do.

580
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,480
Fine.

581
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,800
Anyway, back to work.

582
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,760
Debt papers are coming.

583
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,320
Don’t lose your jobs.

584
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,000
- It’s for my brother.
- What are they? Debt papers?

585
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,480
It's been late. I’m starving.

586
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,040
Mom!

587
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,800
A million?

588
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,880
Brother, what have you done?

589
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,320
It says we’re drowning
in debt. We’re ruined!

590
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,120
Brother, what have you done?

591
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,400
Mom,

592
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,440
Berat.

593
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,680
Berat, what is this?

594
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,080
Oh, the things we’ve been through.

595
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,720
Damn you, Şahin!

596
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,440
Hello, Nezir…

597
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,960
I can’t reach Şahin.

598
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,240
He’s vanished.

599
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,800
Something stinks.

600
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,680
Could Şahin be working with Ateş?

601
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,800
From the way things are
going, you get a bad feeling.

602
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,240
He came to you,

603
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,520
then the job blew up,

604
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,360
Ateş knew everything.

605
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,080
They trapped us.

606
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,080
Falling isn’t the problem, Nezir.

607
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,600
The real issue is taking
others down in this world.

608
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,400
Betrayal is paid for with death.

609
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,240
If he’s behind this, I’ll
settle it with my own hands.

610
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,480
Promised.

611
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,560
First we find Şahin. Then
we’ll know who did what.

612
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,520
Right. I’ll find him.

613
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,680
Even if he’s underground,

614
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,320
I’ll drag him out and put
him in front of you, I swear.

615
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,600
But when it’s all over,

616
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,360
Ateş is mine.

617
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,240
Let me take him down.

618
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,840
I'd be delighted with that.

619
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,280
Agreed.

620
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,440
And I’ll deliver him to
you myself. That’s a promise.

621
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,440
May I have a strong tea?

622
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,840
…I’ll make it myself

623
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,240
At least he deserves this much thanks.

624
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,880
There’s a loophole here.

625
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,600
This could help us get rid of Nezir.

626
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,880
If Nezir stays… after all,

627
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,320
he’s her ex fiancé…

628
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,920
What did you find?

629
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,040
Nothing useful. No loophole.

630
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,680
We’ll have to put up with Nezir for now.

631
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,760
He’ll end up in my hands.

632
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,920
That’s my only concern.

633
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,080
We’ll find a way to kick him out.

634
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,040
Willingly or by force.

635
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,640
If you hadn’t stopped the
arms shipment because of Mercan...

636
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,760
But I did stop it.

637
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,360
Let’s talk future, not past.

638
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,360
I held back their signature
rights so they’d make mistakes.

639
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,480
But things have changed now.

640
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,600
I’m neutralizing Haydar
and Mercan completely.

641
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,320
We must block them from working with Nezir.

642
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,880
Only then can we stop them
from uniting against us.

643
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,400
What’s your plan?

644
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,240
Let’s strip Haydar and Mercan
of their signature rights.

645
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,120
No more headaches.

646
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,240
You’ll handle the arrangements, Aslı.

647
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,680
That’s all for now

648
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,080
on what we discussed.

649
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,640
How long were you listening?

650
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,400
Long enough to hear you plan
to revoke my signature rights.

651
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,880
Yes.

652
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,080
Next time you don’t need to eavesdrop.

653
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,200
I tell you what you need to know

654
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,160
as you already know.

655
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,160
You know… for a moment,

656
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,400
you fooled me.

657
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,600
I thought there was
goodness deep inside you.

658
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,720
A heart.

659
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,720
Everyone’s heart may be covered by a mist,

660
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,560
I thought one day the right
wind blows, and the mist clears.

661
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,360
But there’s no place for good in you.

662
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,040
You’ll never fool me again
even for a single moment.

663
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,400
Did she make this for me?

664
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,000
Nezir…

665
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,320
I’ve changed my mind.

666
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,320
I was wrong.

667
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,000
We’ll continue with the project.

668
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,840
Good decision, Mercan.

669
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,800
You won’t regret this.

670
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,760
What is this now?

671
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,240
Bad news for you.

672
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,680
You’re too late.

673
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,760
Nezir and I already signed the new project.

674
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,120
We’ll work together.

675
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,000
We’ll join forces

676
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,200
against you.

677
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,240
What did you just say?

678
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,720
You heard me clearly.

679
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,760
We’re moving forward
with Nezir on the project.

680
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,480
Did you get my permission?

681
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,240
I don’t need your permission.

682
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,600
You do!

683
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,400
You can’t sign such a big deal

684
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,640
just to spite me!

685
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,000
You’ll lose!

686
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,640
Stop me, if you’ve got the power.

687
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,560
Look…

688
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,520
even if you wanted to move this glass,

689
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,920
you’d have to ask me first.

690
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,040
Got it?

691
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,960
Only if I allow it.

692
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,080
Our talk isn’t over!

693
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,560
We made an agreement
with you and your father,

694
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,640
and you will stick to it!

695
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,320
The company is mine…

696
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,760
and you’re just an architect
working in my company.

697
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,440
You can’t act on your own!

698
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,640
The talk is over.

699
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,040
I’m not your slave.

700
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,560
I said you can go.

701
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,080
One day you’ll regret
everything you’ve done.

702
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,800
Mercan?

703
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,560
You look upset again.

704
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,520
I’m still breathing.

705
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,680
I haven’t seen you smile once lately.

706
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,520
Not just you

707
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,000
everyone’s unhappy.

708
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,800
-It’s like... -It’s
like our souls have died.

709
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,840
We’ve lost our joy for life, haven’t we?

710
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,440
Not too long,

711
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,840
I wish I could go back just a few months.

712
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,440
Back to the days before I met him…

713
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,280
I know about the deal
you made with my brother.

714
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,640
We’re both on your side.

715
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,240
Come on, let’s go out for a coffee.

716
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,840
It’ll be good to get away from this gloom.

717
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,080
Alright. First, let me get my purse.

718
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,680
-Come on. -Let's go.

719
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:11,480
I swear, I'd crush an army all by myself

720
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,200
but I can't handle Mother Müzeyyen.

721
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,320
I’m always on edge,
afraid she’ll hurt Nermin.

722
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,440
I know.

723
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,040
Our punishment didn’t stop her.

724
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,960
Ah,

725
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,120
Ms. Aslı’s here.

726
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,600
Everyone’s gathered here?

727
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,440
Wouldn’t be complete
without me, Cemal Effendi.

728
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,920
It's nothing, Aslı.

729
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,640
We’re gossiping about Ms. Müzeyyen.

730
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,920
You know her plans?

731
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,840
No idea. She wouldn’t tell me anyway.

732
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,400
Aslı…

733
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,160
I swear, I don’t know, Ateş!

734
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,280
She’ll improvise, I think.

735
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,200
I don’t even know which one
of you to deal with anymore.

736
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,240
Oh… Şahin’s calling.

737
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,680
Haydar’s men are after me!

738
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,120
What do I do?

739
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,000
Calm down. How did they find you?

740
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,080
I just stepped out for two minutes!

741
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,840
You're not listening. What did we tell you?

742
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,800
Get somewhere safe. Don’t go out!

743
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,280
You don’t know Haydar!

744
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,760
I’ve seen what he does
to those who betray him.

745
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,400
You can’t even imagine!

746
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,920
Calm down, Şahin.

747
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,520
Send us your location.
Cemal will come get you.

748
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,400
You live right next to Haydar!

749
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,400
How do I know he’s not watching you?

750
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,520
Idiot!

751
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,760
Man, I don’t get how these guys survive.

752
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,760
We tell him to listen, but he won’t.

753
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,040
Hen he shows up whining in front of us.

754
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,800
The man is scared, what else can he do?

755
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,560
Of course he’ll make
mistakes in this panic.

756
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,720
I’ll go find him.

757
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,040
We were just going to talk,
and they ruined that too.

758
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,960
Ateş… maybe tonight we could do something?

759
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,240
-Like what? -May be,

760
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,680
go out, have dinner… I’m starving.

761
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,280
I’m suffocating lately.

762
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:01,840
We’ll see, Aslı.

763
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,520
Where are you going?

764
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,920
Out. For coffee.

765
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,560
Did you finish your work?

766
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,040
I won't be late. I’ll
do it when I get back.

767
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,120
I didn’t ask if you’d be late.

768
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,840
No. It’s not done yet.

769
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,880
Then you’ll go when it’s finished.

770
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,960
I’ll come after I finish my work, Demet.

771
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,640
But I’ll come.

772
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,160
Alright, dear.

773
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,480
We’ll be in touch.

774
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,000
Another time, Aslı.

775
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,720
Are you alright?

776
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,760
How could I be? You saw it!

777
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,920
How will we pay all that debt, Malik?

778
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,840
Don’t worry, Çiçek.

779
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,720
We’ll find a way.

780
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,440
But how?

781
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:57,760
It’s so much money!

782
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,600
Hey, hold on.

783
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,280
Don’t give up so fast, as you always say.

784
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,520
Easy to say…

785
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,120
what about the storm that’s already here?

786
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,480
Ugh, if she hears,

787
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,080
she’ll harp on it forever.

788
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,120
Çiçek, don’t you have work to do?

789
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,440
As you can see, I do!

790
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,960
Not here. In the mansion.

791
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,280
What’s that?

792
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,600
Let me see your watch.

793
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,760
Looks pricey, doesn’t it?

794
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,400
Sure he could afford that on his salary.

795
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,560
You wouldn’t think it’s
a knockoff, would you?

796
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,200
I have to go shopping, Çiçek. See you.

797
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,040
Run away then.

798
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,000
If I tell her mother, she’ll marry her off.

799
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,840
If I don’t, they’ll keep meeting happily.

800
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,720
Something must be done… but what?

801
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,920
Hello, Nezir?

802
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,160
Um, Mercan.

803
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,680
I can't contact Demet.

804
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,360
She hasn’t come yet. Her phone’s off.

805
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,440
Is she with you?

806
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,680
She was here, just left.

807
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,560
Her battery probably died.
Don’t worry. She should be back.

808
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,040
Alright then.

809
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,960
I was worried. Sorry to bother you.

810
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,120
No problem. -Um, Mercan,

811
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,240
Shall we meet tomorrow
about the hospital project?

812
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,880
Sure. Tomorrow afternoon works
for me, if that’s good for you.

813
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,240
See you tomorrow.

814
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,000
Alright, I’m hanging up now.

815
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,400
Who were you talking to?

816
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,480
My work is done. Will you let me pass?

817
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,920
Is Mr. Emrah’s project report ready?

818
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,120
No time.

819
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,000
And… apologies,

820
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,000
I couldn’t manage.

821
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,080
You find time to scheme behind my back,

822
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,160
but when it comes to the report

823
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,760
you wave your hand as an excuse.

824
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,360
If you can chase deals with Nezir,

825
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,840
then your hand isn’t that bad.

826
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,560
I’ll get my computer.

827
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,400
No need.

828
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,120
We can use mine.

829
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,480
My credit card bill came, Haydar.

830
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,320
Ateş seized my accounts.

831
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,040
I can’t pay.

832
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,920
Poor Nermin!

833
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,640
If I were him, I’d do the same.

834
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,120
If you’re going to do
something, do it the right way.

835
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,760
At least don’t leave a trace.

836
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,560
You ordered poison to the house, Nermin?

837
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,200
You’re right. That was a mistake.

838
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,200
Mistake! Then face the consequences.

839
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,680
Müzeyyen wants to see you by the fire pit.

840
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,640
She says there’s something you need to see.

841
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,160
What do we need to see?

842
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,800
Fire pit?

843
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,600
Quite telling, isn’t it?

844
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,600
What’s that woman up to again?

845
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,240
I told them, Ms. Müzeyyen.

846
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,200
Throw those in too, girl. Into the pit!

847
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,280
That woman’s up to something again.

848
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,040
Go back to the mansion, Nermin.

849
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,320
Stay away from these
people until they’re gone.

850
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,960
She’s scheming. I need to see.

851
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,280
Nermin!

852
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,000
They're coming, mom.

853
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,320
Nermin!

854
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,200
Everything Mr. Emrah
wanted is in the project.

855
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,800
Costs are a bit higher, but manageable.

856
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,520
What do you think?

857
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,680
Looks good.

858
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,560
You even included my suggestions.

859
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,040
We can’t sacrifice quality.

860
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,240
Let’s not shortchange the
client for a little money.

861
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,800
Our company’s reputation matters.

862
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,280
We’ve never cut corners in our work.

863
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,920
Is that why you hit rock bottom?

864
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,080
My brother panicked and called you again.

865
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,440
Don’t worry, I’m fine.

866
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,120
No worries, dear.

867
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,320
Get back to work!

868
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,120
Ateş, can we talk?

869
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,800
These are my Murat's belongings.

870
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,280
What are you doing?!

871
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,040
Mother?

872
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,000
Degenerate!

873
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,680
You vile!

874
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,440
-I’ll kill you! -Nermin!

875
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,720
Stop, Nermin!

876
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,000
Let go of me, Haydar!

877
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,280
What’s the reason for
this hatred, Ms. Müzeyyen?

878
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,000
We’re the ones who lost a child,

879
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,000
Pain deserves mercy, not cruelty!

880
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,600
I’ve suffered so much

881
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,960
that I have no mercy for
anyone outside my family!

882
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,520
What's going on here?!

883
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,520
You want to burn my
brother’s things, Ms. Müzeyyen?

884
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,440
Give me that lighter!

885
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,840
Oh, Mother Müzeyyen… will you never stop?

886
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,880
Don't, Mercan!

887
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,320
No one can take your son’s
memories from you, mother.

888
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,960
They’ll live in your
heart and in your soul.

889
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,560
Stand up, Mom.

890
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,640
Stand tall before them.

891
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,200
Mercan’s right.

892
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,840
Don’t show this woman your weakness.

893
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,000
This has gotten really old!

894
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,360
Come.

895
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,560
Come over.

896
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,040
Enough for today, Ms. Müzeyyen.

897
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,600
Come on, let's go.

898
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,440
Enough! Nermin!

899
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,960
Nermin! Nermin! Nermin!

900
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,200
Let go!

901
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,320
Come to your senses.

902
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,360
Haven't I told you not
to give that woman fuel?

903
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,480
You saw, how Mercan...

904
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,400
How she stood strong before them.

905
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,960
Be like her!

906
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,960
Enough!

907
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,680
Everything of our son’s
is gone, turned to ashes!

908
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,240
And you still talk about Mercan!

909
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,400
-Nermin...

910
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,640
You crushed him while he lived, humiliated,

911
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,520
always put Mercan above him.

912
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,760
At least don’t do it now.

913
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,840
- You can’t even protect your son’s memory!
- (furious) Don’t cross the line, Nermin!

914
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,120
I don’t have the luxury
of mourning like you.

915
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,720
We’re still drowning in the pit Murat dug!

916
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,040
You’ll stay away from that woman.

917
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,920
That’s final!

918
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,480
Have some tea, brother.

919
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,840
Thank you.

920
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,560
Where’s mother?

921
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,520
Praying. She’ll be back soon.

922
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,960
I upset her for again.

923
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,680
It’s my fault.

924
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,160
I should’ve taken on more work.

925
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,760
That way, the debt wouldn’t have piled up.

926
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,800
Thinking they’d pay today or tomorrow..

927
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,120
It’s not your fault.

928
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,400
They didn’t pay salaries for months.

929
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,640
Because of Mr. Haydar.

930
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,280
No, no. It's because of Mr. Murat.

931
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,720
Hard to blame them.

932
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,440
They never missed a day
until their business collapsed.

933
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,640
True.

934
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,640
Fool that I am.

935
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,040
While trying to juggle the cards,

936
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,520
I got burned.

937
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,960
Don’t bow your head, son.

938
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,120
You didn’t waste money in bars.

939
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,800
Every penny went to us.

940
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,680
This is my burial money.

941
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,600
Çiçek added some too.

942
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,640
This won't cover all your debts,

943
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,320
but enough for the first payment.

944
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,400
No, mother.

945
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,920
Çiçek, I...

946
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,040
I can’t take this, mom.

947
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,320
What do you mean?

948
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,400
Don’t argue with me.

949
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,840
Who can it be? Let me see.

950
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,440
Good evening.

951
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,240
Is everything alright?

952
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,480
Welcome, son. Have a seat.

953
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,400
Thanks, Ms. Binnaz. I won't stay long.

954
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,640
Malik? What is it?

955
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,320
Malik?

956
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,920
I had some savings. I took them out.

957
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,680
No, Malik. I can’t take it, brother.

958
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,480
Yes, you can, Berat.

959
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,400
You’re like family to me.

960
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,840
Give me a chance to help.

961
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,280
Thank you.

962
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,280
I should get going.

963
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,040
Sit, have some tea. You can go later.

964
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,680
I’d better head out.

965
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,400
Sit, have some tea.

966
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,280
Çiçek, serve us tea, dear.

967
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,320
You shouldn’t have bothered, son.

968
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,800
I had some savings.

969
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,920
Not a problem.

970
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,040
This photo

971
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,280
was from Murat’s birthday…

972
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,960
I barely remember.

973
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,400
He loved chocolate cake,

974
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,720
I loved strawberry.

975
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,680
We always fought about it.

976
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,720
That day they bought strawberry cake,

977
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:26,160
and he sulked: "Why did you get
Mercan’s favorite cake on my birthday?"

978
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,000
How can a single photo

979
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,560
carry a lifetime of longing?

980
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,120
What are you doing here?

981
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,680
Get lost!

982
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,880
I don’t want to see you!

983
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,200
Come on, play.

984
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,760
Come on, kids. Come here.

985
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,920
Brother… aren’t we going to eat cake?

986
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,040
Happy Birthday!

987
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,400
My Eylül.

988
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,560
Your innocent look that day,

989
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,720
is still on my mind.

990
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,600
Nothing will ever be the same.

991
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,640
Those days are just memories now.

992
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,200
For some, they’re sweet memories.

993
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,960
For others, a lifelong nightmare.

994
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,600
How long are you going to stay in there?

995
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,280
As long as I want!

996
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,080
Use another bathroom!

997
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,480
You’ve been in the bathroom for hours.

998
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,240
I'm going to be late.

999
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,240
You should’ve thought of that earlier.

1000
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,840
Don’t you know what civilization is?

1001
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,160
You’ve done everything but break the door!

1002
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,560
Where are you going like that?

1003
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,680
Where else? To work.

1004
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,120
Dressed like this?

1005
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,640
What’s wrong with it?

1006
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:07,920
Weren’t you late?

1007
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,600
Go in the bathroom, already!

1008
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,440
Wait.

1009
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:22,760
We’ll leave together.

1010
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,320
What a jerk!

1011
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,000
Come, Mercan.

1012
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,120
I was going to come talk to you.

1013
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,040
I still can’t forgive my brother.

1014
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,560
Killing someone,

1015
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,680
hurting…

1016
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,040
It chills my blood.

1017
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,200
But he’s my brother.

1018
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,680
No matter how bad he was, I
never wanted anyone to hurt him.

1019
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,720
I only wanted to do what was right.

1020
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,640
Mercan, my harshness is out of anger.

1021
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,800
It was Müzeyyen who hurt your brother.

1022
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,040
She did everything.

1023
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,360
And it wasn’t enough for her.

1024
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,840
Yesterday she even tried
to erase his memories.

1025
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,520
But just wait… you’ll see.

1026
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,000
Just wait.

1027
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,240
When the time comes, she’ll pay for it.

1028
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,800
Mother, please… I’m
asking you, just this once.

1029
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,240
Stay away from them!

1030
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,200
Yeah.

1031
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,080
Stay away.

1032
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,040
Ateş.

1033
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,960
Ms. Müzeyyen has gone too far.

1034
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,240
Last night was the limit.

1035
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,320
You don’t inflict that much
pain on a grieving mother.

1036
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,720
Talk to her...

1037
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,120
- Talk to her, or else...
- Your wife nearly killed Aslı.

1038
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,840
Be grateful she hasn’t done worse.

1039
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,840
And don’t you ever threaten me again.

1040
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,720
I'm telling you what I saw.

1041
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,800
Aslı sits at her mother’s side.

1042
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,760
- My son lies in the ground...
- Everyone’s where they deserve to be.

1043
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:36,120
Your son killed an
innocent girl, didn’t he?

1044
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,480
Did you sleep well, darling?

1045
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,840
Weren’t you going with Ateş?

1046
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,880
He said he had to go with Mercan.

1047
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,240
Told me to come with Cemal.

1048
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,360
That Haydar’s daughter…

1049
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,120
she knows how to play her cards.

1050
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,720
It's all because of mercy.

1051
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,560
What can Ateş do?

1052
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:34,760
He feels guilty because we
blamed her for your poisoning.

1053
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,320
I hope his conscience doesn’t destroy him.

1054
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,480
Okay but Ateş is going too far.

1055
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:47,480
She schemes with her ex,

1056
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,600
and instead of putting her in her place,

1057
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,800
he clings to her even more.

1058
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,200
What are you saying, dear?

1059
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,520
What "Ex"?

1060
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,880
Nezir works with us now, Mom.

1061
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,120
Thanks to Mercan.

1062
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,520
She put him right under Ateş’s nose,

1063
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,280
knowing they don’t get along.

1064
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,520
They’re very close.

1065
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,240
Nezir even gave her a
ride home the other day.

1066
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,840
And of course, Ateş was furious.

1067
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,680
Nezir, huh?

1068
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,640
I'm inside the company building.

1069
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,400
Where are you? You haven't arrived yet.

1070
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,680
No, I'll wait for you.
We'll go in together.

1071
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:42,760
Alright, brother.

1072
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,160
Oh no!

1073
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:50,840
I’m so sorry.

1074
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,480
I'll gather, now.

1075
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:56,120
No, it’s my fault. I
didn’t see you. I apologize.

1076
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:59,360
Don’t worry, I’ll handle it.

1077
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,640
Here.

1078
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,240
We’ll work in my office.

1079
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,600
You’ll work here today.

1080
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,400
Fine. Why not add handcuffs?

1081
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:35,680
You’re getting ridiculous.

1082
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:37,960
No need.

1083
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,440
I can keep you close without them.

1084
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:44,280
Sit down.

1085
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,080
We've got so much work.

1086
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,720
No. I want to work in my office.

1087
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,680
Whether your desk or this
one. it makes no difference.

1088
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,440
If you want to work,
you can work here, too.

1089
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,360
You’re such a tyrant.

1090
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:14,720
And annoying.

1091
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:28,000
Zahide sent over these files, Mr. Ateş.

1092
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,720
Just leave them on the desk.

1093
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:37,040
So you’re working here
now, Ms. Mercan. That’s nice.

1094
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:45,480
Anything you need?

1095
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,160
No, thanks.

1096
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,240
Thank you.

1097
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,400
Good luck with your work.

1098
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,480
Bring me a black coffee.

1099
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,280
What?

1100
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,560
Why so surprised?

1101
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:21,320
Don’t tell me you don’t know what that is.

1102
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,880
This is too much!

1103
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,720
Burak would've brought
it. Why didn’t you ask him?

1104
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,320
Come on, we’ve got work.

1105
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:31,360
Get one for yourself too.

1106
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,680
Caffeine will clear your mind.

1107
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,120
Patience…

1108
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,120
Welcome, Ms. Aslı.

1109
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,680
What’s up?

1110
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,320
What’s happening today?

1111
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,160
Well… Mr. Ateş asked me to
check the contract with Mr. Nezir.

1112
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,360
I already checked. Nothing to do.

1113
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,160
Nezir is our new partner.

1114
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:18,920
Ateş knows.

1115
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,040
Yes, he told me.

1116
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,120
I just couldn’t find a copy. Could
I get one from you, for the copier?

1117
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,520
To keep it in the file.

1118
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,640
I’m the lawyer.

1119
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,440
Why do you need it?

1120
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,160
That's not necessary. I have it.

1121
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,600
I’m sorry for lashing
out at you last night.

1122
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,240
I wasn’t the only one who lost…

1123
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,800
you lost your son too.

1124
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,280
You’re right about Müzeyyen, Haydar.

1125
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,880
She enjoys watching me suffer.

1126
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,680
I won’t give her that pleasure again.

1127
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,720
Finally... finally, Nermin.

1128
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,080
I’m tired of all the fighting.

1129
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,320
If you want your old
life back, stop bickering.

1130
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,400
Listen to me.

1131
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,080
Help me a little.

1132
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,520
We found Şahin.

1133
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,160
At last, some good news.

1134
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,800
Have them send me his location.

1135
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,080
Haydar?

1136
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,200
You’re serving coffee yourself?

1137
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,120
We’ll talk later.

1138
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,360
We’ll be seeing each other more often now.

1139
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:00,920
Let me introduce my new assistant.

1140
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,280
I’m so glad.

1141
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,520
It’s good to see a friendly face here.

1142
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,080
Come on, Ms. Mercan…

1143
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,840
You know what I mean, Yaşar.

1144
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,680
Everything will work out, Mercan.

1145
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,680
They’ll be gone soon.

1146
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,080
Just a little patience.

1147
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,440
Good morning.

1148
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,800
You work here too?

1149
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,160
Good morning. Yes, starting today.

1150
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,840
Ms. Demet is Mr. Nezir’s sister, Burak.

1151
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,120
Ms. Mercan, I can help you.

1152
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,680
-No, thanks, Burak. -No, really.

1153
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,400
-I can help you. -I’ve got it. Thanks.

1154
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:55,760
Really.

1155
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:11,040
My coffee’s getting cold.

1156
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,360
Save your chatter for outside work.

1157
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,280
Give us a moment, Demet.

1158
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:33,800
There's no problem.

1159
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:35,120
I'll be there shortly.

1160
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,360
I don’t want you in this company.

1161
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,280
Name your price to end the partnership.

1162
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,760
You won’t profit from this.

1163
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:54,760
You must have guessed I won’t allow it.

1164
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,040
You’ll walk away richer

1165
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:59,680
from an empty deal.

1166
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:03,760
Unlike you, I think this
partnership is profitable.

1167
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:08,360
And I won’t miss the
chance to work with Mercan.

1168
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,840
I mean her architecture, of course.

1169
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,360
You’ll regret refusing.

1170
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,200
Tell Mercan I’m waiting
for her about the meeting.

1171
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,640
Bring me Emrah’s project file.

1172
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,120
I want to review it again.

1173
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,680
But it was finished. There was no problem.

1174
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,440
Maybe there is. I’ll check.

1175
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,120
Jerk…

1176
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,200
Gosh!

1177
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,120
That was productive.

1178
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,240
If we keep this up,

1179
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,320
we’ll launch many projects.

1180
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,240
It’s been a long day.

1181
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,960
We’re leaving.

1182
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,920
I have other work.

1183
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:59,960
I have a meeting with Nezir.

1184
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:01,720
Um... too bad.

1185
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,080
You should’ve told me earlier.

1186
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,800
We need to visit the construction
site. They’re waiting.

1187
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:33,520
If I lose this money, I’m ruined, Salih.

1188
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,080
You’re sure, bro?

1189
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,040
SALIH: Your money will double.

1190
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,880
You’re my childhood friend.

1191
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,720
I’d never cheat you.

1192
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,400
I have no other choice.

1193
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,000
I’ll bring the money today.

1194
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:49,760
Bye.

1195
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:52,320
Berat?

1196
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,640
Who are you giving the money to?

1197
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:00,520
Well, I found a way

1198
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:01,960
to clear all the debt fast.

1199
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,000
I’ll even pay you back

1200
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,480
and have money left.

1201
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:08,560
There’s no such way, Berat.

1202
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,080
No one makes that much money so quickly.

1203
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,200
Something’s wrong, brother.

1204
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,000
Oh, no. Salih’s a solid guy.

1205
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,920
I've known him for a long time.

1206
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,560
Look, I don't want money.

1207
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,080
Just pay the debt.

1208
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,200
Forget about the rest.

1209
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:24,680
Come now. No, brother.

1210
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:28,400
He’s my childhood friend.

1211
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,840
Don't worry, he won’t betray me.

1212
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,480
Talk to you later.

1213
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:42,120
♪ ????? ♪

1214
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:03,720
Binnaz, did you pour the salad dressing?

1215
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,520
Yes, Ms. Müzeyyen.

1216
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,120
Fine.

1217
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,960
I thought today would never end.

1218
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,280
I’m worn out. Thanks to you.

1219
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,640
We got a lot done.

1220
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:19,520
Thanks to me.

1221
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,240
Perfect timing, son.

1222
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,720
We have guests for dinner.

1223
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:27,200
Who are we waiting for?

1224
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:31,640
They're here.

1225
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:14,600
What are you doing here?

1226
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:18,720
What is he doing here?

1227
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:23,720
I warned you not to come here again.

1228
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,520
Tell me.

1229
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:30,920
Why are you here?

1230
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,400
I invited him.

1231
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,520
And I accepted the invitation.

1232
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:47,520
I know that we had a poor start.

1233
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,240
But I'm ready to leave everything behind.

1234
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,200
We all are a part of the same family.

1235
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,240
Aren't we Mercan?

1236
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,640
Yes. Welcome.

1237
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,440
Moreover, we'll work
together at the company.

1238
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:39,440
We'll always side to side.

1239
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,280
Look.

1240
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:07,800
I came here to ease
tensions and make peace.

1241
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,640
And.

1242
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:14,960
Mercan won't be left out either.

1243
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,200
That's not going to happen.

1244
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,200
Now get out of my home.

1245
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:35,920
Come on brother, let's go.

1246
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,200
You go to the workroom.

1247
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:08,640
What are you waiting for?

1248
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,040
What's the reason for all this anger?

1249
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,000
Moreover, we'll work
together at the company.

1250
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,000
We'll always side to side.

1251
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:20,760
Get out.

1252
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:22,880
The things happened.

1253
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:33,640
Did you know that?

1254
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:35,920
No.

1255
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:44,720
What you did was wrong.

1256
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:48,720
I know why you are angry at Nezir.

1257
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:50,920
He made many mistakes in the past.

1258
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,520
But it's clear that he
wants to turn over a new leaf.

1259
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,320
I've known him for a long time.

1260
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,800
I think he deserves the second chance.

1261
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,720
Don't defend that man to me.

1262
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:04,560
I'm not defending anyone.

1263
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,000
You're my wife.

1264
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:20,480
That man can't

1265
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:22,760
touch you.

1266
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:24,360
Can't touch my wife.

1267
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:25,920
He wouldn't dare touch you.

1268
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:27,920
Can't dare.

1269
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:32,720
Do you understand?

1270
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:42,160
Look.

1271
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:44,320
Please be reasonable.

1272
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:47,960
I just don't want any tension to arise.

1273
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:52,120
We'll work with Nezir,
we're working on a project.

1274
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,280
We'll see each other at the company.

1275
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:00,080
You don't go the company from now on.

1276
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:03,240
What is that means?

1277
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,720
As long as that man is at company

1278
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,160
I severed all the ties with company.

1279
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,120
No. You Can't.

1280
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:13,600
You can't stop me from working.

1281
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:14,720
I did.

1282
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:48,920
Why did you invite him?

1283
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:53,000
Why did you invite our mortal enemy mother?

1284
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:55,720
To show you Mercan's real face.

1285
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,040
You saw how close they are.

1286
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:00,120
She said "Welcome".

1287
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:01,400
He tried to touch.

1288
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:04,120
If you weren't here, only
God knows what would happen.

1289
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:06,200
Mother Müzeyyen.

1290
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:07,280
Stop.

1291
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:08,560
You talk in wrong way.

1292
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:11,520
Let's not break each other's hear.

1293
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,520
Are you in this too?

1294
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,640
Ateş, I swear I didn't know.

1295
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,960
She says true. I did.

1296
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:27,160
To make you come to your senses.

1297
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:29,720
You invited our mortal enemy to our home.

1298
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:32,440
And I'm the one who is unconscious, right?

1299
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:33,840
I'm okay.

1300
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,480
No you're not.

1301
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:39,760
You've forgotten who our mortal enemy is.

1302
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:43,560
Nezir isn't our mortal enemy.

1303
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:45,600
It's Haydar Yıldırım.

1304
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:54,560
You've strayed from your path.

1305
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:57,280
You made mistake

1306
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,520
trying to protect that girl.

1307
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,400
I invited Nezir for you to understand

1308
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:04,920
what kind of woman Mercan is.

1309
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:06,760
And look.

1310
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:09,280
Even that much is enough.

1311
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:11,560
This becomes your obsession.

1312
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:15,160
I'm not protecting anyone.

1313
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:17,480
I said before.

1314
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:19,880
I'm warning you one more time.

1315
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,800
You won't

1316
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:23,560
act on impulse again.

1317
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:27,520
Ateş.

1318
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:29,920
Okay.

1319
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:31,520
I lost control to my anger.

1320
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:34,200
It's maternal instinct.

1321
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:36,600
I wanted to take

1322
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:39,360
precautions against a threat I perceived.

1323
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,480
You see what we're
going through, don't you?

1324
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,560
He is a total despot.

1325
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,640
We can't do anything.

1326
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:08,520
We stand for everything.

1327
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:09,320
We have to.

1328
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:10,680
I'm here for you.

1329
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:13,960
I'll do everything I can
to get rid of that man.

1330
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,360
I feel sorry for Mercan.

1331
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:19,960
She married the man she doesn't want.

1332
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:22,960
The suffering she
endured was beyond measure.

1333
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:25,720
She worn out.

1334
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:28,320
Don't go, wait.

1335
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,600
Mercan wants to see you.

1336
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,640
No.

1337
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:35,320
Binnaz will serve something.

1338
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:39,400
Come on.

1339
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:54,680
There are no sturdy plates left.

1340
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:02,560
They argue every day.

1341
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:07,080
We don't have any day without any argument.

1342
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:11,120
As if our own problems weren't
enough, we have to deal with these too.

1343
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:17,680
Throw them.

1344
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:19,680
Be careful. Don't cut your hand.

1345
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:24,640
I'll take out the trash then.

1346
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:37,120
I'll take

1347
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:38,520
them to the warehouse too.

1348
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:39,840
Okay?

1349
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:41,200
I'll wait outside.

1350
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:42,280
Okay son.

1351
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:44,720
Sorry for that.

1352
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:46,400
It’s my clumsiness.

1353
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,040
Are you okay? Nothing happened, right?

1354
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:54,320
Be careful.

1355
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:01,360
Çiçek, put them into the machine.

1356
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:03,400
Let's arrange them.

1357
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:18,360
Ceren, move to this way.

1358
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,640
Please excuse me.

1359
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:50,040
No problem.
It's okay.

1360
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,200
Are you okay?

1361
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:00,920
After all that has happened,
I am as good as I can be.

1362
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:02,960
I'm sorry for the things happened there.

1363
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,880
I felt ashamed.

1364
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:07,360
I don't want you to be sad.

1365
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:09,360
You aren't guilty.

1366
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:13,680
Let's leave before something happens.

1367
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:19,320
Well.

1368
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:21,560
Ateş is right.

1369
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:24,880
We were wrong.

1370
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:27,400
When should have notify before we came.

1371
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,480
Nothing can excuse what happened inside.

1372
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:33,040
That was real rudeness.

1373
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,360
Kicked you out of the house.

1374
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:38,480
He just fired me from work too.

1375
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,920
I only had my job.

1376
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:49,240
He deprived me of that too.

1377
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:52,560
Are they still here?

1378
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,320
I can help you.

1379
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:00,000
Brother calm down.

1380
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:01,400
They're going. Oka?

1381
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:02,880
Don't touch her.

1382
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:10,080
See you Mercan.

1383
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:11,200
See you.

1384
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
We need to talk.

1385
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:42,360
We don't have something to talk.

1386
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:44,680
I said my last word.

1387
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:49,760
But I didn't say.

1388
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:54,440
I don't like it when people contradict me.

1389
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:57,760
We talked and it's over.

1390
02:07:58,600 --> 02:07:59,680
But we'll talk.

1391
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:28,600
Another night filled with arguments.

1392
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:32,360
If things keep going like this,
we'll end up in an action movie.

1393
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:34,280
But I know what is good for us.

1394
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:35,480
Don't worry.

1395
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:53,640
Son, did you check all of them?

1396
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:56,120
Yes, aunt Binnaz. Everything is okay.

1397
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,400
These are the ones that
you separated from others.

1398
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:00,840
Thanks, son, you saved me from a trouble.

1399
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:02,920
I was going to deal with these tomorrow.

1400
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:04,400
They're heavy.

1401
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:07,040
No problem aunt Binnaz. Every time.

1402
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:10,840
Did you check the valve?

1403
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:12,839
There was a problem with
the irrigation system.

1404
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:14,960
Don't let the garden turn
into a lake in the morning.

1405
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
I turned it off.

1406
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:23,760
Berat didn't come.

1407
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:26,600
Has he deposited the money yet?

1408
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:28,400
Did he call you?

1409
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:30,800
He didn't but he must have handled it.

1410
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:34,360
I hope. I have a bad instinct inside.

1411
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:35,920
I hope nothing happens.

1412
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:37,640
It's because of weather.

1413
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:39,640
I'm tired.

1414
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:41,480
I'm tired too, come on.

1415
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:43,200
Leave the box over there.

1416
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:46,200
Not a single day goes by without incident.

1417
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,040
What happened to this
mansion, I didn’t understand.

1418
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:50,680
Brother.

1419
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:52,440
Welcome.

1420
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:53,720
Thank you.

1421
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:55,440
Is the money thing okay?

1422
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:57,080
It is okay mom.
I deposited it.

1423
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:59,200
Thank god.

1424
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:00,960
Thank god.

1425
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:01,480
Anyway.

1426
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:02,880
We handled this month.

1427
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:05,120
God willing, next month.

1428
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:06,600
I hope.

1429
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:09,200
We will be able to sleep peacefully.

1430
02:10:10,040 --> 02:10:11,720
I'm so tired, I go to sleep.

1431
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:15,280
Çiçek, come-on. Let's go to sleep,
we have too much to do tomorrow.

1432
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:16,800
Malik.

1433
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,520
Son, thank you.

1434
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,080
You're welcome, aunt Binnaz.

1435
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:21,240
Every time.

1436
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:22,800
Good night.

1437
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:24,640
Good night.

1438
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:26,560
Good night.

1439
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:36,960
Berat.

1440
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:38,320
This isn't right to me.

1441
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:40,880
They'll hear.

1442
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:42,560
Look. Malik you've promised.

1443
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:44,040
You won't say anything.

1444
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:45,360
Okay?

1445
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,880
If I say, they'll worry.
There is no need to that.

1446
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:52,160
If the money doubles or triples,
I'll give the good news anyway.

1447
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:53,560
Until then

1448
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:55,480
we'll shut our mouths, okay?

1449
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:57,440
What if your money goes away?

1450
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:58,440
It won't.

1451
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:00,880
I trust with Salih. Calm down.

1452
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:02,720
Sit.
Okay.

1453
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:05,480
Hopefully it will be as you say.

1454
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,680
Let it be so.

1455
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:10,560
Eat it.

1456
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:12,080
Take it.

1457
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,640
Okay, give me.

1458
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:14,520
Man.

1459
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,640
Relax. It'll be good.

1460
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:18,160
Let's see.

1461
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:23,760
Let's throw a few punches
and relieve our stress.

1462
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:25,480
You know me well.

1463
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:29,040
You understand what I need.

1464
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,040
I'm lucky to have such a friend like you.

1465
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:33,120
I'm the lucky one.

1466
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:40,760
Now tell me.

1467
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:42,960
Are you angry at Nezir, or
are you jealous of Mercan?

1468
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,040
Don't be ridiculous.

1469
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:48,720
It can be.

1470
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:55,920
Any news from Şahin?

1471
02:11:57,240 --> 02:11:57,440
No.

1472
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:59,640
We haven't found where he's hiding yet.

1473
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:01,280
We are not the only ones tracking Şahin.

1474
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:02,800
Haydar is also after him.

1475
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:04,360
If he finds him before us.

1476
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:07,720
He can't.

1477
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,560
Don't worry, everything is under control.

1478
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:11,200
Good.

1479
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:13,080
Let's act quickly then.

1480
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:08,840
You're my wife.

1481
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:11,120
That man can't

1482
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:13,400
touch you.

1483
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Can't touch my wife.

1484
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:16,560
He wouldn't dare.

1485
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:18,560
Can't dare to do it.

1486
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:20,920
Do you understand?

1487
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:32,880
I heard what happened to Mercan.

1488
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:35,880
Is this how you treat your wife?

1489
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:37,520
Is this how you protect?

1490
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:56,120
You won again, champ.

1491
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:57,600
It was a good game.

1492
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:07,960
I'm going to have a good sleep tonight.

1493
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:11,720
The Karahans clashed with each other.

1494
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:15,040
The sow discords will destroy them.

1495
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:20,440
I'm not going to rely on
that and sit around either.

1496
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:24,200
I have never left any of my
work to chance until today.

1497
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:27,080
This will be the case after today as well.

1498
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:30,800
May tomorrow be a good day.

1499
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,880
What will you do tomorrow Haydar?

1500
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:38,840
What is in your mind?

1501
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:41,520
It's good for you to not know Nermin.

1502
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:45,320
It's good for you to not know.

1503
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:47,680
Put that over here.

1504
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:11,096
I don't want to overstep my bounds.

1505
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:12,960
But I have to say what
I see as your friend.

1506
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:17,160
I've been noticing you've
been out of control lately.

1507
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:20,800
I'm not defending what mother Müzeyyen did.

1508
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:21,920
It was definitely wrong.

1509
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:23,400
Okay.

1510
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:25,320
But you overreacted brother.

1511
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,560
We embarked on this journey together.

1512
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:33,656
If we argue at the beginning
of the journey, it won't work.

1513
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:35,280
We have no one but each other.

1514
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:37,080
You know best, though.

1515
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:40,960
Mother Müzeyyen crossed the line.

1516
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:43,600
But about overreacting, you're right.

1517
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:47,160
No matter how much I regret it,

1518
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:49,280
I can't stop myself in that moment.

1519
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:52,960
Things she said to defend herself.

1520
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:56,240
I don't want to hear or listen to anything.

1521
02:16:56,400 --> 02:16:58,840
Do you know why you don't want
to hear about Mother Müzeyyen?

1522
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:02,440
When the heart begins to speak,

1523
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:04,280
the ear hears no other sound.

1524
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:05,920
It doesn't even want to hear.

1525
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:17,880
We'll work with Nezir. We are
working on a project together.

1526
02:18:58,600 --> 02:18:59,600
No.

1527
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:00,400
You can't.

1528
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,840
You can't stop me from working.

1529
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:29,520
Are you angry at Nezir
or jealous of the Mercan?

1530
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:44,240
Why didn't you sleep?

1531
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:45,760
Waited for you.

1532
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:47,040
Why?

1533
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:48,080
We have to talk.

1534
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:50,320
I'm sleepy, I'll sleep.

1535
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:53,240
I said what I'm going to say.

1536
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:54,880
But I didn't say.

1537
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:58,720
I listened you, you have to listen to me.

1538
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Look.

1539
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:03,960
Architecture was my childhood dream.

1540
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:06,760
I worked very hard to achieve
it. To get to this point.

1541
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:13,440
I lost everything.

1542
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:14,960
There is only my profession left.

1543
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:19,440
Please don't take that from me.

1544
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:21,680
Please don't stop me from working.

1545
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:27,800
I know that you aren't sleeping. Answer me.

1546
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:29,160
Say something.

1547
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,080
I've said already.

1548
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:33,120
That's all you'll hear from me.

1549
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Okay then.

1550
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:45,400
You left me no other choice.

1551
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:08,840
I don't understand this stubbornness.

1552
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:32,440
You don't have a job.

1553
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,240
Why did you wake up that early?

1554
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:39,160
If I were in your shoes,
I'd sleep a little longer.

1555
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:41,240
You're not, though.

1556
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:11,560
Berat.

1557
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:13,400
Would you like to call your friend?

1558
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:15,200
I called him.

1559
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,480
What did he say?

1560
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,160
When will you get your money?

1561
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:22,560
I don't know, I couldn't talk anyway.

1562
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:24,960
He's busy anyway. He'll call me later.

1563
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:26,680
He'll call me.

1564
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:41,000
Take this shopping list
and put it in your pocket.

1565
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:42,040
You can forget.

1566
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:44,160
Lady Müzeyyen wants it complete.

1567
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:46,120
She's already very angry.

1568
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:47,720
Don't forget it.

1569
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:49,440
Put it in your pocket.

1570
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:52,720
Okay.

1571
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:55,880
What is this?

1572
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:07,840
What is this?

1573
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:16,680
Whose earing is this?

1574
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:19,280
Why is this in your pocket?

1575
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:23,200
Well.

1576
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:25,080
What?

1577
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:29,360
I wonder whose.

1578
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:16,200
Where are you going?

1579
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:17,600
I have something to do.

1580
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:19,840
What is it?

1581
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:21,840
I don't have to tell you.

1582
02:25:22,480 --> 02:25:23,480
You have to.

1583
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:24,880
Or you can't go anywhere.

1584
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:25,360
I'll go.

1585
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:26,840
You don't.

1586
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:27,560
I don't allow you.

1587
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:29,040
I'm not asking your permission.

1588
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:30,760
Then you'll ask.

1589
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:32,280
And you'll not allow.

1590
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:33,880
It's true.

1591
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,000
I don't allow.

1592
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:37,920
Why would I ask for permission
that I know you won't give?

1593
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:58,840
I know you didn't want me to come here.

1594
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:02,360
And you'll come.

1595
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:06,680
I came.

1596
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:08,560
Because, I wanted to say sorry.

1597
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:11,640
I'm sorry for what happened last night.

1598
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:15,800
If I had known you weren't aware of Mrs.
Müzeyyen's invitation, I wouldn't have come.

1599
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,040
As I said last night.

1600
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:18,760
I want this conflict to end.

1601
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:20,840
Are you done?

1602
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:26,040
I got you your favorite dessert.

1603
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:29,960
Creme caramel.

1604
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:32,680
Let's eat something sweet and talk sweetly.

1605
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:46,080
Thank you so much.

1606
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:47,360
Thank you.

1607
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:00,360
I speak sweetly without being sweet.

1608
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:05,080
You enjoy with it.

1609
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:09,400
What are you doing?

1610
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:11,960
As you can see, we're walking.

1611
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:13,600
Let me.

1612
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:15,080
I want to eat the dessert.

1613
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:17,680
I said leave me.
