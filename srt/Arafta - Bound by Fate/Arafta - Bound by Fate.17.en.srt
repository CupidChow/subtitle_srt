1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,479
It takes real nerve to attack someone who tied up.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,480
Bravo!

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,280
Our prey is in the cage. Badly wounded.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,399
So he will wait to die in pain.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,399
He will beg for death.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,439
I would love to see Ateş Karahan at that moment.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,960
Do you know where Ateş is?

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,759
Ateş Karahan is the last person I would worry about.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,759
Watch your words when you talk about Ateş.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Or I will not watch mine, and you will regret it.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will not bow to threats from a servant like you.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What did you just call me?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,999
A servant.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I gave you a chance, Nezir.

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,160
This is Ateş.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,960
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,040
Do not move.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
What will we do with him, boss?

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,320
Leave him here, a feast for the wolves.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,240
Mercan and some guy raided the place. The guy’s finished. We caught Mercan too.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,520
What the hell are you saying? What do you mean Mercan came? How could she come?

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,720
Why does she ruin all my plans?

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,840
Just as we had the opportunity to finish the Karahans off, why the hell she goes there?

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Just don’t shoot me.

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,440
Even now, you’re throwing jabs. I can't believe you.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,600
You, that way. Let’s corner them.

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,040
Let’s settle it man to man.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
Let the girl go.

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,120
You’re both finished.

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,360
Man, they jumped!

31
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,280
Mercan? Are you okay?

32
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,720
I’m fine… Are you okay?

33
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,720
I'm fine.

34
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,280
I was so scared.

35
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,000
Don’t be. I’m right here.

36
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,360
Shoot them! They mustn't survive.

37
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Stay here and don’t move.

38
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,160
Don't go!

39
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,680
What if something happens to you?

40
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,080
I promise I’ll come back.

42
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,840
Fire!

43
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,000
What's wrong? Did you run out of bullets?

44
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,120
Fire, damn it!

45
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,200
That gun won’t go back down until it fires.

46
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
Come on, if you’re so tough, pull the trigger!

47
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,360
That’ll happen too, don’t worry.

48
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
-You okay? -Never better.

49
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,480
Ateş!

50
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,920
Thank God, you're safe.

51
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,120
Thank God.

52
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,600
Are you alright?

53
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,640
We're fine. I told you to wait for me there.

54
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
Don't worry, I'm right here.

55
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,120
You heard Ateş. He’s fine. Call off your men already!

56
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,800
Not until I see them walk in safe and sound!

57
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,160
Have you lost your mind?

58
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,000
Is this a war zone?

59
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,520
What are all these armed men doing at our house?

60
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,000
This has gone way too far!

61
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,160
Mother!

62
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,440
Son!

63
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,720
Ateş!

64
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,240
What happened to you?

65
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,160
Don’t worry, nothing serious. We’re fine.

66
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Son, what's all this blood?

67
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,480
If you’re hiding something from me...

68
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,920
I said it’s nothing, Mother Müzeyyen. I'm fine.

69
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
Cemal!

70
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,040
You just won’t die, will you?

71
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,240
Cemal? What happened to you?

72
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,720
Cemal?

73
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,120
I'm fine. Nothing to worry about.

74
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
You should’ve seen the other guys.

75
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,080
Cemal?

76
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,960
Dad!

77
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm alright.

78
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,640
Enough already!

79
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,040
What did my father ever do? What is all this about?”

80
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
You can all leave now.

81
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,720
Your bullying is getting old, Mrs. Müzeyyen!

82
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,360
Cemal and Ateş are my sons!

83
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
If a single hair on their heads is harmed,

84
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,920
I’ll make whoever’s responsible pay for it.

85
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,040
Believe me, Haydar, I’d slit your throat in your sleep

86
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,880
and you wouldn’t even know what hit you!

87
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,640
Mother Müzeyyen, enough. This isn’t the time.

88
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
What does any of this have to do with my father?

89
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,000
Don’t you ever raise your voice at me again!

90
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,240
Watch your tone! Who do you think you’re talking to?

91
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,800
Every mess traces back to your father!

92
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,800
Who else would do something like this?

93
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,000
You just love pouring fuel on the fire, don’t you?

94
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,960
With this many armed men, you must have plenty of enemies.

95
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,160
Go look for your culprit somewhere else!

96
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,040
Enough!

97
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,000
I don’t want another word from anyone.

98
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,480
Go to your room.

99
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,240
Let's just go.

100
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,040
You two, wait for me in the study.

101
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,880
I’ll change and come down.

102
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,680
We'll have a talk.

103
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,240
Let's go, dear.

104
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,320
Our action never ends.

105
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
It really doesn’t. You need rest too.

106
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,720
I’m fine. Fresh as ever.

107
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,080
If it weren’t for Mercan, I wouldn’t have found you.

108
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,160
I never even considered something bad might’ve happened to you…

109
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,240
Thanks to Mercan. She turned the whole place upside down.

110
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,840
I should’ve been more careful.

111
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,120
Don’t ever blame yourself.

112
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,280
I’m the one who should’ve been more careful.

113
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
I should’ve known Nezir was planning something.

114
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,960
Are you sure it was him?

115
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,960
He didn’t show himself, but I’m sure. He was there.

116
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,280
Thought he could teach me a lesson.

117
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,240
There are only a few people who could pull something like this.

118
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,800
One is Nezir, the other is right under our noses.

119
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,680
Thank God they’re incompetent.

120
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,160
Remind me to scold Mercan later.

121
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,160
She found you before I did.

122
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,160
She didn’t just find me…

123
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
You won’t believe what I’m about to tell you.

124
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,520
She fights well.

125
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
Who? Mercan?

126
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,240
No way. I don’t believe it.

127
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,480
Believe it.

128
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,600
You’d almost feel sorry for the guys.

129
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,760
Sounds like she’s worried about you.

130
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,440
I was surprised too, you know.

131
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,520
See you later.

132
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,800
I’ve been looking for that envelope.

133
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Shopping receipts…

134
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,320
Um, Malik, I…

135
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,600
Hello?

136
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,440
I still couldn’t say it.

137
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,600
Maybe I should just tell him I love him when I give him the scarf?

138
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,960
See you.

139
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,920
May it be easy, sister.

140
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
Things got messy again.

141
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,520
They’re fine, thank God. They’ll handle the rest.

142
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,920
I hope this is the last of it.

143
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,120
May this house finally see some peace.

144
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,280
Are you making the salad?

145
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,640
Thank the Lord. They made it back unharmed.

146
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,120
Çiçek, let’s start preparing dinner

147
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,280
and set a beautiful table for tonight.

148
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,000
I already started chopping the vegetables to make it easier for you.

149
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,200
My thoughtful, hardworking girl.

150
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,360
Well, actually...

151
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,040
I want to cook for you tonight.

152
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,240
-Oh? -Dishes from my home country…

153
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,360
With your permission, of course, Binnaz Teyze.

154
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,040
You? Cook? Do you even know how?

155
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,480
Yes. And I cook very well.

156
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,720
If I cooked, I’d probably poison you.

157
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,800
Alright, son. If you want to… go ahead.

158
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,440
Honestly, it’ll be a nice change, don’t you think, kids?

159
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,680
Great, then.

160
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,240
What are you going to cook? Something like…

161
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,800
…Egyptian dishes?

162
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,440
–Falafel, hummus... –So you’re quite the chef, huh?

163
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I made a vow for Ateş.

164
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,280
Give this money to people who need it.

165
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,960
Don’t worry, Mrs. Müzeyyen, we’ll take care of it.

166
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Whoa, there’s quite a bit of money here.

167
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,560
We can help a lot of people.

168
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,680
Let me see, Mom.

169
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,320
Whoa, there’s a lot in here.

170
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,680
Should we buy food supplies and distribute them?

171
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,320
Let’s put some pay‑it‑forward bread on the rack for people in need.

172
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,480
We’d be feeding so many people in need.

173
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,200
What’s a greater need than that?

174
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,880
So many families would benefit.

175
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,080
True.

176
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,680
Let's do that.

177
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,880
You're right, Mom.

178
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,920
Whatever you say, Mom.

179
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,800
Let's do that.

180
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,920
So, you're gonna prepare dinner, ha?

181
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,320
Whoa, my bro.

182
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,720
I hate sitting here doing nothing…

183
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,040
And still no news.

184
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,920
Should we call again?

185
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,280
Yaşar, any news?

186
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,480
They made it. Thank God, they’re both fine.

187
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
What?! Oh!

188
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,800
Oh thank God! Finally.

189
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,720
I have to share this good news with the whole company.

190
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,800
They're free. They're free!

191
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,040
Ateş and Mercan are free. They're free. They're free.

192
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,760
Ateş and Mercan are free.

193
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,440
They're free.

194
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,920
-They're free. -They're free.

195
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,440
We're so glad.

196
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,240
Thankfully, they're free.

197
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,720
I don’t understand your attitude.

198
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,600
And why is Mrs. Müzeyyen so full of hatred? I don't get it.

199
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,960
You don’t approve of what she did, right?

200
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,840
Though expecting that might be naive of me.

201
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,080
Mother Müzeyyen… She’s acting on maternal instinct.

202
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,160
And she’s not entirely wrong.

203
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,640
Why would my father do something like that?

204
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,440
You blame us before even understanding what happened!

205
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
Not you…

206
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
your father.

207
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,120
So you think he did it too?

208
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,240
I’m considering a lot of possibilities right now.

209
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,840
Whoever did this will answer for it.

210
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,400
Your father or someone else.

211
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,320
Anything could’ve happened out there.

212
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,080
Something could’ve happened to you! You could’ve been hurt.

213
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,880
Look. I’m not in the mood to argue.

214
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,760
You're exhausted. Rest for a while.

215
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,120
It’s your wound, isn’t it? Let me help.

216
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,560
Does it hurt too much?

217
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,720
No.

218
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,560
Cemal said you turned the whole place upside down for me?

219
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,520
Anyone who knows you even a little knows you keep your promises.

220
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,520
Why didn’t you say you were shot in front of everyone?

221
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,400
No need. It’s nothing.

222
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,000
We need to tend the wound.

223
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,960
I’ll handle it…

224
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,920
It’s just a scratch.

225
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,600
Why won’t you rest?

226
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,120
You’re exhausted. And you’re hurt.

227
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,520
I said I’m fine…

228
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,840
Besides...

229
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,720
you’re the one who must be tired.

230
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,040
Beating up all those men would exhaust anyone.

231
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,480
Anything could've happened there.

232
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,560
Something could’ve happened to you! You could’ve been hurt.

233
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,960
What the hell are you doing here, huh?

234
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,800
You botched the job and now you show up in front of me?

235
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,200
If it weren’t for Mercan, it would’ve been done.

236
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,120
I couldn’t hurt her.

237
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,000
No one told you to hurt her! You misunderstood everything.

238
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,400
You were supposed to save Mercan and wipe Ateş out!

239
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,400
-What happened to the men? -They ran.

240
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,400
I’ll deal with every one of them.

241
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Useless idiots ruined everything.

242
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,360
You messed it all up! Now they’re suspicious of me.

243
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,800
Ateş knows it was me.

244
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,640
Even blindfolded, he sensed I was there.

245
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,920
We need to clean this up.

246
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,560
Mercan must never find out I was involved.

247
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,040
Or I’ll lose her completely.

248
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,800
Ateş will be gone one day.

249
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,800
Then you’ll need me again.

250
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,720
It’s in no one’s interest for things between Mercan and me to fall apart.

251
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,080
Haydar… She can’t know I’m mixed up in this.

252
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,320
If Ateş keeps pushing, you’ll have to take the blame.

253
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,920
Sorry, Nezir, but I’m not throwing myself into the fire for nothing.

254
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,400
I need something in return.

255
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,320
What if I give you a good reason…

256
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,880
Like what?

257
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,880
I know you won’t lift a finger unless there’s something in it for you…

258
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,320
Take the blame, and I’ll pay you back.

259
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,120
How dare they?

260
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,920
You two almost lost your lives!

261
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,160
They thought they were sending a message.

262
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,000
If we don’t make them pay for this, it’ll only get worse.

263
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,680
We don’t have any more lives to hand over to these people!

264
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,200
Nezir was behind this too.

265
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,280
So they did it together?

266
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,480
Has there ever been evil without Haydar?

267
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,480
Wherever there’s filth, he’s always involved!

268
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,000
And we live under the same roof with these people.

269
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,320
You never know what they’ll do next.

270
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,160
Aslı’s right.

271
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,920
We can’t let this go.

272
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,640
Otherwise they’ll dare to do far worse.

273
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,640
I’m not letting it go.

274
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,680
Stay here.

275
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,920
Ateş...

276
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,720
Cemal! Keep them here.

277
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,680
Glad you survived.

278
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,400
You look pretty beaten up.

279
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,800
I know what you did.

280
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,280
And you know I know.

281
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,040
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

282
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,280
Beating someone while their hands and eyes are tied… that’s very you.

283
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,520
I told you that back there too, remember?

284
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,840
Still don’t know what you mean.

285
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,400
But maybe it is fun, especially if it’s someone you hate.

286
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,000
Sure.

287
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,680
Cowards enjoy that kind of thing.

288
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,040
Shame you don’t have the courage to match it.

289
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,760
Nezir!

290
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,720
What's going on here?

291
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,040
You’ll pay for this.

292
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,400
Count on it.

293
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,800
-Come on. -What’s happening?

294
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,840
What are you doing?

295
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,600
No, I really don’t understand.

296
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,720
Why were you arguing?

297
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,760
Nezir was the one who had me taken.

298
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,720
First my father, now Nezir?

299
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,440
Why are you always looking for the culprit here?

300
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,480
How do you know it wasn’t someone else?

301
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,360
In business, people have plenty of enemies.

302
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,800
I don’t!

303
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,280
But you always blame them for everything.

304
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,200
Without even thinking.

305
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,480
I’m already on edge.

306
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,200
Don’t defend Nezir to me.

307
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,240
I’m not defending anyone.

308
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,920
I’m saying don’t judge without being sure.

309
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,720
This has happened before. How many more times will it happen?

310
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,400
He did it. Nezir was in that cabin, I know it.

311
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,520
You said you didn’t see him.

312
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,680
I didn't.

313
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,360
I didn’t need to.

314
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,880
I could smell his stench.

315
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,960
And if I know Haydar even a little,

316
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,360
he’s involved too.

317
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,960
Nothing I say matters, does it?

318
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,720
This will never end.

319
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,240
I’m really exhausted.

320
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,760
Look.

321
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,440
I don’t want to argue with you.

322
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,440
Because, when it comes to Haydar, neither of us can be objective.

323
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,120
I don’t want tension with you.

324
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,960
At least, not today.

325
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,400
-Well, our stomachs... -I'm hungry, though.

326
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,160
- We’ll find something to eat, son. - There must be something around.

327
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,680
Whoa...

328
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,160
Welcome.

329
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

330
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,400
Malik, my son, you’re more talented than I thought…

331
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,680
You never said you could cook.

332
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,080
It looks wonderful.

333
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,280
Wow, my bro.

334
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,640
Malik, I knew you were capable, but I didn’t expect this.

335
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,200
I prepared a few.

336
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
A few?

337
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,520
Come on, sit, then. Before the food gets cold.

338
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,960
Now, let me explain...

339
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,120
This is molokhia soup.

340
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,960
One of our most famous.

341
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,800
It’s made with green leaves.

342
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,560
I added a bit of broth too.

343
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,960
This is hummus…

344
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,040
made with chickpeas.

345
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,360
I decorated it with some parsley.

346
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,480
And this is falafel…

347
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,160
our national dish.

348
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,640
Lebanese make it with chickpeas, but we make it with fava beans.

349
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,680
Um, and this is koshari…

350
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,560
-Koshari. -Um, yes, with chickpeas,

351
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,240
tomato sauce on top, and lots of fried onions.

352
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,560
And for dessert, I made basbousa...

353
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,280
with semolina and syrup.

354
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,520
Alright then, Malik. You fed our eyes,

355
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,240
now feed our stomachs. I’m digging in, huh?

356
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,000
Well then, enjoy.

357
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,000
-Let me help. -Please.

358
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,760
Tonight, I’m serving. Please.

359
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,680
Let me serve your soup.

360
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,800
Excuse me.

361
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,800
-Slow down. -But I'm hungry.

362
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,480
He cooked all this.

363
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,200
-It smells great. -Smells wonderful.

364
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,720
Whoa, this is really green.

365
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,360
Like she’s worried about you.

366
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,440
How are you feeling, Cemal?

367
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,400
Better.

368
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,840
I was fine anyway.

369
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Mercan really surprised me.

370
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,640
She was incredibly brave.

371
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,880
You're telling me?

372
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,600
I was surprised too when I saw her in that warehouse.

373
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,400
And the way she stood up to everyone.

374
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,960
Well, that’s the kind of wife who suits Ateş Karahan, right?

375
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,720
Mr. and Mrs. Karahan.

376
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,520
The couple of the year.

377
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,400
Don’t look at me like that.

378
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,560
She is your wife. That’s all I’m saying.

379
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,960
I owe her my life.

380
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,520
You know I hate being in anyone’s debt.

381
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,200
And she’s been through a lot lately.

382
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,480
I should do something to lift her spirits…

383
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,960
but what?

384
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,440
Come on. We'll find a way.

385
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,800
Did you like it?

386
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,400
Like it? That’s an understatement!

387
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,400
I’m telling you, I could dance the "horon!"

388
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,160
Like it? Everything was delicious.

389
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,000
Let me tell you. Whoever marries you is lucky.

390
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,600
Oh, yeah.

391
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,040
Well, um.

392
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,720
In a city I knew nothing about,

393
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,600
I never once felt like a stranger because of you.

394
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,480
I always felt safe… like I was with my own family.

395
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,360
Thank you for being by my side all this time.

396
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,320
Additionally, I feel very lucky

397
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,040
to have gotten to know you.

398
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,520
Sounds like you’re saying goodbye, son. Are you going somewhere, Malik?

399
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,000
Are you?

400
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,560
Is there something we don’t know, bro?

401
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,920
Nothing… nothing, Binnaz Teyze. I just...

402
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,480
felt like saying it.

403
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,040
Who knows what tomorrow brings?

404
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
Of course. Of course. That's life.

405
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,680
Çiçek...

406
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,800
We're done with the meal. The tea is on you.

407
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,360
Make us a bright red tea for us.

408
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,680
Then we'll dig into this dessert.

409
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,960
-Oh, my man. -But the dessert is the best.

410
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,400
Alright.

411
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,960
Man, it looks great.

412
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,400
Yeah, I’ve had my eye on it.

413
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,800
So have I. Dessert hits the spot between meals.

414
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,080
Cemal… Why didn’t you tell me?

415
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,000
I didn’t want to bother anyone.

416
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,520
Don’t be ridiculous.

417
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,480
How did this happen?

418
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,040
Gun handle. They attacked from behind.

419
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,160
You didn’t have to. I could’ve handled it.

420
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,280
Come on. Turn your back.

421
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,920
You didn’t look like you were handling anything when I walked in.

422
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,040
And let me know when you need to change the bandage, okay?

423
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,600
You don't have to manage it yourself.

424
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,920
You don’t have eyes in the back of your head, Cemal.

425
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,680
I’m so relieved you both made it out alive.

426
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,240
If you hadn’t arrived in time,

427
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,040
Ateş might not be here now.

428
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,400
The thought alone is terrifying…

429
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,960
I’d probably lose my mind.

430
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,880
Don't worry. I’d never let anything happen to Ateş.

431
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,200
Thanks for the bandage. Good night.

432
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,760
Mercan really surprised me.

433
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,800
She was so brave.

434
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,960
No.

435
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,480
No.

436
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,880
-No. -It’s okay, it’s over.

437
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,200
Just a nightmare…

438
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,240
No need to be scared.

439
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,080
Do you hear me?

440
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,040
Wake up. See, I’m right here.

441
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,280
No, no. No!

442
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,360
We were jumping off the cliff…

443
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,240
You were falling.

444
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,400
I reached for you but I couldn’t catch you.

445
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,480
It was awful. What if something had happened to you?

446
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,840
Would you have been upset?

447
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
What am I doing?

448
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:19,600
I’m sorry. It was just a nightmare.

449
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,480
She’s so innocent…

450
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,320
Don’t look at me like that.

451
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,880
Don't look so that I won't get lost in your eyes.

452
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,120
Nothing to apologize for.

453
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,040
Here… drink.

454
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,360
It's over now. I'm here.

455
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,200
How’s your wound? Does it hurt?

456
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,720
No. Try to sleep…

457
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,720
No need to be scared. You’re safe.

458
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,160
I’m not scared.

459
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,600
Of course you’re not…

460
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,360
fearless princess.

461
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,800
Wild fairy.

462
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,080
Today I’ll tell him everything. How much I love him.

463
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,680
I haven’t posted anything on Instagram in ages…

464
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,760
Oh...

465
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,960
Malik wrote this…

466
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,320
My Çiçek… This city means nothing to me without you…

467
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,000
From the day I opened my heart to you, this place became my home.

468
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,800
But when you cast me out of your heart, you cast me out of my home too.

469
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,880
I’m only a step away from you, yet somehow miles apart.

470
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,800
Not being able to look at you freely, spend time with you,

471
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,280
or feel my love returned hurts more than I can bear.

472
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,840
It’s best if I leave.

473
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,880
I have no other choice.

474
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,960
Your smile in my memory,

475
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,440
and the love I feel for you in my heart, will stay with me always.

476
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,120
Goodbye, my love. Goodbye, my love.

477
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,160
She wore the necklace…

478
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,440
It’s me… Mercan…

479
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,040
I told you before. I won’t take the blame unless there’s something in it for me.

480
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,080
If Ateş is already sure you did it, why should I take the fall?

481
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,040
I wouldn’t give you a dime if I didn’t want to.

482
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,240
But I’m being generous here.

483
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,440
If you accept I can give you a share from the sale of these stones.

484
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,920
I’ve been making good money off this for a long time.

485
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,760
Depends on the share you’re offering.

486
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,640
Look, Haydar...

487
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,080
To me, this is a good deal.

488
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,640
Be smart so we both walk away with profit.

489
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,200
I want that punk Ateş off my back, and I don’t want Mercan suspecting me.

490
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,000
And you want your money.

491
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,120
But if you’re saying “I don’t care about you,” that’s fine…

492
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,440
then whatever happens to you won’t concern me anymore.

493
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,480
I’ll know exactly who’s a friend and who’s an enemy.

494
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,160
And here’s some advice...

495
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,120
don’t be my enemy.

496
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,840
Sorry for waking you last night.

497
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,600
After everything you’ve been through, it’s normal.

498
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,240
And when I suddenly saw you standing over me like that…

499
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,360
It’s fine.

500
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,000
Maybe you should see a doctor.

501
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,840
No need.

502
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,880
You can’t even put your jacket on.

503
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,640
Stop being stubborn and get checked.

504
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,280
Isn’t it exhausting living like this?

505
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,120
What’s that supposed to mean?

506
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,360
There’s always chaos around us. Always tension.

507
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,600
I’m just saying…

508
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,560
maybe if you stayed calmer, others would too.

509
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,280
Especially when it comes to Nezir and my father.

510
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,320
-Yesterday you almost killed Nezir... -Enough!

511
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,680
Neither Nezir nor your father are innocent.

512
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,680
Everyone pays for what they’ve done.

513
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,760
When the time comes, they’ll answer for it.

514
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,840
That’s exactly what I’m talking about.

515
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,760
How far will this go?

516
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,880
As far as it needs to.

517
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,960
There’s no other way.

518
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,680
You’ll understand eventually.

519
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,320
Are you sure?

520
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,480
Alright. Call me the moment you hear anything.

521
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,280
You won’t believe what Nezir’s been up to.

522
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,680
He’s been up to all kinds of things behind our backs.

523
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,400
Turns out he has another business we knew nothing about…

524
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,480
Buying and selling precious stones.

525
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,360
And apparently he’s gotten some very valuable ones from Africa.

526
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,760
Exactly the opportunity we needed…

527
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,920
We’re definitely using this. Don’t let it go.

528
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,680
Ms. Demet.

529
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,480
Will Mr. Ateş and Mrs. Mercan be coming in today?

530
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,440
I don’t know… But I’ll go see Mercan at some point.

531
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:06,400
Have you known Mrs. Mercan for a long time?

532
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,400
Yes… a very long time.

533
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,560
She seems like a good person. I like her a lot.

534
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,480
Also the employees really like her.

535
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,320
They do… Everyone is equal in her eyes.

536
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,800
I’ve never seen her hurt or offend anyone.

537
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,000
Well, I want to ask something.

538
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,960
Um...

539
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,480
I heard her brother passed away recently?

540
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,880
Does she have any other siblings?

541
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,840
Also, how long have she and Mr. Ateş been married?

542
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,400
Why are you so interested in Mercan?

543
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,920
You’re one step away from asking for her family registry.

544
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,840
Oh, no… just curious. I mean…

545
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,040
They seem like a good couple, but trouble keeps finding them…

546
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,640
It caught my attention.

547
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,160
Yeah, Mercan is good…

548
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,240
but I can’t say the same for Ateş.

549
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,120
Um... would you like some tea?

550
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,680
-Yeah. -Okay.

551
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,160
Could we have two glasses of tea, please?

552
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,880
First floor.

553
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,040
Come in.

554
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,720
- If you’re free, we need to talk. - What do you want?

555
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,080
To talk.

556
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,320
I don’t. Get out.

557
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,960
I’m tired of this attitude.

558
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,040
I'm fed up with the tension you and your family keep stirring up!

559
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,960
There are employees in this house. If they start talking, we’ll be disgraced.

560
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,640
The human trafficker Haydar is afraid of being disgraced, huh?

561
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,880
Worried your precious family honor will be tarnished?

562
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,720
Maybe you should’ve thought of that before giving the press something to feast on.

563
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,880
Talk to me properly.

564
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,640
I’ll talk however I want.

565
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,000
Do I look like someone who takes threats seriously

566
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,800
from a man who hides behind his daughter every time he’s in trouble?

567
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,600
You married your daughter off to a stranger for money.

568
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,160
Your son was the same…

569
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,640
always finding someone else to hide behind.

570
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,520
If it weren’t for Mercan, I would’ve gotten rid of you long ago.

571
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,520
You won’t always be this lucky.

572
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,440
Next time, I’ll take your life.

573
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,200
So you’re admitting it?

574
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,880
I already knew you and Nezir were behind it.

575
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,200
Be smart so we both walk away with profit.

576
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,520
That idiot Nezir is useless.

577
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,520
He’s a coward.

578
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,720
I planned everything. I did it.

579
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,960
If Mercan hadn’t shown up…

580
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,760
that woman Müzeyyen would’ve been praying at your grave by now.

581
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,800
I’m not the only one hiding behind Mercan…

582
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,520
Dad, is what I heard true?!

583
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,440
I asked you a question, Dad. Answer me.

584
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,240
Leave us alone.

585
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,840
Please.

586
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,440
You’ll pay for this.

587
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,120
If that’s all you’ve got to say, let me remind you...

588
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,080
you owe me.

589
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,760
And you’re the one who’ll pay.

590
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:27,280
Tell me. Are you really behind this?

591
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,280
Did you plan Ateş’s kidnapping?

592
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,320
Yes. I planned it. I wanted to teach Ateş Karahan a lesson.

593
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,720
What are you even saying? How could you do this?

594
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,600
And you say it like it’s nothing. I can’t believe you.

595
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,600
I’m not ashamed of what I did, Mercan.

596
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,360
Ateş Karahan already deserved it.

597
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,040
Ever since he came into our lives, nothing but trouble followed.

598
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,280
I was taken into custody for something I didn’t do.

599
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,440
And that makes this right?

600
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:03,120
Really? Dad, how could you do this?

601
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,480
You can’t fix one wrong with another.

602
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,360
I wasn’t going to sit back and swallow everything he did.

603
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,920
You can’t blame me for striking back.

604
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,720
I was protecting myself. Protecting my family.

605
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,640
Compared to what he’s done to us, what I did is nothing.

606
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,480
We’re talking about kidnapping and torturing someone.

607
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,720
Dad, there’s no justification for that.

608
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,400
If we answer evil with evil, how are we any different from them?

609
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:35,560
You...

610
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,480
you weren’t this kind of man.

611
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,360
When did you become this?

612
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,960
-Daughter. Dear. -How could you do that?

613
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,760
You're Haydar Yıldırım's daughter. You’re my daughter.

614
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,760
You’re the one who saw everything Ateş Karahan put us through.

615
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,120
You were a victim yourself.

616
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,480
And think about your brother…

617
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,840
Murat...

618
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,240
Didn't he die because of that man?

619
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,560
What about me? Those men shot at us, Dad.

620
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,400
They were going to kill both of us.

621
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,840
No, they only meant to scare you. Not to kill you.

622
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,840
If they wanted you dead, you’d be dead.

623
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,120
But don't worry, they were dealt with.

624
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,840
It never even crossed my mind that you’d go after that man, daughter.

625
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,160
-But when I realized... -I don’t even recognize you anymore.

626
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,760
It’s like there’s a stranger standing in front of me.

627
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,640
You shattered my trust.

628
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,880
Turned it into rubble.

629
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,560
I don’t know who to trust now.

630
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,240
Ateş Karahan.

631
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,640
Ateş Karahan.

632
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,000
You got away this time, again.

633
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,080
I’ll finish what I started. I’ll get rid of you, for good.

634
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,520
If you came to say “I told you so,” don’t bother.

635
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,160
I’m not arguing with you.

636
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,880
I don’t even have the strength.

637
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,520
Yes, you were right. I admit it.

638
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,520
That’s not why I’m here.

639
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,720
I thought you’d never miss a chance like this.

640
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,240
I don’t see it as a chance.

641
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,840
Then why did you come?

642
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,520
I was worried about you.

643
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,960
I’m not okay. Not at all.

644
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,680
I know you’re disappointed.

645
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,920
More than you can imagine.

646
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,840
It feels like a mountain I trusted collapsed on top of me.

647
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,680
I don’t know how to get back up.

648
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,080
You will.

649
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,240
Why are you looking at me like that?

650
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,000
I thought you’d be yelling… rubbing it in my face.

651
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,160
What are you going to do?

652
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,520
About what?

653
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,160
My father.

654
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,560
If I know you at all, you won’t let what he did go unanswered.

655
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:30,200
What happened? You’re fuming again.

656
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,240
Mercan knows I was behind Ateş’s kidnapping.

657
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,360
She knows? How?

658
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,880
She overheard me talking to Ateş about Nezir.

659
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,440
It’s bad. She got furious.

660
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,240
Nothing I said helped.

661
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,680
I hope she doesn’t take Ateş’s side against us.

662
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,760
Nermin. It’s Mercan.

663
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:01,280
I wouldn’t be surprised. Her sense of justice never fails.

664
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,120
No, I don’t think she’d do that to you.

665
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,320
When it comes to you, you know how sensitive she's.

666
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:15,360
Don't worry. She knows everything you’ve done for her.

667
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:19,200
But it's obvious we couldn’t protect her after Murat’s debts.

668
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,240
And now this.

669
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,160
No.

670
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,120
Mercan is Haydar Yıldırım's daughter.

671
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,880
I can’t let her stand with Ateş against me.

672
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,760
If you want, I can talk to her.

673
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,400
Not now. She’s still too angry.

674
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,480
Maybe later on.

675
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,280
Alright.

676
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,280
How am I supposed to deal with this disappointment?

677
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,200
Everything feels shattered.

678
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:11,120
Everything I believed in… broken.

679
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:17,320
And I don’t know how to put the pieces back together.

680
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,440
Every time,

681
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,720
it leaves more cracks… and deeper wounds.

682
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,720
You’ll find a way.

683
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,200
You have to.

684
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,200
Do you know what I realized today?

685
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,080
What?

686
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,160
I miss the past.

687
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,040
I miss the innocence of my childhood.

688
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,760
Back then, I’d run to my father for strength.

689
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,400
I thought he’d burn the world for me.

690
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,520
And he would. He was so full of love.

691
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,360
Who are you hitting?

692
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,640
Didn't I tell you not to do that again?

693
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,440
Didn't I tell you to stay away from Murat?

694
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,000
He did everything to make me smile.

695
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,680
He stayed by my side through my illness.

696
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,280
I couldn’t go out much,

697
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,600
so he brought the outside world to me.

698
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,280
If you only knew how heartless that man really is.

699
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:11,120
Once, because I couldn’t go to the cinema,

700
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,240
he even brought the movie home.

701
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,360
He’d set up a little open‑air cinema just for me.

702
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,600
But halfway through the film,

703
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,760
they rushed me to the hospital.

704
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,840
Do you see it?

705
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,720
Yes. But you can’t watch.

706
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,080
It’s okay. I’ll watch it later.

707
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:16,360
But halfway through, they rushed me to the hospital.

708
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,560
-Mercan? -Mercan, open your eyes.

709
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,880
She’s not waking up.

710
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,440
- Let's get her to the hospital. - What happened to Mercan?

711
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,720
-Stop the movie. -She fainted.

712
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,880
I never got to watch that movie again.

713
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,360
And now…

714
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,960
looking back from today, I keep thinking how beautiful those days were.

715
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,280
I wish I could go back to my childhood.

716
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,360
How worried I was about you that day.

717
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:08,320
To the days when everyone and everything felt innocent…

718
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,360
or at least looked that way.

719
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,640
Ms. Zahide?

720
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,120
I’m calling to remind you of your 3 p.m. meeting.

721
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,800
The architects and engineers

722
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,320
will brief you on the construction project.

723
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,840
I’ll be there.

724
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,920
Alright, Mr. Ateş. See you then.

725
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,000
I’m going to the company.

726
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,160
In that condition? You haven’t even rested.

727
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,920
No. You can't go.

728
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,320
Whoa...

729
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,880
I see you’ve switched to giving orders, Mrs. Mercan.

730
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,840
Very fitting for a Karahan.

731
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,720
I’m saying it for your own good.

732
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,640
I’m going. It’s nothing serious anyway.

733
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,040
Then I’m coming too.

734
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,240
Someone has to keep an eye on you.

735
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,000
-No... -No objections. Period.

736
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,840
I don’t need a babysitter.

737
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,320
You do, and I’m coming.

738
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,240
Working will be good for me too. It’ll clear my head.

739
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,880
Go on, then. We're going.

740
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,000
"Go on" huh?

741
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,400
Yes. Go on!

742
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,360
Move.

743
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,600
You’re going to do what I say.

744
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,960
You’re not going to defy me today. Okay?

745
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,400
What else?

746
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,600
You’ll take care of yourself. You’re sick.

747
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,440
Though I’ll handle that part anyway.

748
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,280
I won’t let you take Ateş from me!

749
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,880
I’ll get rid of you forever, Mercan!

750
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,600
And Ateş will be mine!

751
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,560
Ms. Demet, I'm going to make you the perfect coffee.

752
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,840
-Oh, really? -Yes.

753
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,440
Let's see.

754
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:50,880
How did you know I take my coffee with one sugar?

755
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,960
Me? Uh…

756
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,440
I saw you getting coffee a few times.

757
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,160
Strong memory, huh?

758
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,880
Yeah. That’s what they say.

759
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:15,880
Break time’s over, Mr. Burak. The files are waiting.

760
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,480
Mr. Ateş Bey will be here soon. Come on.

761
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:22,840
Don’t suffocate Burak, Ms. Zahide. Let him breathe a little.

762
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,160
Maybe you should breathe a little too. You work too much.

763
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,560
You’ll age early.

764
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:36,640
Someone has to work in a place full of loafers, Mr. Yaşar.

765
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:42,560
And whether I age early or late is my business.

766
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:46,480
I’m just saying… don’t waste time on skincare.

767
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,000
For your own good.

768
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,720
Patience.

769
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:55,840
Instead of following me around, maybe focus on your own job.

770
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,800
Don't waste your time. I’m saying it for your own good.

771
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,960
Here. Your coffee is ready.

772
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,800
Ms. Demet. Please.

773
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,120
Let's take our coffee and get back to work.

774
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,160
I was about to go too.

775
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,880
What do you mean I’m always following you?

776
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:24,160
Yes. Every time I look up, your eyes are on me. I'm aware.

777
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,200
Oh, Lord. What does that even mean?

778
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,440
Am I following her?

779
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,640
No.

780
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,520
He’s gone.

781
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,800
Everything’s over.

782
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,680
I’m done too.

783
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:17,440
Malik! Oh my God… am I dreaming?!

784
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,200
-Malik! -Çiçek?

785
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,080
You’re really here.

786
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,400
I thought you left.

787
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,440
I thought you threw the necklace away.

788
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,880
How could you think that?

789
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,760
That necklace means so much to me.

790
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,040
I was devastated thinking you left.

791
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,600
Thank God you didn’t leave.

792
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:10,200
Malik. Where have you been, man?

793
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,920
I’ve been looking for you all morning.

794
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,600
I’ve got a bit of work. Come on, help me.

795
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,120
-Going somewhere? -Well, no...

796
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,120
I was…

797
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,200
but I changed my mind. -Oh...

798
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,120
Good then.

799
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,360
Let's finish the work, then we can relax.

800
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,440
I promise I'll make you tea, myself.

801
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,880
-Come on. -Okay, you go ahead.

802
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,640
Let me drop my suitcase and come.

803
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,600
-Fine. I'll be waiting. -Okay.

804
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,800
Don't leave.

805
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,480
Welcome. Glad you're safe.

806
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,440
Thank you.

807
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,440
Welcome, Mrs. Mercan. I’m glad you’re okay.

808
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,040
Thank you, Yaşar.

809
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:41,440
Mr. Ateş, thank goodness. You scared us. You're here safe and sound.

810
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,520
Thank you.

811
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,720
Glad you’re fine. Are you?

812
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,040
We're fine. Thank you.

813
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,560
Thank goodness. You both look fine.

814
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,480
Thank you.

815
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,080
It's great to see you among us again, Mrs. Mercan.

816
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,680
My dear friend…

817
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,480
I was so scared something would happen to you.

818
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,160
I’m standing right here. Safe and sound.

819
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,320
Mercan! I’m so happy to see you well.

820
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,560
I'm so glad. We didn’t get to talk yesterday.

821
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,800
Now that I’ve seen you, I'm relieved.

822
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,560
I worried so much.

823
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,800
Who knows what you went through… how scared you must’ve been.

824
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,160
Stay calm, bro.

825
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,280
It wasn’t easy.

826
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,320
But it’s over.

827
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,600
We made a good team and got out together.

828
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,440
Let’s drop that unpleasant subject now.

829
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,280
Okay, you're right.

830
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,560
I didn’t mean to upset you.

831
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,040
I just hope whoever did this to you suffers worse.

832
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,600
He will. Don't worry.

833
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:50,960
Until then, he should enjoy his comfort.

834
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,800
After that… well, you know.

835
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,080
I’ll go to my office.

836
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,720
There's little time left before the meeting.

837
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,800
My office.

838
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,680
We’ll prepare together.

839
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,600
Come in.

840
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,520
Come over, Zehra dear.

841
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,720
Enjoy it, Mrs. Nermin.

842
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:47,280
Mmm, perfect. The coffee is exactly how I like it.

843
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,520
You have a good hand, dear.

844
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,600
I can tell from your coffee.

845
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,280
The sugar, the strength… just right.

846
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,240
I’m glad you liked it.

847
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:02,840
So... It’s been quiet. How’s everyone in the house?

848
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,800
Mrs. Müzeyyen is in her room. Ms. Aslı went out.

849
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,720
So everything’s peaceful?

850
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,200
For now.

851
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,360
If anything unusual happens, you’ll let me know, right?

852
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,240
Of course, Mrs. Nermin.

853
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,560
Let me get back to work before I upset Mrs. Müzeyyen.

854
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:27,120
Wait, dear. Wait for a second.

855
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,640
These are my diamond earrings.

856
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,480
I’ve worn them so much I’m bored of them.

857
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,120
If you want, they’re yours.

858
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,080
I cannot accept these, Mrs. Nermin.

859
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,800
These are very valuable.

860
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,760
Don’t hesitate. Take them.

861
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:09,040
Consider it a small gift… for our friendship and cooperation. Huh?

862
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,320
-Thank you very much. -You’re welcome.

863
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:21,440
I knew we’d get along well.

864
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,720
They'll suit you so well.

865
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,080
Look, I brought it.

866
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,280
Don’t you think the window placement in these rooms is a little strange?

867
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:48,000
I told them but they forgot to move them to this side.

868
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,440
I’ll remind them again.

869
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,840
Looks like I’ll have to tell them again.

870
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,040
Yeah, I thought so too.

871
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:23,520
Okay, I'll talk to Yaşar so he gets them redone.

872
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,000
Alright. Thank you.

873
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,360
Where are you going, Mercan? I asked them to bring you some tea.

874
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,840
-Really? -Please, Sir.

875
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,800
-Thank you. -Enjoy it.

876
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,640
Whoa, Dursun Amca. Welcome.

877
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,680
Nice to see you.

878
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:43,520
Brought tea, huh?

879
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,280
-Enjoy it. -Thanks.

880
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,640
Oh wow, look at that color. Perfect. Bless your hands.

881
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,640
-Enjoy it, Mr. Cemal. -Thanks.

882
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,280
You did the right thing staying calm in front of Nezir.

883
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,280
He’s really pushing his luck though.

884
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,080
The man’s relaxed

885
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,800
because he dumped all the blame on Haydar.

886
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,200
And how Haydar accepted it… unbelievable.

887
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,720
They were caught red-handed, that’s why.

888
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,320
But the price will be heavy.

889
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,280
What are you thinking?

890
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,560
Turning Haydar and Nezir against each other.

891
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,200
Divide and weaken. We like that.

892
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,840
-Any news on the stones? -Not yet.

893
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,480
We’re on them though.

894
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,120
We’re even counting every breath they take. We’ll know soon.

895
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,400
Good.

896
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,200
How did Mercan react

897
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,720
when she learned her father was behind all this?

898
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:50,760
Naturally, she was furious. And hurt.

899
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,880
She faced the truth about her father.

900
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,680
But she didn’t stay silent in the face of injustice.

901
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:04,760
-She stood up to him. -Whoa, good for her.

902
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,520
She surprised me too.

903
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,640
I wasn't expecting this much.

904
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,040
She’s a fair girl.

905
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:17,680
Yesterday...

906
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,520
she told me about a cartoon movie we watched in our childhood.

907
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,840
I remember it like it was yesterday.

908
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,000
Not the best memories, I guess.

909
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,200
They're not.

910
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,080
I’m thinking we should create a setup

911
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,080
where she can watch it like she’s in a cinema.

912
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,240
She’s been through a lot.

913
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,280
Maybe it’ll help clear her mind a little.

914
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,640
You sound fine, but don't mention it out loud.

915
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,880
If Mother Müzeyyen and Aslı hear that, things might get messy.

916
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,520
Might?

917
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,240
Right. I was a bit generous. It’ll get very messy.

918
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,440
She risked her life for me.

919
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,240
This is just a small gesture in return.

920
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:15,280
Of course, just a tiny gesture.

921
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:18,040
I’m sure there’s no other reason.

922
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:23,320
-Are you implying something? -No, I'm not.

923
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,360
What could I possibly be implying, Ateş? You're breaking my heart.

924
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,120
Can we talk?

925
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,680
I was just leaving. What is it?

926
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,440
What’s with that face?

927
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,480
Cheer up already.

928
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,400
You’ll get your money. I’m waiting to hear from the buyer.

929
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,280
The babies are sleeping soundly in the safe.

930
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,040
That’s exactly why I’m here.

931
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:07,000
We need to revise the deal.

932
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,040
What?

933
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,520
I want half.

934
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,480
What's that supposed to mean?

935
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:19,120
If you don’t give me what I want, there’s no deal.

936
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,920
I’m the one who got burned in this.

937
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:26,480
When Mercan found out, she took Ateş’s side against me.

938
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,000
Because of that man,

939
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:31,480
Haydar Yıldırım’s daughter stood against her own father.

940
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,960
There will be a price for that.

941
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,160
So I want the profit fifty fifty.

942
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,160
You’re being slippery, Haydar Yıldırım.

943
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,360
This isn’t being slippery.

944
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,360
I’m just asking for what’s mine.

945
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,240
Fine. Suit yourself.

946
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,680
I’ve got nothing left to lose.

947
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:58,360
When Mercan learns you’re responsible for what she went through,

948
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,920
don’t cry after her.

949
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,440
And don’t hold back either.

950
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,360
Nezir Effendi.

951
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,880
Wait!

952
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:12,680
Fine. Have it your way. We’ll split the money fifty fifty.

953
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,520
But you’re not using this against me ever again.

954
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,400
Otherwise, what comes next won’t be pleasant for you.

955
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,920
Deal.

956
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:49,960
Mercan.

957
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,960
What’s wrong? Why do you look so upset?

958
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,960
I learned something awful, Demet…

959
01:40:58,440 --> 01:40:59,760
What happened, Mercan?

960
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:06,200
- Ateş was kidnapped by my father’s men. - What?!

961
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,720
He admitted it himself.

962
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,160
I can’t believe it. Really?

963
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:17,840
But you could’ve been hurt too, Mercan.

964
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,560
How could Haydar Amca do something like that?

965
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,200
I wasn’t supposed to be there.

966
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,240
I can’t believe this.

967
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,600
Neither can I.

968
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:32,360
It’s terrifying not being able to trust one's own family.

969
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,640
And Ateş blamed my brother for nothing.

970
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,400
My brother told me. They argued again for no reason.

971
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,600
Can you imagine him?

972
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,320
I mean my brother.

973
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:49,000
He put both you and him through so much.

974
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,440
Be careful, Mercan. That man isn’t normal.

975
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:59,520
Actually… he’s changed a little.

976
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,200
The way he treats me… I don’t know...

977
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:07,000
he’s very protective. Like he’s someone else.

978
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,320
Ateş?

979
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,720
He’s not as harsh as before.

980
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:16,960
He’s somewhat nicer. He treats me nicer.

981
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,720
Well... nicer.

982
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,680
Are you sure we're talking about the same person?

983
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,840
His anger seems to have cooled.

984
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:29,600
It’s not a radical change.

985
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,800
Let's say he's more like the lesser evil.

986
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,400
He looks at me differently.

987
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,520
I can’t tell if the real person inside is coming out,

988
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,440
or if it’s just another one of his games.

989
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,000
Come on, man… I gather them, and they just blow away.

990
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,120
Patience...

991
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,160
Our Robin Hood still hasn’t shown up.

992
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,680
God bless him, he paid off the debt,

993
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:32,000
but still… I wonder who he is.

994
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,360
Ugh. I’m exhausted.

995
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,840
I swear I'm tired.

996
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:41,120
Berat!

997
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,040
I brought you tea. Come on, take a break before it gets cold.

998
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,760
Thank you, Zehra. You shouldn’t have.

999
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:54,360
Don’t be silly. Enjoy it.

1000
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:01,120
I really feel bad for you. You’ve been working nonstop since morning.

1001
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,480
Isn’t it too much for you?

1002
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,760
What can you do? Gotta earn a living.

1003
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,320
The garden’s big. Obviously, it tires you out.

1004
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,760
Good thing you’re strong.

1005
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,120
Praise be! You’re strong as a lion.

1006
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:21,240
No one else could handle this much work.

1007
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,360
-Really? -Really.

1008
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,760
Without you, the garden would turn into a desert.

1009
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:29,520
Of course, it'll turn into a desert.

1010
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:34,000
Anyway, I’ll leave you to it. The mansion work is waiting.

1011
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,000
Turkish delight?

1012
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:38,760
Let me take one.

1013
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,120
-Thank you. -Enjoy it.

1014
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,480
-May it be easy. -You, too. Thanks.

1015
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,040
Of course.

1016
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,360
If it weren’t for me, this garden would turn into a desert… a desert.

1017
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,120
Oh, Berat… oh, Berat.

1018
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,920
Good job.

1019
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:03,720
Come in.

1020
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:10,040
You need to sign these documents, Mr. Ateş.

1021
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,080
We reviewed these before, didn’t we, Ms. Zahide?

1022
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:24,440
Yes. I made the necessary corrections based on your notes.

1023
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,080
Okay.

1024
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,960
-Here. -Thank you.

1025
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,240
We got a message from our guy.

1026
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,040
The stones are in Nezir’s office.

1027
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:49,880
Let me go get a nice surprise ready for them.

1028
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:51,640
Good.

1029
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,480
-Be careful. -Come on.

1030
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,680
I’m always careful.

1031
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,240
Okay, maybe I slipped up a little in that last mess…

1032
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,720
But my average is still high.

1033
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,840
I’ll get back to a solid five out of five.

1034
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,400
You will.

1035
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,000
My stomach’s growling though.

1036
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:10,840
We’ll get a big lahmacun with sumac… huh?

1037
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,800
-What do you say?

1038
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:17,200
The way you’re describing it… who could say no to a menu like that?

1039
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,320
But don't forget to buy spicy şalgam.

1040
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,120
Good reminder. Can’t have it without şalgam.

1041
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,480
Order extra.

1042
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,400
For Mercan?

1043
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:15,360
Oh wow. What’s all this?

1044
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,040
Lahmacun.

1045
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,120
Really? I had no idea.

1046
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,440
I live on the moon, remember?

1047
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,440
It looks amazing.

1048
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,200
-I’ll get a fork and knife. -Stop.

1049
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,400
You really do live on the moon. What are you doing?

1050
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,480
What am I doing?

1051
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,600
The world of lahmacun is in mourning right now!

1052
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:41,280
Why?

1053
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,640
You said fork and knife.

1054
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:44,520
Should I not have?

1055
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:47,800
Never. Don’t ever say that again.

1056
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,800
Fork and knife.

1057
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,680
I won’t let you torture lahmacun like that.

1058
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,160
Are you threatening me?

1059
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,000
Out of respect for the lahmacun.

1060
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,080
I don’t get what the big deal is.

1061
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,240
You wouldn’t.

1062
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,720
Because eating lahmacun is a culture.

1063
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:14,560
Come down from your glass tower and join the rest of us.

1064
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,920
Wow, just other me immediately.

1065
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,280
I know how to eat it, okay?

1066
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:22,000
I was only testing you because we’re at the office.

1067
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:23,880
And you fell right into the trap.

1068
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:25,960
Sure you did.

1069
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,920
If I hadn’t stopped you, you’d be ruining my reputation.

1070
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,880
You’re dwelling on it.

1071
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,480
We’re just trying to eat lahmacun...

1072
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,840
They’re getting cold because I’m arguing with you.

1073
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,960
Lahmacun is my red line.

1074
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:38,920
Suit yourself.

1075
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:43,240
You act like you’re the only one who eats lahmacun.

1076
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:49,160
What are you doing?

1077
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:52,480
Wrapping it?

1078
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,600
Drop it. Watch how I do it.

1079
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,160
You lahmacun killer.

1080
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:07,000
Look, first you add plenty of greens.

1081
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,840
Then, plenty of lemon juice.

1082
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,920
I like it without lemon.

1083
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,520
I told you. Eating lahmacun is a culture.

1084
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:20,960
Not everyone knows it.

1085
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,560
See. You don't know.

1086
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,640
I don’t. I’m uncultured. Happy?

1087
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,400
You squeeze lemon.

1088
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,720
I’m telling you so you don’t embarrass yourself one day.

1089
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:35,040
That would never happen. Relax.

1090
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:39,320
Wait. Wait. Wait. Drop it.

1091
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,360
Not like that. Watch me.

1092
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:44,280
This is how you roll it.

1093
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,120
Roll it?

1094
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:51,440
Here you go.

1095
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,240
Watch me carefully.

1096
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,480
Learn it so you don’t embarrass yourself somewhere else.

1097
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:06,600
Now add the greens.

1098
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,280
Follow me closely.

1099
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,160
Now squeeze the lemon.

1100
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,200
This is really good. Wrap it fast.

1101
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,280
I mean "roll".

1102
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,440
Hmm...

1103
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:40,360
extraordinarily good.

1104
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,760
This is really good.

1105
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:45,480
Try it with lemon. It’s even better.

1106
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:47,880
I’m fine like this.

1107
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:50,360
You’ll like it.

1108
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:54,000
Just try once. Do you have the courage?

1109
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,960
Oh, a challenge?

1110
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,640
Fine. I’ll taste the one with lemon

1111
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,880
If you eat yours without it.

1112
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,280
Deal.

1113
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:18,880
I like it with lemon.

1114
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:22,880
It’s good, I admit it. But mine is still better.

1115
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:33,920
And don’t start with "lahmacun must be eaten with şalgam."

1116
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,720
I’m starving. I can’t keep up with you anymore.

1117
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:40,200
I wasn’t going to say anything. You wouldn’t understand anyway.

1118
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:46,640
See.

1119
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:49,800
Oh.

1120
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,400
These are barely anything. Are we supposed to get full with this?

1121
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,360
I thought you’d only eat one wrap.

1122
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,920
At this rate, I’ll eat all of them.

1123
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:34,960
There are only two left anyway.

1124
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,560
What are you doing? Are you insane?!

1125
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,520
We’re in the company.

1126
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:09,360
If Ateş walks out and sees us together…

1127
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,560
he’ll tear us both apart.

1128
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:15,320
I was the one about to tear him apart. He got lucky at the last second.

1129
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:17,080
Good. Since you brought that up...

1130
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:21,400
this will never happen again. Do you understand me?

1131
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:27,160
Just like you warned me about Mercan, I’m warning you about Ateş.

1132
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:30,720
You won’t lay a finger on him.

1133
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,200
If you do, I’ll burn you to the ground, Nezir.

1134
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:39,720
Then tell me something. What’s Ateş waiting for?

1135
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:44,480
The one I know would’ve come after me by now.

1136
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,120
What’s behind this silence?

1137
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:49,560
He’s resting for now.

1138
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,480
Resting from what?

1139
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,280
A bullet barely grazed him.

1140
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,480
A bullet?! What are you talking about?

1141
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,280
You didn’t know?

1142
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,400
I’m warning you for the last time.

1143
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:08,680
If you ever try to hurt him again,

1144
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:12,960
I’ll make you regret being born.

1145
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:22,800
Love has blinded you.

1146
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:27,040
We’re not so different, you and I.

1147
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,320
Productive meeting, wasn’t it?

1148
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,040
The kids were well prepared.

1149
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,280
But the lahmacuns were amazing.

1150
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,960
That place is good. Pure Adana style.

1151
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,040
Really good.

1152
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,800
Can we talk for a minute, dear?

1153
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,560
This is all your fault.

1154
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:18,000
Just like everything else, you ruined my relationship with my daughter too.

1155
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,480
Don’t look for someone else to blame.

1156
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:24,360
Whatever happened, you did it yourself.

1157
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:26,960
Then what are you waiting for?

1158
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:29,720
You once held a gun to my head for other people.

1159
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,240
You wouldn’t wait this long to make me pay.

1160
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,840
Watching you sit in fear like this is much more satisfying.

1161
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:38,360
And I don’t even need to do anything.

1162
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:42,960
You already took the biggest hit

1163
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:47,280
from the person closest to you. Your own blood.

1164
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:12,480
Oh, Berat… oh, Berat.

1165
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,040
There's no one.

1166
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,240
Should I even have come?

1167
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:27,280
You don’t mess around with loan sharks, Berat.

1168
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,840
No point dying just because of curiosity.

1169
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:40,040
No, man… you can’t live with this kind of curiosity either.

1170
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:42,280
All or nothing.

1171
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,840
I’ll ask properly.

1172
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,840
We’ll find out who paid the debt.

1173
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:49,120
That's it. Bismillah.

1174
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:53,840
…No, I should just go. Go Berat.

1175
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:59,240
Well, well… look who showed up.

1176
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,080
Someone must’ve eaten brave pills.

1177
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:06,480
- Respectfully, brother. - Didn’t you learn your lesson, boy?!

1178
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,680
Of course I learned. I did!

1179
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:11,240
To the moon!

1180
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:14,040
I just… I just came here to find out...

1181
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:17,920
I just want to know who paid my debt. That’s all.

1182
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,440
That’s why I came.

1183
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,040
You again?

1184
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:29,040
It's me again, brother.

1185
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,800
But I’m not here for money this time.

1186
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:35,320
Just tell me who paid it.

1187
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:37,880
The guy didn’t leave a business card.

1188
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,360
How should I know who he is?

1189
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:44,080
Tall, broad shouldered… He said he was Egyptian.

1190
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:47,600
Egyptian?

1191
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:54,520
What? Malik paid my debt?

1192
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,280
If you’re free, can I come in, dear?

1193
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:43,600
If you came to talk about my father, don’t bother, Mom.

1194
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:51,920
Look, dear.

1195
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:58,440
I understand your anger. And you’re right.

1196
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,400
What your father did wasn’t right.

1197
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:05,520
But he’s still your father.

1198
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:12,200
Everything he does, he does for us.

1199
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,840
There’s no excuse for doing harm, Mom.

1200
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,920
Especially not to your own family.

1201
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:23,160
There is, Mercan. Of course there is.

1202
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:28,120
Don’t you remember what we went through after the Karahans came into our lives?

1203
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:32,200
All the torment, all the humiliation…

1204
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,920
They tortured you right in front of our eyes.

1205
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:40,640
And worst of all,

1206
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:47,240
they took my son from me.

1207
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:52,920
They’re responsible for Murat’s death.

1208
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:01,960
And as if that wasn’t enough, your father was arrested for nothing.

1209
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:05,800
Anyone would lose control.

1210
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,520
Your father had every right.

1211
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:17,080
Mercan...

1212
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:20,840
look daughter.

1213
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:24,800
A father and daughter shouldn’t stay angry at each other.

1214
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:28,280
You know how devoted he is to you.

1215
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:31,880
You know what sacrifices he made when you were a child.

1216
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:34,320
You know all this.

1217
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:41,360
I remember exactly what he did for me.

1218
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:45,200
Otherwise I would’ve turned him in myself.

1219
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:48,400
But that’s it.

1220
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:51,080
I can’t go any further.

1221
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,440
I’ve lost my trust in him.

1222
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:57,320
I don’t recognize him anymore.

1223
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:02,280
How can you call someone "father" when you don’t even know who he is?

1224
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,840
How can you lean on him as a daughter?

1225
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:14,760
I’m sorry, Mom.

1226
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:17,880
But I don’t think I can forgive him.

1227
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:40,200
Aslı. What’s with that face? Did something happen?

1228
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:43,960
Oh, something happened. A lot happened and we’re the only ones who didn’t know.

1229
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:46,120
What are you talking about, dear?

1230
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:50,440
Ateş was shot, Mom. They didn’t tell us.

1231
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:57,080
What?! My son was shot?!

1232
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:03,360
Mercan knows. Everyone knows.

1233
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:07,760
Except us. Ateş hid it from us.

1234
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:12,520
Ateş hid it so the situation wouldn’t escalate.

1235
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:15,840
Mercan must’ve asked him to.

1236
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:17,760
Trying to protect her father…

1237
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,720
That girl played us for fools.

1238
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,880
I’ll make her answer for this.

1239
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:55,120
You’re soaked.

1240
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:57,440
Not too much.

1241
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,720
Now look...

1242
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:12,080
this will warm you up.

1243
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:19,920
I knitted it myself.

1244
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:30,400
-Thank you. -No need to mention.

1245
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:32,880
It’s really beautiful.

1246
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:39,080
But... I mean...

1247
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:46,640
You’re the one who said you didn’t love me. The one who left.

1248
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:56,680
So why are you upset that I left?

1249
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:02,480
Why knit me a scarf? Why wear the necklace I gave you?

1250
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,960
What does all this mean?

1251
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:18,640
Or... or are you playing a game with me?

1252
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:25,560
If that's the case neither I nor my heart are your toys.

1253
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,520
Malik!

1254
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:39,800
Don’t go!

1255
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:48,440
Give me one reason not to, Çiçek.

1256
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,400
Malik, I…

1257
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:54,920
Yes? What?

1258
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:58,960
I’m still in love with you.

1259
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:07,760
I was always in love with you.

1260
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,840
Did I hear that right?

1261
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:15,560
You said you’re in love with me?

1262
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:19,800
What I said when I left wasn’t true.

1263
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:23,280
I didn’t mean any of it.

1264
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:25,840
Then why, Çiçek?

1265
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,040
Why did you do such a thing?

1266
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:30,880
Zehra.

1267
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,240
She saw us together.

1268
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:40,240
She threatened to tell my mother and Mrs. Müzeyyen

1269
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:42,440
if I didn’t break up with you.

1270
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:48,200
I was scared we’d both lose our jobs.

1271
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:04,520
I never stopped loving you, Malik.

1272
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,160
When I read your letter, it felt like my world collapsed.

1273
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,000
I realized I can’t live without you.

1274
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:18,880
Please… forgive me, Malik.

1275
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:09,480
What are you doing, Mrs. Müzeyyen?! Why do you have a knife?!

1276
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:13,200
I’ll show you what it means to hurt my son!

1277
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:14,920
To you and your father.

1278
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:18,320
I did nothing to anyone!

1279
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,160
Spare me the innocent act.

1280
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,120
Your whole family is rotten.

1281
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:31,400
I know you helped your father trap Ateş.

1282
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:41,800
Haydar tested me with my son. Now I’ll test him with his daughter.

1283
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:49,520
What are you doing, Mother Müzeyyen?!

1284
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:51,080
Let me go, Ateş!

1285
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:53,320
Let me go for once!

1286
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:57,800
Wherever the Yıldırıms wounded you, I’ll wound this snake the same way!

1287
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:02,760
Drop this knife!

1288
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:06,640
No, you won’t!

1289
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:09,640
She’s innocent! Enough! Come to your senses!

1290
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:12,240
She’s my wife.

1291
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:23,960
Come to your senses!

1292
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:25,760
You can’t touch her. I won’t allow it.

1293
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:30,840
Get inside.

1294
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,000
Aslı, you too.

1295
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:40,640
Has something happened?

1296
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:42,920
Tell me.

1297
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:45,040
Are you alright?

1298
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,000
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

1299
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:51,440
Say it.

1300
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:55,440
Okay. I'll be right back.

1301
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,800
Have you lost your mind, Mother Müzeyyen?!

1302
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:12,160
Don’t you get it, son?!

1303
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:15,320
No one harms my child!

1304
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:18,040
I would kill for my children!

1305
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:21,600
Our fight isn’t with the innocent. It’s with the guilty!

1306
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:25,640
Are we murderers now? What was that?!

1307
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,600
She did nothing. Leave her alone.

1308
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:34,720
You’re taking a Yıldırım’s side against me?

1309
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:37,080
Telling me I can’t touch her?

1310
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:40,800
Her last name being Yıldırım doesn’t make her guilty.

1311
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:45,040
And she’s a Karahan now.

1312
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
She's my wife.

1313
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:52,400
She’s innocent.

1314
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:58,000
She didn’t hurt me. She risked her life to save me.

1315
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,960
You actually believe that?

1316
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:10,440
That girl is not innocent. She’s playing you.

1317
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:14,320
I’m saying this one last time.

1318
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:19,120
Leave her alone.

1319
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:22,520
Period!

1320
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,480
Be proud of yourself.

1321
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:36,760
This is all because of you.

1322
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:40,720
You couldn’t stop this marriage.

1323
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:43,240
And now look.

1324
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:48,480
He protects her, defends her.

1325
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:56,720
I know what I have to do.

1326
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:31,480
Are you okay?

1327
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,640
I’m fine.

1328
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:40,160
Are you sure?

1329
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:46,640
She's my wife. Come to your senses.

1330
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:04,760
I can’t stand to see her cry.

1331
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:19,560
Look...

1332
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,520
nothing like this will ever happen again.

1333
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:25,360
Anyone who tries to hurt you will face me.

1334
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:34,200
I won’t allow it. Remember that.

1335
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:59,880
Take a couple sips. It’ll help.

1336
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:18,080
Thanks.

1337
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:23,760
You’re bleeding!

1338
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:28,120
It’s nothing.

1339
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:31,120
No. It matters. We need to look at it now.

1340
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,160
Don’t worry about me.

1341
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:36,040
Please don’t be stubborn.

1342
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:40,840
Sit down. What can I think of while your wound is bleeding?

1343
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,200
Let me.

1344
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,160
It looks bad.

1345
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:38,800
Your hands tremble.

1346
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:47,320
It’s okay. I’m here.

1347
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:53,240
No one can hurt you anymore.

1348
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:56,600
Trust me.

1349
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:59,520
I…

1350
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:07,280
This might sting a little.

1351
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,520
Oh God, what are these scars?

1352
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:02,600
What is it?
