1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,800
Will you burn me again?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,000
I’ve already burned once.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,520
I can burn again. It’s fine.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,360
What you’ve done hurts far worse.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,840
We told Aslı it wasn’t
Mercan who poisoned her.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,720
But she still thinks it was.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,320
Everyone will find out eventually.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,920
What about the weapons?

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,440
All taken care of.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,040
Şahin’s being sent abroad.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,480
Now you know what losing a
child feels like, Ms. Müzeyyen.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,480
It was you?

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,240
All that shouting...
just to cover your guilt!

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,720
What are you doing?! Let go!

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,240
-Ms. Müzeyyen. -I'm gonna...

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
What are you doing?!

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,920
Let go!

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,720
Enough! No more incidents from now on!

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,160
Every time we try, he shields her.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,520
Ateş canceled the shipment
because Mercan signed, not Haydar.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,200
Thanks to her, the whole
plan collapsed in a second.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,440
Ateş saved me that day

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
by canceling the shipment.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,480
He even saved you and my father.

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,920
And he still trusts me.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,640
He didn’t revoke my signature rights.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,960
Mercan, you’re making a mistake!

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,360
He saved himself, not us.

29
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,600
Ateş, I don’t understand, son.

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,640
What’s Mercan different from Murat,

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,240
Haydar, or Nermin?

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,000
You know the difference.

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,480
We made this plan for Haydar.

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,000
If I hadn’t intervened,

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,440
our own game would have weakened us.

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,000
They trapped us.

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,000
Falling isn’t the problem, Nezir.

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,520
The real issue is taking
others down in this world.

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,320
Betrayal is paid for with death.

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,160
If he’s behind this, I’ll
settle it with my own hands.

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,400
Promised.

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,480
First we find Şahin. Then
we’ll know who did what.

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,040
I held back their signature
rights so they’d make mistakes.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,160
But things have changed now.

45
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,280
I’m neutralizing Haydar
and Mercan completely.

46
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,000
We must block them from working with Nezir.

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,360
What’s the reason for
this hatred, Ms. Müzeyyen?

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,080
We’re the ones who lost a child,

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,080
Pain deserves mercy, not cruelty!

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,680
I’ve suffered so much

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,040
that I have no mercy for
anyone outside my family!

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,400
- You can’t even protect your son’s memory!
- (furious) Don’t cross the line, Nermin!

53
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,680
I don’t have the luxury
of mourning like you.

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,280
We’re still drowning in the pit Murat dug!

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,600
You’ll stay away from that woman.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,480
That’s final!

57
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,160
I feel sorry for Mercan.

58
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,760
She married the man she doesn't want.

59
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,760
The suffering she
endured was beyond measure.

60
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
She worn out.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,320
If I had known you weren't aware of Mrs.
Müzeyyen's invitation, I wouldn't have come.

62
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,560
As I said last night.

63
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,280
I want this conflict to end.

64
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,560
Why did you bring me here?

65
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,840
Don't you want to eat dessert?

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Eat.

67
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,360
Welcome.
What can I get you?

68
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,840
Can we get two baked rice pudding please?

69
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Of course.

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Are you going to decide what I eat too?

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,201
If you don't want baked rice
pudding, say something else.

72
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Leave it.

73
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Annoying.

74
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,720
All of them looks very good.

75
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,520
Didn't your mom see it, did she?

76
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,760
No. I took the desserts secretly.

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,440
Where is Eylül?

78
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
She is about to come.

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
I don't like the burnt ones.

80
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,240
I don't like burnt ones.

81
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Delicious.

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,040
When I grow up, I'll make it for you too.

83
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,360
But don't make it burnt.

84
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
What's up?

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What happened?

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Nothing.

87
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,920
You heard what happened.

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
Ateş isn't normal.

89
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,680
He isn't.

90
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,120
I don't want to tell this but.

91
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
I think he is jealous of Mercan.

92
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,600
That's why he's angry with Nezir.

93
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Don't.

94
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,680
Just saying it won't work, Mom.

95
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,200
You know that too.

96
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,560
Ateş gets hook into everyone, that's why.

97
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Done with it.

98
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
We do it.

99
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,120
But I'm not sure if Ateş does or not.

100
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,480
We have to take precaution.

101
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,880
Otherwise, he'll go
completely off the rails.

102
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
We made him angry.

103
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,280
If we make him angry little more.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,240
He becomes away from us, right?

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,920
He forgets why we here.

106
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
What will we doing now?

107
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
We'll have to change tactics.

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
We will make sure

109
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,600
he understands without drawing attention.

110
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,800
We'll show him the truth.

111
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,800
If he doesn't see

112
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,600
we shove the truth in someone's face.

113
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,000
I see you've been tense lately.

114
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Be careful.

115
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
It's obvious.

116
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,880
Stress is the root of all problems.

117
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,440
Let them make you a
nice, frothy coffee too.

118
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,360
It calms the nerves.

119
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Leave it.

120
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,920
I'll go to the company.

121
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,520
Okay.

122
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,440
Have a nice working day.

123
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,480
Are you leaving too, Mrs. Müzeyyen?

124
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
We were having such a nice conversation.

125
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
What happened?

126
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,760
We'll talk again.

127
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,080
But in a language you can understand.

128
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Can we get the bill?

129
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Of course, sir.

130
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
I want to come to the company.

131
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,040
Please think twice.

132
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,640
Let's not talk about it again.

133
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
My decision is final.

134
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Yes, Mrs. Zahide.

135
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
What time was the meeting?

136
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,320
Okay.

137
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
I'm coming.

138
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Come on. We're going.

139
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Where to?

140
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,520
I'll drop you to the mansion.

141
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,480
You go.

142
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,080
I want to sit a little longer.

143
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
It didn't seem like a good idea to me.

144
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,880
Going outside is prohibited.
Working is prohibited.

145
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Speaking is forbidden.

146
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Is this life?

147
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,360
Put a shackle on my hand too.

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay.

149
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Sit a little longer.

150
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,040
Go back to the mansion and don't be late.

151
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
I thought.

152
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
I've made my decision.

153
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,320
I searched the entire mansion.

154
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,240
I looked at everyone's ears.

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But, no.

156
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,840
I couldn't find the owner of the earring.

157
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,960
Whose damn earrings are these?

158
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
My earing.

159
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Where did you find it?

160
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,120
I've looked everywhere, you know?

161
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,960
This one is my favorite.

162
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,280
Thank you so much dear, thank you.

163
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,360
Burak.

164
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,056
You've read everything, right?

165
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Yes, Mrs. Zahide.

166
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,760
Okay.

167
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,600
The meeting will be tense.

168
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
We'll be careful and ready, okay?

169
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,440
Is the meeting going to be
tense because of Mr. Nezir?

170
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,320
I understand, the meeting
will be with Mr. Nezir.

171
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Good morning.

172
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,720
Because of the meeting, I came early.

173
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Good morning.

174
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,360
We were talking about this.

175
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
In private.

176
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,240
See you again.

177
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,520
See you.

178
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Burak.

179
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Burak.

180
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Stay with me.

181
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,520
Look.

182
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,440
She is Mr. Nezir's sister.

183
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,160
Be careful please.

184
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,560
Of course, no problem.

185
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,520
What are you doing without me?

186
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
What do you work?

187
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,040
You work for the company, don't you?

188
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,520
One goes, the other one comes.

189
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Burak.

190
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,200
Let's go to the office.

191
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
The unpleasant.

192
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,800
"One goes, the other one comes."

193
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
Unpleasant thing.

194
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Come here.

195
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,720
Why did you sell me?

196
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,640
Did you think you'd get away with it?

197
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,600
No one can fool Haydar Yıldırım.

198
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Understand?

199
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
I didn't do anything.

200
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Didn't do anything.

201
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Come here.

202
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Speak.

203
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Speak, why did you do it?

204
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,280
There is nothing to tell.

205
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,640
Tell me, or I'll make
you regret being born.

206
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,360
There is nothing to tell.

207
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,080
Speak.

208
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Dog!

209
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
Tell me, or I'll make
you regret being born.

210
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Give me that.

211
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Give.

212
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Speak.

213
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,040
Speak.

214
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
I will.

215
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Speak.

216
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Take that away.

217
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Leave no trace.

218
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Welcome brother.

219
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Thank you Cemal.

220
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,640
We received news from our men inside.

221
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,640
Şahin.

222
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,720
Didn't tell about us, there is no problem.

223
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
But Haydar.

224
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Shot him.

225
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
If he hadn't run away,
he wouldn't have been shot.

226
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Brother.

227
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,120
We did what we should do.

228
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,800
We warned him but he didn't listen.

229
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
Dug his own grave.

230
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
The meeting with Nezir is about to start.

231
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,760
Shall we go over the file?

232
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
Of course.

233
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Good luck.

234
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Thanks.

235
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,280
Let's look at the details of
the offer first, if you like.

236
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
No need.

237
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,800
I've looked into it before.

238
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
Be sure not to miss the details.

239
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Sir.

240
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,600
I read it too. You need to
pay attention to Article 6.

241
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,000
The sentence is a bit problematic.

242
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,720
I think it could be understood either way.

243
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
Did you hear Ms. Aslı?

244
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,040
I did.

245
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,600
I'll go over again.

246
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
What are you doing here?

247
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
I said you were fired.
Didn't you understand?

248
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,960
You no longer have any
connection with this company!

249
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,160
She probably doesn't understand.

250
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,200
No.

251
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
I understand.

252
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,720
I didn't come here as a
Yıldırım Holding employee anyway.

253
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
What is that means?

254
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,200
Mercan now works at my company.

255
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,560
Leave us alone.

256
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,480
Who are you to constantly
order people around?

257
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,080
Leave, Nezir.

258
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,360
Only because you asked me to.

259
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,840
I'll be the bigger person.

260
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,399
Are you trying to drive me mad?

261
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,720
You can't work with that man.

262
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,040
Is there a law against
it, show me if there is.

263
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,800
I am the law.

264
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,160
You're the one who fired me.

265
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,400
I can work wherever I want.

266
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,560
But if you regret firing
me, that changes things.

267
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,440
What do you mean by regret?

268
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,840
You're my wife,

269
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,759
and Nezir is a man
trying to hamper my work.

270
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,960
We're married, you know.

271
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,080
For 187 days.

272
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,040
And time moves fast.

273
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,520
I'm not about to leave my practice just
because you have a problem with Nezir.

274
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,200
And I'm your wife out of obligation.
What part of this do you not understand?

275
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,319
If you think I'm going
to let you work with him,

276
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,360
then you don't know me at all.

277
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,240
Nezir, let's go.

278
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,680
Yes, you should go.

279
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
You have no business being here.

280
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,080
If you've caused enough of a
scene, you can get out of here, now.

281
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
You should take an
ethiquette class as a family.

282
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,200
We know how to speak with different people.

283
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,400
It depends on who's
in front of us, you see.

284
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,080
What is this?

285
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,600
What's going on here?

286
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,360
Just a lover's spat.

287
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,119
Apparently, Mr. Ateş is upset because

288
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,440
Ms. Mercan started working with Mr. Nezir.

289
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,480
What is there to be upset
about? He's just deranged.

290
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,559
"Deranged" is a bit much.

291
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,480
You should be careful with your words.

292
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,960
Everyone get back to work.

293
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,239
Who do you think you are, Ateş's stand-in?

294
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,400
I don't have time to deal
with you. Mind your business.

295
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,840
You can't order me around.

296
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,200
If you knew what I was
capable of doing to you,

297
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,120
you'd change continents on
the first flight you found.

298
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,480
Nezir! Please, just leave
it. Let's get out of here.

299
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,279
Aslı!

300
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,760
What happened, who did this to you?

301
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,840
I don't care about your fight with Nezir.

302
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,040
I only care about my work,
the project I'm working on.

303
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,560
And getting rid of the Karahan family.

304
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,160
We're launching the project tomorrow.

305
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,760
What?

306
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,840
You'll do nothing of the sort.

307
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,879
I will.

308
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,400
I'll send you an invitation

309
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,280
if you want to see how I do it.

310
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,240
I'm not going to let this happen.

311
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,240
And I'm never going to give up.

312
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,120
I'll fight you until the very end.

313
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,040
You only just entered the battlefield.

314
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,080
I've been on it for years.

315
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,760
Ask me about fighting.

316
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,920
I know how to lose and I know how to win.

317
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
You'll lose.

318
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,599
You know why?

319
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,240
Because I'm not afraid of you anymore.

320
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,519
This is side effect of cruelty.

321
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,240
At a certain point, there's nothing
left for the other person to lose.

322
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,800
My fear died the day I
married you, Ateş Karahan.

323
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,840
"I'm your wife out of obligation,
what part of this do you not understand?"

324
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,359
Haydar, welcome.

325
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,040
Thank you.

326
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,920
Haydar?

327
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,520
Is that blood?

328
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,079
What happened?

329
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,360
It's nothing, Nermin. Don't
make a big deal out of it.

330
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,240
Did you get shot?

331
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,240
Who would have the guts?

332
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,600
It's not my blood, don't panic.

333
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,640
Hello, what happened with Şahin?

334
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,800
He's dead.

335
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,280
But he couldn't talk.

336
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,120
It's obvious he was working with Ateş

337
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,400
even if he didn't say it.

338
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,680
Doesn't matter. Let's say
we just did some clean-up.

339
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,440
How is your project going?

340
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,080
It's all going well.

341
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,239
Ateş nearly lost it. He
should get used to this.

342
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,199
We're having a hard launch tomorrow.

343
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,279
Okay, do whatever you need to do.

344
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,000
Let's get rid of this
Ateş once and for all.

345
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,999
Haydar, let's change your
shirt before someone sees it.

346
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,720
Take a shower while you're
at it, it'll take the edge off.

347
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,600
Wait up, I'll come with you. Let's go.

348
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,000
So? Are we not going to speak?

349
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
Why did you have Zehra's earring?

350
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,240
I told you I don't know,
dear. I have no idea.

351
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,440
It can't have just fallen into your pocket.

352
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,640
You're being unfair.
Do you think I'm lying?

353
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,280
But it was in your pocket.

354
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,440
Look at me.

355
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,480
If I'm lying, may I never see you again.

356
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,040
That would be the biggest
punishment of all for me.

357
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,440
Really?

358
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,199
Of course.

359
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,160
Both my heart and my eyes
are blind to everyone but you.

360
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,440
I would give up everything for you.

361
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,240
My entire life.

362
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,520
Well...

363
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,520
Okay, then.

364
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,960
The weather's great
today, I'm glad we went out.

365
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,480
Brother, I was thinking...

366
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,200
Why don't we have
dinner just the two of us?

367
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,960
I think it would do us both some good.

368
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,080
I need to talk to her.

369
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,840
If you're talking about Mercan, she left...

370
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,880
After you had your fight.

371
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,600
"You're the one who fired me,
I can work wherever I want."

372
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,680
Brother, let's do what I say. There
is a kebab place I know close-by,

373
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,679
let's go eat some spicy kebabs.

374
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,280
We'll burn our tongues instead
of our hearts for a change.

375
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,360
Nothing can make me feel better.

376
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,960
When I think about her working with
Nezir, I feel like I'm going to lose it.

377
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,720
Of course, if she works with
Nezir, Haydar will gain more power.

378
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,720
That must be the reason
you're hot and bothered.

379
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,720
Why else would it be?

380
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,360
Do you share my mom's concerns?

381
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,480
Brother, you're the one in charge.

382
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,640
Whatever you say, goes.

383
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,240
I'm doing everything and more
to win this fight, don't worry.

384
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,360
I'm doing everything.

385
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,080
Meeting in secret, huh?

386
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,840
Zehra?

387
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,120
You seem to be busy.

388
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,240
I was just checking if the
windowsill needed dusting.

389
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,800
I admire your diligence.
You're a really hard worker.

390
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,880
Mrs. Müzeyyen is really lucky.

391
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,200
Thank you.

392
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,160
Hello.

393
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,240
Hello, Ms. Mercan.

394
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Give it to me.

395
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,040
Ms. Mercan, what are you doing?

396
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,359
You can go, do something else.

397
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,440
I need to decompress a little.

398
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,840
But if Mr. Ateş sees, I'll get an earful.

399
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,920
And what am I? Am I not
the lady of this house?

400
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,800
Mr. Ateş this, Mr. Ateş
that... As if he's so important.

401
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,160
What are you doing?

402
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,760
What does it look like I'm doing?

403
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,960
This is a bucket, that's
a car and this is a brush.

404
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,640
When you add these together,
they equal cleaning a car.

405
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,079
I was fired from my job, you know.

406
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,760
This is just something extra I picked up.

407
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,280
Why don't you let me help you?

408
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Is this how you do it?

409
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,080
Are you sure you were washing
this car, it's dirty all around.

410
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,560
I'll dock your daily wages.

411
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,800
You're my boss here, as well?

412
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
I am.

413
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,600
Don't push it!

414
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,160
I'm just rinsing the car.

415
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
Leave it.

416
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Give it back.

417
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,800
I said let go.

418
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,320
Hello, welcome.

419
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,240
Haydar and I will be dining out tonight.

420
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,640
Don't put out plates for us at dinner.

421
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Sure, ma'am.

422
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,520
Did she say something to you?

423
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,040
No, she didn't.

424
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,600
Don't get too involved with her.

425
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,800
And let me know if she
does something worth noting.

426
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,360
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,480
I wonder what these people do all day.

428
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,880
I'll go get the door.

429
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,520
I'm coming.

430
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,480
For Mercan Karahan.

431
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,960
Thank you.

432
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,400
These came for Ms. Mercan,
but there is no note.

433
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,120
What do you mean no note?

434
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,960
There is no sender name?

435
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,000
No. Maybe it's at the bottom, let me check.

436
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,080
Forget it. Could you get me a water?

437
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Yes, ma'am.

438
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,320
Where have you been?

439
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,640
I answered the door. Get back to work.

440
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,760
I was just dropping off the
flowers that came for Ms. Mercan.

441
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,080
Where is she?

442
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:41,960
She was just drying off... I don't know.

443
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,920
"Baby, we'll be wonderful
business partners,

444
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,480
I'm always with you,

445
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
I love you so much."

446
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,600
"I'm your wife out of obligation,
what part of this do you not understand?"

447
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,120
Is he angry because I got him all wet?

448
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,360
What is this?

449
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,400
What is with these flowers?

450
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,640
Answer me! What are these flowers?

451
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,600
I don't understand, they're just flowers.

452
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,320
Let go of me.

453
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:28,800
Don't get cheeky with me, what are these?

454
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,160
How should I know? I have no idea.

455
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,120
I do. They're from Nezir.

456
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,640
"We'll be wonderful business partners,

457
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,200
I'm always with you..."

458
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,560
What kind of talk is that?

459
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,759
How dare he write this to you,

460
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,320
where does he get the courage? Answer!

461
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,400
What is going on between you two?

462
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,840
You and him are..?

463
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,239
You're married, your last name is Karahan.

464
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,320
Did you hear me?

465
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,720
What are you accusing me of?

466
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,120
What kind of relationship
do you have with this man?

467
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,560
Don't! Don't you dare.

468
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,720
Stop right there, don't push my limits.

469
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,360
You can't say a word about my honor.

470
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,560
Who are you to ask me that,
who do you think you are?

471
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,000
How dare you speak to me that
way? No one can speak to me that way!

472
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,200
I can! I can speak that way.

473
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,640
If you're so bothered, don't
fool around with other men.

474
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,520
Is that answer good enough for you?

475
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,560
Get off me! Get out! Get out of my life!

476
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,280
Get out of here!

477
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,360
I hate you!

478
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,880
Get out!

479
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,480
"You're married! Your last
name is Karahan. Did you hear me?"

480
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,680
"Answer me! What is
going on between you two?"

481
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,080
"If you're so bothered, don't
fool around with other men."

482
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,560
What is going on?

483
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,760
It's Ateş. I can't get through
to him. He's set in his ways.

484
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,280
They almost screamed the house down.

485
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,560
They must have ticked him off again, right?

486
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,040
I know as much as you do, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

487
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,040
Did you get my flowers, sweetheart?

488
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Mercan?

489
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,440
Yes, I did.

490
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,400
Mercan, what happened?

491
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,520
Mercan, you're scaring me.

492
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,880
"What are you accusing me of?"

493
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,720
"Who are you to ask me that,
who do you think you are?"

494
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,320
"You can't speak a word about my
honor... get out of my life, get out!"

495
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,840
Can you believe what he accused me of?

496
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,520
But I didn't write you a note.

497
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,800
What do you mean? Who did, then?

498
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,720
Who do you think?

499
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,720
How evil can they be,
do they have no limit?

500
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,880
They're tormenting me.

501
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,640
Be patient, at least you know
when you'll be rid of them.

502
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,239
I don't have patience to wait one
more day, Demet. I can't bear it.

503
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,360
Sometimes, I feel like he's
going to be in my life forever.

504
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,520
I'm trying to hold my own,
I'm trying not to back down but

505
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:15,999
the more I hold on the worse
everything gets. I'm losing my family,

506
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,759
my dreams, my freedom, even my beliefs.

507
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,400
I can't hold on any longer.

508
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,120
I can't even hold on to myself anymore.

509
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,400
I have no more strength to stand.

510
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,040
I can't.

511
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,640
What happened?

512
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:01,360
I don't know the reason but
there was a huge fight, mom.

513
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,640
Mr. Ateş just left and I haven't seen
Ms. Mercan, I think she's in her room.

514
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,960
I wonder what happened.

515
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,239
Their fights are so dramatic.

516
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,480
It's so weird how they just explode.

517
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,880
You know what they say,

518
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,480
a love without fights is
like a dish without salt.

519
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,640
What do you mean, love?

520
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,080
Don't you see the hatred in their
eyes when they look at each other?

521
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,800
The greatest loves start with hatred.

522
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,480
The lettuce has gone bad, by the way.

523
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,080
We'll throw it out.

524
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,760
Let's see what will happen.

525
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,560
This shouldn't have happened.

526
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,640
This isn't what I wanted.

527
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,200
Ateş isn't answering his phone.

528
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,120
You... Is there something
wrong, you look upset?

529
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,880
I hate this house and everyone in it.

530
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,480
Why did we even come here?

531
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,200
I was fine with living apart,

532
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,760
I could have looked after him from afar.

533
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,360
I just need to know he's with me.

534
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,840
But I can't go on like this, Cemal.

535
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,759
Aslı, listen to me.

536
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,680
Every hardship you go
through has its reward.

537
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,720
And the Aslı I know-

538
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,160
The Aslı you know is not so strong anymore.

539
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,640
We were going to take
everything from them, right?

540
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,960
But I'm losing everything.

541
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,720
I can't stand seeing him
with that girl, like that...

542
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,480
Like husband and wife,

543
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:57,560
looking at each other, fighting...

544
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,640
I can't bring myself to say it
but... What kind of torture is this?

545
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,560
I miss us.

546
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,400
I miss us so much.

547
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,120
I know best what kind
of torture that is, Aslı.

548
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,600
We used to hang out together all the time,

549
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,320
laughing, having fun.

550
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,879
I miss that too, Aslı.

551
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,360
We were like three musketeers.

552
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,880
We're not anymore, though.

553
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,960
Ateş has missed the mark.

554
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,240
He's confused.

555
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:57,599
Cemal, talk to him. Remind
him that Mercan is our enemy.

556
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,360
Don't let him play favorites with her.

557
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,200
Talk to him, convince him to divorce her.

558
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,800
Aslı, the burden Ateş carries is a
heavy one. He may stumble on his path,

559
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,440
but we must help him along the way.

560
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,280
And I trust his discernment.

561
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,600
He always has his reasons.

562
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,040
We're going to have this
conversation again one day, and

563
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,080
you're going to say "you
were right Aslı, I'm sorry."

564
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,080
Salih, answer the phone.

565
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,000
Answer the phone. If you're
up to something, I'll kill you.

566
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,680
Answer, answer the phone, Salih.

567
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,360
What is it, son?

568
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,320
Why are you walking around frantically?

569
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,560
No... not frantic...

570
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,160
Just strolling, mom. I got bored.

571
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,200
You got bored?

572
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,880
Okay, then. Stroll around.

573
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,760
Could you give me the debit note?

574
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,760
What? What note?

575
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,200
Berat, I mean the note
of the debt you paid off.

576
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,239
Oh, you mean the bank receipt.

577
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,399
Yes, the receipt, whatever it is called.

578
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,919
Give it to me, I'll keep it.

579
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,240
The receipt is in the pocket
of my overalls, you know

580
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,320
the one hanging in the
storage room in the estate.

581
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,840
Berat, that's a two minute
walk. Go and get it, come on.

582
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,680
I'll go get it.

583
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,800
I'll bring it to you, okay.

584
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,856
"The person you have called cannot..."

585
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,120
I'll kill that person I have called.

586
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,080
My God help me, please.

587
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,920
"Are you supposed to be trustworthy?
What do I know about you? Nothing.

588
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,520
Demet and Nezir are my childhooh friends.

589
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:02,200
I won't stop seeing them
for someone I won't see after

590
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,800
divorcing, for someone I can't
even stand to see right now.

591
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,679
The Karahan family will
leave this house one day.

592
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,760
But they will always be in my life.

593
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,360
You'll be in my life
as long as I want you to.

594
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,720
You think so?"

595
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:27,280
"You'll lose. You know why? Because
I'm not afraid of you anymore."

596
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,640
"Ask me about fighting. I know
how to lose and I know how to win."

597
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,480
"This is the side effect of cruelty.

598
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,400
At some point the other person
has nothing left to lose."

599
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,080
"Are you trying to drive me mad?"

600
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,000
"We're married, you know."

601
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,320
"Only for 187 days."

602
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,920
"I won't let this happen."

603
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,560
"And I'll never give up."

604
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,920
Çiçek?
Yes?

605
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,240
Did you put those flowers
in my room yesterday?

606
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,360
No, Ms. Mercan. It wasn't me
and I don't know who did either.

607
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,760
But Zehra received those flowers.

608
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,040
Ms. Aslı and Mrs. Müzeyyen were with her.

609
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,600
Okay, thank you dear.

610
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,600
Did you see Ateş?

611
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,320
Not since yesterday.

612
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,040
He didn't return last night?

613
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,320
No.

614
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,280
I wish he never would.

615
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,640
Where is he?

616
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,600
Hello?

617
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,240
Brother, I've called you a million
times. Why aren't you anwering your phone?

618
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,680
We're people with enemies,
you can't just disappear.

619
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,920
I needed to be alone, Cemal.

620
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,200
You needed to be alone? Okay, go be alone.

621
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,640
But let me tell you something, the
one who's alone will always fall prey.

622
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,480
If anyone dares, they're welcome to try.

623
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,680
Nothing can go wrong.

624
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,240
I'm very diligent with each step.

625
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,840
So much effort went into this project.

626
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,040
If this works out, the
tables will have turned.

627
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,480
Don't get distracted for a second.

628
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,600
You know Ateş is always watching us.

629
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,400
That's why I'm working so hard.

630
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,200
I am personally in charge of most of it.

631
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,640
Everything is ready.

632
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,000
Ateş will see now what it means to mess

633
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,640
with Haydar Yıldırım's daughter.

634
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,000
My daughter is very
strong-willed, just like her father.

635
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,480
Where is that girl?

636
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,840
She just texted, she'll be here soon.

637
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,440
What is it Mrs. Müzeyyen?

638
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,440
What kind of evil are you planning now?

639
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,520
I don't need to plan anything.
It keeps finding me anyway.

640
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,880
What kind of a mother are you?
Teach your daughter some manners.

641
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,360
Married women shouldn't have

642
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,520
strange men at her door picking her up.

643
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,920
You're crossing a line, Mrs. Müzeyyen.

644
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,560
What are you trying to say?

645
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,280
I said what I said.

646
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,400
This is inappropriate in our
culture. You should act accordingly!

647
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,839
Salih, don't do this to me.

648
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,360
Answer the phone.

649
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,360
Answer the phone, Salih.

650
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,080
Answer, Salih. Don't do
this to me, don't do this.

651
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,560
What happened? He's
still not answering, right?

652
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,200
No, he isn't.

653
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,320
I'm dead, bro. I'm done for, I'm finished.

654
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,160
Berat, maybe you should go to the police.

655
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,160
What if I did? Then, mom would find out.

656
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,719
But if you went to the police...

657
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,719
What do you mean go to the
police? What is it, Malik?

658
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,559
Just come straight out with it.

659
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,839
What could I have to say,
Berat? What is there to say?

660
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,040
I get that you're upset
but don't take it out on me.

661
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,800
I'm not taking anything out on anyone.

662
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,520
I'm not taking anything anymore.

663
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,920
What am I going to do now, Malik?

664
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,880
You have a saying around here,

665
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,440
every dark cloud has a new lining.

666
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,680
That's not how it goes.

667
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,119
It's "every dark cloud
has a silver lining."

668
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,239
Whatever it is.

669
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,679
You were talking about
what to say to your mother...

670
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,600
Yes?

671
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,920
Berat we also have a
saying where I come from,

672
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,639
Admit to your wrong doings
and ask for forgiveness

673
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,320
or you'll double your crime, brother.

674
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,400
Go and tell your mom.

675
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,800
Come on, tell us how you feel, Ms. Mercan.

676
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,000
Are you excited?

677
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,400
I'm talking about the project,
Mercan. Are you excited?

678
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,440
Yes, I am.

679
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,240
What's wrong?

680
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,719
Did he do something?

681
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,039
It's nothing, Nezir

682
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,440
I don't want to talk about
it. Let's focus on the project.

683
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,240
As you wish.

684
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,920
What's going on?

685
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,160
Get out.
What are you doing?

686
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,879
Get out.

687
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,320
Let go! What are you doing?

688
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,120
What do you think you're doing?

689
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,440
No one can send my wife flowers.

690
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,480
Let him go.

691
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,016
Let him go, what are you doing?

692
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,360
Shut up, don't try to protect him.

693
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,280
Demet sent those flowers.

694
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,720
That's the best lie you could come up with?

695
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,840
Stop!

696
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,400
I'm telling the truth.

697
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,640
What about the note?

698
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,960
I don't know, you should
ask your family about it.

699
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,560
What does that mean?

700
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,480
I think you know what I mean.

701
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,360
They wouldn't do such a thing.

702
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,560
They wouldn't, huh?

703
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,080
I still have a burn wound on my hand.

704
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,160
This, they wouldn't do?

705
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,919
You know what?

706
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,240
Believe whatever you want, I don't care.

707
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,840
Just stay away from me.

708
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,480
Come with me.

709
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:17,680
Let go of me, I need to go.

710
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,000
You can't go.

711
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,600
Do you understand?

712
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,320
This presentation is really
important, I need to go.

713
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,800
What is it you don't understand?

714
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,120
I told you to get in.

715
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,960
Ateş!

716
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,440
I'll make you regret everything!

717
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,000
I'll take everything from you.

718
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,800
But I'll take Mercan first.

719
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,000
I'm telling you for the final time,

720
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,760
this Nezir business is off.

721
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,159
There was no such business until

722
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,800
you were tricked and lost your mind.

723
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,120
You talk too much and

724
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,080
say a whole lot of nothing.

725
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,960
Put your energy not into speaking

726
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,400
but into listening to me.

727
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,200
I wish I couldn't hear you at all.

728
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,360
Or see you.

729
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,240
I think that would be my happiest day.

730
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,280
Where were you?

731
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,879
Why are you doing this?

732
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,760
Why do you keep going behind my back?

733
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,359
Why are you riddling my head
with this type of thoughts?

734
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,960
My writing that note
doesn't change anything.

735
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,280
It's obvious what's going on.

736
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,880
I only wrote what I saw.

737
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,280
You should face the truth
when we still have the time.

738
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,040
Mrs. Müzeyyen wrote that note?

739
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,880
Mom is right. This doesn't change anything.

740
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,119
Nezir this, Nezir that.

741
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,680
You haven't talked about
anything else for days.

742
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,000
Aslı!

743
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,520
This has gone on for too long.

744
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,856
I'm not the one who keeps bringing it up.

745
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,000
Neither is mom. It's you.

746
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,480
Because of that girl, you're always...

747
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,840
I don't understand what this is about.

748
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,680
It's as if I'm their enemy and not them.

749
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,720
We need to find a solution to this, Cemal.

750
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,040
I don't want to keep checking
what's going on behind my back.

751
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,600
You're not going to cry! You're not crying.

752
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,160
Your tears would be a prize for them.

753
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,759
You'll bite the bullet, clench your
fist, hurt yourself if you have to,

754
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,120
but never show them your pain.

755
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,160
Let them push, you won't fall.

756
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,880
If they hit you, you won't make a sound.

757
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,520
You won't break, even if
your heart's breaking inside.

758
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,760
You're a strong woman.

759
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,000
And you, Ateş Karahan.

760
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,920
You'll lose to this woman.

761
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,639
Hello, Yaşar?

762
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,600
Listen to me carefully.

763
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,880
Listen to me.

764
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,656
Mrs. Müzeyyen would like the dishes
to be made with olive oil from now on,

765
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,560
and fruit and vegetables will
be organically sourced, okay?

766
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,056
Mrs. Müzeyyen wants detailed information on

767
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,840
the ongoings of the
house, just so you know.

768
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,319
It's understandable,

769
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,720
since this kitchen has
caused nothing but trouble.

770
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,480
Like the poison incident.

771
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
Hey!

772
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,240
Are you not listening to me?

773
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,040
We should let Mrs. Müzeyyen know about

774
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,880
your lost earring too, then.

775
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,160
Let's see if she'll like the earring
that was found in the kitchen incident.

776
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,520
What are you trying to say?

777
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,039
I've seen people like you in TV shows,

778
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,719
You're so transparent to me.

779
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,800
You're plotting all sorts
of things in your mind.

780
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,200
I'll tell you the rules.

781
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,639
From now on, you'll watch your step.

782
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,480
You'll enter the kitchen with respect

783
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,520
and leave it with respect.

784
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,960
And another thing,

785
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,560
you'll stay away from
the workers of the estate.

786
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,320
Or this earring incident
will get out of this

787
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,960
kitchen and find its
way to Mrs. Müzeyyen's ear

788
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,120
I think you should lend an ear to that.

789
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,560
I suppose you don't
watch much TV, Ms. Zehra.

790
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,280
But I do.

791
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,720
Who do you think you're playing with?

792
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,800
Mr. Burak.
Yes, ma'am.

793
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,000
Did you get around to
doing what I asked you?

794
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,240
Yes, I did, Ms. Zahide.

795
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,319
Let me see.

796
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,480
Of course, go ahead.

797
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,360
Here it is.

798
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,680
Open the file right below.

799
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,320
Okay.

800
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:00,200
You've missed this part again,
please pay more attention to this.

801
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,280
Yes, Ms. Zahide.

802
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,600
All hell broke loose,
and you guys have no idea.

803
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,000
What are we supposed to
have an idea on, Mr. Yaşar?

804
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,519
We don't care about gossip,
we're working as you can see.

805
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,840
I'd recommend you do the same.

806
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,920
I'm working, too, Ms. Zahide.

807
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,559
But I think, you guys should

808
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,840
take a look at this.

809
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,120
How is this possible?

810
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,040
How can we not know about this?

811
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,000
She put me in a ridiculous position.

812
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,480
I let my tongue run because of her.

813
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,680
I ended up being the bad
one once the truth came out.

814
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,120
I'm trying to keep a heavy
hand and she's undermining me.

815
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,080
You're right, brother.

816
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,559
You fired her from the company, you're

817
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,600
not really letting her leave the house,

818
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,880
you basically handed her to Mrs. Müzeyyen.

819
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,320
She, obviously, can't sit still.

820
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,280
But I think you should go over this

821
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,720
once more, you've made a mistake.

822
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,120
You're right.

823
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,040
Yes, Ms. Zahide?

824
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,160
What do you mean Ms. Zahide,

825
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,480
how can such a thing happen?

826
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,239
Okay. Send us a link, we'll take a look.

827
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,400
What happened?

828
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,720
This is what happened.

829
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,080
You asked for this.

830
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,600
If you want a fight so bad,

831
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,640
I'll get my ammunition out.

832
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,560
What do you think you're doing?

833
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,159
I'm not doing anything.

834
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,080
You're the one throwing the party.

835
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,160
But don't worry, I'll be a good hostess.

836
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,600
I'll make you proud.

837
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,040
Look, everyone is talking about the party.

838
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,279
The hospital project,
architectural design of which,

839
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,159
was done by Mercan
Yıldırım, and is a product of

840
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,880
a Yıldırım Conglomerate and
Nezir Keseroğlu partnership,

841
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:45,920
will be launched at a party
that will be held by Ateş Karahan.

842
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,800
The business world is in suspense.

843
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,896
You're pulling out the big guns, huh?

844
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:55,920
Uh-huh.

845
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,240
You're going to regret this.

846
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,880
This is the first step towards my freedom

847
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,960
Take firm steps.

848
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,320
You look very happy.

849
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,880
It's like you're celebrating
something inside yourself.

850
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,600
Yes, I'm happy.

851
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,880
Because I believe this will work.

852
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,880
Why are you so relaxed?

853
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,560
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

854
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,440
Today looks like it's going to be fun.

855
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,800
Really?

856
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,680
Why are you surprised?

857
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Why is that?

858
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,880
You're usually very tense and angry.

859
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,400
I hardly ever saw your smile.

860
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,240
You even owe me an apology.

861
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,480
Everything have its place and time.

862
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,120
I guess now is not the time or place.

863
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
Maybe.

864
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,560
Maybe after the divorce.

865
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,760
Life will be better for both of us.

866
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,200
Especially for me, that's for sure.

867
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,160
What a difficult man.

868
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,960
Living in the same house with
him must be very exhausting.

869
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,040
They brought flowers.

870
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:12,640
Let's welcome them.
Okay.

871
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:22,720
She's always wandering
around like she owns the place.

872
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,560
Every time I look at the
girl, my heart freezes.

873
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,400
Never mind.

874
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,760
Her last wandering will be.

875
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,680
Ateş will give him her due today, somehow.

876
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,200
I'll be happy to help.

877
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,200
Well.

878
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,160
Actually, Mercan should
have died instead of Murat.

879
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,560
Murat was useless.

880
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,360
But Mercan.

881
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,200
Mercan isn't like this.

882
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,520
She is the apple of his family's eye.

883
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,120
The one who keeps the family together.

884
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Did you notice?

885
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,720
Haydar wasn't as upset
as Nermin was for Murat.

886
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,080
Why?

887
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,520
Because she is Haydar's precious daughter.

888
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,360
Mercan is her dad's daughter.

889
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,720
We can make Haydar sad through that girl.

890
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,640
If there's someone who will
make the life unbearable for

891
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,480
it's you.

892
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,320
You're the strongest one among us.

893
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,920
Your power and hatred

894
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,640
will destroy Haydar.

895
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:43,920
Mother.

896
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,600
Aslı, Ateş wants to see us.

897
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,920
The old days came to mind.

898
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,840
This mansion has seen
days both bitter and sweet.

899
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,480
Yes.

900
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,640
There was an invitation every week.

901
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,760
This invitation might be
good for Mrs. Nermin too.

902
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,720
Feels a little better.

903
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,880
After Murat.

904
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:18,760
Yes.

905
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,360
There was another bond
between her and Murat.

906
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,720
If only she knew the truth.

907
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,040
Did you say something mother?

908
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,760
No.

909
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,880
I'm saying it's not easy.
It's a child, after all.

910
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,800
Mrs. Mercan a child too.

911
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,840
She's not like this with her.

912
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,120
Like a stepdaughter.

913
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,640
Be quiet, daughter.

914
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,520
Someone hears and thinks it's true.

915
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,600
You're always talking.

916
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,640
Ladies.

917
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,440
Less talk more work.

918
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,600
You won't get paid for gossiping.

919
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,040
You're starting to repeat yourself, Zehra.

920
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,240
There must be an update.

921
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,000
You know what to do?

922
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,480
Close yourself.

923
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,600
But don't restart.

924
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,560
Well said, bless your heart.

925
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,200
But enough.

926
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,800
Update.

927
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,080
Yes, update.

928
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,360
God.

929
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,520
Çiçek.
God bless you.

930
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,040
Maybe after divorce.

931
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,600
Then life would be better for us.

932
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,760
It will definitely be better for me.

933
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,680
Come in.

934
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,560
How are we doing?

935
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,600
We still haven't managed to
cancel the project, have we?

936
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,760
Well, we looked at all the documents.

937
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,640
We tried everything.

938
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,520
We haven't found a way yet.

939
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,640
But relax. I'll find.

940
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,600
Whatever it takes, find a way.

941
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,280
The launch is about to begin.

942
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,080
She won't be able to do
that presentation today.

943
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,760
She's been talking too much lately.

944
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,880
She should get back to normal.

945
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,640
We'll cut off the power if necessary.

946
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,840
This won't stop her.

947
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,680
She does presentation even in the dark.

948
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,200
We need something more definite.

949
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,520
Mrs. Mercan, I'm bringing the appetizers.

950
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:10,840
Okay dear.

951
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,240
One minute.

952
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,360
They are here.

953
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,880
Okay, they're all here, I guess.

954
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Thank you so much.

955
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,640
One minute.

956
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,080
They smell so good.

957
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,600
Okay, you can take them.2

958
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,880
I still can't believe I
have this moment Demet.

959
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,080
I get ants in my pants.

960
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:56,080
I can't wrap my head
around how he let it happen.

961
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,000
I think he felt compelled to do it

962
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,200
once he realized I wouldn't give up.

963
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,000
This had already been
reported in the press;

964
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,800
He can't bring himself to back down.

965
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,480
You know.

966
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,800
He is a gentlemen.

967
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,080
I hope everything will be fine.

968
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,440
But, I don't forget
what he did to my brother.

969
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,680
Let’s not bother us anything today.

970
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,800
Okay.

971
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,520
I'll check the preparations.

972
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,760
Okay, dear.

973
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,640
This shouldn’t be here.

974
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,240
Like this.

975
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,520
Too heavy.

976
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,720
I can do it.

977
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,600
Are you okay?

978
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,240
It's just rose thorn.

979
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,600
It's strange that such a beautiful flower

980
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,320
has thorns sharp enough to hurt someone.

981
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,840
Perhaps it bestows its beauty
only upon those who truly deserve it.

982
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,800
Brother.

983
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:44,840
Welcome.

984
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:45,920
Thanks dear.

985
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:47,920
Please don't cause trouble.

986
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,080
You look good Nezir.

987
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,760
How are you?

988
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,560
You look fine.

989
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,760
Demet works on this.

990
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,080
Better.

991
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,160
And.

992
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,080
After your success

993
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,400
I'll be better.

994
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,480
How are you?

995
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,720
Everything looks good.

996
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,320
Thanks.

997
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,640
It's really good.

998
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
What?

999
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,280
Usb.

1000
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,600
Usb.

1001
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:44,920
I left it at the office.

1002
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,976
All the images, everything is in it.

1003
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,760
Okay. Don't panic. We'll figure it out.

1004
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,960
I have to go and get it.

1005
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,480
Okay, let's go together and get it.

1006
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,320
We can do it.

1007
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,280
We can go.

1008
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,240
I'll kill this man.

1009
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,760
Mrs. Mercan is very excited.

1010
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,600
She cares every detail.

1011
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,080
I hope everything turns
out the way she wants.

1012
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,360
Amen. God willing.

1013
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,280
Çiçek I'm so tired, I
can't move my hands or feet.

1014
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,000
Shall I make some tea?

1015
01:29:58,680 --> 01:29:59,680
Yes, make.

1016
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,240
Thank you baby.

1017
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,840
God bless you.

1018
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,880
My feet are aching.

1019
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,320
I got old.

1020
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,760
No way mother.

1021
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,480
You're good.

1022
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,600
You say so?
Yes, of course.

1023
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:28,840
No, dear, no.

1024
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,000
My back hurts.

1025
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,800
When there is also sorrow and grief.

1026
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
But thank god.

1027
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,840
Now that this debt issue is sorted too.

1028
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,840
At one point, I was afraid
we wouldn't be able to pay.

1029
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,400
Me too.

1030
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,280
Malik is such a good boy.

1031
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,560
We owe him too, for no reason at all.

1032
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,800
But he doesn't say anything.

1033
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,240
It can't be like that.

1034
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:01,840
I don't owe anyone.

1035
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,720
It needs to be paid as soon as possible.

1036
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,920
He will need it. He
says he's getting married.

1037
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:11,640
We've taken care of it; it
will be paid as soon as possible.

1038
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,400
Salih.

1039
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:28,880
Berat.

1040
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,800
Berat.

1041
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,680
What happened? He didn't pick up, did he?

1042
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,520
No, he doesn't.

1043
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,560
He turned off the phone.

1044
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:40,680
Berat. Damn, Berat.

1045
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,640
He was my childhood friend.

1046
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,680
I think I got the worst from him.

1047
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,480
Do you remember what I said?

1048
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,560
I warned you, right?

1049
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,600
Crypto money.

1050
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,320
Why are you getting involved
in things you don't understand?

1051
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,200
Yes you warned, brother.

1052
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,040
I didn't mean any harm.

1053
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,296
I was going to quickly collect the money,

1054
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,320
pay off the debt,

1055
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,040
and surprise my parents.

1056
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:07,960
Yes.

1057
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,720
This is the biggest surprise.

1058
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,560
If my mother finds out,

1059
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:17,920
she can have heart attack.

1060
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,200
What will I do?

1061
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,080
Okay.

1062
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,440
Don't worry.

1063
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,560
We'll figure it out.

1064
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,680
Where is this?

1065
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,080
Instead of just standing
there, give me a hand.

1066
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,960
Isn't bringing you here enough?

1067
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,880
We arrived on time.

1068
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,360
You checked everywhere.

1069
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,000
Instead of just standing there,
would you die if you helped?

1070
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,360
We're late.

1071
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,880
If I were you, I would help you.

1072
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,880
What do you want me to do?

1073
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,120
Should I look in the drawers again?

1074
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,320
You can't find, let's go.

1075
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
One minute.

1076
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,240
How could I not have thought of that?

1077
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:49,920
Stop.

1078
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,400
Yes, Mrs. Mercan.

1079
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:54,680
Yaşar.

1080
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,920
I couldn't find the usb.

1081
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,680
You always make copies of the
files. Please tell me you have them.

1082
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,839
Yes, don't worry, Mrs. Mercan.

1083
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,480
I backed it up as usual.

1084
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,120
I mailed you.

1085
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,200
You're awesome.

1086
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,360
Thank you so much. I'm
so glad you're here Yaşar.

1087
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:10,880
He is the best.

1088
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,360
Good to him.

1089
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,120
Let's go. We're being late.

1090
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,000
Just like the old days.

1091
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,960
We used to host so many parties.

1092
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,280
Back then, my friends from the
community would come over every time.

1093
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,400
Now no one is calling

1094
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,320
and coming.

1095
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,840
We'll have much better
days than before, Nermin.

1096
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,480
Don't worry.

1097
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,280
I promise you.

1098
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,720
Everyone who turns their back Yıldırıms

1099
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,520
will once again be a slave
at the door of this mansion.

1100
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:12,920
You can do it Haydar.

1101
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:17,160
You've risen from nothing to the top.

1102
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,640
You've overcome so many obstacles.

1103
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,760
How can you not overcome this?

1104
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,080
Like this Nermin.

1105
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,400
Be by my side like you used to.

1106
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,600
Everything will be easier, don't worry.

1107
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,760
What can I do Haydar?

1108
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,160
What can I do?

1109
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,960
I still can't accept it.

1110
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,400
Moreover, I lost my son.

1111
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,920
You are the pillar of this family.

1112
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,640
Since we got married, you've
done everything I've asked.

1113
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,360
For instance, this mansion.

1114
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,840
Just walking past it was a dream of mine.

1115
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,160
Now it's mine.

1116
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:00,800
But now.

1117
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,400
I'm afraid.

1118
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,400
What if they don't give us anything back?

1119
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,600
I can't stand it.

1120
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,240
No.

1121
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,360
Don't be afraid. Don't worry.

1122
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,000
Everything will be our again.

1123
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,680
I promise.

1124
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,800
How stylish you both are.

1125
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,920
I love your dress, Aunt Nermin.

1126
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,320
Thank you Demet.

1127
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,320
-You're very beautiful too. -Thank you.

1128
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:41,400
Can we talk?

1129
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,440
What about Şahin?

1130
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,480
Is it okay?

1131
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,520
We handled it.

1132
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,760
The deceased rests peacefully at
the bottom of a construction site.

1133
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,640
It would have been better if
he had spoken before he died.

1134
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,040
Shameless.

1135
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:10,960
Demet.

1136
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:12,400
Where is Mercan?

1137
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,480
She had gone to the company with Ateş.

1138
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,720
Everything seems to
have been done properly.

1139
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,120
Mrs. Zahide.

1140
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,160
Is there another file
inside? Could you check?

1141
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,960
If there are any unfiled
documents, bring them too.

1142
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,240
I can check.

1143
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,680
I'll come too, and we'll
look at the documents.

1144
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:52,840
Nothing can be this perfect.

1145
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,600
There must be something.

1146
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,400
Something that was overlooked.

1147
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:02,080
Aslı, you drained all my energy.

1148
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:03,720
Calm down.

1149
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,200
We have time.

1150
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,800
It would be a shame if we
couldn't get anything out of this.

1151
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,880
If it touches Mercan

1152
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:22,960
or I'll make it happen.

1153
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,440
I'll do everything in
my power to destroy her.

1154
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,600
You were right, Mr. Cemal.
A file was left inside.

1155
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,720
Burak found it.

1156
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,120
Thank you.

1157
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,600
Welcome Burak.

1158
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,440
Thank you Ms. Demet.

1159
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,280
Burak.

1160
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,400
Any news yet? Check your emails.

1161
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,200
I'm checking it Ms. Zahide.

1162
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:30,680
No.

1163
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,160
Call the man, he should make it fast.

1164
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:35,480
Making fast what?

1165
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,080
Hello, welcome.

1166
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,040
Waiter.

1167
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,440
Waiter.

1168
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,440
Enjoy!

1169
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,040
Ladies.

1170
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,480
You're beautiful.

1171
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,200
I'm charmed.

1172
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,960
You're very handsome.

1173
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:13,960
Mother.

1174
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,440
The shirt is about to choke me.

1175
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,760
And the jacket.

1176
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,560
If you find my dead body

1177
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,080
they're the murderers.

1178
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,240
God bless you. Don't say that.

1179
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,520
Where is Ateş?

1180
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,040
He'll come.

1181
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,240
He is so handsome.

1182
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,280
God bless my son.

1183
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:51,840
God bless you.

1184
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,000
Did you find anything?

1185
01:42:58,280 --> 01:42:59,280
Kind of.

1186
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,960
But we'll need time, Zahide takes care.

1187
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:04,920
I found something too.

1188
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,040
I send them to Mrs. Zahide.

1189
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,000
We may need to delay the presentation

1190
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,480
until we receive the news.

1191
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,160
Marcan hasn't come yet.

1192
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,440
You're charming.

1193
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,280
You've taken everyone's breath.

1194
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,440
Thank you.

1195
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:17,720
I'll make compliments but

1196
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:21,600
I'm afraid that you will get angry.

1197
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,400
Why does she prink up that much?

1198
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:43,960
The presentation must be poor.

1199
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,160
It is meant to keep people's attention.

1200
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:59,080
Demet is right, everyone's eyes are on you.

1201
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:17,400
Ateş no longer even feels the
need to hide his interest in Mercan.

1202
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:21,280
He's not afraid of you or me.

1203
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,080
He always goes to her.

1204
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,000
Aslı. Don't.

1205
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:08,640
Nermin.

1206
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:12,320
Hello, dear, welcome.

1207
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,200
Thank you dear.

1208
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,880
Frankly, your invitation
surprised me quite a bit.

1209
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,600
After what I heard

1210
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,560
I wasn't expecting you to invite.

1211
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:22,920
What did you hear, dear?

1212
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,200
Haydar went bankrupt.

1213
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:28,880
The Karahan's took this mansion from you.

1214
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:35,000
You live in your own home like a
refugee. They settled here as a family.

1215
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,400
Don't believe everything you heard.

1216
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:43,760
Mercan has a happy
marriage with Ateş Karahan.

1217
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:48,120
Two families joined forces.

1218
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,240
Living under the same roof was

1219
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,000
also our mutual decision.

1220
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,200
Mercan is very lucky.

1221
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:58,080
Ateş is handsome.

1222
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:02,240
Maybe you'd like to introduce
me to your in-laws someday.

1223
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:06,320
Wealthy families from Anatolia

1224
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,760
are really colorful.

1225
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:09,920
See you dear.

1226
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,080
Relax.

1227
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:22,360
You don't have to play the
role of the loving spouse.

1228
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,520
I'm already relaxed.

1229
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,360
This is just a message.

1230
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,840
So no one comes near what's mine.

1231
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:47,960
You aren't my owner.

1232
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:10,120
I am.

1233
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:19,120
Calm down.

1234
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,360
You don't want them to
think we're fighting, do you?

1235
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,040
It's good for me.

1236
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:34,720
I don't care.

1237
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,040
It's your presentation.

1238
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,320
You'll get rid of me.

1239
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,680
I'm talking for you.

1240
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,920
I know you don't care what guests think.

1241
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,480
You're a selfish person who

1242
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:00,520
doesn't give a damn about the world
and doesn't care what others say.

1243
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:06,360
I act in my own best interests.

1244
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,960
Actually, this invitation
was somewhat good to me

1245
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:19,080
Everyone should know that I
bought everything from the Yıldırıms.

1246
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,240
Including the daughter.

1247
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:32,280
We signed for 187 days.

1248
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,680
Don't forget.

1249
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,840
Are you counting the days?

1250
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:38,200
Of course.

1251
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Mercan.

1252
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,680
Today you charmed us all.

1253
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,520
You're so kind, thank you.

1254
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,360
Congratulations, you're newlyweds.

1255
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:01,440
Thanks.

1256
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:04,080
We were talking about
the project with Nezir.

1257
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:05,680
He said you create wonders.

1258
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,920
We were talking about Mercan's project.

1259
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:24,760
Yes.

1260
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:28,160
When I saw the project, I
was truly proud of Mercan.

1261
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,240
I'm sure it will be talked
about for a long time.

1262
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,520
And I'm sure it'll make waves abroad.

1263
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:44,400
The powerful investors
who come here says the same.

1264
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,320
This will be a very profitable project.

1265
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:51,320
Everything became easier
with your support, Nezir.

1266
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:53,360
Every time.

1267
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:00,400
Ateş Karahan.

1268
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:02,840
You're lucky man.

1269
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,840
Mercan is a beautiful woman.

1270
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:11,920
And also a very successful architect.

1271
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:13,640
Thanks.

1272
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,200
She is.

1273
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,200
If I may.

1274
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,600
Aslı.

1275
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Did you see Ateş?

1276
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,280
He got too caught up in his role.

1277
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,840
He's holding the girl so tightly,
as if they're going to take her away.

1278
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,600
Don't be hard on yourself.

1279
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:34,120
It's easy to say.

1280
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,680
You have nothing with Yıldırıms.

1281
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:42,000
Our only hope to defeat Haydar is Ateş

1282
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:45,600
But if he gets caught up
like this, we're done for.

1283
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,281
Are you afraid that your plan
for revenge will be ruined?

1284
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,320
You know it's not just that.

1285
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:56,400
You know how my heart
burns when I see them.

1286
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:01,480
Who am I telling this to?

1287
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:03,880
You can't understand
unless you've lived it!

1288
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:15,640
Of course.

1289
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:17,320
How can I understand?

1290
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:24,680
My heart is a stone.

1291
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,520
Malik.

1292
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:03,280
Even the wheels on that car

1293
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:04,960
could pay off my debts.

1294
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Is this justice?

1295
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:11,480
Salih.

1296
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:14,640
If I could just catch you, I'll kill you.

1297
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:16,800
I'll kill you.

1298
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,080
Look around, Malik.

1299
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,440
Look around, everyone is happy.

1300
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,600
They spend so much money

1301
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:25,760
for a couple hours of fun.

1302
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,120
What have we done wrong
that we're suffering?

1303
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,400
Don't rebel, Berat.

1304
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,400
Be grateful for what you have.

1305
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:35,360
Your family is safe, your health is good.

1306
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,280
Everything will pass.

1307
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:41,560
Complaining won't solve anything.

1308
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,200
We need to find a solution.

1309
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:45,840
I think so.

1310
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,040
Talk to Mr. Haydar.

1311
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,160
Maybe he can help.

1312
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,200
Mr. Haydar.

1313
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:54,120
He is worse than me.

1314
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,160
Even the mansion isn't his.

1315
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,320
The man.

1316
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:02,496
He gave her daughter to
Mr. Ateş in exchange for a debt.

1317
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:03,520
Will he help me?

1318
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,880
If the bailiffs come,
Çiçek will be very upset.

1319
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:12,120
Your mother and Çiçek will be really upset.

1320
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,200
Me and everyone else will be sad.

1321
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,480
Malik.

1322
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:26,440
Actually, there is a solution
to get rid of this problem, but.

1323
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,640
There's an unused car at the mansion.

1324
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,096
I'm going to use it for
unlicensed taxi services.

1325
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:34,280
You'll help me.

1326
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,280
Unlicensed?

1327
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,600
Like a robbery.

1328
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:40,280
No, no way.

1329
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:41,560
-No. -No brother.

1330
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,840
- Don't say something like this.
- Not like this.

1331
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:46,400
I said no.

1332
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:47,520
I'll tell you, come.

1333
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:48,760
Brother.
I'll tell.

1334
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:07,920
Let's celebrate the
project with this dance.

1335
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,360
Don't fight with me.

1336
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:58,200
You can't win.

1337
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:49,080
Where did Aslı go?

1338
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:51,280
I think she is on the phone.

1339
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:52,880
There's something about the last thing.

1340
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:53,920
I'll check.

1341
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:02,800
This has to stop now.

1342
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:34,240
Why?

1343
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:36,160
Why?

1344
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:41,200
What did you see in her that
you haven't seen in me for years?

1345
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:34,320
Aslı, are you okay?

1346
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:35,680
Did you cut yourself?

1347
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:41,280
I'm not Cemal.

1348
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:45,560
I'm not okay.

1349
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:51,080
You saw how they danced, didn't you?

1350
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:55,360
You saw how that stupid girl clung to him.

1351
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:05,240
I can't resist.

1352
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:09,960
Haydar's daughter.

1353
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:15,800
My father's, my brother's
killer's daughter, the man I love.

1354
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,560
Aslı, don't do this.

1355
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:32,280
Please don't do this.

1356
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:36,400
I'm worried you'll hurt yourself.

1357
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,760
Trust Ateş.

1358
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:47,160
He won't easily turn back from this
path; it's not such a big deal for Haydar.

1359
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,080
He won't give up easily, not
for Mercan, not for anyone.

1360
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,800
I'll kill that girl.

1361
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:01,360
My dream

1362
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:03,680
will be that girl's nightmare.

1363
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,200
I will dig up the ground myself.

1364
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:12,120
She will pay for every moment

1365
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:16,720
she touched Ateş, every
moment it drew near!

1366
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:24,520
I will.

1367
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:32,560
I'll do it.

1368
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,520
I will.

1369
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:49,920
They danced without caring about anyone.

1370
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,400
I could feel the passion
between them from here.

1371
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:54,800
I've never seen anything like this.

1372
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:57,160
I'm really shocked.

1373
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:00,160
If I didn't know the
reason for their marriage.

1374
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:02,400
They may not realize it,

1375
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:04,680
but they were made for each other.

1376
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:07,160
Just like us.

1377
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:15,040
I wish we could freely
show our love to everyone.

1378
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:17,280
Don't worry, Çiçek.

1379
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:21,080
When the time comes, everyone will know.

1380
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:22,560
And we will be very happy.

1381
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,600
Well, we didn't even have
the courage to tell my mother.

1382
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:28,200
Don't worry.

1383
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:31,760
I'll go to your mother and
tell her I'm in love with you.

1384
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:35,040
I'll tell her no one could
love her daughter as much as I do.

1385
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:38,080
I'll tell her my love will
be her daughter's paradise.

1386
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:41,680
She doesn't allow.

1387
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:44,320
She says that she won't
allow me to go far away.

1388
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,880
We'll keep trying until we get permission.

1389
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:11,560
Yaşar has probably
finished the preparations.

1390
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,920
I need to get ready for the presentation.

1391
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:16,040
Leave it, let Nezir take care of it.

1392
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:18,320
He seemed too nosy anyway.

1393
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:22,280
Well.

1394
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:23,480
Where is he?

1395
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:25,440
Did he leave early?

1396
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:29,360
Why are you so against it?

1397
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:33,080
The project is really good.

1398
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,120
It will bring prestige to the
company. You will benefit too.

1399
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:38,360
Can't you give it some support?

1400
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:41,160
You're being unfair.

1401
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:45,160
I let you host a party at my house.

1402
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:49,760
And I even played the role of the
doting husband to impress everyone.

1403
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:52,120
Be fair.

1404
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:13,520
Mrs. Zahide finally arrived.

1405
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:34,360
Thank goodness, there was no problem.

1406
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:37,280
I was afraid Müzeyyen would make a scene.

1407
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:42,360
But for some reason she kept quiet.

1408
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:47,760
Anyway.

1409
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:49,880
The night isn't over yet.

1410
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:51,440
God bless.

1411
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:56,760
She is coming.

1412
02:10:57,640 --> 02:11:00,320
I loved Mercan and Ateş's dance.

1413
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,120
They look so good together.

1414
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:08,680
Judging by the way they dance,
they are very much in love.

1415
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:13,800
It was a very profitable marriage
for both sides. What do you think?

1416
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,600
I congratulate not only
Mercan, but all of you.

1417
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:19,680
See you.

1418
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:20,840
Enjoy.

1419
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:26,720
She's trying to be clever.

1420
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:29,320
Anyway.

1421
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
It is good.

1422
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:36,200
She'll go and tell everything in
great detail to those who aren't here.

1423
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:38,240
Yes.

1424
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:41,080
It is good.

1425
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:54,720
Yaşar, everything is okay, right?

1426
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:57,040
You should double-check.

1427
02:11:57,120 --> 02:12:00,640
Don't worry, I checked twice.

1428
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:01,440
Everything.

1429
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:02,880
Okay.

1430
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:07,520
Where is Nezir, Yaşar?

1431
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:13,840
Walked away quickly after you danced with
Mr. Ateş, and I haven't seen him since.

1432
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:17,800
Was he going to give the opening speech?

1433
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:21,560
Right.

1434
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Okay.

1435
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:25,560
Don't panic.

1436
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:27,600
Obviously, I'll do it.

1437
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:28,840
I mean, I can.

1438
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:30,480
But I.

1439
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:34,880
I'll think about the opening
speech or have AI write it.

1440
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Okay.

1441
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:11,080
What is this?

1442
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:12,560
Read it.

1443
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:38,440
No.

1444
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:40,720
It's not real.

1445
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:42,720
There was nothing missing.

1446
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:44,400
No way.

1447
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:47,880
I told you that you couldn't
do anything without my knowledge.

1448
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:53,400
But you didn't take it seriously.

1449
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:58,000
You can't be that cruel.

1450
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:00,720
This project was my dream.

1451
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:02,640
You saw how hard I worked.
