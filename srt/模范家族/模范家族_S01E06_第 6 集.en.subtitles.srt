1
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,727
Why would you have Kkwang-chul do it?
I could always do it.

2
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,355
Getting the goods and giving payment
to the head cartel is an important matter.

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,524
Is there anyone
you can trust more than family?

4
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,776
Big conglomerates
keep it within the family.

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,987
Just wait. I have a plan.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,739
Fucking hell, wait for what?

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,199
It's a busy world.
We can't afford to wait around.

8
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,451
Forget it.

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,538
Send him to one of our distributors
in the countryside or something.

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,540
He keeps crossing paths with me.

11
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,501
I said wait. He needs to slip up first
for me to take action.

12
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,089
You're talking nonsense again.

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,092
You said the head cartel will kill us
if anything goes wrong,

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,261
but now you're waiting for him to slip up?

15
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,180
You want to end up dead while waiting?

16
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,557
Fuck, this is so frustrating.

17
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,644
I'll find something to get him with.
I said I'll find something.

18
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,107
Go ahead then.

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,153
You approved.
You can't take it back now. Okay?

20
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,134
INCHEON CHINATOWN - 3:00 P.M.
ONE BOTTLE

21
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,534
KANG EUN-JU

22
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,372
I want to run away.

23
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,796
Where did you go last night?
And what's wrong with your face?

24
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,923
I fell down a hill.

25
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,678
Byeong-gu is starting a business,
and he asked me to go in with him.

26
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,139
He said it's money
that he can't wire through a bank.

27
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,141
They're illegal funds or something.

28
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,284
Look at me and follow me.

29
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,621
That's right, keep coming along.

30
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,080
You're doing great.

31
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,211
My balloon!

32
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,798
It's too fast.

33
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,177
Walk slowly. You'll trip and fall.

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,433
I'm okay.

35
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,560
You have to go here, you idiot.

36
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,250
You're curious, aren't you?

37
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,918
As to why you're still alive.

38
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,673
You should listen to me
before you decide to kill me or not.

39
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,008
Why do you have to be so greedy?

40
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,595
Rumor has it
that you're going independent.

41
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,222
You're in for trouble.

42
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,267
Working with them
will only get you in trouble.

43
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,603
The boss gets to decide who we work with.

44
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,648
A petty bastard like you
has no say in the matter.

45
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,899
Where's the money?

46
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,236
There was an accident because
Kang-jun tried to intercept the money.

47
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,447
There's something you guys don't know.

48
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,116
-That bastard--
-I know.

49
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,534
I know he skims off the top.

50
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,703
Does that matter though?

51
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,371
All we need is the money.

52
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,331
If Kang-jun causes trouble,

53
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,209
it's going to affect all of you.

54
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,504
Work with me.

55
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,340
Give me a chance.

56
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,553
Just wait, I'll get a call soon.

57
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,515
These types of folks
like to keep things simple,

58
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,519
so they'll probably get rid of
all of you and set up a new board.

59
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,147
I found the money. I'll bring it to you.

60
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,190
So…

61
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,153
let me handle things.

62
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,779
I don't have a family.

63
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,907
I have no reason to be greedy.

64
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,118
Let me handle it.

65
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,454
I'll work like a dog for you.

66
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,934
Hello?

67
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:54,979
Yes.

68
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,358
I understand.

69
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,991
To be or not to be.

70
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,828
Wait.

71
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,873
Wait.

72
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,126
You fucking bastard!

73
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,881
It looks like Kwang-chul left to get
in contact with the head cartel, right?

74
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,468
But we missed our chance
because we're a bunch of dumbasses.

75
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,941
Isn't that the professor's wife's car?

76
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,574
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT

77
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,247
FAMILY RELATIONS CERTIFICATE
KANG EUN-JU

78
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,792
HANKUK UNIV. DROPOUT
FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE

79
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,497
Excuse me, is it your first time here?

80
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,332
Yes.

81
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,209
I can help you register first.

82
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,218
Excuse me.

83
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,803
Yes?

84
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,432
I'm not here to register…

85
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,643
I'm here for a delivery.

86
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,729
What delivery?

87
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,158
We already have
a water company we get deliveries from.

88
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,827
Well, the thing is

89
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,914
someone told me to come here.

90
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,084
Oh, ma'am!

91
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:27,465
This salesman is here to sell water,
I think. Can you talk to him?

92
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,805
Would you come this way?

93
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,026
Are you nuts?

94
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,612
Why didn't you go to the parking lot?

95
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,740
The parking lot? I was told to come here.

96
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,493
Let me see it.

97
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,417
Hello?

98
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,002
No.

99
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,631
This stupid idiot came here. Yeah.

100
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,717
He's coming up now. Bye.

101
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,601
Go.

102
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,813
Just follow the path.

103
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,647
Jeez, like anyone would steal
such petty cash.

104
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,822
It's always better
to hide your money and your weaknesses.

105
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,240
Sure.

106
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,993
Did you get a call from our weakness?

107
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,911
Not yet.

108
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,663
He must have died.

109
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,583
Even if he hasn't yet,
he'll get caught by the cops soon.

110
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,878
That fucking idiot has no idea
the cops are all over him.

111
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,797
When can we send out the goods?

112
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,885
We don't have anything to send.
There's not much left.

113
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,846
We need to pay the head cartel
if we want the goods.

114
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,224
At this rate,
we might have to sniff glue instead.

115
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,435
You have a delivery, sir.

116
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,696
What is it?

117
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,586
Hello?

118
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,972
Someone sent you a lifeline.

119
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,601
They want to work with
whoever puts out a better performance.

120
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,064
You know what's going to happen
if they stop making deals with you, right?

121
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,024
What about Yong-soo?

122
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,153
How did a dog who's afraid
of his owner think of biting?

123
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,741
Who do you think told me
that you were trying to go independent?

124
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,245
Don't worry about Yong-soo.

125
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,665
We apply the same rules to everyone.

126
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,711
I thought you said
you were going to work like a dog?

127
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,215
Then try and survive like a dog as well.

128
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,638
Kwang-chul, that motherfucker.
He turned on us, after all.

129
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,016
I'm not even surprised, jeez.

130
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,310
Let's kill him then.

131
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,272
The head cartel told us not to harm him.

132
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,324
Yong-soo.

133
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,996
I think Kkwang-chul's been
skimming our stuff off the top.

134
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,247
We're always a bit short.

135
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,583
He's taking them
and dealing with our clients.

136
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,627
He sent a delivery in Incheon today.

137
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,713
But the head cartel is
telling us not to harm him?

138
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:23,886
Let's just let the pigs deal
with Kkwang-chul, that bastard.

139
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,680
If the cops catch him,
the head cartel can't say shit.

140
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,891
Fucking hell, it's not like we did it.

141
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,354
Give it a go.

142
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,357
Things have already gotten out of hand.

143
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,651
Let's see how capable you are.

144
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,772
Nice!

145
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,191
-Cheers!
-Drink up.

146
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,903
-How many times has it been?
-Cheers!

147
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,573
Long time no see!

148
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,824
Hey, baby.

149
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,369
-All right, cheers.
-Cheers.

150
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,187
-Hey, give me your arm.
-Give me some too.

151
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,022
-Drink it already.
-I want some too.

152
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,440
-Wait.
-Hey, drink up.

153
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,692
I said drink.

154
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,985
I want some too.

155
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,281
It's my turn.

156
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,881
Korean chicken is fucking awesome.

157
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,133
-My sweet chicken!
-Help yourself.

158
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,511
What a beautiful sight.

159
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,222
Let's lay them out like this,
it'll be delicious.

160
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,015
So, who is he?

161
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,270
Hello.

162
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,065
Why are you standing there?

163
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,443
Come on, come here.

164
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,459
Why is this guy so zoned out?

165
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,629
-I've never seen him before.
-They probably sent another dumb junkie.

166
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,430
Hey, Hyun-woo.

167
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,099
I'm sorry.

168
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,560
You know where my card is, right?

169
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,812
-Order whatever you want with that.
-Okay.

170
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,313
All right. What about Yeon-woo?

171
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,858
She came home, but I don't see her.

172
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,942
Oh yeah?

173
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,318
Okay, I got you.

174
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,499
Damn it, he moved it.

175
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,426
Gather around!

176
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,929
The parking lot, underground corridor,
and the restaurant are access routes.

177
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,308
Seal off all the exits, and make sure
to arrest every single person!

178
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,517
-Yes, sir.
-Let's move!

179
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,769
Let's move!

180
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,903
What? Is this it?

181
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,822
I think this fucker messed up the order.

182
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,325
Fucking idiots…

183
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,911
-Is this really Kwang-chul's stuff?
-It is, you bastard.

184
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,750
I know your distribution centers are
getting busted by the police these days.

185
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,919
But I can't do business with this.

186
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,171
You're the one who called him!

187
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,881
Just shut up!

188
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,217
Just one? Not even two?

189
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,472
There should be at least three bottles
to run a business, not just one, you punk!

190
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,516
Hey!

191
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,683
Over there!

192
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,060
Hurry up!

193
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,481
What? Now?

194
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,569
The police are here.

195
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,324
Didn't you give them the money?

196
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,326
They're not with the one I paid.

197
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,330
Hey, who the hell are you?

198
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,541
Did Kwang-chul really send you?
Are you a cop?

199
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,086
No, I just delivered what they gave to me.

200
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,797
Who the hell are you? Answer me!

201
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,717
Hey, we should leave now. Let's go!

202
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,812
Okay, go in. Move!

203
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,980
Come on. Let's go!

204
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,860
PROFESSOR PARK

205
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,198
Pick up.

206
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,244
-The call has been…
-Only when he needs me. Asshole.

207
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,665
This way!

208
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,002
It's this way!

209
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,923
-Stop pushing!
-Let's get a move on, people!

210
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,717
-Quickly!
-Stop pushing!

211
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,558
They're coming down this way!
Fuck! It's the cops!

212
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,226
Run back up!

213
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,412
Hey, don't leave me!

214
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,334
They're over here!

215
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,960
Get them!

216
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,659
ESCAPE ROPE

217
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,747
Who do you think told me
you were trying to go independent?

218
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,541
Don't worry about Yong-soo.

219
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,002
We apply the same rules to everyone.

220
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,299
I thought you said
you were going to work like a dog?

221
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,177
Then try and survive like a dog.

222
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,976
JUNG-BAE

223
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,270
Sir, where are you?

224
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,563
We've run into a problem.

225
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,737
Damn it.

226
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,004
I want to turn myself in.

227
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,390
Hurry up and put everyone away!

228
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:49,975
Stay right there!

229
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,484
Think about your family.

230
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,154
If you do anything stupid,
your family will suffer for it.

231
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,363
Mr. Park Dong-ha.

232
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,993
Yes?

233
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,912
We knew about everything
before we went in there.

234
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,874
We received a tip-off
that there were drug dealings going on.

235
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,586
But, Mr. Park, why were you there
if you weren't going to do drugs?

236
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,464
You, Mr. Park,
are the most suspicious one.

237
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,341
Precisely because you're the cleanest.

238
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,093
You're not on drugs
and you teach students at a university.

239
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,054
And you're a breadwinner to a family.

240
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,098
You've never even had
to pay a fine in your life.

241
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,850
You're a real model citizen.

242
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,146
All right, be honest with me.

243
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,439
Why were you there?

244
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,567
I thought…

245
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,529
I could…

246
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,533
get a massage--

247
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,160
-A massage?
-Yes, sir.

248
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,579
Come on, you said
you were turning yourself in.

249
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,497
Yes.

250
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,833
For soliciting a prostitute--

251
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,418
Are you joking right now?

252
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,629
You think
we were going after prostitution?

253
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,257
I'm sorry, but like I already said,

254
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,885
I heard I could hook up--

255
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:07,928
Forget it.

256
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,264
I don't even drink and drive.

257
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,935
Excuse me,

258
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,855
will this be revealed
to my family or the school?

259
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,024
That's what I'm saying.

260
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,234
What are you doing?

261
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,825
Where did the tip-off come from?

262
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,077
An informant from Team Two.

263
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,871
The time and location were exact,

264
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,873
but there's not even a picture of the guy?

265
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:43,880
LIEUTENANT MOON JUNG-KOOK

266
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,428
-Hello?
-I have something to ask you.

267
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:54,057
I saw your report, and you know
the professor who called in with the tip?

268
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,101
Was his name Park Dong-ha?

269
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,644
Yes, why?

270
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,896
The Incheon Investigation Unit
did it again.

271
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,399
They arrested a bunch of drug offenders,

272
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,276
and he was one of them.

273
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,862
On drug charges?

274
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,071
No, not that.

275
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,949
For soliciting a prostitute.

276
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,873
But we had that location listed
as one of the Yongsoo Ring's clients.

277
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,792
I have no idea
how the Investigation Unit found out.

278
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,378
They said they found it
while going through their files,

279
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,130
but I thought I should let you know.

280
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,216
PARK DONG-HA - HANKUK UNIVERSITY
KANG EUN-JU - HANKUK UNIVERSITY

281
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,026
Eun-ju.

282
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,283
What were you doing there?

283
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,744
Where?

284
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,871
Stop stuttering and answer me.

285
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,212
Eun-ju, why are you acting like this?

286
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,715
What are you up to these days?

287
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:13,178
Why did you go to the police station?
And what's this about a massage parlor?

288
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,096
Eun-ju, let's not do this here.

289
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,098
Let's talk in the car.

290
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,102
Are you committing crimes?

291
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,064
-What are you talking about?
-What in the world are you up to?

292
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,191
Let's talk somewhere else.
Okay? Let's go in--

293
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,780
You were roped in because you stole money?

294
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,244
And they're threatening
to kill your wife and your kids?

295
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,623
I'll take care of everything, so--

296
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,874
Delivering drugs?

297
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,880
Are you insane?

298
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,299
Are you trying
to get your whole family killed?

299
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,760
Start the car. Let's go to the police.

300
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,056
They might be tailing me.

301
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,267
If they find out,

302
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,104
they might harm our family. And…

303
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,525
I'm not doing this by choice.
I'm doing this for our family--

304
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,403
Our kids' lives are on the line,
and you're doing this for us?

305
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,990
What have you done for our family?
You don't deserve to say things like that.

306
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,534
Tell me what you've done for our family!

307
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,203
You must have really lost your mind.

308
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,207
I'm going to report you right now.

309
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,800
Eun-ju!

310
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,012
Let go. I'm going to protect
Yeon-woo and Hyun-woo.

311
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,181
I've been the one protecting
our family this whole time, not you.

312
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,685
I don't care what you do anymore.

313
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,895
Am I…

314
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,357
Am I not family to you?

315
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,278
You're not. Not anymore.

316
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,040
Then what did you do?

317
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,087
Having an affair?

318
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,094
And asking me

319
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,680
for a divorce because of that?

320
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,144
You're the one trying
to break apart our family, not me.

321
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,493
Get going.

322
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,620
Go back home.

323
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,860
All the guys here knew about it?

324
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,990
Min-gyu used to work for Kang-jun, right?

325
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,159
How should we handle the situation?

326
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,704
If you just give me the order,
I can take him out.

327
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,707
If we leave him, this will keep happening.

328
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,837
Let's get going for now.

329
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,267
Then what did you do for us?

330
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,187
Having an affair?

331
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,526
You're the one trying
to break apart our family, not me.

332
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,870
I think Kwang-chul's here.

333
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,418
Find someone for me.

334
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,923
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT
PARK DEUK-SOO

335
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,512
Am I…

336
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,306
Am I not family to you?

337
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,558
You're not.

338
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,268
Not anymore.

339
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,922
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

340
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,183
Jung-bae.

341
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,646
It's a misunderstanding.

342
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,441
It's a misunderstanding.

343
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,946
Listen to me, Jung-bae.

344
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,198
Wait, just hear me out.

345
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,826
Jung-bae.

346
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,416
Jung-bae.

347
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,501
It's a misunderstanding.

348
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,462
This was before the liberalization
of overseas travel.

349
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,841
It was hard for the average person
to go overseas in those days.

350
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,635
It was during the heyday of boxing.

351
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,888
Although I was unknown at the time,

352
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,181
I fought as a middleweight
for the opening match.

353
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,852
And they don't just let anyone
compete in the opening fight.

354
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:39,564
But you have no idea
how beautiful Santa Monica beach looked

355
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,316
when I first went to L.A. back then.

356
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,319
I remember shadowboxing

357
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,237
on that beautiful beach.

358
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,824
This is probably what heaven is like,
is what I thought.

359
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,660
I'd love to visit again
at least once before I die…

360
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,788
Santa Monica beach sure is beautiful.

361
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,081
Exactly.

362
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,166
How do you know?

363
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,627
Did you see it in a movie or something?

364
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,463
-No, it was while I was studying abroad.
-Studying abroad?

365
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,843
Was there a university near Santa Monica?

366
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,640
We went off-topic for a second,

367
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:17,435
but what I wanted to say is that

368
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,437
you and I have a lot in common.

369
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,147
From our personalities,

370
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,691
to Santa Monica…

371
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,742
You said

372
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,495
you don't have any children, right?

373
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,791
They say being childless is better.

374
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,127
If two lonely people
can rely on each other,

375
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,338
it's much better than having any children.

376
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,257
Is that so?

377
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,428
When were you bereaved of your husband?

378
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,348
He ran a hospital, right?

379
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,231
You don't have to get out.

380
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,692
The next one is on me.

381
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,776
What do you mean?

382
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,028
You can treat me once I go broke.

383
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,950
I've never had a woman pay for my meal.

384
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:15,868
Sun-ok.

385
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,371
Drive safely.

386
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,540
See you later.

387
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,541
Take care.

388
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,220
Hey.

389
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,212
Thank you.

390
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,892
This is costing me a lot.

391
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,772
I haven't even paid for my room.

392
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,400
Jeez.

393
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,403
GO HANKUK
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

394
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,282
YOO HAN-CHEOL

395
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,577
Is he the right guy?

396
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,455
Yes, he is.

397
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,708
Okay. Did you go to university with him?

398
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,919
No, we didn't go to school together.

399
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,214
You must have lost touch with him.

400
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,144
YOO HAN-CHEOL

401
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,363
You fucking ignored me
when I asked to do it.

402
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:19,659
FISHING CONVENIENCE STORE

403
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,786
The situation's different now.

404
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,996
Are you struggling a bit these days?

405
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,583
I'm not just struggling.

406
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,919
I'm dying here.

407
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,924
But our stuff might not be up to par.

408
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,551
Just bring me anything.

409
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,345
Our distribution network
will earn you a lot.

410
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,681
Sounds good.

411
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,642
By the way,

412
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,396
isn't it a bad idea
to go behind their backs?

413
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,605
They're a scary bunch.

414
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,983
They started it,
so that's why I came to you.

415
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:59,073
Business has turned into a mess
ever since that punk joined.

416
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,201
No one is as good as Kwang-chul.

417
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,871
What a shame.

418
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,582
If I don't kill that bastard,
I'll be the one to die.

419
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,469
Sir.

420
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:27,977
Sit down.

421
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,452
Eat up. It's getting cold.

422
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,548
Min-gyu.

423
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,967
Yes, sir.

424
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,803
-How's your mother?
-Sorry?

425
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,182
Yes, she's doing fine, sir.

426
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,936
Her 70th birthday party was years ago.

427
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,063
She's probably aged quite a bit.

428
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,528
Call her regularly
even if you don't visit her often.

429
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,324
I'm an orphan, so I've always been jealous
of people who have their moms.

430
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,414
You don't know
what it's like to be abandoned.

431
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,332
Sir.

432
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,459
Just this once.

433
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,754
Please just let me off this once.

434
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,756
I won't make excuses.

435
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,387
Please don't kill me, sir.

436
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,316
Come with me, and you'll live.
If you go alone, you'll die.

437
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,488
Eat up.

438
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,991
And we can leave together.

439
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,768
Hello,

440
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,812
this is Park Deuk-soo.

441
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,566
Sun-ok?

442
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,611
I thought you had dinner plans,
what's going on?

443
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,031
Did it get canceled?

444
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,284
You're coming right now?

445
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,204
Oh, dear.

446
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:56,667
You're not making it easy for me
by calling me on such short notice.

447
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,628
I haven't even showered yet.

448
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,797
What?

449
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,634
Oh boy! 30 minutes?

450
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:11,015
Goodness, take your time, all right?

451
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,851
I told you, I haven't even showered yet.

452
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,228
Well, you miss me so much,

453
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,814
so what can I do?

454
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,649
All right, then. Sure.

455
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,987
Take your time.

456
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,323
Okay. I'll see you soon.

457
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,575
All right, Sun-ok.

458
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,998
Gosh, I'm in serious trouble.

459
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,835
It'll take me more than 20 minutes
to get to the apartment by taxi.

460
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,921
Goodness me.

461
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,547
Shut up, would you?

462
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,385
Hey, asshole.

463
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,429
How about you stop watching
all that porn at night?

464
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,764
You hear me?

465
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,476
You punk…

466
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,521
This is killing me.

467
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,940
Fucking punk.

468
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,069
DAESEONG STUDY ROOMS

469
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,570
It's hot.

470
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,659
Mr. Park Deuk-soo?

471
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,993
"Park Deuk-soo"?

472
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,453
The guy from Room 302?

473
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,247
He's sleeping. You can go check.

474
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,374
Do I look like him?

475
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,668
Come on, you're Park Deuk-soo.

476
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,545
Do you want to get cuffed or cooperate?

477
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,338
You've got the wrong person.

478
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,591
-Do I need to show you my ID?
-Come on now! I don't need your fake ID.

479
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,218
What do you mean fake?

480
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,347
Let me just cuff you.

481
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,473
Damn it!

482
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,809
Fine.

483
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,396
Let me just make a call.

484
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,650
Sun-ok? I don't know how to put this,

485
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,694
but I don't think I can meet you today.

486
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,489
I have a Rotary Club
members' meeting today,

487
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,991
but I forgot all about it.

488
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,910
I must be getting old.

489
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,288
I'm so forgetful, like an old broken lamp.

490
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,918
All right, then.

491
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,004
I'll call you again sometime soon.

492
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,632
I'm so sorry, Sun-ok.

493
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,053
Damn it…

494
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,764
I was so close
to wrapping this one up too.

495
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,351
-Just get in.
-Jeez.

496
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:24,940
Gosh.

497
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,945
Miss, are you in here
because you got caught,

498
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,614
or are you in here for work?

499
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,702
What the… Are you a detective?

500
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:42,875
I didn't do anything wrong for a beautiful
detective like you to be worried about.

501
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,838
For someone
who has seven prior convictions,

502
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,715
isn't dine and dash a bit beneath you?

503
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,925
Exactly.

504
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,719
Isn't this a waste of your power?

505
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,888
There are so many bad guys out there.

506
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,473
Don't you think so, miss?

507
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,142
-Mr. Park Deuk-soo.
-Yes.

508
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,435
Tell me your wishes.

509
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:06,232
Judging from the long introduction,
I doubt you're trying to toss me in jail.

510
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,692
What do you want to do with me?

511
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,778
Let's do a job together.

512
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,881
Go home and feed your kids.

513
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,050
-Don't just sit there.
-Mom.

514
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,805
Can I just live here
with you and the kids?

515
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,456
All right, ten, nine, eight,

516
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:10,754
seven, six, five, four, three,

517
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,049
two, one, it's time!

518
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,184
YOO HAN-CHEOL

519
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,150
DELETE

520
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:55,132
Is this neighborhood
a cemetery or something?

521
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,508
Why is it so quiet?

522
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,906
-Who could that be?
-If it's Mom, I'm not going out.

523
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,034
It can't be someone in our family.
We all know the passcode.

524
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,370
You're right.

525
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,916
Who is it?

526
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,547
Who are you?

527
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,843
Is this Mr. Park Dong-ha's house?

528
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,429
Yes. How can I help you?

529
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,140
You shouldn't open the door to strangers.

530
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,351
You have no idea
how scary the world can be!

531
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,645
Your parents did
a terrible job of raising you.

532
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,271
Okay, but who are you?

533
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:57,069
