1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,205
The man buried in the yard

2
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,708
was apparently a police officer.

3
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,253
The cops were already in the neighborhood

4
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,756
and they've been
watching us the entire time.

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,757
I know.

6
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,722
They'll find out
about that body in the yard.

7
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,600
It's only a matter of time.

8
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,869
The head cartel told me to take you out.

9
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,206
Whether I do what they say or not,

10
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm a dead man either way.

11
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,921
If I don't do anything,
I'll die at the hands of the head cartel.

12
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,800
And if I turn myself in to the police,

13
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,261
you and your guys are going to kill me.

14
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,182
You have no intention of letting me go.

15
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,937
Tell Kang-jun that
you're meeting me tonight.

16
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,155
You have to find a way to survive…

17
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:58,910
like a dog.

18
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,003
Hey.

19
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,507
Talk to me.

20
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,514
You're the one who asked me
to kill Kkwang-chul, you bastard.

21
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,433
Fuck.

22
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,896
You're a fucking monster.

23
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,698
Jung-bae.

24
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,451
Let's stay alive together.

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,037
I know…

26
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,250
where the head cartel is, okay?

27
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,880
If I go and lure them…

28
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,756
Motherfucker.

29
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,104
Get rid of him.

30
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,703
You never said anything about killing him.

31
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,079
Go back home.

32
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,957
I thought we were going
to catch the head cartel, or whatever.

33
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,334
Go home and wait

34
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,211
until we contact you.

35
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,500
Oh gosh, what in the world?

36
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,795
POLICE

37
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,132
We are close to the bottom of the hill.

38
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,634
Nothing to report just yet.

39
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,969
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,221
What's going on?

41
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,722
Goodness. What happened?

42
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,608
-You can't go in.
-I live here.

43
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,235
Okay. You can head in.

44
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,531
-Wait.
-You're not supposed to be here.

45
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,657
But this is my house.

46
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,077
You're checking over here too, right?
Forensics hasn't found anything yet?

47
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,169
Go more to the right.

48
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,007
I don't think there's anything here, sir.

49
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,559
We are close to the bottom of the hill…

50
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,893
Call us later.

51
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,353
All right.

52
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,607
When the suspect appears,
make sure you keep your eyes on him.

53
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,530
Alpha One Captain, copy.

54
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,283
There's nothing unusual
in the house, either.

55
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,704
-Let's wrap it up.
-Yes, sir.

56
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,914
Wrap it up!

57
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,417
Good job everyone. Let's head out.

58
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,585
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,003
Detective Kang.

60
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,255
Hey, that's enough.
Let's pack it up, guys.

61
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,590
Follow me.

62
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,091
Yes, sir. We'll pack it up.

63
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,973
You think I won't be able
to find him, don't you?

64
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,810
I'll search through
the depths of hell if I have to.

65
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,687
He was dear to me,

66
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,108
as your family is to you.

67
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,112
And once I do,
I will burn this place down.

68
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,584
When the suspect appears,
make sure you keep your eyes on him.

69
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:20,064
Three, zero, eight, seven.
Sinyeong 3-dong, public parking, row B.

70
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,358
Number 35, Starex.

71
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,279
What is this place?

72
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,326
Fuck.

73
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,792
I told Eun-ju to stay
at the hospital with Hyun-woo.

74
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,754
What happened here?

75
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,425
My nails are a mess.

76
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,926
It was tough.

77
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,928
Where did you bury the corpses?

78
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,597
In the next-door neighbor's yard.

79
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,266
That guy's yard is huge.

80
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,145
That punk killed them
and buried them there.

81
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,441
The police are looking for him,
so it's going to be over for him soon.

82
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,195
You have to keep your head low until then.
Don't do anything.

83
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,863
Do you understand?

84
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:13,993
Dong-ha.

85
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,413
You can't stray too far.

86
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,126
It'll only make it harder
for you to come back to your family.

87
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,339
Remember that.

88
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,943
I don't know anything.

89
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,444
When I get the calls,

90
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,947
I just send text messages
to the number they give me.

91
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,198
I just relay messages.

92
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,783
That's really it.

93
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,201
Do you know the number 2335?

94
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,040
When the call comes in, I get the number
I'm supposed to send it to.

95
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,919
They said for each text I send,
they'd pay me three million won.

96
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,379
Can you reach the boss?

97
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,360
The person you are trying to reach
is not available--

98
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,712
I heard you got yourself a girl.
What does she do?

99
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,881
Let me have some fun, too.

100
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,049
Hook me up, man.

101
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,968
You're crazy, man.

102
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,721
Yes, sir.

103
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,681
We're on our way.

104
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,767
Yes.

105
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,477
Okay. I understand, sir.

106
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,855
-Why?
-What? It's nothing.

107
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,190
Why, what is it?

108
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,859
Hey, pull over to the side.

109
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,069
I need to take a piss.

110
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,404
Hey, Myeong-su.

111
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,407
-You motherfucker--
-Son of a bitch!

112
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,368
Hey, fucking, wait!

113
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,290
I told you I was going to get exposed.

114
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,708
You bastards!

115
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,508
Eun-ju.

116
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,468
Please…

117
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,470
help me.

118
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,306
There's not a single person…

119
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,310
-The person you are trying to reach…
-…I can trust.

120
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,728
Eun-ju…

121
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,817
You have to find a way
to survive like a dog.

122
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,531
Save…

123
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:21,949
me.

124
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,868
You can't stray too far.

125
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,955
It'll only make it harder
for you to come back to your family.

126
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,708
I'll search through
the depths of hell if I have to.

127
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,043
And once I do,
I'm going to burn this place down.

128
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,099
It's done.

129
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,393
Good job.

130
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,313
Is that professor's family
that important to us?

131
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,107
Enough to go against the head cartel?

132
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,744
Dokki, we need to move locations.
Have the ledger ready.

133
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,995
I'll be there tomorrow.

134
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,298
There's one more body buried
somewhere here.

135
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,012
I buried it with Yong-soo a long time ago.

136
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,098
It's been so long
that I don't know where it is.

137
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,562
But this is where my life
got all messed up.

138
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,025
Jung-bae.

139
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,819
Yes, sir.

140
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,201
Even if I end up dying,
I need to put an end to this.

141
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,161
What are you hiding?

142
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,999
We were out there in the middle
of the night and made all that mess.

143
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,169
Yet we found nothing.
Where's the proof tied to the head cartel?

144
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,420
It was there.

145
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,631
But he moved it.

146
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,973
What do you think you're doing with
your own family in the interrogation room?

147
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,350
Family's a really funny thing.

148
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,271
They growl at each other like enemies
but never turn their backs on them.

149
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,439
We say we're a police family,

150
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,068
but we're always fucking betraying
and stabbing each other in the back.

151
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,611
We're not family.

152
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,489
They're a real family.

153
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,995
You're overreacting, Lieutenant.

154
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,581
We were just talking.

155
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,958
May I leave?

156
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,086
I'll take whatever reprimand
you throw at me.

157
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,783
I'm the only one.

158
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,162
Everyone has a family,
and I'm the only one that's single.

159
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,539
If anything happens to go wrong,

160
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,251
there's no one who would really care.

161
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,629
I'd care. It'd mess with my promotion.

162
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,756
Is that so?

163
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,347
Joo-hyun, don't leave
a single trace of evidence,

164
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,183
and don't trust anyone.

165
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,270
Are you someone I can trust?

166
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,693
I need at least one person I can trust.

167
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,950
Stop making a fuss.
No one knows you're a cop.

168
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,160
Damn it, whatever.

169
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,662
I need to get out of here.

170
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,289
They're delivering cash
to the head cartel soon.

171
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,208
-Just hang in there.
-Listen, I…

172
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,418
I think they're going to kill me.

173
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,969
Detective. Jeez.

174
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,431
It smells like an ashtray in here.
Come on, open the windows.

175
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,187
How's the lookout team?

176
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,439
They're playing with their kids.

177
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,735
I heard the kids are loving
that their dads are suspended from duty.

178
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,404
What did you get on the lieutenant?

179
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,906
I did my best to find something,

180
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,036
and I couldn't come up with squat.
But guess what I found in my back pocket?

181
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,624
Do you know what's on this thing?

182
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,420
You're not going to believe it
when you see it.

183
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,014
You made a copy, right?
I'll look at it later.

184
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,682
Where you going?

185
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,945
KANG JOO-HYUN

186
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,284
The person you are trying to--

187
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,000
Where is he?

188
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,505
The SD card is missing.

189
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,175
PLEASE INSERT AN SD CARD

190
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,053
We say we're a police family,

191
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,431
but we're always fucking betraying
and stabbing each other in the back.

192
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,100
We're not family.

193
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,726
You're overreacting, Lieutenant.

194
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,770
We were just talking.

195
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,679
No…

196
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,247
COPYING FILES

197
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,009
This shit is happening

198
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,511
because you killed Han-cheol
in the first place.

199
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,514
If it wasn't Han-cheol,
then it would've been us who died.

200
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,725
What are you going to do now?

201
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,644
-Fuck, you should have done the job right!
-Crazy bastards.

202
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,855
What's the point?

203
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,148
She didn't even eat.

204
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,609
Forget the money.
Everything's ruined, idiot.

205
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,986
I told you to send the cops,
and you betray me?

206
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,072
What, were you trying
to get rid of me too?

207
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,035
You fucking bastard. I agreed to raid
the place after you took the money--

208
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,254
Oh shit!

209
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,176
DETECTIVE KANG JOO-HYUN

210
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,571
Hello, Lieutenant.

211
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,033
-You never come outside to greet me.
-Oh well…

212
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,749
Detective Kang asked me to help her pack,
so I got dragged out here.

213
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,593
This is where we usually eat,
but she didn't eat and just left.

214
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,350
That's just where she rests.

215
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,826
Where is Joo-hyun?

216
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,203
I'm not sure.
She wasn't here when I got here.

217
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,708
-Can I get you something to drink?
-Sure.

218
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,544
-How about a cup of coffee?
-Yes, ma'am.

219
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,026
We only have instant--

220
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,060
Yun-seok.

221
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,561
Yun-seok.

222
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,939
Cha Yun-seok!

223
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,941
Wake up, Yun-seok!

224
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,442
Yun-seok!

225
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,528
Oh, no…

226
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,135
Oh shit!

227
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,103
RECORDING

228
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,026
-Hello, Lieutenant.
-You never come outside to greet me.

229
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,361
What brings you here?

230
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,906
Detective Kang asked me to help her pack,
so I got dragged out here.

231
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,409
That's just where she rests.

232
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,832
Where is Joo-hyun?

233
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,418
I'm not sure.
She wasn't here when I got here.

234
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,879
-Can I get you something to drink?
-Sure.

235
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,715
-How about a cup of coffee?
-Yes, ma'am.

236
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,059
-This way, shoot!
-Over there.

237
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,645
It's here! I got you!

238
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,562
No!

239
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,981
No, it's too cold!

240
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,901
Hey, come on, just give it to me.

241
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,111
Dad.

242
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,406
You kids…

243
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,367
Bring it on!

244
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,161
Hey, Chang-su.

245
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,539
Stop that now.

246
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,165
-Wait, hold on.
-Okay.

247
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,960
Hey. What brings you here?

248
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,086
Hello.

249
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,215
You guys look great.

250
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,134
Is there something going on?

251
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,261
What about Yun-seok?

252
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,431
I need your help.

253
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,936
Go on.

254
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,230
Take care of the rest for me.

255
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,482
Wait, what's going on right now…

256
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,401
I'll get changed first. Just wait here.

257
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,402
It's fine.

258
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,653
It's so pretty!

259
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,863
He's at Seongu Hospital.

260
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,617
Go be with Yun-seok.

261
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,462
I'll go with you, sir.

262
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,052
No. This is something
I have to finish myself.

263
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,105
Shit…

264
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,744
Goddammit…

265
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,972
What are you trying to do?

266
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,265
Why are you doing this?

267
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,683
Aren't you used to it?

268
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,395
This is how you guys deal with dogs.

269
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,563
Fuck, man.

270
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,358
Was all of that really necessary?

271
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,488
All you had to do was
get rid of that professor

272
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,532
and lay low for a while.

273
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,493
Would you have let me live if I laid low?

274
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,036
No.

275
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,248
You had no intention
of doing that from the start.

276
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,125
You're just a fucking errand boy.

277
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,962
It was never your choice to begin with.

278
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,756
Where's your owner?

279
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,384
It doesn't matter what you do.
Nothing's going to change.

280
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,096
Don't waste your energy.

281
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,890
You don't have to answer.

282
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,687
I know how you guys work.

283
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,814
Crazy bastard.

284
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,861
You think this is the end of it,
don't you?

285
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,739
You crossed the line.

286
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,800
Are you someone I can trust?

287
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,304
I need at least one person I can trust.

288
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,885
Contact me if you want to talk.

289
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,097
SENDING MESSAGE
MESSAGE SENT

290
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,630
OUR COUNTRY'S HARD-WORKING POLICE

291
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,478
Joo-hyun,

292
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,981
don't leave a single trace of evidence,

293
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,484
and don't trust anyone.

294
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,559
MORTUARY

295
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,563
Asshole…

296
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,899
The dead bodies of two men were found

297
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,318
in the front yard of a house
in Yongbong Village.

298
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,654
One of the two was
a member of a major drug ring

299
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,989
that is currently under investigation.

300
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,783
The other man was as an officer…

301
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,829
Several stab wounds were found
on the abdomen and neck of both corpses.

302
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,332
Considering the circumstances, it seems
that the two men stabbed each other…

303
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,210
The body appears to belong
to the recently missing, "Mr. B."

304
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,631
Police revealed that the body showed
evidence of heavy damage and torture…

305
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,133
This is breaking news.

306
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,262
The identity of the man found
burnt to death in the salt flat fires

307
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,098
was identified to be a narcotics agent
working with the SIU…

308
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,518
The shooting incident that occurred
yesterday at Yongnam Police Station

309
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,604
resulted in the death
of Narcotics Squad Lieutenant Moon.

310
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,983
The officer that fired the gun,
Detective Kang, was arrested immediately.

311
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,027
Kang's motive
for shooting Lieutenant Moon was that

312
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,114
Moon was part of the drug syndicate
known as the head cartel…

313
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,826
After a shooting occurred
inside the Yongnam Police station…

314
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,787
At today's press conference at the NPS,
it was reported that

315
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,789
the shooting incident,
the salt flat fires,

316
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,834
as well as the Yongbong Village
burial sites may all be connected…

317
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,712
The police are currently
tracking down the locations of Hwang,

318
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,215
the boss of the Yongsoo Ring in Seoul,
a lower-tier head cartel distributor,

319
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,969
and Kim, the boss
of the Seagull Ring in Busan.

320
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,971
Let's check in with reporter Lee Ji-won.

321
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,640
The head cartel supplied
these distribution rings

322
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,726
with undiluted solutions
of methamphetamine,

323
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,603
in the form of water bottles.

324
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,688
The Chief of Police, Nam Gi-ho,
revealed that

325
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,567
the narcotics squad lieutenant was
most likely working as a double agent.

326
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,905
Chief of Police, Nam Gi-ho,
apologized for any disappointment

327
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:43,034
the citizens might have felt
due to police involvement in the fiasco…

328
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,741
It's a mismatch for Hyun-woo again.

329
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,953
We'll have to wait again

330
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,121
for his surgery.

331
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,624
I see.

332
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,966
Is everything over on your end?

333
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,259
Do you remember?

334
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,594
A while back,

335
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,013
at the end of the year…

336
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,019
we had a New Year's Eve party.

337
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:57,441
Yeon-woo made Hyun-woo cry
because he took a bite of the cake first.

338
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,443
It was a total mess.

339
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,364
I took a video with my camcorder…

340
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,827
but I think I lost it.

341
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,079
I can't find it anywhere.

342
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,832
You didn't lose it.

343
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,085
It should be in Hyun-woo's drawer.

344
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,586
Really?

345
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,549
That's a relief.

346
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,011
Eun-ju.

347
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,431
Why did we end up like this?

348
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,642
We used to be happy.

349
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,063
What's the reason

350
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,066
that I can't be a family to you?

351
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,116
Why do you want to…

352
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,411
break up?

353
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,127
I…

354
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,715
turned into a completely invisible nobody

355
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,219
after becoming a family with you.

356
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,943
It's been like that for a while,
but that doesn't mean there's a problem.

357
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,572
Airplanes have an order of landing.

358
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,826
That plane is circling in the sky
and waiting for its turn.

359
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,709
Dad.

360
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,752
Yes?

361
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,922
Do you think it's better
for the family if I stay sick,

362
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,882
or if I get better quickly?

363
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,301
Whenever I'm sick,

364
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,053
our whole family comes together.

365
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,273
That plane will probably land
without a problem, right?

366
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,859
Before it runs out of fuel?

367
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,532
Of course.

368
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,001
Dong-ha.

369
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,223
Back then,

370
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,934
I strayed too far from you.

371
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,857
I'm sorry.

372
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,067
HAPPY NEW YEAR

373
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,652
Hyun-woo, look at Dad.

374
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,159
Yeon-woo, Hyun-woo, let's go!

375
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,202
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

376
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,536
Hyun-woo, let's go!

377
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,663
-Here we go!
-Let's go!

378
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,378
All right, get ready.

379
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,505
I'm going now.

380
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,173
Daddy's going now!

381
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,467
It's the countdown now! Here we go.

382
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,636
All right, ten!

383
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,598
-Nine! Eight! Seven!
-Nine! Eight! Seven!

384
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,602
-Six! Five! Four!
-Six! Five! Four!

385
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,022
-Three! Two! One!
-Three! Two! One!

386
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,658
Do you think…

387
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,620
we can forget everything that happened

388
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,832
and go back to that party?

389
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,879
YONGNAM POLICE STATION

390
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,096
Hello, this is 112 emergency dispatch.

391
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,975
I have something to report
regarding the Yongbong Village case.

392
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,395
I'd like to do it in person.

393
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,148
I'll go to the police station today.

394
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,555
Mr. Park Dong-ha?

395
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,349
Yes.

396
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,519
Who is this?

397
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,854
Keep that phone safe.

398
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,315
The lives of your family depend on it.

399
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,944
All right then. I'll be seeing you soon.

400
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:05,948
IN LOVING MEMORY OF NAM MUN-CHEOL
