1
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:12,846
Knock knock.

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,348
Eun-ju, look over here.

3
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,061
What are you doing?

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,396
I'm filming you.

5
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,859
Don't film me.

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,986
No, I'm going to keep filming.

7
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,070
Stop it.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,991
Wow. Eun-ju, you still got it.
You're still so pretty.

9
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,492
-Please.
-Smile.

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,414
All right…

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,134
You really haven't changed one bit.

12
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,471
Lucky you.

13
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,734
KANG EUN-JU

14
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,313
KANG EUN-JU - I CAN'T SEEM TO REACH YOU
MISSED CALL

15
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,028
KANG EUN-JU - IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
I CAN'T SEEM TO REACH YOU

16
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,098
Can you call me?

17
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,391
Hang on.

18
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,601
Are you busy?

19
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,228
Yeah, I have a lot going on.
I'll call you later.

20
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,897
Do you have time on Wednesday?

21
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,356
Is Thursday okay?

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,067
-Did you get home safely yesterday?
-Yeah, you?

23
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,903
I'm at my parent's house.

24
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,322
It was so hectic
that I just saw your missed call.

25
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,615
Is everything okay?

26
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,203
I can't seem to reach you.

27
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,093
Knock, knock.

28
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,762
Eun-ju.

29
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,514
What are you doing?

30
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,309
I'm filming you.

31
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,564
-Don't film me.
-No, I'm going to keep filming.

32
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,191
-Stop it.
-Gosh.

33
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,401
Eun-ju, you're still so pretty.

34
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,778
-Please.
-Smile.

35
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,375
You really haven't changed one bit.

36
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,753
Lucky you.

37
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,859
The Yongsoo Ring is a group
that distributes drugs around the nation.

38
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:41,072
When the head cartel supplies the drugs,
they distribute them.

39
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,075
Once they get money from selling drugs,
they take a cut

40
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,286
and send the rest to the head cartel.

41
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,830
We received a hot tip,

42
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,666
so we tracked the delivery van
headed for the head cartel.

43
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,959
But we lost it.

44
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,421
We lost all contact,
and we haven't gotten any updates.

45
00:04:56,504 --> 00:05:00,216
You guys were running your damn mouths
about breaking into the head cartel!

46
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,468
You had everyone on standby
and messed it up?

47
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,886
What's your next move?

48
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,598
-Are you going to give up?
-I spent two years on this case.

49
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,726
I can't give up.

50
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,727
Do you have a plan?

51
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,314
Before going missing, he told me
he had some important information.

52
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,279
But finding one of our own comes first.
Even if it's a dead body.

53
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,989
But no one has found him!

54
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,992
-We need to track his phone.
-Get your head straight, man.

55
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,079
"Your Honor, we lost one of our men
while running an illegal investigation."

56
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,998
"Could you help with a warrant, please?"

57
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,750
Is that what you're going to say?

58
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,251
If any of this gets out,

59
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,503
you think we'll just lose our badges?

60
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,339
So, we need to find a way to--

61
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,049
Keep looking into the head cartel,

62
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,218
and get rid of anything that has to do
with the undercover operation.

63
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,887
It never happened.

64
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,139
Kang Joo-hyun, do you understand?

65
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,557
Fuck.

66
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,741
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT
YOO HAN-CHEOL

67
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,041
-Hello.
-Where's the car?

68
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,293
It's still at the Pass-one parking lot.

69
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,004
-What about Kwang-chul?
-I'm looking for him.

70
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,177
Hey, put on your masks, man.

71
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,095
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,154
-Is this stuff going out tomorrow?
-Yes.

73
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,283
Make sure you don't mix them up.

74
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,412
You don't want some guy
boiling a pack of ramen to start tweaking.

75
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,382
Damn it.

76
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,478
Did this motherfucker
really die or something?

77
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,658
What are you looking at?

78
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,452
It's just…

79
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,956
I mean, you sitting right next to me
reminds me…

80
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,042
of an ex-girlfriend of mine.

81
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,879
Who's better, me or her?

82
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,214
Oh jeez. You're so much better.

83
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,841
You interested?

84
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,759
I thought…

85
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,762
I thought we weren't allowed
to date other detectives.

86
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,347
We aren't.

87
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,641
It never ends well.

88
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,729
Well, you never know unless you start…

89
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,023
Damn it, you're getting too cheeky.

90
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,652
What you're interested in is
if I'm hiding something from you, right?

91
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,778
No, I mean…

92
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,532
One of our informants went undercover
into Kwang-chul's gang.

93
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,784
Why wouldn't you tell me
something like that?

94
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,828
That's the whole point
of being undercover.

95
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,663
Wow. Seriously…

96
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,999
Talk about love for your colleagues.

97
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,000
I know.

98
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,545
That's one thing I have in spades.

99
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,887
The delivery van is on the move.

100
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,394
-So, he hasn't found it yet?
-No, sir.

101
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,023
Then what the hell is
that Kwang-chul doing right now?

102
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,108
I heard he moved into the suburbs.

103
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,486
Where?

104
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,240
I don't have any of the details.
All I heard was that it was the suburbs.

105
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,243
He's living the life
while we're all about to die.

106
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,953
Make sure everything goes smoothly.

107
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,870
Yes, sir.

108
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,047
-Gosh, you scared me!
-Shit.

109
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,926
-You guys are working hard.
-Hello.

110
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,845
They scrapped it.

111
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,348
I guess we can't salvage
anything any more.

112
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,893
Gosh. These morons
took a perfectly good van and just…

113
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,938
What do we chase now?

114
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,398
What about Kwang-chul?

115
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,025
He's going around
trying to fix the delivery mess-up.

116
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,527
He's been gone since yesterday.

117
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,363
Yong-soo looked
pretty pissed off at Kwang-chul.

118
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,823
Wait, how did you know

119
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,493
that the delivery van was headed
to the head cartel?

120
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,331
One of the guys on the delivery
was apparently on our side.

121
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,125
Undercover?

122
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,085
Hold on. Who?

123
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,004
Why didn't we know?

124
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,842
Isn't that the whole point
of being undercover?

125
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,177
You two follow him.
We need to go somewhere else.

126
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,931
-We'll be heading out then.
-Hey, Yun-seok.

127
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,391
-What?
-Come over here.

128
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,311
Are you getting cheeky
because Joo-hyun keeps you next to her?

129
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,522
The whole point of being what?
You're pushing it, rookie.

130
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,232
-Come on.
-Watch it.

131
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,236
You should've gotten on her good side.
Life is all about connections.

132
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,238
-Get over here, come here.
-A car's coming.

133
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,198
Bye.

134
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,910
-What should we do with him?
-Jeez. He's a cheeky one.

135
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,662
Here.

136
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,313
It's an abandoned house, but it will do.

137
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,649
Do you need anything else, sir?

138
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,692
That house over there.

139
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,403
The lights were on all night.

140
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,947
-The house with the dog?
-Yeah.

141
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,326
Some weird bastard
is living all alone in that big house.

142
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,745
-Look into it.
-Yes, sir.

143
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,790
That family left early in the morning.

144
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,751
Check if they're moving or running away.

145
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,003
Do you have pictures
of the two missing guys?

146
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:11,921
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,549
Spread them around to all the spots
they might hit with the cash.

148
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,886
Have them call us even if it's not them.

149
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,723
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, and be discreet.

150
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,600
Word might spread.

151
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,143
Yes, sir.

152
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,953
Thank you for the food.

153
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,081
Take your meds, Hyun-woo.

154
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,416
Okay.

155
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,180
Hey.

156
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,103
What's the real reason?

157
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,650
If I just do a little better,

158
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,531
things are going to get better for us.

159
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:22,908
No.

160
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,869
It's impossible.

161
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,330
Just do as you always do.

162
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,542
You haven't made a decision yet, right?

163
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,170
You have always been indecisive.

164
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,047
You miss the right time,
and end up messing everything up.

165
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,676
You couldn't even decide
which café to go to when we were dating.

166
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,429
Maybe you're timid
because you think too much,

167
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,556
or you think too much
because you're so timid.

168
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,518
I've been making
all the decisions for you since then.

169
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,189
But there's one decision I made
that you didn't go along with.

170
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,859
Working as a part-time lecturer
to be a professor,

171
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,362
when you should've known
that you were never going to make it.

172
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,073
There are things that will never happen.

173
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,201
Things will get better, Eun-ju.

174
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,453
Aren't you tired of saying that?

175
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:13,083
How much do we make from your lectures
and my part-time translating?

176
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,128
I've been asking for money
from my mom to raise the kids.

177
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,255
Since one of them is sick,

178
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,132
I spent all my time taking care of him.

179
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,552
I blamed myself for his illness.

180
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,263
It felt like it was my fault.

181
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,557
Where were you then?

182
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,185
You went lecturing out in the countryside,

183
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,979
saying everything would be okay.

184
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,527
You came home late and left in the morning
in order to become a professor.

185
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,531
On the weekends, you'd follow
the professors on their golfing trips,

186
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,990
and fishing trips.

187
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,784
What about our family?

188
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,411
Have we gone on a real vacation together?

189
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,917
Have you ever taken us to Southeast Asia,
or even Jeju Island, for that matter?

190
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,963
You were indecisive and timid,
and yet so stubborn.

191
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,926
It's that stubbornness of yours
that made us turn out like this.

192
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,271
Let me make one final decision for you.

193
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,233
We need to get a divorce.

194
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,319
It'll be better for you, me, and the kids.

195
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,123
Next week,
we have to pay utilities, insurance,

196
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,333
credit cards, tutoring expenses, and rent.

197
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,461
I can't just sit back
and take your word for it.

198
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,338
How much? I'll give it to you.

199
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,634
The owner is coming back to Korea.
We have to move out of this house too.

200
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,637
So, how much is everything?

201
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,681
For the rest of the year--

202
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,143
No, wait, I'll give you enough
for ten years. How much is it?

203
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,185
Are you joking?

204
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,897
I'm not joking.
Don't ask your mom for money anymore.

205
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,318
I'll make sure you don't have to worry
about money anymore.

206
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,862
So stop…

207
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,957
making me feel so pathetic.

208
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:36,352
HOW TO LAUNDER MONEY

209
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,271
WHERE TO LAUNDER MONEY

210
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,441
WHERE TO LAUNDER MONEY

211
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,193
LAUNDERING A LARGE SUM

212
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,618
I WILL LAUNDER MONEY FOR YOU

213
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,078
I DO LAUNDRY
INQUIRE WITHIN

214
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,955
What is this?

215
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,581
1:1 CONSULTATION REQUEST

216
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,209
GUEST

217
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,724
DO YOU DO LAUNDRY?

218
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,521
GUEST - DO YOU DO LAUNDRY?

219
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,026
Dad.

220
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,654
Oh, Hyun-woo. What is it?

221
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,698
-What?
-Do you want to play catch?

222
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,615
Jeez.

223
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,661
You got in trouble with Mom last time
because you ran out of breath.

224
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,372
How about a board game?

225
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,290
I can stop if I run out of breath.

226
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,794
It's been a while
since you've been home like this.

227
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,589
All right. Let's do it. Let's play.

228
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,634
Daddy's not busy at all.
I don't need to be busy anymore.

229
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,386
All right. Let's go.

230
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,141
WASHER - YES, I DO
I CAN GET IT SUPER CLEAN

231
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,935
HOW MUCH LAUNDRY DO YOU HAVE?

232
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,990
He stayed in this neighborhood
for three hours and 26 minutes?

233
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,576
This looks like
a normal countryside suburb.

234
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,870
We should look into the residents here.

235
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,956
There must be a reason why he came here.

236
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,751
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Hyun-woo.

237
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,796
Dad, throw it harder.

238
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,339
It's Kwang-chul.

239
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,592
Don't make a scene.
He doesn't know our faces.

240
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,261
As long as you don't act up.

241
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,180
Let's just loop around the neighborhood.

242
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,057
Here, heads up! Here it comes.

243
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,808
You asshole…

244
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,393
Let's act like newlyweds.

245
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,937
And stop swearing, for goodness' sake.

246
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,607
Catch! Watch it. Oh jeez.

247
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,401
There we go! Heads up!

248
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,990
We must really look like a couple.

249
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,950
Hey, move your arm right now.

250
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,581
I was wondering where Kwang-chul went.

251
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,750
He must have completely settled in.

252
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:10,422
Kwang-chul doesn't fit in
with such peaceful neighborhood like this.

253
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,423
Yun-seok.

254
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,341
Yes?

255
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,219
Should we just live together?

256
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,848
There are a few vacant houses
in that neighborhood.

257
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,185
People bought the land and built houses,

258
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,978
but a lot of them weren't sold.

259
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,981
So the contractors just left
after selling them for cheap.

260
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,984
They haven't been looked after
but are still new developments.

261
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,904
Are the two of you newlyweds?

262
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,489
-Oh, us?
-Yeah.

263
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,075
We're just…

264
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,703
newlyweds.

265
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,414
Well, that's great then.

266
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,625
There are no daycare centers
or schools around,

267
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,460
so it's tough for families with kids.

268
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,172
The houses are nice and cheap,
but no one wants to buy them.

269
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,801
Does the neighborhood have
a guard post or security cameras?

270
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,094
What?

271
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,307
My wife is a scaredy-cat. Were you scared?

272
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,351
That neighborhood
doesn't need any of that.

273
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,603
Not even stray cats steal food.

274
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,189
Everyone in the neighborhood
is nice and predictable.

275
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,109
What are you going to do
about the down payment?

276
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,987
You're acting on an impulse right now.

277
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,324
-Find out if they do short-term leases.
-What about the money?

278
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,411
We can split it.
We're a dual-income household, dumbass.

279
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:23,996
What?

280
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,749
I can barely afford to pay my own rent.

281
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,501
That's a lot…

282
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,348
Okay.

283
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,309
Catch!

284
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,104
Here it goes!

285
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,774
Catch! Here!

286
00:19:58,822 --> 00:19:59,740
Here!

287
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,244
Oh, whoops. Run. Pick it up!

288
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,289
Throw it right away. Here!

289
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,374
There we go!

290
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,667
As hard as you can!

291
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,793
Come on!

292
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,378
-Sorry, Dad.
-Come on, man!

293
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,214
Super sorry.

294
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,233
-What's the matter?
-Call 911.

295
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,275
Oh my.

296
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,236
Gosh.

297
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,154
Hyun-woo!

298
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,281
The child isn't breathing.

299
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,743
Okay. Please come quickly.

300
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,453
Hyun-woo!

301
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,330
Hyun-woo!

302
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,415
What happened? Hyun-woo!

303
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,042
Hyun-woo!

304
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,460
Let's get an X-ray first.

305
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,628
Okay, understood.

306
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,297
EMERGENCY CENTER

307
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,882
I'm sorry, Mom.

308
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:05,514
Dad said no, but I kept insisting.

309
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,891
I'm sorry.

310
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,018
Can I speak with the parents for a moment?

311
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,150
I assume you're already aware
of your son's condition?

312
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,779
He has a congenital heart disease,
and he's already had a few surgeries.

313
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,824
In addition to heart failure,
there are a number of complications.

314
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,660
He needs good care
until he gets a heart transplant.

315
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,578
Do you know what Hyun-woo's wish is?

316
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,581
He wants to ride a bike,

317
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,502
skateboard, play soccer,

318
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,587
shoot layups,

319
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,173
and run a 100-meter dash
as fast as he possibly can.

320
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,554
Do you now understand why I never

321
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,390
allowed him to do any of that?

322
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:50,851
You played catch?

323
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,565
And you call yourself his dad? You?

324
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,944
You want to know the real reason?

325
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,750
Let's stop.

326
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,502
I don't want anything from you.

327
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,629
Just put back the money for his surgery.

328
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,928
WASHER - HOW MUCH LAUNDRY DO YOU HAVE?
010-0228-5950

329
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,090
I gave photos of the missing men
to the places they'll likely visit.

330
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,009
As for the family that moved out today,

331
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,636
it was because
their child transferred schools.

332
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,806
But that guy in the house
with the lights on is notorious.

333
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,602
-For what?
-For bud. Marijuana.

334
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,187
He doesn't even import the stuff.

335
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,481
He apparently grows
and distributes them himself.

336
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,483
The reason he keeps the lights on at night

337
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,485
is because he's growing all that weed.

338
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,279
You think that might explain
why they stopped by this area?

339
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,450
Let's ask him ourselves.

340
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,500
-First time?
-Yes.

341
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,545
If you're looking to save on taxes,
you should find a tax accountant.

342
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,214
It's not that.

343
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,674
Are you aware
that this isn't exactly legal?

344
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,344
Yes, I'm just in a bit of a hurry.

345
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,472
Where should I go?

346
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,741
Shit, man.

347
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,745
Just leave it.

348
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,581
Goddammit.

349
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,004
Who is it?

350
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,839
Hi, I'm from just across the street.

351
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,508
Are you the owner of this dog?

352
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,467
A dog?

353
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,428
-Are you talking about Hash?
-"Hash"?

354
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,765
What a great name.
Hash is concentrated marijuana.

355
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,850
Oh, I think something happened to Hash.

356
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,185
What's the matter?

357
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,188
I mean, he's not getting up.
Come out and take a look.

358
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,069
-Did something happen to Hash?
-Well, hello there.

359
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,071
What the fuck?

360
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,948
You little fucker.

361
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,533
-What the fuck?
-Go inside.

362
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,410
-Who the hell are you guys?
-Get inside.

363
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,203
This guy's too fucking loud, man.

364
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,455
-Let me go!
-Jeez, just stay still!

365
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,971
JUNIN ELECTRONICS PLAZA

366

BUILDING 21 UNIT 3-53, GEOSANG C&C
BUILDING 21 UNIT 3-54, GEOSANG C&C

367
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,879
COMPUTER ASSEMBLY

368
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,427
Today we had a beautiful taste of summer.

369
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,055
The skies were clear,
and throughout the peninsula,

370
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,767
the daily highs reached
well over 26 degrees Celsius. Tomorrow…

371
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,685
I chatted with you online.

372
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,439
What chat? Are you here
to fix your computer at this hour?

373
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,025
No, well,

374
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,904
I chatted with someone on the blog.

375
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,282
I'm here to get my laundry done.

376
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,453
-"Laundry"?
-Yes.

377
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,788
What laundry?

378
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,248
I think you came to the wrong place.

379
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,417
There aren't any dry cleaners
in this building.

380
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,880
Isn't this unit 302?

381
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,716
-Bit B Computers?
-It is.

382
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,991
FOURTH FLOOR UNIT 402

383
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,628
Jeez.

384
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,630
It's like a jungle in here.

385
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,562
You guys aren't cops, are you?

386
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,690
No. I'm the one asking the questions here.
You just answer.

387
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,191
Where's the money?

388
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,277
What money?

389
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,863
I said I'm asking the questions.

390
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,531
Where are my guys?

391
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,450
Your guys…

392
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,455
Your guys

393
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,750
are standing right next to you, dumbass.

394
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,087
I can't tell if he's got
some balls on him, or if he's just high.

395
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,174
You'd better watch your mouth
if you want to keep your tongue.

396
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,968
Not his tongue. We still need him to talk.

397
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,890
Where did you hide my money?

398
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,934
What does your money look like?

399
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,314
You should've written your name on it,
motherfucker!

400
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,025
Is this it?

401
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,737
Aren't you laundering?

402
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,850
-Is this all of it?
-Yes, for now.

403
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,060
There's another round coming?

404
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,105
You were too nervous to bring all of it?

405
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,487
We'll launder it through cryptocurrency.

406
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,613
We take a 30% cut.

407
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,950
The longer it takes,
the safer your money is.

408
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,451
Are you in a rush?

409
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,870
Yes, kind of.

410
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,080
I'll hook you up with an older wallet.

411
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:18,167
So you've been trading
in crypto for a while now,

412
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,711
but recently sold everything off.

413
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,922
Once 70% of the clean money
is deposited into your account,

414
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,092
feel free to spend it however you want.
Do you understand?

415
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,720
No, not really.

416
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,890
You don't have to.

417
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,641
What's important are the results.

418
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,689
Only use this phone to contact me.

419
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,691
You can leave now.

420
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:50,533
-That's… that's it?
-Yeah, what else would there be?

421
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,996
Just how am I supposed to trust you
with this money?

422
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,965
Then you can take all of it back

423
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,219
and hide it in your backyard for a while,
how about that?

424
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:16,434
I saw you walk in alone.
Are you in finance?

425
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,020
-Or is it the National Assembly?
-No, I'm not.

426
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,773
You don't look like a bookie,

427
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,317
and there's nothing
in the news about a bank robbery.

428
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:49,050
I'm sorry. I'll be back next time.

429
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,017
Hey.

430
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,104
Who are you?

431
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,775
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,488
You're just going to leave? What are you?

433
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,157
-A cop?
-No.

434
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,535
I'm just--

435
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,078
Where'd you get that money?

436
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,624
It's not political slush fund money,

437
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,919
or pocket money from a large corporation.

438
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,546
It's not gambling.

439
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,758
And loan sharks are our main clients
so there's no way I wouldn't know.

440
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,846
Who are you, man?

441
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,681
I'm sorry.

442
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,070
Get him.

443
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,965
You've never seen him before?

444
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,676
How many times do I have to tell you?

445
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,930
I've never seen him before.

446
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,099
-Let's cut off another toe.
-Yes, sir.

447
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,936
Wait!

448
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,021
I remember!

449
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,565
I remember now!

450
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,776
I'm not sure,

451
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,653
but they came in a car.

452
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,868
It was like… I can't remember the color.

453
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,287
But it was a foreign car.

454
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,705
Not a domestic SUV?

455
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,333
Was it a domestic car?

456
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,960
I don't know. But,

457
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,923
the guys wanted to buy some hash.

458
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:56,219
They said they had loads of cash,
and they took it out of a bag to show me.

459
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,888
Wait, that's what we told you earlier!

460
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,849
That's what happened, man.

461
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,520
Damn it! What the fuck?

462
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,605
-That's what you told me to say!
-Fuck.

463
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,024
-What now?
-Jeez.

464
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,030
You bastards!

465
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,283
-Bring it on, motherfucker!
-Fuck!

466
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,077
Fuck! Damn it.

467
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,413
You fucking assholes!

468
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,082
Hey! Fuck.

469
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,627
Fucker!

470
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,671
Fucking asshole.

471
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,673
Get over here.

472
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,590
Get off me!

473
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,226
Fuck!

474
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,062
Damn it!

475
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,113
What the fuck? Hey!

476
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,823
Assholes! You fucking assholes!

477
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,244
Fuck! Come and get some.

478
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,746
Motherfuckers!

479
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,875
Get up, asshole.

480
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,668
Fucking asshole!

481
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,257
Fuck!

482
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,302
What the fuck.

483
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,932
Seriously, what the fuck.

484
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,193
I don't think this is the guy.

485
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,876
If I catch you, you're dead!

486
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,923
Hey, you punk!

487
00:39:56,685 --> 00:40:01,524
IN LOVING MEMORY OF NAM MUN-CHEOL
