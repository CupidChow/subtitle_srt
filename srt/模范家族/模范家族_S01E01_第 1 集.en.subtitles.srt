1
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,652
War, disease, accidents…

2
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,614
Lots of people die from those things.

3
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,160
But even more people die

4
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,412
because of money.

5
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,248
Please forgive me.

6
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,586
What's so great about money?

7
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,338
It's no use if you're dead.

8
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,888
I shouldn't have

9
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,766
ever laid my hands on that money…

10
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:13,907
A MODEL FAMILY

11
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,245
The author of the best-selling book,
"I Am Justice,"

12
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,414
and recent talk of the town,
Professor Kim…

13
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,332
Dad?

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,502
-…has been arrested last night.
-Dad, are you okay?

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,669
Yeah, I'm fine.

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,047
Prof. Kim was in a dispute
with the alleged victim

17
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,424
regarding the allegations
of the sexual assault.

18
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,677
The police secured text messages
and hotel security camera footage,

19
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,138
-…and promptly made the arrest…
-Dad, watch your hand.

20
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,724
As the son of
Hankuk University Foundation's director,

21
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,519
-Kim denied the reports against him…
-What's wrong with him?

22
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,938
…that student Jane Doe
had been sexually assaulted,

23
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,149
claiming he had never even heard
of the student in question…

24
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,864
What is it this time?

25
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,993
Huh? What do you mean?

26
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,579
Oh, this thing?

27
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,332
It's fine, it's no big deal.

28
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,505
-I dare you to try and skip school today.
-Have a good day, Yeon-woo.

29
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,602
Dad, is your hand okay?

30
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,813
Yeah, it's fine.

31
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,025
Wait. Why aren't you going
to school today, Hyun-woo?

32
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,779
-They're all going on a picnic today.
-Then you should go on the picnic.

33
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,535
Mom said it's too dangerous to go.
That it's bad for my heart.

34
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,747
Because it's dangerous out there.

35
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,754
I'm going to my mom's with the kids today.

36
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:53,965
Oh, okay.

37
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,593
Should I go after I'm done?

38
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,598
-How long are you going to drag it out?
-What?

39
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,893
You need to make
a decision regarding the divorce.

40
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,738
Jesus, man.

41
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,782
My God.

42
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,080
I can't believe it, man.
How could things get so messed up?

43
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,000
The way this is playing out
is completely ridiculous.

44
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,794
They're saying because it wasn't a bribe

45
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,339
but a form of investment,
we can't get our money back.

46
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,257
Where does the director live?

47
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,509
Why are you looking for the director?

48
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,220
I need to get the money back.

49
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,347
Do you know what that money was for?

50
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,100
It's for Hyun-woo's surgery.

51
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,062
Money that was supposed
to pay for his heart transplant.

52
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,397
My boy's life depends on it.

53
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,860
I went behind Eun-ju's back
and took out a loan I couldn't afford.

54
00:03:55,944 --> 00:04:00,490
Bribing someone to become
a professor is also a crime, man.

55
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,493
We could all go down
in the blink of an eye.

56
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,162
I don't mind if I go down. I deserve it.

57
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,873
But I still need
to take care of my family.

58
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,834
Well, what about me?
I'm going down too, man.

59
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,547
Where does the director live?

60
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:21,219
Hey, let's go out for a drink
and come up with a plan, yeah?

61
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,721
-Byeong-gu.
-What?

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,183
Can you lend me some money?

63
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,603
Come on, man. Where would I even get…

64
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,855
Do you really think
I have any money right now?

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,691
There's nothing for me, either.

66
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,567
Byeong-gu.

67
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,528
What?

68
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,949
Go fuck yourself.

69
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,286
Come on, man. What--

70
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,499
Go fuck yourself,
and that fucking commission,

71
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,960
and everything else, motherfucker.

72
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,504
Hey, I know Eun-ju's been
asking you for a divorce.

73
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,382
You're making a big mistake
if you tell her any of this.

74
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,926
Let's suck it up. We have to endure it.

75
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,303
"Suck it up"?

76
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,013
"Endure it"?

77
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,351
You said the director has your back. No?

78
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,563
You said that if I bribed him,
he'd make me professor!

79
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,858
I took a shot
at making myself a professor.

80
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,236
And now my family's going to die from it.
And what?

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,655
"Endure it"?

82
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,286
"Men must endure.

83
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,205
Their going hence,

84
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,458
even as their coming hither,

85
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,253
ripeness is all."

86
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,965
This is one of Edgar's lines
from King Lear.

87
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,760
Tragedy turns man into a pitiful creature.

88
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,139
Did fortune end up
finding the man who endured?

89
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,643
Edgar does end up surviving until the end.

90
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,110
Give the book a read,
and not just the synopsis you find online.

91
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,403
That'll be it for today.

92
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,781
Yeah, hello?

93
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,033
We just finished, I'll be right there.
Wait for me.

94
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,703
Idiot…

95
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,791
Just die…

96
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:41,025
PARK HYUN-WOO
FACE TALK

97
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,077
PARK HYUN-WOO
FACE TALK

98
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,995
Hey, Hyun-woo.

99
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,082
Dad, Mom, Yeon-woo,
and I are all at Grandma's house.

100
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,126
Yeah, I know.

101
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,503
It's Grandma's birthday.
Aren't you coming?

102
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,464
Oh, I…

103
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,136
Daddy has something to do today,

104
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,596
so I already told her I can't make it.

105
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,014
Oh, I see.

106
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,226
What about your meds?
Did you take them with you?

107
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,394
Yeah, Dad.

108
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,605
Don't forget to eat something,

109
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,232
and no drinking.

110
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,484
Yeah.

111
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,362
Don't forget to take your meds, Hyun-woo.

112
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,280
Okay.

113
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,784
-Hyun-woo, I'm sorry.
-What?

114
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,743
I…

115
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,039
I'm sorry
that I couldn't go with you today.

116
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,208
It's okay, Dad.

117
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,751
All right, go on, then.

118
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,295
Make sure to eat your dinner.

119
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,838
-Okay.
-All right.

120
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,322
Hello, you've reached
112 emergency dispatch.

121
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,574
-Hello?
-I…

122
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,409
Yes, please speak.

123
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,787
No, it's nothing.

124
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,998
I pressed the number by mistake.
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,508
Dad must be so bored by himself.

126
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,134
I mean, it's the weekend.

127
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,763
Do you not like it when Dad's not around?

128
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,015
We're family.

129
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,601
We should all be together if we're family.

130
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,686
Get used to it.

131
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,437
Because he might be gone soon.

132
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,064
-Park Yeon-woo.
-What?

133
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,275
He's not that dense. He knows everything.

134
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,069
Hyun-woo.

135
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,697
What do you think of living here?

136
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,033
-It's nice and close to the hospital.
-I don't want to.

137
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,537
I just made some friends,
and I have to move again? I won't do it.

138
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,863
I have to avoid security cameras…

139
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,575
DUI CHECKPOINT

140
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,180
Hey, stop him!

141
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,765
We got a runner!

142
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,559
Go catch him!

143
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,852
Watch out!

144
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,270
What are you waiting for?

145
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,482
Stop!

146
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,441
Shit…

147
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,818
Hurry up, man! Stop him!

148
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,174
Let's go.

149
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,343
Good boy.

150
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,137
Hey, what's going on?

151
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,056
What is it?

152
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,516
What is it?

153
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,060
What's wrong, boy?

154
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,853
What is it? Let's go.

155
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,563
What's wrong with you?

156
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,857
Let's go. Hey, what's gotten into you?

157
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,318
Come on, boy. Let's go.

158
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,569
Come on.

159
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,186
You had a lot of guy friends,
didn't you, Mom?

160
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,815
Well, it's not like I wasn't popular.

161
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,943
In middle school,
high school, and at university,

162
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,946
there's always a guy next to you,
even in the group photos.

163
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,990
I was always part of a clique.

164
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,535
Why isn't there a photo
from your college graduation?

165
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,082
I was pregnant with your sister.

166
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,043
Let's go to bed now, Hyun-woo.

167
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,757
Dad's not in any of them, though.

168
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,760
Dad wasn't next to you back then,

169
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,803
or even now.

170
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,265
Will it be hard without your dad?

171
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,187
I think we'll do fine without your dad.

172
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,900
Dad's not someone you need in your life?

173
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,611
But he's a good person.

174
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,865
Excuse me, isn't this the car
that ran past the checkpoint?

175
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,492
What?

176
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,203
No, it's not.

177
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,291
This is a common car. So is the color.

178
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,755
Blow.

179
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,802
-Give me another breathalyzer.
-Yes, sir.

180
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,804
A line of cars is forming, sir.

181
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,223
Blow.

182
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,486
-Aren't you going to pick up?
-Sorry?

183
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,280
I can hear it coming from inside the car.

184
00:20:54,878 --> 00:21:00,884
Oh, my daughter must've
left this in the car again.

185
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,387
We got a big line going on, sir.

186
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,486
KANG-JUN - WHERE ARE YOU?
DID YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT BASTARD?

187
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,489
Dong-ha, you have got to keep it together.

188
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,202
You're now the Caesar
that crossed the Rubicon.

189
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,080
There's no turning back now.

190
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:04,132
There's no such thing as bad money
if it's used for something good.

191
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,303
I should buy a house

192
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,264
and a car for Eun-ju.

193
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,102
I'll buy Yeon-woo a new phone.

194
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,105
And for Hyun-woo…

195
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,776
a heart that never stops beating.

196
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:18,934
It's me.

197
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,978
Where's that punk Kwang-chul at?

198
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,703
Get rid of him.

199
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,872
-Hello?
-No hospitals.

200
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,041
What is it?

201
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:46,920
And then what?

202
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,317
-Get the car.
-Yes, sir.

203
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:37,220
LET'S DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL
FOR OUR SOCIETY

204
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,657
What's the point of watching what you eat

205
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,744
if you're going to chain-smoke
all the time, Yong-soo?

206
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,872
Kang wants us to find Kwang-chul.

207
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,626
He hasn't shown up since last night.

208
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,921
Jun-yeong, what happened to that van
that was on delivery to the head cartel?

209
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,257
I don't know.
I heard the chief is pissed, though.

210
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,510
All right…

211
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,305
Kwang-chul is here.

212
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,103
PASS-ONE DISTRIBUTION

213
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,503
What are you doing?

214
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,382
Jesus, you could've hurt him.

215
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,802
He got hurt. He's bleeding.

216
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,095
Where were you?

217
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,515
I was checking the guys
who siphoned off the goods, sir.

218
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,559
The money never arrived.

219
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,019
I heard.

220
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,979
You should've used the right guys, idiot.

221
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,357
-What will you do now?
-I'll find them, sir.

222
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,901
Kkwang-chul is the best at finding people.

223
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:18,988
You look scary.

224
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,907
Why are you looking at me like that?

225
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,326
What? Is it something I said?

226
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,662
We're not family.
I can't call you my brother.

227
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,958
You're dead if you can't find them.
You, me, all of us.

228
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,003
I asked them to give us a week.
Is one week enough?

229
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,547
I'll find them, sir.

230
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,683
What a fucking shitty way
to start to the day.

231
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,566
Was it really Kwang-chul?

232
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,485
Yong-soo,

233
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,155
who else would intercept the money?

234
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,741
Who else knew about delivering the money?

235
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,119
We're in this shitstorm
because you trusted him.

236
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,420
Damn, that swagger.
It's like he's using the force.

237
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,838
He's like a Jedi.

238
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,222
Is he not picking up?

239
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,308
The call goes through,
but he won't pick up.

240
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,101
What about the guys?

241
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,562
They left a while ago
and are probably almost there.

242
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,314
Let's go.

243
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,700
What are you doing here?

244
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,995
The chief has been looking for you.
You're in trouble now.

245
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,121
What about Kwang-chul?

246
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,373
I heard Yong-soo
gave him an earful at Pass-One.

247
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,708
He'll be headed here.

248
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,295
The delivery van is over there.

249
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,926
What? How did you know it was there?

250
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,761
Kwang-chul is here.

251
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,072
-What about the money?
-There's nothing, sir.

252
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,681
Isn't that blood?

253
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,517
Take the car to the office
and meet up with us later.

254
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,102
Where are you going, sir?

255
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,479
To find the money.

256
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,147
Yes, sir. Let's go.

257
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:03,945
Should we tail them?

258
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,952
Follow the delivery van.

259
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,580
-I'm seeing the chief to get an earful.
-What?

260
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,711
Shit…

261
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,504
Shit.

262
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,030
What do you know?

263
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,365
You know nothing.

264
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,827
What an annoying mutt.

265
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,664
Yes, I'd like to make an appointment.

266
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,374
Park Hyun-woo.

267
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,877
-Park Hyun-woo? Just a moment please.
-Sure.

268
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,097
ACCOUNT INQUIRY
ACCOUNT BALANCE: 4,720 WON

269
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,974
Can I have the patient's date of birth?

270
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,978
TRANSFER - 35,000,000 WON
BALANCE - 4,720 WON

271
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,021
Hello?

272
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,357
Hello?

273
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,287
What is it this time?

274
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,499
Grandma and Grandpa
will be back from the market soon.

275
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,584
Just get in first. Let's go home.

276
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,637
Why do you always do whatever you want?

277
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,263
Then you can stay here!

278
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,224
Hyun-woo and I have to leave.

279
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,684
Do whatever you want!

280
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,730
You should at least call
Grandma and Grandpa.

281
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,566
-Okay.
-Let them know something came up.

282
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,068
I'll call them.

283
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,656
I'm sick of this.

284
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,242
Shut your mouth, Park Yeon-woo.

285
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,744
I'm so sick and tired of this.

286
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,164
I hate going home because of you and Dad.
Everything feels like crap!

287
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,166
Just get a divorce already!

288
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,714
Do you think I want to live like this?

289
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,633
I'm tired of living like this too.

290
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,563
It's okay.

291
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,440
Nobody knows.

292
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,671
Oh, Yeon-woo…

293
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,674
-We're back.
-Hey, what's wrong with your sister?

294
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,968
Yeon-woo's not the problem right now.

295
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,178
Mom's…

296
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,598
Didn't you say you were coming tomorrow?

297
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,974
Are you even human?

298
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,144
Even when I can't pay the bills,
I never touch that money.

299
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,645
What? Money?

300
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,065
Oh…

301
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,109
I just let someone borrow it for a minute.

302
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,612
-I didn't blow it all.
-Then explain.

303
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,699
If you can't help me understand it,
we're done, as of today.

304
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,367
Well…

305
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:43,498
Byeong-gu is starting a business,
and he asked me to go in with him.

306
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,042
It's a publishing company
for school textbooks.

307
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,961
The company's also going to be
doing content development.

308
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,465
I mean, you know, content development
is really important these days.

309
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,175
But the thing is…

310
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,011
He just needed to get
his start-up capital verified,

311
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,679
so I let him borrow it temporarily.

312
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,057
He'll pay me back next week. Don't worry.

313
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,350
Are you serious right now?

314
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,268
Would you believe that if you were me?

315
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,898
I'm in the deal to author the textbooks,
so I'm going make good money now.

316
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,193
Yeon-woo's academy fees,
Hyun-woo's hospital bills, living costs…

317
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,112
No need to worry about them.

318
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,197
You trust Byeong-gu?

319
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,866
He has the foundation director's ear.

320
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,368
Eun-ju,

321
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,579
everything will turn out fine this time.

322
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,707
I'm going to cut down on my lectures,

323
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,545
and I'll pay more attention
to our family. Yeah?

324
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,299
That money is Hyun-woo's life.

325
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,218
Put it back, right now.

00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,353
Hey, Yeon-woo.

333
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,772
What are you looking at?

334
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,066
What do you mean?
I'm not looking at anything.

335
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,359
Why, what is it?

336
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,987
I can't sleep because of the noise.

337
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,575
There isn't any other neighborhood
as quiet as this one.

338
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,952
No, I'm talking about the phone.

339
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,747
What phone?

340
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,981
Yeon-woo,

341
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,693
it's not that loud.

342
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,072
More than it being loud, it's just scary.

343
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:25,409
Our backyard is all woods and forests,
but why do I hear a phone ringing?

344
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,955
It must be someone's
from the house in front of us.

345
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,875
That guy doesn't sleep much at night,
and the lights are always on.

346
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,671
The next time I see him,
I'll make sure to talk to him about it.

347
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,048
Don't worry about it and go to sleep.

348
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,675
Gosh.

for location tracking is accepted…

352
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,149
Important tip.
You need to involve the police.

353
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,068
Or else your carrier won’t do a thing.

354
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,528
And the tracking is on.

355
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,363
A Missing Persons Report is needed,

356
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,949
and the phone needs to be on
to guarantee results.

357
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,938
We scoured all the routes the car took.

358
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,149
But this area seems suspicious.

359
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,570
Instead of going straight to the drop-off,
they stopped by this neighborhood.

360
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,907
Then the car was left
in the woods and he went off the grid.

361
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,327
Should I call the guys?

362
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:48,028
KANG EUN-JU

363
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:03,706
IN LOVING MEMORY OF NAM MUN-CHEOL
