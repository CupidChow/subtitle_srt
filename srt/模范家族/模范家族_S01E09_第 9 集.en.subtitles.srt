1
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,487
I said I'd take care of it.

2
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,573
Don't you trust me at all?

3
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,205
Now you're involved in this too.

4
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,801
These are the same guys we've been
investigating for the past two years.

5
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,053
That's your guys' problem.

6
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,680
You've made a huge mess
in someone else's jurisdiction.

7
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,434
You don't have to be
so worked up about it.

8
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,729
Our chief is going ballistic right now!

9
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,191
I already told you!

10
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,068
Officer Lee, call the chief, damn it!

11
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,487
-That's not what I'm saying.
-Please try to…

12
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,244
We're all in this shit
because of that asshole.

13
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:03,623
If only that punk
never told me to kill Han-cheol…

14
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,624
So?

15
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,334
Did you kill him?

16
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,421
At around 6:00 p.m. today in Busan,
an incident occurred

17
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,799
that rather fits to be in a movie.

18
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,301
Four vehicles were involved
in a high-speed car chase.

19
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,346
Among other damages, there was
a trailer truck that was overturned

20
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,641
and exploded after the driver swerved
to avoid speeding vehicles.

21
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:25,061
Even more accidents followed in its wake.
Reporter Ko Eun-seong reporting.

22
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,190
The chase started in the parking lot
of a downtown hotel

23
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,986
and continued for about ten kilometers
to an intersection near a shipyard.

24
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,821
A trailer truck…

25
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:39,826
…a vehicle running a red light
while chasing a car.

26
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,412
Is taking money back from that bastard

27
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,998
that big a deal
that you caused all this mess?

28
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,293
Find that motherfucker, Kang-jun, now.

29
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,210
Wait…

30
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,755
at least get me the phone.

31
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,507
If the head cartel comes to us,

32
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,260
we're all dead, all right?

33
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,220
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,624
How's our son doing?

35
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,251
All right. Okay.

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,588
I can't go home for a while, so…

37
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,718
Never mind. I'll call you back, bye.

38
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,636
Okay.

39
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,508
Why the hell do these motherfuckers
keep calling me…

40
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,824
Where are you?

41
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,662
Are you going to save me or not?
Just tell me that.

42
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,209
I need to pick one side
to stick to right now.

43
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,255
Don't try anything sneaky.

44
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,381
You're…

45
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,553
You're interested in that cop
I'm leeching off of, aren't you?

46
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,722
Who is he?

47
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,889
Hey.

48
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,643
We're making a deal right now.

49
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,563
Call me after you've come up

50
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,109
with a way to save me, you fucking bitch.

51
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,617
The citizens of Busan
had to suffer the damage.

52
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,579
The driver caused a chaotic scene
by ignoring traffic signals

53
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,706
and speeding through the intersection.

54
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,250
Numerous cars were caught
in the midst of the action,

55
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,586
and various minor accidents ensued.

56
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,713
While authorities
were handling the situation,

57
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,466
two lanes in Centum City
had to be shut down…

58
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,260
Sir, the lieutenant is looking for you.

59
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,429
However, it is said
that they have all escaped.

60
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,556
We have reporter Kim Yu-jin on the scene.

61
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,932
The call has been forwarded…

62
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,561
The police are currently tracking down
the suspects who have fled the scene.

63
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:57,023
The Regional Investigation Unit…

64
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,780
Hello.

65
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,784
Hello, sir.

66
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,036
Thank you, sir!

67
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,839
VIOLENT CRIMES SECTION

68
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,317
We're going to be cleaning things up.

69
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,194
Take care of the professor first,

70
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,904
and move your home base.

71
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,573
Stay under the radar
until I contact you again.

72
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,370
DANMIN HOSPITAL

73
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,398
They said he needs
to undergo some kind of test tomorrow.

74
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,692
The manager also mentioned the bills.

75
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,914
Where are you going?

76
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,211
I'll take care of it.

77
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,340
So just trust me this once.

78
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,677
You just worry about Hyun-woo.

79
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,173
Things got out of hand in Busan.

80
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,592
The head cartel is going
to be cleaning things up.

81
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,635
If things get worse--

82
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,137
You have no intention of letting me go.

83
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,765
Wait until I contact you again.

84
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,121
Professor Park went back home alone.

85
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,187
I've fucking had it!

86
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,314
Just quit, you pricks!

87
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,026
Those punks from the Special Investigation
Unit are coming into my territory!

88
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,321
As of today, you're all going to be sent
to the disciplinary committee.

89
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,865
Wait until they figure out
how to punish you bastards!

90
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,285
Is disciplining the guys
going to solve anything?

91
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,288
You and the chief investigator
decided to take on this case, no?

92
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,664
What was that, asshole?

93
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,082
Look at this punk.

94
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,960
Are you telling me to take
all the blame and die on my own?

95
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,462
We were against your overambitious plan

96
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,840
but you wanted
to get promoted before retirement.

97
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:54,719
Hey.

98
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,353
Hey. How can someone who only cares
about keeping a good reputation

99
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,855
say something like that?

100
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,814
Huh?

101
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,441
Get lost, prick.

102
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,577
Move out of the way, you bastards!

103
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,498
Whatever you've found
over the past two years,

104
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,791
cover everything up.

105
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,045
Don't leave a single file
for the Special Investigation Unit.

106
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,004
Shred everything.

107
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,088
You got that?

108
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,300
Damn it!

109
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:40,348
If it gets out that
our undercover investigation was ruined,

110
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,975
we're all dead.

111
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,270
Damn it!

112
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,955
Weren't you supposed
to help me get promoted?

113
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,041
It looks like I'll be getting sacked.

114
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,504
I already packed up my stuff.

115
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,674
They’re making me take responsibility
as a leader by transferring me.

116
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,385
Shit, they'll probably send me
to some rural police station

117
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,470
in some town
I've never even heard of before.

118
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,188
Things will be hectic because of the SIU.

119
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,857
Make sure any files
related to Han-cheol get covered up.

120
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,735
I'd rather die than go to jail.

121
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,363
By the way,

122
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,825
did you lose Yong-soo's men too?

123
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,786
Let's grab a meal sometime.

124
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,580
Or a drink.

125
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,394
Hyun-woo,
you can do it this time too, right?

126
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,313
I thought you said
things might not work out?

127
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,774
You said we'd know
after we get the biopsy results.

128
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,819
Wow, what a way to cheer him up.

129
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,196
He deserves to know.

130
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,532
You need to teach
about despair before hope.

131
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,617
That way he'll grow up to be strong.

132
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,455
No one in our family dies
from illness, Mom. Don't worry.

133
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,082
That's right.

134
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,255
PARK DONG-HA

135
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,096
LITERATURE AND HUMANITIES

136
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,984
You know who I am, don't you?

137
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,361
We made a mess in Busan.

138
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,907
You'll end up dying,
just like your front door neighbor.

139
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,869
You knew, didn't you?
You were the one who reported them.

140
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,873
I don't know what you're talking about.

141
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,793
I don't know
how Kwang-chul is blackmailing you,

142
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,836
but the police will be here soon.

143
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,464
You'll be investigated as an accomplice

144
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,008
in all of the cases
Kwang-chul was involved in.

145
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,805
Let me ask you something.

146
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,683
How did you get involved with Kwang-chul?

147
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,521
Why are you being dragged around
like this? Even your wife got involved.

148
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,066
I have no idea what you're talking about.

149
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,442
Give me a chance.

150
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,612
That's the only way
you and your family can stay alive.

151
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,870
Excuse me.

152
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,542
I have no idea what you're--

153
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,418
You're more than involved.

154
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,006
You're a fucking accomplice, aren't you?

155
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,012
It's going to be an ugly ending for you.

156
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,073
The two of them met.

157
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,869
We should get rid of him
before it gets more complicated.

158
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,593
Where are you?

159
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,972
These are the mid-bosses

160
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,975
that were being investigated
by the narcotics squad.

161
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,686
The head cartel's identity
remains unknown for two years.

162
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,271
Look at the photos.

163
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:02,776
Hwang Yong-soo, and Ma Kwang-chul.
These are two guys we're looking for.

164
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,320
We have reason to believe

165
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,031
that these two have been
in contact with the head cartel.

166
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,198
We sent out the intel…

167
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,535
I found Yong-soo.
He's at Incheon West Tourist Hotel.

168
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,829
The details are all in there.

169
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,335
West Tourist Hotel. Bring him to me.

170
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,801
Shit…

171
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,511
The call has been forwarded to…

172
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,973
Damn it!

173
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,660
-Where's the boss?
-Over there.

174
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,833
You need to find
another place to stay, sir.

175
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,216
Shit…

176
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:12,179
If you're badly hurt,
you should go to a hospital.

177
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,556
Where did you hurt yourself?

178
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,019
It's none of your business, bitch.

179
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,264
Police?

180
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,747
What the…

181
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,256
What…

182
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,463
His double life

183
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,424
ends in tragedy.

184
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,472
Unable to control the monster
that grew from within him,

185
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,101
he eventually dies by suicide.

186
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,728
You get to die somewhere nice.

187
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,064
It's a peaceful death, isn't it?

188
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,111
I was only trying to kill Kwang-chul.

189
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,279
I wasn't trying to betray the head cartel.

190
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,742
You want me to compete with Kwang-chul?

191
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,954
He's a dog that bit his owner.

192
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,706
Was I supposed to let a mutt like him be?

193
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,001
Dogs take after their owners.

194
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,088
Dogs don't bite
their owners for no reason.

195
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,759
I have a young son.

196
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,845
He's only four years old.

197
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,473
Is that why everyone turns their back?

198
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,309
Everyone seems to have a family.

199
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,397
Family's always the problem, isn't it?

200
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,110
You were as good as dead
the moment you met Mr. Kim,

201
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,237
or whatever they call him.

202
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,073
How could you even think
of approaching a different supplier?

203
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,533
Better to just get rid of you.

204
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,918
You want to live, don't you?

205
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,921
Who wants to do it?

206
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,887
I have a lot to take care of. Let's hurry.

207
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,222
We only need one of you.

208
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:52,566
Everyone has a monster
living inside of them.

209
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,610
I do

210
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,778
and so do all of you.

211
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,620
Yong-soo.

212
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,875
You were about to grab the gun, right?

213
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,503
You were trying to kill me?

214
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,421
Weren't you?

215
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,632
Hey.

216
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,886
Family's supposed
to watch each other's backs.

217
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,973
If you'd listened to me,
you son of a bitch,

218
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,144
none of this shit
would have happened, motherfucker!

219
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,942
I never should have
accepted you as family.

220
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,617
Good and evil.

221
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,162
Out of the two,
the one that's more helpful in survival

222
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,081
is evil.

223
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,585
"That's what limits people
who try to live a good life,

224
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,880
and it's the start of a tragedy."

225
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,513
In the end, Henry Jekyll was too weak

226
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,850
to keep Edward Hyde under control.

227
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,478
What brought out Hyde

228
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,607
were Dr. Jekyll's repressed urges

229
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,235
that were hidden behind his hypocrisy.

230
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,405
In other words…

231
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,033
it was self-destruction as well as…

232
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,958
-What the…
-Fuck.

233
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,627
-What's wrong with him?
-He must be pissed.

234
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,837
Everyone, leave.

235
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,380
Get out!

236
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,939
That Han-cheol guy you buried in the yard…

237
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,734
That punk was a cop.

238
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,072
Were you able to sleep
after burying a corpse?

239
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,159
I heard you live with your family.

240
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,707
You

241
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,001
and your family

242
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,421
want things to go back to normal,
like how you used to live, right?

243
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,300
I'll help you,

244
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,720
so when you meet Kkwang-chul,

245
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,889
just tell me when and where.

246
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,268
I'll set you free from that bastard

247
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,854
for good.

248
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,000
Fucking hell…

249
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,177
Yong-soo passed away last night.

250
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,597
His driver is a friend of mine.

251
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,727
We should also start to get moving, sir.

252
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,107
Isn't his son around three years old now?

253
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,025
Sir, we really don't have time for this.

254
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,361
He said Kang-jun was killed too.

255
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,323
That bastard is still alive.

256
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,120
There must be a reason
he's still breathing.

257
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,936
You have to get rid of all of them,

258
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,480
from Kwang-chul to that professor.

259
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:07,487
Kwang-chul, that prick,
thinks way too much.

260
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,951
If you do a good job,
we'll become great partners.

261
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,579
After everything is over,

262
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,290
what about me?

263
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,253
Will you let me live?

264
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,725
Stop thinking too much.

265
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,146
That could kill you too.

266
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,361
That Han-cheol guy you buried in the yard…

267
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,904
That punk was a cop.

268
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,288
PROFESSOR PARK

269
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,501
Yes?

270
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,130
Where do I need to go?

271
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,842
You and your family want things
to go back to normal,

272
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,886
like how you used to live, right?

273
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,472
I'll help you,

274
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,560
so when you meet Kkwang-chul,
just tell me when and where.

275
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:06,064
I'll set you free
from that bastard for good.

276
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:13,488
My family seemed to have a hard time
when I stayed at home.

277
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,660
An exemplary family man? No way.

278
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,913
I was worse than a stranger.
I was their enemy.

279
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:28,628
That's why I left,
and it's been 30 years now.

280
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,676
Come on,
I'm telling you everything as it is!

281
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:40,223
My son and his wife have been
getting pushed around by Kwang-chul,

282
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,183
and now this is where they've ended up.

283
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,352
I'm not sure if you're aware,

284
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,939
but my grandson is in the hospital
getting ready for his surgery.

285
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,944
My son was running around getting
into all that shit to protect his family.

286
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,613
To put it bluntly,

287
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,740
why do we even have cops in this country?

288
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,744
Don't you have to protect these kinds
of families from evil bastards like that?

289
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,787
Why feel guilty if he's innocent?

290
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,706
Listen up, Ms. Detective Lady.

291
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,375
My kids aren't who you're looking for.

292
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:12,922
I don't know
what kind of illegal investigation

293
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,342
made you guys end up in this situation,

294
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:19,179
but don't you think asking a wanted
old man to dig up dirt on his own family

295
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,182
is a bit too cruel?

296
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,934
I have connections with some cops too.

297
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,104
If that doesn't work out,
I can even call a reporter.

298
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,234
It'll be better for the both of us
if you just forget about my family.

299
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,319
Don't you think?

300
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,284
You guys are one hell of a family.

301
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:43,995
Old man,

302
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,457
I've got nothing to lose.

303
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,713
Tell your son that he can either confess
or die with his whole family.

304
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,757
Tell him to choose one.

305
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,648
Let's do this.

306
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,109
Since the cops think you're just a pawn,

307
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,112
go to jail for something like assault
for about six months.

308
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,279
I'll help you out.

309
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,241
But you have to reveal the cop
who's been exploiting you.

310
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,786
You don't have time. You'll die
even if the cops don't get to you.

311
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,329
You're telling me to go to jail?

312
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,747
That's helping me out?

313
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,125
You call that a deal, bitch?

314
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,835
Accept it while it's on the table.

315
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,796
For a thug like you to pick
and choose is a luxury for you.

316
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,549
Or you can just go fucking die.

317
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,343
Fuck.

318
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,768
-The test results will be out soon.
-Okay.

319
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,896
And the doctor will go over
the details with you.

320
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,440
Okay, I understand.

321
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,198
Mom.

322
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,244
Dad is in a dangerous state right now.

323
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,457
Dad commits crimes or something
with the guy next door.

324
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,584
There's a bunch of money in the garage.

325
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,587
There's no way
Dad could earn that much money.

326
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,508
You have to stop him
before he gets into serious trouble.

327
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,887
Damn it, this is supposed to be a secret.

328
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,890
I'm just letting you know.

329
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,309
Committing a crime is a different level.

330
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,519
You should ask the cops for help

331
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,396
before it's too late.

332
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,865
I'll take care of it.

333
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,825
So just trust me this once.

334
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,911
You just worry about Hyun-woo.

335
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,304
Men think that if they fall,
their families will fall with them.

336
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,266
But it's the women
that are holding up the family.

337
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,897
You need to protect them. Your family.

338
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,238
What do I have to do
to protect my family completely?

339
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,406
"Completely"?

340
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,324
Yes.

341
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,620
Without anyone getting hurt. Completely.

342
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,791
All you have to do is tell me the truth

343
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,545
about why your husband
is being dragged around by his neighbor.

344
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,176
When he first found the van,
he said there was no one there,

345
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,970
and that it was just a bag of money.

346
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,513
No one was there?

347
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,515
Where was the van?

348
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,101
The road leading to our neighborhood.

349
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:58,439
They were about 30 kilometers out
when they found the van.

350
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,025
Who do you think moved it?

351
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,028
That has nothing to do with my husband.

352
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,531
There was something else
other than the money.

353
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,034
Your husband probably hid whatever it was

354
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,662
and got involved with Kwang-chul.

355
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,124
You seem to not
really know about your husband.

356
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,502
You didn't even know he was
delivering drugs when you're his family.

357
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,963
All right, then.

358
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,173
If there's anything else,
please give me a call.

359
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,142
I told you everything I know.

360
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,815
You'll leave our family alone now, right?

361
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,493
DETECTIVE, NARCOTICS SQUAD
KANG JOO-HYUN

362
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,663
How's Hyun-woo?

363
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,040
He just fell asleep.

364
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,751
We need to wait for the test results.

365
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,589
Where are you?
Hyun-woo's been looking for you.

366
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,800
I'll be there tomorrow.

367
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,804
Hey, the female cop
from our neighborhood came by for a visit.

368
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:53,721
But--

369
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,722
Eun-ju.

370
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,225
You didn't do anything.

371
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,644
I'm the one who took you to Busan

372
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,521
and you didn't know about anything.

373
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,232
Take good care of Hyun-woo.

374
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,694
Don't worry.

375
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,155
Everything will be over after tonight.

376
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,918
DANMIN HOSPITAL

377
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,338
Are you sure he's coming?

378
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,967
He will. We planned on meeting here.

379
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,054
You're going to…

380
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,641
let our family go, right?

381
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,478
Don't worry.

382
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,284
What about Kwang-chul?

383
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,204
I'm headed to the appointed place.

384
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,873
I'll get rid of him tonight.

385
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,542
-What about the professor?
-Him too.

386
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,554
After everything is over,

387
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,139
what about me?

388
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,935
Will you let me live?

389
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,572
Let's make a deal.

390
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,158
Since the cops think you're a just a pawn,

391
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,745
go to jail for something like assault
for about six months. I'll help you out.

392
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,124
What?
What did you just say about Han-cheol?

393
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,002
He's an undercover agent.
You need to get rid of him.

394
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,797
-Or else we'll both be exposed.
-Wait.

395
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,425
-You're saying Han-cheol is a cop?
-Yeah.

396
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,512
But he's getting close
to finding out about us.

397
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,389
If I die, you die too.
You understand what I'm saying?

398
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,309
Fuck. This is so shitty.

399
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,853
Come on. Are you really
going to play dirty like this?

400
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,481
You guys exposed yourselves,
like dumbasses.

401
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,858
Fuck! Then what do you want me to do?

402
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,152
Kill him.

403
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,029
And bring the money.

404
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,408
If anything goes wrong,
it was them who took the money.

405
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,791
YOO HAN-CHEOL
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

406
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,175
Yes, Detective?

407
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,427
Did you get what I sent?

408
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,345
What?

409
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,142
You're someone I can trust, right?

410
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,270
Find the evidence
to prove that she's a rat.

411
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,610
KANG JOO-HYUN
UNTITLED

412
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,853
Yes.

413
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,522
He's almost here.

414
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,983
All of them?

415
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,987
Yes, sir.

416
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,463
Shit…

417
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,810
All you have to do is stay at home.

418
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,729
We'll take care of everything.

419
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,691
How did you get involved
in something like this?

420
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,030
People like us never get happy endings.

421
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,904
Hey!

422
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,914
I'm here.

423
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,537
Smoke one, it'll be your last.

424
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,792
Yong-soo's dead.

425
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,923
You guys will soon be dead too,
you fucking idiots.

426
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,509
This shit happened because of you.

427
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,219
No.

428
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,847
It's all because of that punk.

429
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,684
It's because that fucking bastard

430
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,354
stole the money.

431
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,440
That's why all of this is happening.

432
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,072
Han-cheol, that bastard.

433
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,076
You didn't know he was a cop, did you?

434
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,956
If only he would've died first,
it would've all been over.

435
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,667
But that son of a bitch over there

436
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:25,506
took off with the money,
which is why all of this happened.

437
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:30,970
We

438
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,306
were one family.

439
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,809
Family.

440
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,353
The one who set this up
to kill their own family

441
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,564
is you, isn't it?

442
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,731
No.

443
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,985
The head cartel made me do it.

444
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,197
I'm sorry. Okay?

445
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,866
It's my bad.

446
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,952
Fuck…

447
00:40:56,036 --> 00:41:00,958
He said he would kill me if I didn't.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

448
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,256
Let's ditch the head cartel.

449
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,635
I held hands with a cop.

450
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,847
If we help them catch the head cartel,

451
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,640
all of us

452
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,728
would get helped out. She promised me.

453
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,177
The most helpful trait for survival

454
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,262
is not good,

455
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,848
but evil.

456
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,020
IN LOVING MEMORY OF NAM MUN-CHEOL
