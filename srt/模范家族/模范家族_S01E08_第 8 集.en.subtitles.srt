1
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,517
She died two years ago?

2
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,729
Why didn't you call me?

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,314
Are you married yet?

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,483
I will be, soon.

5
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,610
When?

6
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,370
Will you be okay without me?

7
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,916
-She thinks you died when I was little.
-How did you tell her that I died?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,543
Is that important?

9
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,797
What's important is that you're dead.

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,842
Did you have to kill someone
who's alive and well, you punk?

11
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,595
-I should be there.
-Don't bother.

12
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,390
You were never anything more
than a stranger.

13
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,518
-Why would you come to my wedding?
-Do you need to talk like that?

14
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,187
You were the same way with Mom

15
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,147
and the same with me.

16
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,692
Whenever you came home,
something bad always happened.

17
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,694
You know what I'm saying, right?

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,489
I told you where you can find Mom,

19
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,365
so don't contact me again.

20
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,413
I can live just fine without you.

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,220
Dad, can we have this dog?

22
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,430
I'm not cleaning the poop. You do it.

23
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,641
Shouldn't we call a shelter and report it?

24
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:43,144
This dog has been digging up
the whole backyard like it owns the place.

25
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,064
Hey, get over here.

26
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,734
What kind of shit
have you gotten yourself into?

27
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,069
Huh?

28
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,656
Explain yourself, asshole.

29
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,617
Those guys that are buried
in your backyard,

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,035
did you kill them all?

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,246
Did you?

32
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,792
Those crazy bastards buried corpses
in someone else's backyard?

33
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,336
Why didn't they use their own backyard?

34
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,713
What about the money?

35
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,674
Where's the money right now?

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,759
I gave it back.

37
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,847
You gave it back to them,
but you're still taking orders from them?

38
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,933
Are you a doormat?

39
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,144
Why didn't you report them to the police?

40
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,020
I'm an accomplice.

41
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,191
My next-door neighbor is
already buried right now.

42
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,944
And I almost got buried right next to him.

43
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,114
They won't hesitate to kill my family too.

44
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,825
I thought your child was sick,
you fucking idiot.

45
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,244
What have you been doing
with your life? You…

46
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,726
Yeon-woo and Hyun-woo, come back in now.

47
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,643
Okay.

48
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,479
Jeez. We haven't even
been out for that long.

49
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,649
Hey, I said I'm not going to pick up
any poop. You clean up after it.

50
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,567
Okay.

51
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,917
-Hello?
-Am I speaking with Hyun-woo's mother?

52
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,738
Don't you think you're being
a bit too overt? What if you get caught?

53
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,079
FAMILY RELATIONS CERTIFICATE
KANG EUN-JU

54
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,580
IDENTIFICATION CARD

55
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,555
You're awfully quiet.

56
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,647
I haven't found out anything yet.
Wait a little bit.

57
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,318
Push the geezer
to bring us anything we can work with.

58
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,571
If we don't make progress,
we'll be at the complaints department.

59
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,282
Yes, ma'am.

60
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,952
The old man needs to come through for us.

61
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,924
Hey, brace yourself.

62
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,552
For what?

63
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,430
There's a storm coming.

64
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,559
Does our family look normal to you?

65
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,063
Is anyone in our family normal?

66
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,232
Our grandpa came back from the dead,

67
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,192
you were basically born defective,

68
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,945
Mom is hysterical, and I'm a troublemaker.

69
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,448
Even that dog who lost its owner…

70
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,117
-I guess Dad's the only normal one?
-Dad is…

71
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,665
There's a reason
why I can't talk about him,

72
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,001
but he's the most abnormal one
in our family.

73
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,879
Anyway, just brace yourself.

74
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,549
Because we have
some big-ass rain clouds coming our way.

75
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,929
Thanks to a generous decision
by the donor,

76
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,765
Hyun-woo's able to get his surgery.

77
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,809
As you already know,
he has to take a compatibility test,

78
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,812
so you'll have to get ready
and start the patient intake process.

79
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,273
Hey.

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,318
I have something tomorrow,

81
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,528
so I might be away for a night.

82
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,448
And my dad said

83
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,867
he's going to stay for a few more days.

84
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,162
He said he needs to find a place to stay.

85
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,915
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,958
When will you get the money
for the surgery?

87
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,294
Is it even possible?

88
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,882
If we need to,
I can probably borrow it from somewhere.

89
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:23,800
"Borrow"?

90
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,513
You're a drug courier,
and you still can't make a buck.

91
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,350
I'm going to my mom's with the kids.

92
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,269
We'll be there for the time being,

93
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,856
so you can live here with your dad.

94
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,692
I can't leave the kids here.
Our neighbors are too dangerous.

95
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,570
I'm going to have
the kids transfer schools.

96
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,198
I guess that could be good for them.

97
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,410
There's nothing for you to do.
I'll take care of everything.

98
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,411
So…

99
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,706
you handle your own business.

100
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,873
Anyway, just brace yourself.

101
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,959
Because we have
some big-ass rain clouds coming our way.

102
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,348
I'm busy today, so I'll head out first.

103
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,020
Yeon-woo and Hyun-woo, have fun at school.

104
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,688
Okay. Bye, Dad.

105
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,731
All right.

106
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,257
Who's the old guy at your house?

107
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,258
He's my father,

108
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,844
but he'll be leaving in a few days.

109
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,138
Why were the police there?

110
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,559
I've had some problems
with my dad since I was young.

111
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,686
Load the money and wait outside.

112
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,731
I'll send you the location separately.

113
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,107
How long…

114
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,153
do I have to do this?

115
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,113
Until I say you can stop.

116
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,448
No…

117
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,077
I don't think I can do it anymore.

118
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,748
How am I supposed to continue
when my family's about to break apart?

119
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,086
Isn't that better than dying?

120
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,004
Wasn't it until I pay everything back?

121
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,132
When is this going to end?

122
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,928
This next job's an important one.

123
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,265
Nothing can go wrong.

124
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,392
Just keep that in mind.

125
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,854
Kwang-chul hasn't moved yet.

126
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:24,772
Wait.

127
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,943
-The professor's car is heading out.
-Tail him.

128
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,195
According to the guy
who worked for Kwang-chul,

129
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,030
he's the one who's moving the money.

130
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,575
Get the cash
before they meet the head cartel.

131
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,492
Okay.

132
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,249
I sent some guys over.

133
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,670
If Kwang-chul and the head cartel team up,
it'll be a headache for us.

134
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,967
You can't get a damn thing done properly,

135
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,052
that's why you got bitten by your own dog.

136
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,764
There wasn't much going on with my family.

137
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,893
But, Dong-ha must have seen the guy
from across the street get dragged away.

138
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,521
That's what they're holding above his head

139
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,939
and threatening my son with.

140
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,108
They were still taking advantage of him.

141
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,319
Those bastards.

142
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,487
They're some terrible human beings.

143
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,826
Just because he was a witness,
they threatened to kill his whole family.

144
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,455
By the way,
if something happens to my kids,

145
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,498
it'd be a big problem
for the cops as well.

146
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,667
You knew about everything

147
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,045
yet neglected innocent citizens.

148
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,505
Did your innocent son say
anything about any money?

149
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,342
I don't know anything about that.

150
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,473
He said he was going
on a business trip today.

151
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,520
Shouldn't the police be protecting him,
or something like that?

152
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,272
"A business trip"?

153
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,651
They might be meeting
the head cartel today.

154
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,819
Just take them all out in one go.

155
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,781
I'll give you a play-by-play
as things play out.

156
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,954
What the fuck are you talking about?
There won't be a better chance.

157
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,625
Contribute to your country
and make Chief of Police.

158
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,212
Damn it.

159
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,425
Don't be like that, and just go along
with this one. Come on!

160
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,349
Fine.

161
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,060
If you won't help me,
I'm not going down alone.

162
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,104
I'm bringing you down with me,
motherfucker!

163
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,484
Okay, fine.

164
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,743
PARK DONG-HA

165
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,165
PASS-ONE DISTRIBUTION

166
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,129
Move out of the way.

167
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,135
The cops will be there.

168
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,845
Just retrieve the money.

169
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,389
We need to really get
on the head cartel's side. Okay?

170
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,390
Yes, sir.

171
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,651
Hey, have him call
as soon as he finds the money.

172
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,280
We're taking the cash to the head cartel.
We're not working with these punks.

173
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,364
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:27,955
All right, then.

175
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,003
Pass-one is moving. We'll follow them.

176
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,887
Is it okay to go without any backup?

177
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,513
As long as you don't screw it up.

178
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,980
The money will be moving.
It's our last chance. Stay on your toes.

179
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,090
MISSED CALL
010-0238-0185

180
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,936
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY IS GOING TO DIE
CALL ME IF YOU WANT TO LIVE

181
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,152
Hello?

182
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,488
I'll send you the address,
so head over there.

183
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,826
-You're all good to go!
-All right.

184
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,080
Have a good day.

185
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,337
JOEUN AUTO CENTER

186
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,467
He's leaving. Follow him.

187
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,398
Wait in the car.

188
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,538
Isn't that the professor's car?

189
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,645
Listen carefully.

190
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,564
We're going to follow you from close by.

191
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,774
You just need
to drive the car there and back.

192
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:02,985
Are we good?

193
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,070
-Yes, sir.
-Take that car.

194
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,537
Where do I go?

195
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,915
You'll find out in the car.

196
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,056
Get in.

197
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,058
Why are you here?

198
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,225
Just get in.

199
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,227
I'll tell you on the way.

200
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,485
You may head upstairs.

201
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,916
I saw it on the news.

202
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,044
The cops are conducting
a large-scale drug bust.

203
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,380
That'll shoot the prices up, won't it?

204
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,759
I'm aware

205
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,137
of what my husband has been doing,

206
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,181
and the reasons behind it.

207
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,599
So?

208
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,895
I need you to promise me something
in exchange for me keeping quiet.

209
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,232
Promise me that you won't harm our kids.

210
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,609
-And…
-"And"?

211
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,194
Money.

212
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,446
"Money"?

213
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,825
Money is always the problem.

214
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,079
Money can get a man killed and saved.

215
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,331
I need money, right now.

216
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,669
If the drug prices go up,
shouldn't the labor cost also increase?

217
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,752
Kwang-chul is still in there,
and the professor's car just came out.

218
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,344
How did it…

219
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,686
They moved the money.
Follow the professor's car.

220
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,896
It's that gray car.

221
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,654
Go to Busan Grand Beach Hotel.

222
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,615
What are you doing here?

223
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,826
Why are you doing this?

224
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:02,039
I need money. The hospital called.
Hyun-woo can get his surgery.

225
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,418
So just keep looking forward.
We just need to keep going ahead.

226
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,134
Where are you?

227
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,928
We're following Kang-jun and his men.

228
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,304
Don't lose them.

229
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,515
-All you have to do is catch them.
-Yes, ma'am.

230
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:34,905
Shit.

231
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,563
This punk.

232
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,233
PARK DONG-HA - KANG EUN-JU
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

233
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,110
YOO HAN-CHEOL
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

234
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,111
UNDERCOVER AND MIA

235
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,949
Why didn't you tell me about Hyun-woo?

236
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,535
Even if I did,
what could you have done about it?

237
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,789
In return for this job, we'll get money
for the surgery and treatment.

238
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,293
He told me to keep an eye on you,
because today's job is an important one.

239
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,796
-I don't think he trusts you anymore.
-He said that?

240
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,090
Also, it's your fault that I'm doing this.

241
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,552
You stole the money,
and now you're handing it back.

242
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,597
Because of that, our family now
has no idea when we might die.

243
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,307
You? "Protecting our family"?

244
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,601
Does that make any sense to you?

245
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,565
This is our last chance,
and we can't lose it.

246
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,400
All I trust is results.

247
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,780
-Whereas all you have is good intentions.
-No, now you're involved as well.

248
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,617
You're calling this an opportunity?

249
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,037
We'll never break free from that thug.

250
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,289
No matter how good the results are.

251
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,594
Is that motherfucker sleeping,
or some shit?

252
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,888
How many hours has it been already?

253
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,765
Wait.

254
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,779
-You're here, sir.
-What's the matter?

255
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,572
He's been going around in circles

256
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,908
and hasn't moved an inch
after parking there.

257
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,079
-Since when?
-It's been about two or three hours.

258
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,249
I think they're waiting
for the head cartel's call.

259
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,048
Damn it!
Why is he getting out of that car?

260
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,718
I told you to chase
after the professor, idiot!

261
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,719
Come over here.

262
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,596
Fucking idiots. They must've lost him.

263
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,557
How the hell do guys like that
smuggle drugs into the country?

264
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,643
Hello?

265
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,479
Professor?

266
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,317
What is it?

267
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,902
Can you not talk right now?

268
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,280
Just tell me where you're headed.
I'll help you.

269
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,739
Why should your family suffer?

270
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,199
Just give me the money.

271
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,038
Yes, I have
to take care of some business in Busan.

272
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,082
I will be back…

273
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,295
I'll call you back
once I get back to Seoul.

274
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,682
Hey, get closer.

275
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,021
What are they doing?

276
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,775
What's going on, man?
Can't you get anything done properly?

277
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,278
Follow me, and don't get lost.

278
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,328
I want him skinned
after we find that money.

279
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,579
Yes, sir.

280
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,749
They're moving. Get closer.

281
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,126
Damn…

282
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,013
I think they caught on.

283
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,264
They all left.

284
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,892
Where is the professor?

285
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,604
He says he's almost arrived in Busan.
I think that bought us enough time.

286
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,025
Let's go, now that we don't have a tail.

287
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,029
Yes, ma'am.
We're on the Gyeongbu Expressway.

288
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,784
Wait, but,
shouldn't we be asking for backup?

289
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,869
What the--

290
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,954
What? Did she say no?

291
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,956
Goodness.

292
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,546
Head to the third basement level.

293
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,049
We should have
a reservation for Room 1201.

294
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,745
This is what they told me to do.
Then they'll find it on their own.

295
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,507
Follow them.

296
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,824
-How can I help you?
-Thank you for your hard work.

297
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,659
I'm going to ask for your cooperation.

298
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,577
Oh…

299
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,587
Is there something wrong?

300
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,429
Just tell me where you're headed.
I'll help you.

301
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,182
Why should your family suffer?
Just give me the money.

302
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,398
Eun-ju.

303
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,276
Stop drinking.

304
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,493
He said we just have to spend
a night here and go back.

305
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,413
That probably means I can drink.

306
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,290
He'll contact us soon.

307
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,417
-We just need to wait.
-You believe that?

308
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,544
I told you I'd take care of it.

309
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,690
Hello?

310
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,362
Is that all you're going to tell me?
You're putting me through the mill.

311
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,830
If I give you the money, will you really

312
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,416
leave my family alone?

313
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,255
This fucking guy is
so fucking scared of everything. Goddamn.

314
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,260
If I wanted you all dead,

315
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,346
do you think I wouldn't be able to do it?
I know where you live.

316
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,764
But,

317
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,810
what would I get from killing your family?
Why would I do that?

318
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,231
Just go on and live happily ever after.
I don't fucking care.

319
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,691
Just give me the money.

320
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,193
And I'll get rid of Kkwang-chul for you.

321
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,616
Check if the professor's doing okay.

322
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,451
Yes, sir.

323
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,757
He's asking if there's anything wrong.

324
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,391
You never can get any recognition
for anything you do.

325
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,605
What? What are you going to do?

326
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,106
To check on the goods.

327
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,692
If the job's done now,
I'm going back to Seoul.

328
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,613
Wait, Eun-ju.

329
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:59,618
If we hand over the money to someone else,
he said he'd let us go.

330
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,494
What are you saying?

331
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,538
There are people who want that money.

332
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,625
He said nothing will happen to us
as long as we give him the money.

333
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,959
Are you insane?

334
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,296
Hyun-woo's in the hospital right now!

335
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,591
We need the money for his surgery.
What are you saying?

336
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,136
Are you out of your mind?

337
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,608
What?

338
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,235
The wife's going down the elevator.
What should I do?

339
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,320
She'll come here.

340
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,155
Keep your eyes on the professor.

341
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,996
We just need to take the money,
so let's not make a scene.

342
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,584
Hey. You guys go back to the car.
You'll scare the professor.

343
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,986
-Hello?
-Did the wife go back into the room?

344
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,447
She took the elevator.
Did she not go down there?

345
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,076
I should check the security room.
I'll find her. Don't lose the professor.

346
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,631
Mr. Pig.

347
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:41,177
Beach Hotel. I'll give you the cue,
so get your timing right.

348
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,361
Call her.

349
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,699
Kang-jun came to the hotel.
What should we do?

350
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,453
Check if we can get backup
and be on standby.

351
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,620
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,622
What did she say?

353
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,191
A woman from our neighborhood
is at the hotel.

354
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,109
On a weekday afternoon

355
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,279
all the way down in Busan.

356
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,698
What are the chances that our neighbor

357
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,326
ends up at the same hotel as us?

358
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,702
Well…

359
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,329
She's a cop.

360
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,583
She was watching our car
in the parking lot.

361
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,545
-We need to get out of here.
-Wait, what about the money?

362
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,797
We need to hurry.

363
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,264
Professor, it's a pleasure to meet you.

364
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,560
There's no need to be nervous.

365
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,355
We'll leave once you show us
the money and give us the keys.

366
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,023
The third basement level?

367
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,819
The third basement level.

368
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,333
Sorry.

369
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,136
TEAM LEADER
KANG JOO-HYUN

370
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,099
You should pick up your phone.

371
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,520
Oh, I can take the call once I get off.

372
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,064
Who are you?

373
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,234
-Sorry?
-Aren't you going to press a button?

374
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,781
I'm also getting off at the same level.

375
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,871
You're the fucker that was hiding
at the end of the hall earlier, right?

376
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:14,747
Me?

377
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,457
No, that wasn't me.

378
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,505
Police?

379
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,925
No.

380
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,310
TEAM LEADER
KANG JOO-HYUN

381
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,107
-Hey!
-Fuck.

382
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,033
What are you doing, man?

383
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,118
Come here, motherfucker.

384
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,662
Who were those people?

385
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,082
The guys who said would let us go
if we gave the money.

386
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,380
We have to take the money!

387
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,393
Shouldn't we check
if the money's still there?

388
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,311
What the…

389
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,731
-Hey!
-In front of you! Watch out!

390
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,774
Hey!

391
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,460
Yun-seok!

392
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,586
Are you okay?

393
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,100
He's not picking up.
He's not picking up again.

394
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,852
What do we do? Where do we go?

395
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,369
Follow them, you punk!

396
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,565
Hey, you'll die if you keep that money.

397
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,151
Just hand over the money
and fuck off, you idiot.

398
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,862
Motherfucker, do you have
anyone else you can trust?

399
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,406
I don't give a damn
about you or your family.

400
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,074
I'm trying to help you stay alive!

401
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,452
You fucking bastard!
Why aren't you talking? Hey!

402
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,037
Hello?

403
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,373
-Hello? Hey! Hello?
-Come here. You son of a bitch!

404
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,792
-What the fuck!
-Stop the fucking car, asshole!

405
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,086
Pull the fuck over!

406
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,129
Pull what over?

407
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,964
-Come on, asshole.
-What, motherfucker?

408
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,050
Look at this motherfucker! Pull up closer!

409
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,177
-Anything else? That water bottle.
-Pull up!

410
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,721
-You ran away yourself?
-What, bitch? You motherfucker.

411
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,973
-Look at this son of a bitch.
-Hurry up, man!

412
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,600
Step on it, you fucker!

413
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,273
Where are Mom and Dad?

414
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,984
Your aunt lives in the countryside.

415
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,613
They went there.

416
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,490
They'll be here tomorrow morning.

417
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,575
Hey, Hyun-woo.

418
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,994
Aren't you scared of the surgery?

419
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,288
He's already had four,
so this won't scare him.

420
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:46,167
I'm not scared about the surgery,
but I do feel bad.

421
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,669
-Why?
-Because it costs so much.

422
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,674
Gosh. You little punk.

423
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,052
You're more mature than me.

424
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:00,014
You may be able to buy the world
with money, but you can't buy family.

425
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,766
Don't worry about money.

426
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,893
Okay?

427
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,148
Family is, really,

428
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:13,694
a million times scarier than money.

429
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,033
Hey, you bastard!

430
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,701
Hey! You son of a bitch!

431
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,661
That bitch!

432
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,996
Keep going, you punk!

433
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,873
You fucker. Ram them!

434
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,587
Ram them!

435
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,173
That fucking bastard. Shit!

436
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,606
This guy ain't shit.

437
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,361
Hey.

438
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,320
Run them over.

439
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,202
Motherfucker!

440
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,590
Where did he go?

441
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,263
Where is it?

442
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,705
-Officer Kim, head over there.
-Yes, sir.

443
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,665
Overturned vehicle.

444
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,291
-Is it over there?
-Check the car!

445
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,001
-Yes, sir.
-No one's inside, sir!

446
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,636
How did you know about this deal, asshole?

447
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,929
Talk.

448
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,973
How did you know about the deal?

449
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,933
Because it was ours.

450
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,353
I should be the one asking…

451
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,731
How did you know where to find us?

452
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,695
Who are you?

453
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,988
Who sent you?

454
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,823
Enough with the bullshit.

455
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,866
Where's the money?

456
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,035
You're not one of them.

457
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,580
Fuck. They double-crossed me.

458
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,291
Where are the guys
from the head cartel, asshole?

459
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,417
I don't know!

460
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,627
Fuck the head cartel, fucking…

461
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,714
Hey.

462
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:06,052
There's this cop I've been working with.

463
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,221
Don't you want to know who it is?

464
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,556
Huh?

465
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,060
Once we secure the money, kill Mr. Kim.

466
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,146
-Bring his boys under us.
-Yes, sir.

467
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,232
How could I let go of the head cartel?
There's no better partner.

468
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,320
What the head cartel wants

469
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,824
is a capable organization
that's willing to work like dogs for them.

470
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,242
That's it.

471
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,745
-Get moving.
-Yes, sir.

472
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,383
What the…

473
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,718
Where did the phone go?

474
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,806
Do you want the head cartel?

475
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,600
If you let me go--

476
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,811
Tell me about the cop
who was working with you.

477
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,074
We're all

478
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,701
in this shit

479
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,830
because of that asshole.

480
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,626
If only that punk
never told me to kill Han-cheol,

481
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,254
none of this would have happened.

482
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,213
So?

483
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,259
Did you kill him?

484
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,802
I was told to kill him,

485
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,138
so that's what I did.

486
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,559
Give me the name of the cop.

487
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,237
You fucking bitch.

488
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,614
Let's make a deal

489
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,450
that's good for you,

490
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,785
and good for me.

491
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,250
PASS-ONE DISTRIBUTION
CHOI KANG-JUN

492
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,434
What are you doing over there?

493
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,938
I'm a cop. An officer.

494
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,535
The call has been forwarded…

495
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,163
How long do you think she knew?
That woman.

496
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,876
If she followed us all the way here,

497
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,420
it means she knew everything.

498
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,884
If she knew everything,
she would have arrested us already.

499
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,555
There has to be a reason why she can't.

500
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,433
It's all over now
since we protected the money.

501
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,186
We just have to tell them we're done…

502
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,518
Are those guys
still chasing the professor?

503
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,852
Who knows?

00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,048
