1
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,857
I LOVE YOU, HYUN-WOO

2
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,194
His surgery was yesterday.

3
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,530
Does it mean more to you than your son?

4
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,992
I know. I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,038
But, how am I supposed to tell him
I can't make it?

6
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,666
Those damn professors are
blood-sucking vampires.

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,919
They're like demons
trying to ruin our family!

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,632
You don't have to become a professor.

9
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,760
Let's just try to be happy ourselves.

10
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,386
Hyun-woo's sick.

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,725
And Yeon-woo walks on eggshells
because of that.

12
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,810
That's exactly why I'm trying so hard.

13
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,021
I have to at least get
that job as a professor

14
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,023
so we can pay
for Hyun-woo's medical bills.

15
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,400
Try watching Hyun-woo all day long!

16
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,988
It breaks my heart. It's killing me!

17
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,989
I know.

18
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,117
Everything will get better.

19
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,036
Trust me, okay?

20
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,249
-Mom.
-Yes?

21
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,004
Mom.

22
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,298
I'm perfectly fine.

23
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,592
Let's go home.

24
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,609
I want to run away.

25
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,219
-Get him!
-Stop right there!

26
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,333
You're all set.

27
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,506
How did you get hurt?

28
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,388
The window…

29
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,266
The window broke.

30
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,859
Make sure to clean your wound
and have the stitches removed in a week.

31
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,389
Is there anything you can do properly?

32
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,407
Hey, come and load this too.

33
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,081
-Do you have to go this far?
-Hello.

34
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,126
What are you moving
into that neighborhood for?

35
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,839
There's a surveillance team.
Have them do it. Don't go yourself.

36
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,428
A team leader has
her own set of responsibilities.

37
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,931
You're right. That's why I'm doing this.

38
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,193
It's dangerous
when you're hot on the trail.

39
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,738
And that's exactly why I have to go.

40
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,699
Who would I send?

41
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,826
Then take more guys with you.

42
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,539
You're dealing with brutal thugs.
Plus, something ended up happening.

43
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,041
I'll wrap this case up well,
and get you a medal.

44
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,628
So you can get promoted.

45
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,505
That sounds sarcastic to me.

46
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,013
I know…

47
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,687
how you felt about Han-cheol,

48
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,023
but this isn't my fault.

49
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,485
Han-cheol wanted to do it.
Nobody forced him.

50
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,364
That's why we acted like
it never happened. Didn't we?

51
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,116
-Yun-seok.
-Yes, ma'am.

52
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,079
-Be careful out there.
-Yes, ma'am.

53
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,916
-And take good care of Joo-hyun.
-Yes, ma'am.

54
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,753
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

55
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,219
What? Hurry up.
Are you going to move these all night?

56
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,388
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,476
Where did you go last night?
And what's wrong with your face?

58
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,771
I just couldn't fall asleep,

59
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,649
so I went on a little drive
to Waterside Park.

60
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,694
When I got there, I fell down a hill.

61
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,112
Like a moron.

62
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,323
I heard that park is packed with perverts.

63
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,327
Perverts? I didn't see any.

64
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,080
You look so manly
with that scar on your face.

65
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,457
Very macho.

66
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,333
Thanks.

67
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,217
I'm leaving.

68
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,181
Yeon-woo, let's go together.
I'll give you a ride on my way.

69
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,350
Yeon-woo!

70
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,487
Park Yeon-woo!

71
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,157
Yeon-woo!

72
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,619
Stop it. Why aren't you acting yourself?

73
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,662
I'm just going to take the bus.

74
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,999
Come on, you can ride with me in the car,

75
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,585
and we can chat. It'll be nice.

76
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,504
Excuse me.

77
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,589
Do you live in this house?

78
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,175
-Yes, I do.
-I see.

79
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,930
Do you remember the last time
you saw the man who lives in front of you?

80
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,015
I'm not sure.

81
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,060
I think I saw him two nights ago.

82
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,813
What's going on?

83
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,814
Oh, okay.

84
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,067
We got a call
because his dog kept barking,

85
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,027
but there was no one inside.

86
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:02,083
Did you ever notice
anything strange about him?

87
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,084
Strange?

88
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,545
I'm not sure.

89
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,381
I didn't know him too well.

90
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:12,552
So, you had no idea that he's been
growing marijuana inside his house?

91
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,555
"Marijuana"?

92
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,021
I thought I heard screaming
coming from that house last night.

93
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,692
I heard someone yell
"Where is it?" at least ten times.

94
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,570
-Really?
-Maybe that's why the police came.

95
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,761
-Is your son okay?
-Yes, he is.

96
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,265
I didn't even get a chance
to say thank you.

97
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,684
I really appreciated
your help the other day.

98
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,062
This must be your daughter.

99
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,607
Yes, she is.

100
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,651
Do you work night shifts, too?
You seem to go out at night often.

101
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,820
No, not really.

102
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,115
I just go on a lot of walks at night.

103
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,702
You take your car to go on walks?

104
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,624
All right, then. I'll see you around.

105
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,044
Okay.

106
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,790
REGARDING DEATH
EAST ASIAN PERSPECTIVE ON DEATH

107
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,000
He's so annoying.

108
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,044
-What's with him?
-What is he even doing?

109
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,719
-What's going on?
-Put this in the van.

110
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,637
Yes, sir.

111
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,305
-He grew them in his house?
-Yes.

112
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,682
There are more boxes inside.

113
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,974
Is that legal?

114
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,601
We got almost everything.

115
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,602
I know.

116
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,068
Okay.

117
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,529
All right, thank you. Have a good day.

118
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,159
He's never been caught for narcotics,
and no priors whatsoever.

119
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,747
I don't think the weed guy
has anything to do with our case.

120
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,386
All right.

121
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,560
Sir, we have a report from one
of the places we scattered their photos.

122
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,356
He said a strange man
showed up to launder some cash,

123
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,151
but then ran away after causing a ruckus.

124
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,611
Where was it?

125
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,823
It's one of the businesses
connected to the boss.

126
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,325
-Who's the guy that went there?
-I don't know.

127
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,787
They tried to find out who he was,
but he took off.

128
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,205
It wasn't any of our guys.

129
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,248
We found him.

130
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,292
He's a university professor.

131
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,753
But would a professor have done that?

132
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,133
Call the cleaners,
and ask if this is the guy.

133
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,407
Good afternoon.

134
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,453
Good afternoon…

135
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,623
Good afternoon, I'm calling
about the disappearance of…

136
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,624
No, that's not it.

137
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,126
Yongbong Village…

138
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,179
Yes, good afternoon.

139
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,473
I would like to call in with a tip.

140
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,771
Well, it's about
the Yongbong Village case…

141
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,316
I'm talking about the person
growing marijuana at his house.

142
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,779
Yes, him. But, something seems off
about the people living across from him.

143
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,949
No, I didn't see anything myself.
I just heard from someone…

144
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,618
I don't live in that neighborhood,
so I'm not sure.

145
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,702
My name?

146
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,705
Why do you need to know my name?

147
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,376
No, this isn't a prank call.

148
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,463
Just, please look into it. Thank you.

149
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,080
Why am I here…

150
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,586
What the hell are you doing here…

151
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,305
And what happened to you?

152
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,099
-Joo-hyun.
-What?

153
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,851
Someone called in with a tip

154
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,811
about the missing weed dealer.

155
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,647
Someone asked the police to investigate

156
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,025
Kwang-chul's gang,
saying they looked suspicious.

157
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,903
So they dispatched a patrol car.

158
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,573
Stop that patrol car.

159
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,412
All right.

160
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,466
What's the matter?

161
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,677
Sorry to bother you,
but someone called in with a tip.

162
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,847
They're saying this house is tied
with the missing person's case.

163
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,765
How so?

164
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,100
Hold on. Who made the tip?

165
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,769
No idea. The operator received it.

166
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,520
Forget it. Do you have a warrant?

167
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,273
Let us look around for a bit.
It's just a formality.

168
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,901
-Can you come in without a warrant?
-Please cooperate.

169
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,694
Why would they need a warrant?

170
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,488
Tell them they can come in.

171
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,500
You don't have any furniture.

172
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,795
We moved in yesterday,
so nothing is set up yet.

173
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,214
I see. And what do you do for a living?

174
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,131
What?

175
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,425
Oh, I invest in stocks.

176
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,730
What's the reason for your visit again?

177
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,400
Someone called in with a tip

178
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,610
that the missing person was in this house.

179
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,320
-Feel free to look around.
-Okay.

180
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,048
I just received a call from the cleaner.
He said it was him.

181
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,720
He left all the money and took off,
so I told him to bring us the money.

182
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,437
Hey, take a look at the laptop.

183
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,872
Rewind the footage. Did we get it?

184
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,964
-Who called in with the tip?
-It was anonymous.

185
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,135
Contact the police control room.

186
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,245
Do you work night shifts too?
You seem to go out at night often.

187
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,457
No, not really.
I just go on a lot of walks at night.

188
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,142
Yes.

189
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,607
All right.

190
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,151
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

191
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,069
Hello.

192
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,783
Jeez.

193
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,996
-Sis, take the kid and wait outside.
-What?

194
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,414
All right.

195
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,041
Come on.

196
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,836
Let's go.

197
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,047
Let's talk business, Yong-soo.

198
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,763
Kwang-chul killed some random guy
while looking for the money.

199
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,473
The police stopped by his place.

200
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,642
What did you just say?

201
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,312
If shit hits the fan for Kwang-chul,
it'll get all over you, too.

202
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,736
Let's cut him out.

203
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,657
I mean, we're family,

204
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,910
but Kwang-chul has nothing
to do with our family.

205
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,163
We went through a lot together,
like brothers.

206
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,915
He's like a brother.
He's not your actual fucking brother.

207
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,588
You're the head of the household.
What about my nephew and my sister?

208
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,881
Take some responsibility.

209
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,550
The head of the household
needs to protect his family.

210
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,189
Yes, I found it.

211
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,068
Call the precinct and get them
to share what they have on the weed guy.

212
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,174
Welcome.

213
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,510
Can I get a pack of Marlboro Reds
and some nicotine gum?

214
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,724
-Does the security camera outside work?
-Yes.

215
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,643
Can I take a look at the footage?

216
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,354
I need to see footage
from 12 seconds past 1:23 p.m.

217
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,358
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to show this to anyone. We--

218
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,901
POLICE
KANG JOO-HYUN

219
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,864
Stop.

220
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,660
Keep it rolling for a bit more.

221
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,704
Stop.

222
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,211
Can you run a license plate for me?

223
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,545
95 MO…

224
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,674
0809.

225
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,633
It's black,

226
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,719
and it doesn't look like it's a new model.

227
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,513
This is a 2001 SM5.

228
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,432
Someone I know bought the same model,

229
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,768
but it started leaking oil.
It was a total mess--

230
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,395
It's a 2001 SM5.

231
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,980
Save it.

232
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,613
What?

233
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,823
Yeah.

234
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,701
They won't cooperate
without giving us a reason why.

235
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,203
They said it was an order
from the higher-ups.

236
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,121
Oh yeah.

237
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,833
The chief said to wrap things up here.
What's going on?

238
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,836
Get your head straight, man.

239
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,130
"We lost someone
in an illegal investigation."

240
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,091
"Help us with a warrant, your Honor."
Is that what you'll say?

241
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,426
If any of this gets out,

242
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,511
you think we'll just lose our badges?

243
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,056
Get rid of anything that has to do
with the undercover operation.

244
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,683
It never happened.

245
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,851
Do you understand?

246
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,190
Isn't the layout great?
The view is so nice.

247
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,401
Yes, you're right.

248
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,988
Are you interested in buying?

249
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,616
We can offer a rental contract,
but there's also the option to buy.

250
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,536
No, I'm fine with just renting.

251
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,620
I see.

252
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,080
All right, then.

253
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,835
Is there a large hospital in the area?

254
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,587
Yes, just ten minutes away by car.

255
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,257
There's even a shopping mall.
And the school district is great too.

256
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,593
-I see.
-Would you like to see the master bedroom?

257
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,970
No, I'm okay. This is great.

258
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,015
Sorry? You didn't even look around.

259
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,727
I'm sort of in a rush.

260
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,813
I'd like to move in
as soon as possible. Tomorrow, even.

261
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,120
Ta-da! We lit the candles!

262
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,710
All together, guys!

263
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,678
Have some of this.

264
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,721
Seriously!

265
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,349
Oh, no! Hyun-woo!
You rubbed it all over me.

266
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,726
Hyun-woo.

267
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,478
Hyun-woo, say "Daddy, I love you."

268
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,230
I love you.

269
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,606
How much?

270
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,463
DO NOT CROSS - POLICE LINE

271
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,661
What is it?

272
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,206
Did you find anything?

273
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,500
I just got in, dumbass.

274
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,752
I found something interesting.

275
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,753
What is it?

276
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,922
The license plate number you asked about.

277
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,382
Guess who called in to give us that tip?

278
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,510
Who?

279
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,431
It's the guy that lives right next
to the house you're currently staying in.

280
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,016
His name is Park Dong-ha.

281
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,603
He's a university professor
with a clean record.

282
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:25,565
He's never even gotten a traffic ticket.
He's a perfect law-abiding citizen.

283
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,734
But do you know what's interesting?

284
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,195
Just say it already.

285
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,366
These bastards have been running
a background check on this professor.

286
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,035
You know that pile of mail
next to that laptop earlier?

287
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,870
It was the professor's.

288
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,122
But how did they know that

289
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,542
it was the professor who reported them?

290
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,712
Or were they already looking into him
before the tip-off?

291
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,339
How could they have known?

292
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,510
He doesn't look like
that type of guy at all.

293
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:59,224
Maybe they were just running
background checks on all the residents.

294
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,228
But they only took the professor's mail.

295
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,689
Hello? Joo-hyun?

296
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,607
Are you listening? Hello?

297
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,776
He might be a witness…

298
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,572
to a murder or something.

299
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,073
Murder? No way.

300
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,743
He's on the wanted list. He probably fled
after his grow-op got busted.

301
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:23,206
I mean, not too long ago,
one of his buyers got caught too.

302
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,959
We might need to do a search instead.

303
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,254
Come on. Cops aren't that sloppy.

304
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,924
The guys here don't know Kwang-chul,
or who he actually is.

305
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,230
Either way, what are you going to do
about the chief's orders?

306
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,983
I'll go ask him
what the hell he's messing with us for.

307
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,028
It looks like…

308
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,072
Kwang-chul's on the move.
Should I follow him?

309
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,782
What the…

310
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,369
Shit! Wait!

311
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,706
He's headed that way! Damn it.

312
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,554
Fuck.

313
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,751
You think it's the cops?

314
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,046
Or maybe it's one of the delivery guys?

315
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,631
What about this guy?

316
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,758
He hasn't come home yet.

317
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,720
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

318
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,648
Damn…

319
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,827
You scared the crap out of me.

320
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,497
Why did you have to hit me?

321
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,501
Jeez.

322
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,052
Fuck. We lost them.

323
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,430
Where the hell is he going?

324
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,766
Don't worry. He didn't take off for good.

325
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,518
They're still looking for something.

326
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,561
Is it money?

327
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,187
Who knows?

328
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,941
They wouldn't be here if they found it.

329
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,360
They need to find the head cartel's money.

330
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,655
And that goes for us too.
Because that money

331
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,325
is our ticket to the head cartel.

332
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,954
If everything that's happened
until now was because of money,

333
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,082
how did the money end up here
in this neighborhood?

334
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,417
I can't figure that out.

335
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,879
There must be a reason
why the money ended up here.

336
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,257
But because that money ended up here,

337
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,385
it looks like this man
unwillingly got involved.

338
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:25,652
DAD

339
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,613
-Hey, Dad.
-Hyun-woo.

340
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,616
-Did you get back from school?
-What?

341
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:36,079
Hyun-woo, how long has it been
since we've lived in our neighborhood?

342
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,957
Aren't you getting
kind of tired of living there?

343
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,919
-Are we moving?
-No, just asking.

344
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,463
What about Mom?

345
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,547
She's home.

346
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,884
Dad, are you not coming home today?

347
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,470
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm on my way right now.

348
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,515
Hey, do you remember
how you fainted the other day

349
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,644
and those guys from across the street,
the ones that helped you…

350
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:03,564
Can you look out your window
and see if they're home?

351
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,149
Just a second.

352
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,614
Their lights are on.

353
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,826
Oh yeah?

354
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,745
Dad, when are you coming home?

355
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,772
Hello.

356
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,445
-Are you just getting off work?
-Yes.

357
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,572
Wait a second.

358
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,284
Is there something going on?

359
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,201
No.

360
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,038
Not yet.

361
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,462
Something's about to happen now.

362
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,923
They were both already dead.

363
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,303
I'm telling the truth.
The car was covered in blood.

364
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,556
I didn't want anyone to see,
so I came home

365
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,225
and just buried them in my backyard.

366
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:25,688
The money… The money is in my garage.

367
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,400
But, when I went to go get it laundered

368
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,738
I lost maybe a quarter of it.
No, maybe even a third of it?

369
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,656
I promise I'll pay it all back!

370
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,741
My gosh!

371
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,036
I'll really pay all of it back!

372
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,747
The money's not the problem, dumbass.

373
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,290
You know too much.

374
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,042
-I haven't said a word.
-Get up, man.

375
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,169
-It's the truth.
-But you called the cops?

376
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,215
Please!

377
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,889
For fuck's sake.

378
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,309
Shit.

379
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,521
Mr. Professor,

380
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,441
you get to stay neighbors
with the weed man even in the afterlife.

381
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,738
We're doing this shit again. Fuck.

382
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,157
Jeez.

383
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,995
Breaking our backs,
all because of this bastard.

384
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,665
Damn it.

385
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,421
You should leave with the money.

386
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,966
I'll make sure they finish the job
before I head down.

387
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,092
What is this?

388
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,148
-Jung-bae.
-Yes, sir.

389
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,400
Dig him out.

390
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,485
Sorry?

391
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,239
I said, take him out.

392
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,127
From now on, you are going to pay us back.

393
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,838
How?

394
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,715
Just do whatever we tell you to do.

395
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,261
You're a part of the family now.

396
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,351
Go.

397
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,897
Go and wait for us to contact you.

398
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,486
A lot of people get involved
because they need money or drugs.

399
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,573
They're all desperate.

400
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,534
But they always cause trouble.

401
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,953
Running off with cash or dope.

402
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,790
Those people were only desperate
for their own lives.

403
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,542
BUSAN STATION

404
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,545
Do you know what kind of people
are more desperate than them?

405
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,132
People who need to feed their families.

406
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,425
Breadwinners.

407
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,681
But he has something else on top of that.

408
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,227
He's a breadwinner
that needs to save his sick child.

409
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,188
No one could be more desperate.

410
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,024
A double-cross?

411
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,401
He could never.

412
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,278
Are you here for the delivery?

413
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,739
On top of that,
as far as the cops can tell,

414
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,699
he's a law-abiding citizen.

415
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,077
The new face in town.

416
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,996
The best mule we could ask for.

417
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:41,128
IN LOVING MEMORY OF NAM MUN-CHEOL
