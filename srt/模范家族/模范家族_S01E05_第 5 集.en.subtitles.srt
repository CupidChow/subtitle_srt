1
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,893
Whenever something like this happens,
I'm always reminded of something.

2
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,481
Nobody dies in vain.

3
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,819
There's a small lesson to be learned
with each and every death.

4
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,654
It's so simple.

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,032
"Don't be a traitor."

6
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,201
Is it really that hard?

7
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,967
He didn't die in vain.

8
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,096
Even a punk like him had something
to teach you guys as he left us.

9
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,813
So…

10
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,650
are you ready to learn?

11
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,283
When it rings once, end the call.
Then call it back.

12
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,285
I won't answer other numbers.

13
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,791
Let's try and make it work.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,960
And take today's lesson to heart.

15
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,073
He's coming back after delivery.

16
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,409
-Were there any problems?
-No, sir.

17
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,371
-He did well for his first run.
-Keep an eye on the money.

18
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,288
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,707
Jung-bae.

20
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,378
Is this considered a betrayal?

21
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,382
If we lose, it's betrayal.

22
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,137
But if we win,
wouldn't it be called something else?

23
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,392
Get some rest, sir.

24
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,766
THERE'S AN ISSUE
WITH THE MONEY TO THE HEAD CARTEL.

25
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,020
PLEASE CALL ME.

26
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,796
What is that?

27
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,882
That's a cell phone.

28
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,427
It's not like the phone
is made out of gold.

29
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,472
So why is it popping up here
all of a sudden?

30
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,140
The head cartel?

31
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,099
Bingo.

32
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,310
Look at it. It's a 2G phone, right?

33
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,480
No one uses a 2G phone these days.
What is he, a caveman?

34
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,565
2G phones are hard to track.

35
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,651
They're for guys
who have something to hide.

36
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,320
So, if we can get our hands on this thing,
it's game over.

37
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,198
-That's right.
-Wow!

38
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,992
You guys finally made
some headway, didn't you?

39
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,953
You were always a step behind.

40
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,121
The head cartel will
help clean up the mess.

41
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,915
We can't afford to lose him now.

42
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,709
Keep a close eye on the professor.
We need him as a witness.

43
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,879
-If you lose him, he could die.
-Understood.

44
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,343
Good work.

45
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,179
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

46
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,183
Good luck.

47
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,940
Jeez. How much did you drink?

48
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,193
What are you doing?

49
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,447
-You guys dating or something?
-You little punk.

50
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,449
-You're even more suspicious.
-Please!

51
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,076
Jeez. Don't drink so much.

52
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,203
-You drank so you wouldn't drive.
-Let's go.

53
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,080
-See you later.
-Goodbye.

54
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,845
-What do you want?
-Sorry?

55
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,433
I can keep an eye on Kwang-chul,
so go up and rest.

56
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,062
A crackdown of drug offenders began today,
and Yong-soo closed shop yesterday.

57
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,273
All the other guys are getting arrested.

58
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,942
-This happened last time too, right?
-It did, yeah.

59
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,777
There's someone on the inside.

60
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,554
Hyun-woo.

61
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,479
Hyun-woo.

62
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,814
Hyun-woo.

63
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,782
Mom?

64
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,331
I'm sorry, Hyun-woo.

65
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,376
-What for?
-For not going to pick you up today.

66
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,003
What about dinner?
Should I make you something?

67
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,588
I had ramyeon.

68
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,633
But Yeon-woo hasn't come home yet.

69
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,430
She's sleeping over at a friend's house.

70
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,229
Mom, you don't have to pick me up anymore.
You need some rest too.

71
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,064
Thanks.

72
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,110
You're the only one who cares about me.

73
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,299
-What about the guys?
-They'll be here soon.

74
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,345
-Did you say the money was in the garage?
-Yes, sir.

75
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,890
If Kkwang-chul's guys show up,
handle them.

76
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,934
-Kill them for all I care.
-Yes, sir.

77
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:15,893
Hey, hang on.

78
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,733
"0809."

79
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,902
That guy must be the delivery guy.

80
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,781
Thanks to Kkwang-chul, that guy's life
is about to be completely fucked up.

81
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,227
Good work. Leave the money there.

82
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,771
I'll be in touch again.

83
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,398
Take care of the goods.

84
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,942
Wait, what goods?

85
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,221
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,306
I didn't see your message in time.

87
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,351
I was a bit busy today.

88
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,687
What about Yeon-woo?

89
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,731
Is she in her room?

90
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,483
She ran away.

91
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,194
What?

92
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,285
You used Hyun-woo's medical funds
to become a professor?

93
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,830
Mi-yeon told me
that she heard from her husband.

94
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,710
Starting a business with Byeong-gu?

95
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,504
Textbooks?

96
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,507
Who would ever trust you with that?

97
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,219
You're a part-time lecturer
who can't even handle a proper job.

98
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,392
You lost all the money, didn't you?

99
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,518
No.

100
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,021
I'm getting it back.

101
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,274
I swear.

102
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,988
But the thing is…

103
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,948
Of course.

104
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,244
There's always something else
after you make a promise.

105
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,787
No, it's not that…

106
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,083
I'm getting it back in cash.

107
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,628
He said it's money
that he can't wire through a bank

108
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,714
because they're illegal funds
or something.

109
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,299
But, yeah, who cares?

110
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,968
What does it matter
if we get it in cash, right?

111
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,969
You think so?

112
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,394
Eun-ju, wait!

113
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,314
You'll put Byeong-gu
in a difficult position.

114
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,149
It's a bribe. He could lose his job.

115
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,986
I swear I'll get it back tomorrow.

116
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,990
I'm sorry, Eun-ju.

117
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,580
Can you stop fucking apologizing?

118
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,124
Why do we always
have to apologize to each other?

119
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,668
This really feels

120
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,670
like shit.

121
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,819
Things are going crazy over here
because of you.

122
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,696
So?

123
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,825
Where are you?

124
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,202
Backyard.

125
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,013
I thought you ran away.
What are you doing back there?

126
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,308
Because I have no money.

127
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,897
You can't do anything
without money in this world.

128
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,358
Just come inside.

129
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,652
Just go to sleep.

130
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,249
Keep warm.

131
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,755
Send me a text
when Mom and Dad fall asleep.

132
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,926
All right.
Let me know if you need anything.

133
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,220
Other than money.

134
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:27,955
Crap.

135
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,935
Just come inside. It's raining.

136
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,900
I don't want to see Mom's face.
Text me when she falls asleep.

137
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,537
Let me apologize for her instead.

138
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,289
I'm sorry.

139
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,294
What the heck. Why?

140
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,549
It's my fault that Mom
doesn't pay more attention to you.

141
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,218
She's busy taking care of me.

142
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,348
Shut it.

143
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,227
Text me when she falls asleep.

144
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,029
All right. Then at least go in the garage.

145
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,364
It's pouring outside.

146
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,021
Fuck…

147
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,067
I'm a bit busy right now.

148
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,738
I need to work if I want to live.

149
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,076
Thanks to your tip-off,
everything went without a hitch.

150
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,536
I'll return the favor soon.

151
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,247
I'll send you some guys
so you can rack up some points.

152
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,586
I'm here to get the money back
from the delivery mishap.

153
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:23,923
What?

154
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,799
How did you know?

155
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,220
Fuck. Are you serious?

156
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,431
Putting a tail on me like that
is cheating.

157
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,266
I thought we were on the same team.

158
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,977
What?

159
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,586
Shit, this is a serious fucking headache.

160
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,174
The cops have their eyes on this place.
They're watching Kkwang-chul.

161
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,342
What should we do?

162
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,220
Should we just grab the cash?

163
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,473
How are we going to do that?
They've got cameras all over this place.

164
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,060
Then, what should we do
about the guy we sent to Kwang-chul?

165
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,187
I don't know. Just leave him.

166
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,527
Fuck. The cash is
right there in front of us.

167
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,864
-Hey, let's pull out.
-Yes, sir.

168
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,741
Hey, turn the car around.

169
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,561
Isn't it cold in there?

170
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,213
-Where are you going?
-Huh?

171
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,631
What about you?

172
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,010
To get Yeon-woo.
I need to bring her back home.

173
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,471
Then you won't have to go that far.

174
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,326
Dad.

175
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,328
Mom went to find Yeon-woo.

176
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,705
What?

177
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,875
Yeon-woo's hiding in the garage,
but Mom went out to find her.

178
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,170
Can you make sure
that she doesn't get in too much trouble?

179
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,391
He said it's money
that he can't wire through a bank.

180
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,185
They're illegal funds or something.

181
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,520
But, yeah, who cares?

182
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,022
What does it matter
if we get it in cash, right?

183
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,232
Don't you think so?

184
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,412
She's not there.

185
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,249
What?

186
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:48,919
Yeon-woo.

187
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,671
What?

188
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,270
She's not there!

189
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,731
What?

190
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,025
No, it's just…

191
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,255
Jeez…

192
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,402
Where is Yeon-woo?

193
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,072
Oh. Well.

194
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,868
She was hiding because of your mom,
but I think she left again.

195
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,370
I'm going to go bring her back.

196
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,664
Go back inside, Hyun-woo. Okay?

197
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,792
I heard a motorcycle just now.

198
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,921
A motorcycle?

199
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,650
Go back inside.

200
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:07,891
Sir.

201
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,530
He's not picking up.

202
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,115
-Bring out the car.
-Yes, sir.

203
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,079
-Check if the money's there.
-Yes, sir.

204
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,798
Why isn't Kwang-chul leaving his place
when it's so nice out?

205
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,551
Gangsters go on picnics
and stuff too, you know.

206
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,470
What am I doing cooped up here like this?
I can't even go home.

207
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,805
This is suffocating.

208
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,099
If you can't sleep, then stand watch.

209
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,065
You can trust me.

210
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,320
What you said earlier
about someone being on the inside.

211
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,572
I thought about it,

212
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,700
and I think I'm a pretty trustworthy guy.

213
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,995
I mean, I have a good reputation

214
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,457
and I even have great credit,

215
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,876
even though I'm no good
at making any money.

216
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:20,005
So, if you have any secrets that you want
to talk about, don't hesitate--

217
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,381
Kwang-chul's leaving.

218
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,512
PARK DONG-HA PROFILE

219
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,518
Sir, we checked,
and the money disappeared from the garage.

220
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,478
All right.

221
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,526
I think the fucking professor
made a dash with the money.

222
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,493
I don't think he's going
for a midnight snack.

223
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,578
-Should we call for backup?
-Hey, calm down.

224
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,206
You're getting too close. Drive properly.

225
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,624
Sorry.

226
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,169
We just need to check
who they're meeting for now.

227
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,932
I'm on my way. Where are you? Not yet.

228
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:12,933
That black one?

229
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,810
This one's pretty. Look at it.

230
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,144
Hey, how's this one?

231
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,772
-You don't have to say it like that.
-Just leave.

232
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,650
Jeez, isn't that a bit harsh?

233
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,818
You're a dangerous one.

234
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,945
Have you seen this girl before?

235
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:25,987
-No, we haven't.
-No.

236
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,074
Excuse me,
have you seen this person, by any chance?

237
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,033
No, I haven't

238
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,855
The person you've called…

239
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,246
PROFESSOR PARK

240
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,281
Maybe they found out
he called the cops on them.

241
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,158
What if he gets beaten to death?

242
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:58,371
Is this a drive-in theater?
I feel bad just watching.

243
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,291
Professor.

244
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,793
Do you not understand the situation?

245
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,670
I told you not to mess with the money--

246
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,671
I'm…

247
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,673
I'm looking for it too.

248
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,802
I'm looking for my daughter right now.

249
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,231
-What am I supposed to do about it?
-What?

250
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,025
This is something
the cops are going to come down on us for.

251
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,902
It's my dad's money. We can spend it.

252
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:32,113
Is your dad a politician?
Or what, is he some kind of drug kingpin?

253
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,784
Don't be a pussy. Let's just flex it.

254
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,412
If it was one stack,
then I'd say go and flex it. But this…

255
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,041
I don't think I can touch it.

256
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,044
Just spend it.
You could even buy a new motorcycle.

257
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,921
I could buy a whole motorcycle company.

258
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,595
I guess they're done.

259
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,473
Oh, never mind.

260
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,059
Hey, get it together.
How can you be joking right now?

261
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,728
Hey, open the door.

262
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,897
Did you call someone?

263
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,109
I said open the door!

264
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,945
You guys are underage, aren't you?

265
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,156
Open the fucking door
or I'll just do it myself.

266
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,284
You little shits.

267
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,041
Jeez.

268
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,211
It's like you punks are trying
to screw me over or something.

269
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,839
You're always finding a way to sneak in.
Leave, man.

270
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,174
Leave before I call the cops!

271
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,759
I don't have any clothes on.

272
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,928
I need to put on my clothes first,
so get out!

273
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:37,846
Damn.

274
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,808
You youngsters are
still wet behind your ears.

275
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,204
Hey, what's up?

276
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,122
Hey.

277
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,583
Come over to the shop.

278
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,127
There are some strange kids here.

279
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,758
SANG-GU

280
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,011
It's me. I sent the picture.

281
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,054
Find her.

282
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,848
I'm sorry.

283
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,392
My daughter…

284
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,354
She usually isn't the type of kid…

285
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,650
-She got in a fight--
-Hey, Professor.

286
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,777
Go with them and search.

287
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,779
Not for your daughter, but for my money.

288
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,574
You'll die today if you don't find it.

289
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,426
It looks like this is all related
to Kwang-chul somehow, doesn't it?

290
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,970
Is he being threatened?

291
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,682
Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have.

292
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,851
If it's something serious,
shouldn't we help him out?

293
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,436
He's an ordinary guy.

294
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,855
If they wanted to kill him,
they already would have.

295
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,859
I wonder why they kept him alive.

296
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,659
Yuseong-dong, San, building number 12.

297
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,786
Bring me the money tomorrow.

298
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,874
This kind of cash is enough
for us to kill people.

299
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,043
I don't know where you got this,

300
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,963
but you shouldn't lay your hands
on money like this.

301
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,007
This kind of money can get you killed.

302
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,137
Hey, we need to kill them.

303
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,223
They know our faces. The last guests
in the other room just left.

304
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,308
Don't you think this will get out of hand?

305
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,395
Let's just take the money and leave.

306
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,021
We just need to drug them.

307
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,024
A lot of kids commit suicide these days,
and this is a motel.

308
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,152
Just take the money.

309
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,489
Can you please let us go, mister?
I beg you.

310
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,741
I beg you.

311
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,659
MU MOTEL

312
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,577
Yes.

313
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,830
I know some guys there
I used to be in prison with.

314
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,333
They asked around
and a few of the kids who ride motorcycles

315
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,211
know something about
the professor's daughter's boyfriend.

316
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,255
The punk said he was going to a motel.

317
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,843
There's only one motel in the area
that kids can sneak into.

318
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,909
MU MOTEL

319
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,584
MU MOTEL

320
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,410
Security cams are fake.

321
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,128
-Jackpot!
-That fucking bastard.

322
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,380
We hit the jackpot!

323
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,090
-Spare me.
-We don't have time!

324
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,393
Fuck.

325
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,645
Shit.

326
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,990
What…

327
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,244
Put all of it in the bag!

328
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,955
-This is unbelievable!
-My gosh!

329
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,458
Hey.

330
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,419
Who is that?

331
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,714
What the hell?

332
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,048
Who the hell are you?

333
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,967
Who are you?

334
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,468
Damn it.

335
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,393
Who are you?

336
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,769
Shit.

337
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,354
Close the door.

338
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,148
What is this?

339
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,109
Shit. Who the fuck are you supposed to be?

340
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,444
You little…

341
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,492
Hey! What are you doing?

342
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,497
Hey!

343
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,418
Fuck!

344
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,141
Hurry up.
Don't you want your finger reattached?

345
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,570
Your daughter
and the money are in that room.

346
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,531
Put it back where it belongs.

347
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,515
Dad.

348
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,066
Are you two okay?

349
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,485
Are you okay?

350
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,742
What was your name again?

351
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,371
-What?
-Name, what's your name?

352
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,039
Jae-chan.

353
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,459
Yeon-woo, I wasn't asking you.

354
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,919
It's Oh Jae-chan.

355
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,716
All right, Jae-chan.

356
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,223
Nothing happened here tonight.

357
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,391
Do you understand?

358
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,563
All right, then.

359
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,282
Dad.

360
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,368
Let's go home.

361
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,535
Yeon-woo.

362
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,831
Everything that happened tonight…

363
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,710
Let's keep it a secret from your mom.

364
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,300
Let's forget about everything
that happened tonight.

365
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,344
Forever.

366
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,930
Okay?

367
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,266
Okay.

368
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,197
Don't go to school if you don't want to.

369
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,867
You'll end up getting suspended
and expelled anyway.

370
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,287
I'm tired of transferring you
to different schools anyway.

371
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,706
Are you done nagging?

372
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,937
Let's just wait and see.

373
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,357
Kids her age go through phases.

374
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,943
Where did you find her?

375
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,487
At karaoke.

376
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,782
How did you know she was there?

377
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,452
I asked around here and there

378
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,289
and called some people.

379
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,627
If you're trying to lie or hide something,

380
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,422
try not to stutter.

381
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,144
Should we look at it again?

382
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,062
Leave it.

383
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,025
If I rack my brain and think about it,

384
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,779
the only story I can come up with is
that the professor's front door neighbor

385
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,949
saved the professor's daughter
from the bad guys.

386
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,912
How do Kwang-chul
and the professor know each other?

387
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,753
Let's switch in the morning.
Set up a camera at the professor's house.

388
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,213
Yes, ma'am.

389
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,923
Good night.

390
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,231
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT
PARK DONG-HA

391
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,857
FAMILY RELATION CERTIFICATE

392
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,190
Incheon Chinatown, 3:00 p.m.

393
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,697
Eat some.

394
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,240
I can't use my hands.

395
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,825
Fuck. Here.

396
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,870
-Asshole.
-It's good.

397
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,874
-Where did Kwang-chul go?
-He's not upstairs?

398
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,751
I saw him in his room earlier.

399
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,095
Send Professor Park to Incheon.

400
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,417
I was lying down for a second…

401
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,086
Find Kwang-chul. Find out where he went.

402
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,239
Didn't I tell you to bring the money?

403
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,866
Isn't it strange?

404
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,746
Why doesn't anyone
ever understand the lesson?

405
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,748
Are you all animals?

406
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,838
IN LOVING MEMORY OF NAM MUN-CHEOL
