1
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,697
They knew they were being watched.

2
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,490
They didn't come to the meetup spot!

3
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,660
They'd been planning this for a month
and then all of a sudden

4
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,038
someone is leaking internal information.

5
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:38,955
Who is it?

6
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,332
I don't know, but I have a bad feeling.

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,335
They started running
background checks on their underlings.

8
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,420
Why all of a sudden?

9
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:49,090
I have no fucking clue
who's leaking the information.

10
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,384
Just calm down. No one knows you're a cop.

11
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,511
Damn it. Whatever.

12
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,138
I need to get out of here.

13
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,058
They're delivering cash
to the head cartel soon.

14
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,476
-Just hang in there.
-Listen…

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,643
I…

16
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,313
I think they're going to kill me.

17
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,023
Just wait until the deal's done.

18
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,233
Fuck!

19
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,660
VIOLENT CRIMES SQUAD 1

20
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,781
SIR, THIS IS BIG HIT REALTY
WHEN CAN YOU MAKE THE PAYMENT?

21
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,331
Go.

22
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,542
Go and wait for us to contact you.

23
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,711
What about the money?

24
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,298
Just leave it there. It's safer that way.

25
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,176
Think about your family.

26
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,387
If you do anything stupid,
your family will suffer for it.

27
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,808
Forget everything that happened.

28
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,020
The money was all there.

29
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,856
You could tell that he also buried
something in his backyard.

30
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,940
What an idiot.

31
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,942
He buried the bodies in his own backyard?

32
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,029
Who said he was an innocent citizen?
And not a psychopath?

33
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,240
Wait, why did those bastards kill
each other while moving the cash?

34
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,992
They probably got greedy.

35
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,493
You think like a dumbass.

36
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,829
Should we send
whatever cash is left for now?

37
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,416
-Once the head cartel guys get here--
-How long have you worked for me?

38
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,253
It's been about five years.

39
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,259
I've worked with the boss for 15 years.

40
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,429
But…

41
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,646
even though I worked my ass off,

42
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,775
I don't have anything to show for it.

43
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,869
Some owners abandon their dogs
they raised for their whole lives.

44
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,164
I need to go my own way
before I get abandoned.

45
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,130
Are you with me?

46
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,091
What?

47
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,634
They recovered the cash.

48
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,929
Really? What about the delivery guys?

49
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,223
They're dead and buried.

50
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,227
Fucking idiots. Why the fuck
would they get themselves killed?

51
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,645
What happened exactly?

52
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,732
I don't know the details yet,

53
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,942
but Kwang-chul's trying to go his own way.

54
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,528
He's stabbing the boss in the back.

55
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,159
That fucking piece of trash.
He's got a death wish.

56
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,245
We should use this opportunity
to take them all out.

57
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,674
Wait. I need time to think about it.

58
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,968
Stay quiet for now.

59
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,886
Yes, sir.

60
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,638
Seriously!

61
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,894
Why? Scream all you want.

62
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,480
Why do you care
whether or not I put makeup on?

63
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,941
Everyone does it. It's not just me!

64
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,194
Why do you have to nag
and nitpick at every little last thing?

65
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,571
I just don't understand.

66
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,906
I don't either.

67
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,243
I don't understand
why you're getting so hysterical.

68
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,039
Look, you're always getting on Dad's case,
and you're always getting on my case.

69
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,500
Why don't you just go live with Hyun-woo?

70
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,960
You'll die without each other.

71
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,004
What a way
to talk about your sick brother.

72
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,466
-Is this really the best you can do?
-Then what about you, Mom?

73
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,219
Is making Dad miserable by demanding
a divorce the best you can do?

74
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,265
Or not caring about us and wanting
a divorce for your own happiness?

75
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,101
Fine. Just get divorced already.

76
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,771
I'm sick and tired
of watching you two fight all the time.

77
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,942
You're absolutely right.
Our family needs to split up to be happy.

78
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,946
-So hurry up and get divorced!
-Eun-ju.

79
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,786
-I am sick of this.
-You think I don't feel the same way?

80
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,998
Do I look happy to you?

81
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,542
Where are you? Come pick me up.

82
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,049
I dropped off some rice cakes
when I first moved in.

83
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,260
It looked like
a normal house on the inside.

84
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,554
Where was he growing the marijuana?

85
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,138
I mean, the house is so big.

86
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,848
He probably grew them all over.

87
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,017
But I heard they haven't found him yet.

88
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,019
Gosh, that's so scary.

89
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,021
We need to make sure our doors are locked.

90
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,455
Dad.

91
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,375
Do anything you can.

92
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,046
Our family is a mess right now.

93
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,430
I don't know what to do either.

94
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,850
You're fearless
because you're still young,

95
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,437
but we're old now,
so we need to play it safe.

96
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,232
There's no need to play it safe.
We're not doing anything illegal.

97
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,818
-Hey, because of that Han-cheol--
-Who's that?

98
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,573
We need to catch the head cartel.

99
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,451
That's where Kwang-chul is,
and their money too.

100
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,995
All we have to do is wait.
Why should we retreat?

101
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,627
Are you really after the head cartel?

102
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,882
If you can't trust me, I'll stop.

103
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,261
But do you think
you'll be able to stomach it?

104
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,222
What if I go somewhere else
and start talking?

105
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,394
Hurry up and get me the results.

106
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,814
Because the old man above me
plays it safer than I do.

107
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:54,320
What was that important piece of info
that Han-cheol was talking about?

108
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,283
I have no fucking clue
who's leaking the bloody information.

109
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,368
Who knows?

110
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,245
He disappeared
before I could hear him out.

111
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,524
You're driving me crazy.

112
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,527
What did the chief say?

113
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,076
He made a big fuss to get you pulled out,
so I had to go on the defensive.

114
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,703
But it didn't work.

115
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,913
Are you guys pulling out?

116
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,874
No, but he wants to see some results.

117
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,959
Good.

118
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,961
The old man is playing safe

119
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,213
because he doesn't want
his flaws to be exposed.

120
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,883
But then again, the chief's getting close
to retirement, so I understand.

121
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,637
He has big dreams, but he's as incapable
as the Chief Investigator.

122
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,180
Why even start all of this?

123
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,266
But you were against it too.

124
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,562
Yeah. I didn't want anyone to get hurt.

125
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,649
What's the point of seeing blood
just to catch those guys?

126
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,860
There'll be someone else
filling in those spots.

127
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,740
Things are hectic here too.

128
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,492
The Incheon Investigation Unit
cracked a big case,

129
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,161
so it's making all of us look bad.

130
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,830
How about you?
Are you making any progress?

131
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,752
We're just lurking. Sniffing around.

132
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,087
At least you're close enough
to catch a scent.

133
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,548
What we are doing here is insignificant,

134
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,717
compared to what you are doing out there.

135
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,636
Do well. And be careful out there.

136
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,224
I should get going.

137
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,686
Let's grab a meal together sometime.

138
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,648
Have it with your family.

139
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,527
Let go of me. Shit!

140
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,115
Fucking bastards!

141
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,577
After the recent declaration
of war on drug-related crimes,

142
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,789
the police took down
a large-scale cyber cartel today.

143
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,333
The police reports
they seized enough narcotics

144
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,752
to supply
up to 300,000 individual doses.

145
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,339
This cyber cartel ran its operation
using the internet and social networking…

146
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,924
We won't be dealing for a bit.

147
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,511
Everything needs to be stopped.
Damn it. Fuck the cops.

148
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,514
…to make it convenient
for their clients to get access to drugs.

149
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,518
As drug trafficking
has started to move online--

150
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,731
How did you know about the crackdown?

151
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,317
There's nobody to sell the goods
even if we open it up.

152
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,443
All of them got caught.

153
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,488
These motherfuckers have
no goddamn loyalty.

154
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,824
If one gets caught,
the rest fall like dominos.

155
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,741
What about us?

156
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,537
I made sure we wouldn't attract any heat,
but we should lie low.

157
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,044
What's Kwang-chul up to?

158
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,094
He found the money.

159
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,848
-And?
-I don't know what he's thinking.

160
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,059
Everything's so messed up as it is,
he might be looking for a way out.

161
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,897
You should call him and ask him
since he's like a brother to you.

162
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,865
Shut down the warehouse
for the time being.

163
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,033
And keep a close eye on the guys.

164
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,882
So who's the bastard who stole the money?

165
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,887
Well…

166
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,472
Yes.

167
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,351
Professor, I'll call you back later.

168
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,269
Yes.

169
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,063
All right.

170
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,026
Did you drink and get in a fight?

171
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,279
I'm sorry about what happened
with the professor thing,

172
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,448
but you need to get it together.

173
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,783
I'm keeping an eye out
to grab a spot for you.

174
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,286
I know a president
of a regional university,

175
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,121
and they're looking for a professor--

176
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,456
Save it.

177
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,418
But do me a favor.

178
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,377
No.

179
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,673
-If you get a call from Eun-ju--
-No, don't ask me for any favors.

180
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,594
Please tell her that we're trying to start
a business related to school textbooks.

181
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,930
That's all you have to say
if she happens to ask.

182
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:31,931
What textbooks?

183
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,557
Just tell her exactly that.

184
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,934
What's going on, man?

185
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,645
You enjoy being a professor
for the rest of your life, man.

186
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,063
Don't ask. Later.

187
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,565
PROFESSOR’S RESEARCH OFFICE

188
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,152
He doesn't even do any fucking research.

189
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,407
That punk.

190
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,703
I don't think I can afford it
if your rates go up.

191
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,166
Books on economics
don't bring in a lot of work for us.

192
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,878
Is there any other work you can give me?

193
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,632
I can work on magazines,
documents, or even essays.

194
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,594
Eun-ju, the truth is,
we have a lot of translators.

195
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,138
I was doing you a favor
because you insisted.

196
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,308
Are things really that hard
for you these days?

197
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,858
Never mind.
Let's just forget I ever said anything.

198
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,989
I'll just do what I'm doing now.

199
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,890
What? Am I embarrassing you?

200
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,935
No, it's just that…

201
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,729
There are a lot of people here.

202
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,733
People don't care about you
as much as you think. Don't worry.

203
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,448
This is a picture-perfect college campus.

204
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,367
It's nice.

205
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,203
I never got a proper education
so I envy this type of thing.

206
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,085
Why did you stop your car in front
of the police station this morning?

207
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,172
You were there for at least five minutes.

208
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,925
What? You want to turn yourself in?

209
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,893
Your wife walked
into a hotel 30 minutes ago.

210
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,855
Does she have a meeting,
or is she having an affair?

211
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,192
Don't get distracted.

212
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,236
One phone call, and your wife
will be crossing the Jordan River.

213
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:58,035
You never know when, where,
or who might have their eyes on you.

214
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,746
It's the best for doing this job.

215
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,248
"This job"?

216
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,169
You need to work to pay us back, dumbass.

217
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,922
Going to Busan today, right?
Make a stop on your way.

218
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,217
I didn't get another offer
to keep my gig in Busan, so I won't have--

219
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,719
There's always something,
isn't there, Professor?

220
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,346
Go and get some fresh air then.

221
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,933
TRAIN TICKET
SEOUL TO BUSAN

222
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,852
You'll get a text
around the time you arrive.

223
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,691
Do your best.
Your family's lives depend on it.

224
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,155
Oh…

225
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,908
The stuff is in the car.

226
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,660
It's expensive.

227
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,870
You're dead if you lose it.

228
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,518
You're right. That's a really good idea.

229
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,770
I mean, this time…

230
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,857
How's your husband doing?

231
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,237
Hello? How's your husband doing?

232
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,366
Yeah, he's doing well.

233
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,330
Eun-ju, Byeong-gu feels bad
about the situation too.

234
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,250
How was he supposed
to know that would happen?

235
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,334
What do you mean?

236
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,463
My husband tried to help Dong-ha
get appointed as a professor,

237
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,382
but things didn't go as planned.

238
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,842
He just wasted his money.

239
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,218
What do you mean by that?

240
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,054
He greased his palm.

241
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,724
He bribed him.

242
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,058
Well,

243
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,979
Byeong-gu is starting a business,
and he asked me to do it with him.

244
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,149
He just needed
to get his startup capital verified,

245
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,359
so I let him borrow it temporarily.

246
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,862
Byeong-gu should have
helped him out, jeez.

247
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,616
Hey! The reason he's even doing
part-time lectures is because of his help.

248
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,910
-What? That's how he got the job?
-Of course.

249
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,037
Byeong-gu's such a loyal friend.

250
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,455
Gosh, I was just saying…

251
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,249
Hello, I'm contacting you about Yeon-woo.

252
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,251
Do you have time to talk today?

253
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,169
Hold on.

254
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,839
Stop talking about Dong-ha.

255
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,634
They're not on good terms right now.

256
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,135
They're considering a divorce.

257
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,762
What a rough life.

258
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,474
She came out today
because she needed money.

259
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,391
Really?

260
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,936
Should I lend her some money?

261
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,563
You wouldn't be lending it.

262
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,941
-Struggling that much, huh?
-She's coming.

263
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,234
If I give her…

264
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,612
What? Is something wrong?

265
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,616
Life is so rough, I can't even afford
to sit and rest for a second.

266
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,624
Hey, Mi-yeon.

267
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,961
Is it my fault
that Byeong-gu liked me in college?

268
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,296
You've talked
behind my back for over ten years.

269
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,673
Are you still not over it?

270
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,384
You live with him now.

271
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,552
I wasn't even interested
in Byeong-gu one bit.

272
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:06,515
Think about it. When you two were busy
hanging out at the café across the campus,

273
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,894
I was always studying in the library.

274
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,647
But how could the world be so unfair?

275
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,152
There wasn't a single moment
in my life that I didn't work hard.

276
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,822
Why is my life like this?

277
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,036
Mi-yeon.

278
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,248
Watch your mouth before you get slapped.

279
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,801
The person you're trying to reach--

280
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,681
Where are you right now?

281
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,443
This seems to be a common occurrence.

282
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,194
Call me.

283
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,113
I've been called to the school.

284
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,074
Where are you? Call me now,
while I'm still asking you nicely.

285
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:10,162
-Do you want to see me go insane?
-Are you listening to what I'm saying?

286
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,623
No, not at all.

287
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,292
Pardon?

288
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,210
Our youngest is doing just fine.

289
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,922
She uses her brother as an excuse
to leave early or skip school often.

290
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,674
When she had an unexcused absence,

291
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,885
I was worried
something had happened to him.

292
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:29,056
Then she's been lying to you
for skipping class and leaving early?

293
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,183
She had so many absences
and early dismissals.

294
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,142
Mrs. Kang,

295
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,978
she was involved
in a school fight last year, right?

296
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,147
We were lenient on her then.

297
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,318
-How can you…
-I'm busy today, so Dad will pick you up.

298
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,694
I'll see you at home.

299
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,405
I apologize.

300
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,368
Is her father aware of this situation?

301
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,586
Her dad is rather busy.

302
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,839
Is there anything more urgent
than a situation concerning his child?

303
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,884
One bad apple can spoil the bunch.

304
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,720
In all honesty, Yeon-woo is
one of our problematic kids.

305
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,934
I can't get in touch with her.

306
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,812
Do you think you can ask her friends
where she might be?

307
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,397
Well…

308
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,565
-Wouldn't Ha-eun have an idea?
-No!

309
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,026
Leave Ha-eun alone.

310
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,278
She was the victim of the altercation.

311
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,949
It seems that you know
almost nothing about Yeon-woo.

312
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:33,286
Ma'am, you don't seem to have
any understanding of what the problem is.

313
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,248
I'm sorry for doing
a poor job of raising my child.

314
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,166
But sir,

315
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,212
about that incident last year,
was Yeon-woo really the perpetrator?

316
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,384
Are you sure you're not just ignoring
the fact that she's been bullied?

317
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,096
Yeon-woo was hurt badly
and was hospitalized for a while.

318
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,100
Above all, the psychological damage
she sustained is unspeakable.

319
00:23:55,183 --> 00:24:00,355
Do you know what your children are doing
and thinking at all times?

320
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,775
Is it possible for any parent
to fully understand their child?

321
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,610
We all have to make an effort.

322
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,778
I did.

323
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,990
From the moment she was born,
to this very day,

324
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,075
I tried everything I could, maybe more.

325
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,704
What Yeon-woo is trying to do,
what she's thinking about,

326
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,583
or why she's so angry
at me all the time, I have no idea.

327
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,297
I'm sorry that I'm a bad parent.

328
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:32,429
Hey, isn't this crazy pretty?
It's pretty, but it's so expensive.

329
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,557
I've been saving up money for a while.

330
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,476
It's still not enough.

331
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,102
How much more do you need?

332
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,439
How have you been, Ha-eun?

333
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,607
Who are you?

334
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,735
I'm Yeon-woo's mom. We met
at last year's school violence committee.

335
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,944
Damn it.

336
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,280
I can't get a hold of Yeon-woo.

337
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,658
-Do you know where she is?
-Why would I care about that?

338
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,244
You probably know. Think carefully.

339
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,287
I said I don't know.

340
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,874
Sometimes enemies know
each other better than friends do.

341
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:01,958
You probably know.

342
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,168
Do I look like I care?

343
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,214
Your nose looks great.

344
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,633
Your new nose is a lot prettier.

345
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,718
You did that with my money.

346
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,720
I'm glad it turned out pretty.

347
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,139
What are you even talking about?
You're so annoying.

348
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,892
Ha-eun, how much more do you need?

349
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,519
I'll pay for another one.

350
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,140
Think about your family.

351
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,519
If you do anything stupid,
your family will suffer for it.

352
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,864
All right.

353
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,908
I'll head back now.

354
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,165
The train has departed.

355
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,043
Send him the address
when he arrives in Busan.

356
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,003
Yes, sir.

357
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,132
Let's go.

358
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,383
Will you be okay?

359
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,719
Is there a problem?

360
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,347
I'm just worried
because you turned your back on them.

361
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,892
How would they know if I turned or not?

362
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,311
You're right.

363
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,230
I need to get something from them anyway.

364
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,066
And I want to check something.

365
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,569
Let's go.

366
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,089
You're here, Kwang-chul?

367
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,258
Did you find the money?

368
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,552
Goddamn.

369
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,721
He's got a mean look in his eye.

370
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,274
You're here.

371
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,528
-Where's the money?
-We're still looking.

372
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,239
You're still looking?

373
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,619
Do you have a lot on your mind lately?

374
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,204
I'm not following.

375
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,456
Things get slow
when there's a lot on your mind.

376
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,544
One of the weed dealers was hiding there.

377
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,004
So he's not there anymore?

378
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,465
Did you kill him?

379
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,385
No one's going to find him.

380
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,222
Is he solving problems right now?

381
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,057
Or is he making them?

382
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,645
Did that punk have the money?

383
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,148
He died before we could find out.

384
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,152
I'm sure that
the money disappeared in that area.

385
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,864
We'll just have to wait.
Someone will eventually show up.

386
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,199
We don't have much time.

387
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,996
I'll go meet with the head cartel.

388
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,627
-What are you going to do?
-I'll buy us some time.

389
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,004
Nothing matters
if we don't make it out alive.

390
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,239
Today might end up being our last time.

391
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,839
Fuck, why would you give that to him?

392
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,633
We need to check
if he's really trying to go his own way.

393
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,012
The bastard's definitely changed.
He used to only do what I told him to.

394
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,180
I told you, didn't I?

395
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,183
He is a dog that bites his owner's hand.

396
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,561
-Did he really find the money?
-I swear on my dead mother.

397
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,900
Bring it to me. Without the money,
there's no deal with the head cartel.

398
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,110
Then we won't even need
to handle the bastard.

399
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,163
-Oh, sir.
-What are you in such a hurry for?

400
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,956
It's nothing. I'm sorry, sir.

401
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,336
He should be arriving in Busan soon,
so text him the address.

402
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,253
Yes, sir.

403
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,259
-You call Mr. Ma.
-Yes, sir.

404
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:08,389
Were you able to check
on that thing you were talking about?

405
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,475
I'm still working on it.

406
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,353
The professor is being
put through the mill

407
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,438
while his wife's chatting it up
in a hotel.

408
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,774
Right? She's living the life.

409
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:22,445
I'm not sure who he is, but there's
this guy who rides a motorcycle.

410
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,280
I heard he stole it from somewhere.

411
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,909
I heard he doesn't go to school.
And he doesn't go home either.

412
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,452
He's just always on his bike.

413
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,462
I was just at Yeon-woo's school.

414
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,632
She ditched school,
so I'm out looking for her now.

415
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,052
She might need to transfer schools again
after only a year.

416
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,930
Since there's no class
in the suburbs today, pick up Hyun-woo.

417
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,807
-Was it you?
-You said you'd buy it.

418
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,560
Have you seen
a group of kids with a motorcycle?

419
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,562
Those guys were over at the arcade.

420
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,786
Fuck!

421
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,289
Let me ask you something.

422
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,166
-Let's go.
-Slowly guys, everyone get in the back.

423
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,379
I'm busy today, so Dad will pick you up.

424
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,298
Sorry, see you at home.

425
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,148
Yo! Someone's coming this way.

426
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,068
Shit.

427
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,737
What is it?

428
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,655
It's my mom.

429
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,408
Then just go home.

430
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,286
She'll kill me. She's hysterical.

431
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:57,248
We're too broke to do anything anyway.
And there's no place for you to crash.

432
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,375
Just go and start the engine.

433
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:04,881
Park Yeon-woo.

434
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,717
Let's go.

435
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,510
I'm not going.

436
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,012
-Damn.
-Let's talk at home.

437
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,555
I said, I'm not going.

438
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,432
Out here is better than that shithole.

439
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,851
-Then let's go talk in the car.
-No.

440
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,394
Park Yeon-woo.

441
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,480
Listen to me.

442
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,399
-Her mom looks classy in that dress.
-Elegant, bro.

443
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,317
Yeah.

444
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,737
I'm sorry for what I did this morning.

445
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,324
I won't ever lay a hand on you again.

446
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,951
I promise.

447
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,583
Try to understand me.

448
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,461
Don't just ask me to understand you.
Try to understand me.

449
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,879
All day I was…

450
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,595
miserable.

451
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,850
-So let's…
-Let go of me.

452
00:32:58,935 --> 00:32:59,769
Yeon-woo!

453
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,562
-Let's go.
-Let's get out of here!

454
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,563
Let's go, guys.

455
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,490
Wait.

456
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,132
DONG-HA
PLEASE PICK UP HYUN-WOO

457
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:43,521
BUSAN STATION

458
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,444
Are you here for the delivery?

459
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,953
Follow me from ten meters away.

460
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,062
Wait.

461
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,880
Excuse me. Can you walk a bit slowly?

462
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,704
Wait…

463
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,874
Wait!

464
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,940
-Hey.
-Yes?

465
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,817
Yes, sir.

466
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,612
Are you sure you're the guy Yong-soo sent?

467
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,615
Sorry, I couldn't hear you too well.

468
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,034
Don't you even know your boss's name?

469
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,620
Yong-soo's gotten a lot more cautious.

470
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,875
He didn't even let
his delivery guy know who he was.

471
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,585
But then again,

472
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,964
with all the mess the pigs are making
these days, I don't blame him.

473
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,766
I see.

474
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,605
He says it looks good this time.

475
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,359
The last batch you guys sent over
was a little lighter than usual.

476
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,236
Did you add water?

477
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,282
If you fuckers keep on playing games
with the shipments,

478
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,784
I'm not going
to keep on doing business with you.

479
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,661
-You got that?
-Yes, sir.

480
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,042
But what's this?

481
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,299
"Ka…"

482
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,803
"Metamorphosis"?

483
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,889
Is this some kind of a prop?

484
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,099
His ID says
he's some kind of college professor.

485
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,226
"A professor"?

486
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,188
A professor? For real?

487
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,523
Well, dang, man.

488
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,734
I've only met people like you as clients.

489
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,195
I never thought I'd see one
in my line of business.

490
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,700
But why did you only bring one?

491
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,912
It used to be one per box,
so five in total.

492
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,665
Oh, I was just…

493
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,458
They only gave me one.

494
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:36,128
These fucking guys. What am I supposed
to do with just one bottle?

495
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,924
I'm the largest distributor in Busan,
and this isn't enough.

496
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,303
You guys aren't the only ones
going through lean times, you understand?

497
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,807
Look at the look on this guy's face.

498
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,477
I don't think he has any clue
what I'm talking about.

499
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,106
Jeez.

500
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:56,899
Hey!

501
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,861
We need to recruit a guy like this.

502
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,699
We could use a guy with that kind
of innocent look to his face.

503
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,034
Hey, listen to me very carefully.

504
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,997
Make sure to bring
at least three bottles next time.

505
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,915
Go tell Yong-soo.

506
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,375
If I don't get what I want,

507
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,753
I'll find a new supplier.

508
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,506
Understand?

509
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,802
Let's go.

510
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,215
Busan Station at eight. KTX, Seoul bound.

511
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,982
Mom, I came home.

512
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,650
See you at home.

513
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,865
I'LL BE HOME SOON

514
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:33,551
IN LOVING MEMORY OF NAM MUN-CHEOL
