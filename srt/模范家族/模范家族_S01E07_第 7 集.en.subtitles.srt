1
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,670
Grab him.

2
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,770
MAGNESIA POWDER (LIME)

3
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,197
I don't know either.
This is how they do it, though.

4
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,783
It makes them decompose faster,
or something.

5
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,368
Dump it on him.

6
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,587
Is it your first time killing a man?

7
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,133
It's my first time too.

8
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,886
I only did it because they told me to.

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,764
But fuck, it feels like shit.

10
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,850
We used to break bread together,

11
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,436
and now I'm burying him. Fucking hell.

12
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,609
How is it that there's
no one you can fucking trust?

13
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,320
Hey.

14
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,200
If someone orders you to bury me,

15
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,285
are you going to tell me?

16
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,582
Let's tell each other,
even if we bury one another.

17
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,919
We should at least know
why we're fucking dying.

18
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,717
You're an orphan, right?

19
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,303
Let's trust each other

20
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,722
for the rest of our lives.

21
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,271
For the first time in your life,
you have a family now.

22
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,670
Take a seat.

23
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,547
What do you mean, take a seat?

24
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,135
Hey, motherfucker. Are you here
to show us your knife skills, or what?

25
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,137
I fucking dare you to hit me.

26
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,098
You're only alive because
of the head cartel, you fucking idiot.

27
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,312
I thought I'd never see you again.

28
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,855
We promised

29
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,274
to give each other the heads-up.

30
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,360
You should at least know why.

31
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,030
What the fuck are
you talking about right now?

32
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:17,947
Hey.

33
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,536
So, you're here to bury me?

34
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,288
One of us is going to die.

35
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,250
This is why you should've
abandoned that punk, not me.

36
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,002
Then we wouldn't be in this mess.

37
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,921
Let's go, motherfucker.

38
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,277
So we know the reason why we're dying,

39
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,530
but we don't know
who it's going to be yet, do we?

40
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,824
I can't exactly die for you now, can I?

41
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,202
Hey, it wouldn't be right for me to kill

42
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,996
a member of my family
just so I could raise a dog, would it?

43
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,697
What are you doing?

44
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,284
You should know enough
to offer your elders a cup of cold water.

45
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,788
The younger one is
a lot quicker than the older one.

46
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,749
How old are you?

47
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,917
I'm in 9th grade.

48
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,086
Come on. I asked for your age.

49
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,673
How am I supposed to know
if you had to repeat a grade or not?

50
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,926
-Do you guys have any alcohol?
-No.

51
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,262
There's no alcohol in the house?

52
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,474
Does your dad not drink?

53
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,642
Well,

54
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,063
he did take after his mother,

55
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,231
he was rather soft.

56
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,193
Where's your mom?

57
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,196
She hasn't come home yet,
but she should be here soon.

58
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,572
All right, then.

59
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,033
Excuse me, sir.

60
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,579
How are you going to prove
you're really our grandfather?

61
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,622
"Prove"?

62
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,667
Why do I have to do anything like that?

63
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,420
We heard that
he passed away when our dad was young.

64
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,005
Gosh.

65
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,635
All right, then. How did he die?

66
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,388
He said you passed away from an illness.

67
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,931
That's bullshit.

68
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,227
No one in our family has ever died
because of an illness.

69
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,605
Everyone died in the war
or because of accidents.

70
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,441
Even your grandmother passed away
from a car accident.

71
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,319
As long as we're careful,
we're blessed with long lives

72
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,737
in this family.

73
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,323
That doesn't prove anything.

74
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,034
Jeez, you little…

75
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,039
Our glabella look similar.

76
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,042
That's the area between our eyebrows.

77
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,338
It means we're all quick-witted.

78
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
Are you happy now?

79
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,842
Got it?

80
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,222
What kind of house has no alcohol?

81
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,140
Hyun-woo.

82
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,559
What's a dog doing in our…

83
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,477
Mom.

84
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,481
Who are you?

85
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,692
Are you their mother?

86
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,235
Who are you?

87
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,904
I'm your father-in-law.

88
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,365
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-What?

89
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,054
Yes, Hyun-woo.

90
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,306
What?

91
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,481
You're here.

92
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,650
Try and be home earlier, would you?

93
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,904
How did you get here?

94
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,697
How did you know?

95
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,536
What do you think you're doing here?

96
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,829
You punk…

97
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,042
It's been a while. What's with
the attitude in your language?

98
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,127
Leave, right now.

99
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,589
Get out of my house, right now.

100
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,718
Hey, you're making
an ugly scene in front of the kids.

101
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,389
Come here. Sit down.

102
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,017
It's the first time
the whole family is getting together,

103
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,227
so let's be happy.

104
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,728
What fucking family?

105
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,438
Get out!

106
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,441
Get out!

107
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,194
-Get out!
-Hey…

108
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,153
Get out!

109
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,947
Get out.

110
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,659
-Dad.
-Jeez, man.

111
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,077
Bring it on.

112
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,079
I know you're tenacious.

113
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,624
-Come on.
-You!

114
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,127
You punk!

115
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,005
Come on!

116
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,298
You punk!

117
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,382
Give me a cigarette.

118
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,428
Hey.

119
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,347
We need to talk business,

120
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,099
so stop whimpering

121
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,892
and go make us some coffee.

122
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,479
By that look in your eye,

123
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,523
you get your ass kicked a lot, don't you?

124
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,029
What did you just say?

125
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,032
Hey, brother.

126
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,576
Go make me a cup of coffee.

127
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,458
If you keep that up,

128
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,169
you might really lose
one of those eyes, man.

129
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,796
Hey.

130
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,574
No wonder my fortune for the day was shit.

131
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,957
I look pathetic.

132
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,126
Let's get you to the hospital.

133
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,894
That fucking bum

134
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,855
is taking advantage
of his head cartel clout.

135
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,483
Good.

136
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,944
The pot's gotten a lot bigger.

137
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,781
Now that things have turned out this way,

138
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,158
we can wipe
the lot of them out in one swoop.

139
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:50,042
The pig must be drooling already.

140
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,016
So, you don't want to press charges?

141
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,521
I don't.

142
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,441
All right, then.

143
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,863
Yeon-woo.

144
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,074
The cops can't get involved.

145
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,701
He's right about that.

146
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,163
Our family and law enforcement
do not get along.

147
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,969
It was self-defense.

148
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,264
Goodness. What a waste.

149
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,748
You told me your father passed away
when we first met.

150
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,833
Is your mother also alive?

151
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,379
Why did you hide it from me?

152
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,632
Why does everything
you do turn out like this?

153
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,842
Why do you always make everything worse?

154
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,972
I did it because I could get along
just fine without him.

155
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,605
He would always come home every few years

156
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,359
and then bad things would happen.

157
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,614
He probably stole all the money
from our accounts

158
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,368
because Mom started to work double time.

159
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,955
I was suffering constantly.

160
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,459
I don't know how he knew,
but he always found us, even if we moved.

161
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,421
My mom died from an accident…

162
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,426
and he showed up again
to collect on the life insurance.

163
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,513
So, that's why I cut ties with him.

164
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,100
I was about to get married to you

165
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,936
and I was going to have a family soon.

166
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,438
So I thought…

167
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,152
I shouldn't be involved with him anymore.

168
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,949
I'll kick him out, so don't worry.

169
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,836
PROFESSOR PARK

170
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,216
Hello?

171
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,137
It's nothing.

172
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,058
All right.

173
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,733
I gave it some thought…

174
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,528
and I think I can understand

175
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,031
why you met someone else.

176
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,118
I think I can try to understand.

177
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,539
I should have done better.

178
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,959
It's my fault.

179
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,337
But that's in the past,

180
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,172
so from now on,

181
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,425
we can be different.

182
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,180
Why do you…

183
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,477
want a divorce?

184
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,690
Is it because of him?

185
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,443
No.

186
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,365
That has nothing to do with our problem.

187
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,534
That's not why I want a divorce,
so don't misunderstand.

188
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,702
Then

189
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,664
what's the real reason?

190
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,092
Because I think I can live without you.

191
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,268
That man…

192
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,024
can't do anything for you.

193
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,489
I'll protect you, and our family.

194
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,256
Dad.

195
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,970
Can we take care of that dog?

196
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,930
What dog?

197
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,896
Hey! Go!

198
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,484
-Goodness.
-Go away! Go! Shoo!

199
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,363
Gosh, you scared me.

200
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,158
He's been digging for a while.

201
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,410
Maybe he buried a bone or something.

202
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:20,164
No matter how much you chase him away,
he'll come back and dig.

203
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,750
Dogs are persistent, you know?

204
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,841
Why did you come?

205
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,217
To see my grandchildren.

206
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,596
Please leave.

207
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,891
Is something going on with you these days?

208
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,309
Why does it matter to you?

209
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,852
Just leave.

210
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,566
-Go back to living your life.
-I have no place to go, okay?

211
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,818
I have absolutely nothing.

212
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,488
There's even less for you
to mooch off of in my house.

213
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,240
Please just leave.

214
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,664
What would I take anything from someone
who lives out in the country, like this?

215
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,832
Good, then.

216
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,921
You've always been persistent
when you wanted something from someone.

217
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,549
Gosh.

218
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:22,059
It's not like I can cuss you out
and call you a son of a bitch.

219
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,185
Go for it.

220
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,896
Because

221
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,190
I am a son of a bitch.

222
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,366
Jeez.

223
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,244
My goodness.

224
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,248
Gosh.

225
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,628
At first, I thought about why
these two were moving around together

226
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,922
and what their relationship was.

227
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,800
Then something came to mind.

228
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,679
Instead of wondering why the professor
moves around with Kwang-chul,

229
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,056
I asked myself
why the delivery car ended up here.

230
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,685
At first, I thought it had something to do

231
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,728
with the marijuana grower.

232
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,481
But I realized
it may be because of the professor.

233
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,732
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT

234
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,734
Who is this professor?

235
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,238
And how much does he know?

236
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,876
I wasn't sure
if this had anything to do with our case.

237
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,461
But what I know for sure

238
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,716
is that the professor
is also looking for something.

239
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,682
-Here you go.
-Great.

240
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,393
-See you later.
-Bye.

241
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,151
Excuse me.

242
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,571
May I ask the reason
for that professor's visit?

243
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,618
The couple went
to the same university as Han-cheol.

244
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,829
But if he already knew Han-cheol,
he wouldn't have looked him up.

245
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,289
He learned about him recently.

246
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,125
His relationship with Kwang-chul
may not be that simple.

247
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,089
Joo-hyun, I found Park Deuk-soo.

248
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,467
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT
PARK DEUK-SOO

249
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,260
Start acting like an adult.

250
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,721
I'm still pretty immature.

251
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,602
Your family is in great danger right now.

252
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,480
They got involved with some scary people.

253
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,359
If we just leave them,
they might vanish without a trace.

254
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:39,404
Your son, daughter-in-law,
and your grandchildren. All of them.

255
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,657
How scary are these guys?

256
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,991
They're a drug ring.

257
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,203
Your entire family will get destroyed.

258
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,206
You need to save them.

259
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,292
What can I do?

260
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,712
I'm having him look into their phones
for recent calls, texts, photos,

261
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,632
and anything that may have to do
with the delivery accident.

262
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,594
So you're saying the delivery mess-up
is related to the professor's family?

263
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,304
We'll have to wait and see.

264
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,558
This family is now a prime suspect
of the delivery accident.

265
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,941
We have no information on the new guy.
We need to do some digging.

266
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,652
Yong-soo and Kwang-chul
have completely parted ways.

267
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,488
But they'll all end up where the money is.

268
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,865
That money is here right now,

269
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,368
and that's why
Kwang-chul is waiting around.

270
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,830
And our hunting dog
is working his ass off.

271
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,189
Jeez.

272
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,119
How could there be no alcohol?

273
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,059
Why are you so surprised?

274
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,772
By the way, are you always this sensitive?

275
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,400
My goodness.

276
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,062
What is this?

277
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,319
KANG EUN-JU

278
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,242
What have you done for our family?
You don't deserve to say things like that.

279
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,120
Tell me what you've done for our family!

280
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,001
Am I not family to you?

281
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,420
You're not. Not anymore.

282
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,230
Doesn't anyone wait for their elders
before digging in for a meal?

283
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,985
I called you earlier. But I think
you were washing up and couldn't hear me.

284
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,196
The little one is putting in some effort.

285
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,782
It seems there's still
some hope left for this family.

286
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,659
Your grandfather's leaving today.

287
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,202
Are you?

288
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,955
Well, apparently so.

289
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,999
There are too many weird things
about our family.

290
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,125
I'm off to school.

291
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,715
Eun-ju.

292
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,968
Can you take Hyun-woo to school?

293
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,889
Let's go, Hyun-woo.

294
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,685
-See you later.
-Bye.

295
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,602
All right.

296
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,496
Don't ever come back.

297
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,583
Let me just stay for one week.

298
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,668
I need to find a place to stay.

299
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,588
After that, I won't stay,
even if you ask me to.

300
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,508
This will probably be the last time
I see my grandchildren before I die.

301
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,760
Am I asking for too much?

302
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,641
I want it to seem
like you're not even here.

303
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,562
Don't just show up,
pretending to be a part of this family.

304
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,985
See you later.

305
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,862
I'll look after the house.

306
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,836
Busan.

307
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,255
Tomorrow night. Bring the money.

308
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,302
-Jung-bae.
-Yes, sir.

309
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,470
Let's move the money.

310
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,931
We can't afford another accident,
but it will indeed happen.

311
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,060
Yong-soo called Mr. Kim for a reason.

312
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,979
-Be prepared.
-Yes, sir.

313
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,365
I know for sure
I won't decompose after I die.

314
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,617
Eat as much as you want.
I'll have you cremated.

315
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,537
-Have mine too.
-What--

316
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,873
-I can't even look at that right now.
-Gosh.

317
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,050
By the way,

318
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,136
were you close with the undercover agent?

319
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,349
Why?

320
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,226
Just because

321
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,978
you seemed to be fond
of him as a colleague.

322
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,153
If you weren't going to eat,
you shouldn't have poured the water.

323
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,155
Just the smell makes me want to puke.

324
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,700

327
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,708
Interesting kid.

ENTER PASSCODE

329
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,790
Damn it.

330
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,305
-What are you doing here?
-Huh?

331
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,640
That might be a problem.

332
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:34,105
Do you see the water
in that ceiling corner right there?

333
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,987
You don't see anything right now, do you?

334
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:45,909
It may look fine right now,
but it will end up being a problem.

335
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,161
You have a water leak.

336
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,204
"A water leak"?

337
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,623
The kids' rooms have the same problem.

338
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,375
If you just leave it,
it will cost you a lot later.

339
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,877
You can't just leave it.

340
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,589
Did Hyun-woo get to school safely?

341
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,023
What's wrong with you now?

342
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,112
-You make me lose my appetite.
-Byeong-gu.

343
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,574
Do you know who Yoo Han-cheol is?

344
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,493
Who? "Yoo Han-cheol"?

345
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,953
Who's that?

346
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:35,166
I heard he used to go out
with Eun-ju in college.

347
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,127
Come on, man. Do you know
how many guys tried to hit on Eun-ju?

348
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,046
You may have been the last one,

349
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,715
but that doesn't mean
you were the only one.

350
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,511
I'm not even the last.

351
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,720
What?

352
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,267
-Is she cheating on you?
-No.

353
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,518
It's nothing.

354
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,772
Do you know him or not?

355
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,319
Just eat.

356
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,148
There's something important
coming up tomorrow. Clear your schedule.

357
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,095
They're making the professor
move the money soon.

358
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,639
We should get ready too.

359
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,560
He's only reporting to me now.
Just letting you know.

360
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,650
After a near-death experience,
I realized I needed good insurance.

361
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,219
Do you need anything?

362
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,303
Yes, I do.

363
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,015
My phone is acting weird.
I don't think I took proper care of it.

364
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,266
It won't work.

365
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,353
Can I borrow your phone?

366
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,522
Sure, go ahead.

367
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,528
What's your passcode?

368
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,410
Thanks.

369
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,662
I'll make the call in my room.

370
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,206
I need some privacy too.

371
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,257
Goodness! Sun-ok!

372
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,884
This is Park Deuk-soo!

373
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,428
Yes!

374
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,682
Goodness. What is this punk saying?

375
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,934
Gosh, I'm not busy.

376
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:44,272
-Is this another one of your scams?
-I'm only a little busy.

377
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,898
-Why would you be busy--
-Yes!

378
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,192
That's enough. Let's have some soju.

379
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,986
Oh, I agree.

380
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,534
I don't have time
to drink with you, you punk.

381
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,703
-What's going on?
-I don't know, you punk.

382
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,165
Just don't hang up.
Stay on the line with me.

383
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,168
-Why?
-I'll fill you in later.

384
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,379
-What?
-My goodness, Sun-ok.

385
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,882
You've gotten even funnier.

386
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,054
You punk. Did you find yourself
another rich lady? You crook.

387
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,391
If everything goes well,
you better treat me to some drinks.

388
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,435
You haven't changed a bit.

389
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:25,980
Lucky you.

390
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,733
Yes, it was nice talking to you.

391
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,277
Yes. Take care.

392
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,862
All right.

393
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,158
Thank you.

394
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,538
You should eat something.

395
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,083
It's okay.

396
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,793
I'm not hungry right now.

397
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,468
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT
PARK DONG-HA - KANG EUN-JU

398
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,392
Who are these guys?

399
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,645
They might be involved
in the delivery incident.

400
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,938
We're still investigating.

401
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,899
What do you mean?
They're just normal people.

402
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,444
We'll be able to get a lead soon.
I'll submit another report then.

403
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,365
Okay, so what lead?

404
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,870
What is it?
You can't keep it a secret from us too.

405
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,830
Hey!

406
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,415
I thought we were on the same team.

407
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,043
Is there something we don't know about?

408
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,169
Joo-hyun.

409
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,588
Hey!

410
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,631
Let's just stop.

411
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,634
Dissolve the team,
and have them report back to their units.

412
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,720
We have a mole
that's connected to the drug ring.

413
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,763
What?

414
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,893
We weren't the only ones
who had an undercover agent.

415
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,896
The head cartel member
that we're looking for could be a cop too.

416
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,189
Is this true?

417
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,234
Yes, that's how our agent was killed.

418
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,114
And it looks like that's what caused
the mishap with the delivery.

419
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,701
Okay, so what kind
of progress have you made?

420
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,120
We're just getting started.

421
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,914
We'll start getting some leads soon.

422
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,189
Your family got tangled up
with a drug ring.

423
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,942
Go in the house and do a little digging.
Anything will help.

424
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,571
We need to know what's going on
in order for us to help them.

425
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,828
Jeez. That freaking dog.

426
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,831
Hey! Scram!

427
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,291
Shoo!

428
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:15,691
Hello?

429
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,028
Dong-ha, you punk.
Where are you right now?

430
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,988
-What?
-This…

431
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,493
What is this in your backyard?
Is it a dead body?

432
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,996
Did you kill someone?

433
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,706
Answer me.

434
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,625
Is that what's going on?

435
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,878
Dong-ha, you punk.
Where are you right now?

436
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:53,182
IN LOVING MEMORY OF NAM MUN-CHEOL
