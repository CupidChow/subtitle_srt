=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,256
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,944
(So, How Are You Going to Kill Me)

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,720
I suspect Consort Chun

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,720
wanted to steal that child too.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,480
That's why Wan'er died there!

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,040
Please investigate it

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,440
and clear Wan'er's name.

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,840
How dare you two

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,760
collude to set me up!

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,352
Outrageous!

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,880
One is the head of the imperial harem.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,080
My favored consort.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,200
The other leads the Imperial Hospital.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,400
My trusted official.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,440
Yet you two

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,800
conspired against me

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,240
and lied about

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,280
my royal heir.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,720
Your crime

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,720
is unforgivable.

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,600
Your Majesty.

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,200
I merely desired a child of yours.

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,520
Heaven and Earth
know my devotion to you.

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,320
I merely made a mistake.

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,920
Your Majesty.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Consort Chun.

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,520
You've disappointed me deeply.

29
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,440
Your Majesty.

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,200
Hear my decree.

31
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Chief Physician Zhang

32
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
neglected duty

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
and deceived me.

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,400
His entire clan

35
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,760
shall be exterminated.

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,720
Consort Chun

37
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,080
is stripped

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,000
of her title

39
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,640
and confined forever.

40
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,760
Effective immediately.

41
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,280
Your Majesty.

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
How can you be so heartless?

43
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,480
I only wanted a child of yours.

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,560
What did I do wrong?

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,320
Your Majesty.

46
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,000
Take her away.

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,160
Your Majesty.

48
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,760
Your Majesty.

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,560
Your Majesty.

50
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,680
Spare me, Your Majesty.

51
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,560
Your Majesty.

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,560
Lady Shen,

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,280
I will do you justice.

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,080
Rest well during pregnancy.

55
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

56
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Hear my decree.

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,880
Noble Consort Xian of the Yongxiu Palace

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,400
shall be restored to her position.

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,200
You protected

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
the royal heir,
but were unjustly punished.

61
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,800
However,

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,560
your crime of spreading plague

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,960
negates

64
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,760
your merit.

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,640
Thank you

66
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,600
for your mercy.

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
On behalf of Noble Consort Xian

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,920
and the Yongxiu Palace,

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,080
I kowtow in gratitude.

70
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,160
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
All of you,

72
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,120
treat the patients.

73
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,520
Should any mishap occur,

74
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,800
I'll kill you.

75
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,560
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,880
Jiuning.

77
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:56,720
Jiuning.

78
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,480
Lady Shen.

79
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,600
I haven't fully recovered.

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
Best keep your distance.

81
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,640
You're bearing a royal heir.

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
You should be careful.

83
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,120
It's raining. Please go back.

84
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,600
Thank you, Jiuning.

85
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,160
(Wan'er.)

86
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
(Are you watching?)

87
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,840
(Are those your tears?)

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,160
(Those who put you in the Cold Palace,)

89
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,440
(who stood so high)

90
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,840
(and trampled our fates,)

91
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,800
(have been overthrown by me.)

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,520
(But those who took your life)

93
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,240
(still roam free.)

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,480
(Wait a little longer.)

95
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
(I will surely)

96
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,360
(send her before you.)

97
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
You've finally come.

98
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,920
Here to avenge your sister?

99
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,720
The once-invincible,

100
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,400
all-powerful Consort Chun

101
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,360
has been reduced to this.

102
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
How are you coping?

103
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,880
My father and brother

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
are generals who have
safeguarded the nation

105
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,720
and rendered outstanding service,

106
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,240
deeply trusted by His Majesty

107
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,880
and respected
by every official in court.

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,920
Such prestige.

109
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,800
Yet now I've been bested
by a mere palace maid.

110
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,800
How absurd.

111
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,080
You mocked me as an ant trying

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,320
to topple a tree because you failed

113
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,440
to see

114
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,440
that all people are equal in dignity.

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,200
Even the lowliest ant

116
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,720
has the right to survive.

117
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
We won't tolerate

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,600
your ruthless trampling.

119
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,160
I must admit this.

120
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,880
A humble maid like you,

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,320
without power or status,

122
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,160
has matched wits with me,
an imperial consort

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,520
with prestige.

124
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,400
I underestimated you.

125
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,560
I thought you couldn't fight back.

126
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,240
Yet you advanced strategically

127
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,680
and actually

128
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,520
took me down.

129
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,400
I never wanted this.

130
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,880
Wan'er and I

131
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,840
entered the palace only to survive.

132
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,800
Even if treated as inferiors,

133
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,200
even if ignored by all,

134
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,680
we just wanted to live.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,880
That's all we wanted.

136
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,960
But you

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,520
shattered our last shred of hope
with your own hands.

138
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,000
Enough.

139
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,480
So,

140
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,200
how are you going to kill me?

141
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,360
Since I've lost,

142
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,800
I accept defeat.

143
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,000
Who killed

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,920
Wan'er?

145
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
You're quite something.

146
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,320
You asked the right question.

147
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,360
No shame in losing to you.

148
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,920
At first, I thought

149
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,520
you killed Wan'er

150
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,720
out of jealousy.

151
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,320
But when I learned

152
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,760
that you tried to steal
Lady Shen's child,

153
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,240
I realized that

154
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,400
Wan'er was targeted precisely because

155
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
she was pregnant.

156
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,560
You put her in the Cold Palace,

157
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,080
intending to steal her newborn child.

158
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
That was your real plan.

159
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
You wouldn't have

160
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,320
killed her before the child was born.

161
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,280
So the real killer

162
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,560
must be someone else.

163
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,560
You're quite something.

164
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,360
So thoughtful.

165
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,160
Who most opposes your rise?

166
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,440
Who dreads your possible ascension

167
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,880
through motherhood?

168
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
It doesn't matter now.

169
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,760
I don't care.

170
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,200
You have the answer.

171
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,720
Is it Consort Shu?

172
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,080
Consort Shu?

173
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,080
I've been thinking

174
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,440
who most envies your glory.

175
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,280
It's most likely Consort Shu.

176
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,680
Though equal in rank,

177
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,080
she's languished beneath you,

178
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,800
enduring your scorn

179
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,720
and humiliation.

180
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,560
She wouldn't submit to you.

181
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,520
Is it her?

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,400
This imperial harem

183
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
is full of

184
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,200
deception and double-dealing.

185
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,480
It could be anyone.

186
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,520
You're the one who caused my downfall.

187
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,960
How I wish to tear you apart

188
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,000
and flay your flesh.

189
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,200
Yet you expect me to name the killer

190
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,000
and share clues with you?

191
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,600
Even without your tips,

192
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,320
I'll uncover the truth myself.

193
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,280
I defeated you,

194
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,440
a prestigious consort of high power.

195
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,880
Of course, I can
get to the bottom of this

196
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,360
and catch this cowardly schemer

197
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,080
who strikes from the shadows.

198
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,680
Your Highness,

199
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:11,760
I will never

200
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,240
forget your help.

201
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,600
Rise.

202
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,160
I know

203
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
Your Highness assisted me.

204
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
You scolded me harshly

205
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,920
and kicked me out

206
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,560
because you knew my intentions

207
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
and were willing to

208
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,640
lend me your support.

209
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,120
It's all thanks to
your own efforts and virtue.

210
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,520
I almost

211
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,320
implicated Your Highness

212
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,240
and all your subordinates.

213
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,200
I came here

214
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,200
to apologize.

215
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,720
Please punish me.

216
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,160
You serve in the Yongxiu Palace.

217
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,760
Just remember this.

218
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,320
We stand united,

219
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,320
sharing

220
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
weal and woe.

221
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,080
Your problems

222
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
are my problems

223
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,840
and concern all of us.

224
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
I will not,

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,960
nor will I ever

226
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,560
allow your reckless behavior

227
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,400
to endanger others.

228
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,040
Now,

229
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,200
Consort Chun is confined in her palace.

230
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,600
As the saying goes,

231
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,840
"To resist temptation is true virtue."

232
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,640
Stop causing trouble from now on.

233
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,600
If you cause further disturbances,

234
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,120
I will not

235
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,920
show mercy.

236
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,120
Understood.

237
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
I will behave.

238
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,288
(Jingfu Palace)

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,040
Miss.

240
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,520
What brings you here?

241
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,800
I'm Lu Jiuning

242
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,400
from the Yongxiu Palace.

243
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,760
Consort Shu helped me a few days ago.

244
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,160
I've come to show gratitude.

245
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,480
Miss Jiuning.

246
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,240
This way.

247
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,880
Your Highness,

248
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,800
Lu Jiuning
of the Yongxiu Palace is here.

249
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,240
Your Highness.

250
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm Lu Jiuning.

251
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,440
I've come to thank Your Highness.

252
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Since you are resting,

253
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,120
I'll come again.

254
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,600
This is weird.

255
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,160
Surong is usually here

256
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,440
when Her Highness naps.

257
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,280
Why is no one here today?

258
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,040
(Oh no.)

259
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,800
Assassin!

260
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,720
Assassin!

261
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,840
Assassin!

262
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:56,720
Your Highness.

263
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,360
Your Highness.

264
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:03,800
Hurry.

265
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,928
Summon Imperial Physicians.

266
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:05,504
Understood.

267
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:06,360
Audacious villain.

268
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,880
How dare you eunuch

269
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,520
attempt to kill me?

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,040
Who sent you?

271
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
Xiao Zhuozi.

272
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,840
Why did you do this?

273
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,280
What insolence!

274
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,840
The Yongxiu Palace sent an assassin!

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,520
Guards.

276
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,120
Send this scoundrel

277
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,840
to the Punishment Bureau
for interrogation.

278
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,680
He bit his tongue off.

279
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,560
This is horrible.

280
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,800
This is terrifying.

281
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,960
Why would he want me dead?

282
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,440
Your Highness,

283
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,920
I was too careless.

284
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,400
Someone called me
to inspect your new gown.

285
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,720
Had Miss Jiuning not intervened,

286
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,120
you would've been killed.

287
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,520
Thank you, Miss Jiuning.

288
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,480
Don't mention it, Surong.

289
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,800
When I was in trouble,

290
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,960
Consort Shu and you helped me out.

291
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,920
I came to show my gratitude today

292
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
and happened

293
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,720
to run into the villain.

294
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,760
It's our duty

295
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,320
to protect our masters.

296
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,480
Jiuning.

297
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,200
I helped you

298
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,960
out of compassion

299
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,640
for you.

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,240
You don't owe me anything.

301
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,760
Your Highness treats everyone

302
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,520
kindly.

303
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,840
How did you offend anyone?

304
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,640
I seek nothing

305
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,920
more than self-preservation.

306
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
Perhaps I was too close to Consort Chun.

307
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,200
Now that she's fallen,

308
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,960
I will be

309
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,960
taken down with her.

310
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,400
Your Highness.

311
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,320
Even if you lack powerful

312
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,080
connections,

313
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,520
you now hold the noble rank of Consort.

314
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,840
How dare they disregard the law?

315
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,880
They can't

316
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,000
just bully you.

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,560
Surong.

318
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,920
Mind your words.

319
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,840
(Consort Shu sounds like)

320
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,960
(she's implying something.)

321
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,480
(What kind of person is she?)

322
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,760
(Why did Xiao Zhuozi)

323
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,880
(try to assassinate Consort Shu?)

324
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,000
(Is it related to Noble Consort Xian?)

325
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,720
Your Highness, please take care.

326
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,360
I will leave you to rest.

327
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,040
I take my leave.

328
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:47,360
Xiaotao.

329
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,160
Miss Jiuning.

330
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,920
Her Highness says

331
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,680
it's been rainy these days.

332
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
The sun is out today.

333
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,400
Let's move the flowers
outside for the sun

334
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,160
and trim them

335
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,160
a bit.

336
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,360
We're on it.

337
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,360
Weren't there

338
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,240
several pots of Her Highness's
favorite balsams?

339
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,440
Where are those?

340
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,880
Forget it.

341
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,560
Those balsams

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,800
all died.

343
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,440
They died?

344
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,120
Yeah.

345
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:17,880
Why?

346
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,360
They were thriving before.

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,120
How did they die?

348
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,000
Xiao Zhuozi has been careless

349
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,280
at work these days.

350
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,440
Somehow,

351
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,840
he killed all those balsams.

352
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,640
And he intentionally

353
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,520
broke the vase
His Majesty gifted to Her Highness.

354
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,720
She was furious

355
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,640
and punished him.

356
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,080
Intentionally?

357
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,600
Days before his death,

358
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,360
he became neglectful
of Her Highness's orders,

359
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,320
shirking responsibilities

360
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,280
all day.

361
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
Xiaotao. It's getting late.

362
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,200
Hurry up.

363
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:53,376
Alright.

364
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,160
Xiao Luzi.

365
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,280
I have a question.

366
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,680
- Xiao Zhuozi...
- Please.

367
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,440
Miss Jiuning.

368
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,640
Xiao Zhuozi...

369
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,640
Xiao Zhuozi is in trouble.

370
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,800
We're not allowed to discuss him.

371
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,480
Xiao Luzi.

372
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
You worked with Xiao Zhuozi for years.

373
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,840
Don't you think his death

374
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,720
is suspicious?

375
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,200
It does seem odd.

376
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,280
A few nights ago,

377
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,160
I saw him secretly wiping tears

378
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,400
while muttering

379
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,680
things like,

380
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,480
"There's no way out".

381
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,400
(Could it be)

382
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,080
(that Her Highness forced Xiao Zhuozi)

383
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,760
(to assassinate Consort Shu?)
