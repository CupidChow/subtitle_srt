=Episode 7=

3
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:14,944
(I'm Willing To Be a Lapdog)

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,160
Quit dawdling around.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,560
Hurry up.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,120
Jiuning, let me help you.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,880
Do a proper job.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,560
Look lively.

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,640
And keep your wits about you.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,400
If anything goes wrong,

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,440
and the superiors blame us,

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,320
you'll pay with your worthless lives.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,936
You.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,840
Scrub it clean.

15
00:00:58,144 --> 00:00:58,720
Yes.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,320
- Yes.
- And this.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,360
This.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,760
Madam Li.

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,600
Well, Eunuch Yong.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,040
By the Imperial Household's order,

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,160
we need some servants

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,880
to move tributes at Fengxian Hall.

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,960
A few days ago,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,840
we sent someone

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,640
to inform you.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,640
I wonder

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,640
if you

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,000
have made proper arrangements?

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
These past few days,

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,280
the imperial kitchen
needed servants for banquets,

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,800
and Manufacturing Bureau

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,400
also demanded servants.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,480
Well,

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,760
we're short-handed.

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,280
Eunuch Yong,

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,760
you'd better look elsewhere for help.

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,840
Hold on,

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,720
Madam Li,

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,360
transporting tributes
is of utmost importance.

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,000
If it gets delayed,

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,560
won't my head roll?

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,320
Madam,

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,760
here's a small token of my appreciation.

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,640
Could you do me a favor?

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,160
If your head rolls,

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,800
what's that to me?

47
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,200
Don't you know the rules?

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,480
For life-threatening tasks like this,

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,680
you need ample silver for bribes.

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,200
Only then can things be done properly.

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,320
With this measly amount,

52
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,240
you expect me to obey?

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,800
Madam,

54
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm merely

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,576
a minor overseer.

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,160
I truly can't produce more silver.

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,120
That's not my concern.

58
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,800
No silver?

59
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,480
Forget about your duties.

60
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,680
Fail your duties,

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
and your wretched life

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,280
isn't worth keeping.

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,800
Madam Li.

64
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:35,680
Madam Li.

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,320
How dare you!

66
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,960
You dare disrespect me?

67
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,400
Madam,

68
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,200
look, there's a pit ahead.

69
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Don't sprain your delicate foot.

70
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,440
That's more like it.

71
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,120
Next time, remember

72
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
to bring more silver.

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,160
Now go pick some eunuchs
to carry the tributes.

74
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you, Madam Li.

75
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,920
Unbelievable.

76
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,800
Eunuch Yong.

77
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Eunuch Yong, please wait.

78
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,080
Jiuning?

79
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,920
What is it?

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,480
You're the head
of the Imperial Household Department.

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,720
Madam Li should be subordinate to you

82
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,880
and follow your orders.

83
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,640
But now she holds the world in contempt,

84
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,680
even her superiors.

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,960
She openly emptied your purse

86
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,080
and even humiliated you.

87
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,720
Eunuch Yong,

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,080
you really know
how to bend over backwards.

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,400
Miss Jiuning,

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,600
are you here to mock me?

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I wouldn't dare.

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,360
I merely

93
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,720
wish to voice

94
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,280
your injustice.

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,440
Very well.

96
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,880
Since your first day in the palace,

97
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
we've known each other.

98
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,200
We're old acquaintances now.

99
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,680
I'll share my true thoughts

100
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,880
with you.

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,680
I

102
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,880
have long disliked her.

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,120
A mere overseer of the Hard-Labor Ward,

104
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,320
she dared publicly

105
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,640
give me a hard time.

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,440
She has no respect for me at all.

107
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:24,720
That filthy wretch

108
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,400
flaunts Lady Yu's backing behind her.

109
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,280
I'm just tolerating her for now.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,320
When will

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,080
this humiliating life ever end?

112
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,400
I have a plan to eliminate Madam Li.

113
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
I wonder if you'd dare to try it.

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,720
As a lowly palace maid,

115
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,720
you're audacious.

116
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,760
If these words

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
were overheard by others,

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,600
it'd cost your worthless life.

119
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,760
Don't panic.

120
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,160
I'd not suggest it

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,360
without certainty.

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,960
Should anything go wrong,

123
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,560
I'll take full responsibility.

124
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,200
You won't be implicated.

125
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
What do you want

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,360
from me?

127
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,400
My request

128
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,320
is well within your capabilities.

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,040
If I overthrow Madam Li,

130
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,800
please arrange

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,200
to make me the new overseer
of the Hard-Labor Ward.

132
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
From then on,

133
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,160
I'll follow your every command.

134
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,320
Deal?

135
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,584
(Hard-Labor Ward)

136
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,960
Madam?

137
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,480
Madam.

138
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,400
Madam.

139
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,000
I need to ask you

140
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,240
for a favor.

141
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,360
You offended Lady Yu.

142
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Begging me won't help.

143
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,352
What's this?

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,640
I can't

145
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,560
endure scrubbing nightsoil pots
day and night anymore.

146
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,520
But I've no money

147
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,880
except

148
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,360
this gold-thread handkerchief.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,920
I offer it

150
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,880
as tribute to you.

151
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,800
No wonder you were once favored
in the palace.

152
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
Even a random trinket

153
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,840
is worth substantial silver.

154
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,680
But I can't accept

155
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,040
anything from you.

156
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,600
Recently,

157
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,680
you chased away

158
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,440
the eunuch collecting debts for me.

159
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,720
Weren't you boasting

160
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
that here,

161
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
you fear no one?

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,880
That was my past foolish arrogance.

163
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,680
Madam,

164
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,760
please don't hold it against me.

165
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,440
Look,

166
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,776
this handkerchief's

167
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
threads are pure gold.

168
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,320
Look.

169
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
The embroidery.

170
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
The stitching precision.

171
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,040
I only appreciate two types of dogs.

172
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,800
The first

173
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,680
kneels and licks my feet,

174
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
a lapdog.

175
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,840
The second

176
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,760
is the kind

177
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,080
that yaps mindlessly,

178
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,960
a stray mutt.

179
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,960
Tell me,

180
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,120
which dog are you?

181
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
I'll be your lapdog,

182
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,720
serving at your side.

183
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,840
Wise choice.

184
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,920
In the Hard-Labor Ward,

185
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
I'm the almighty Buddha.

186
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,680
No matter who you are,

187
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,200
none escape

188
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,840
my palm.

189
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,240
Now,

190
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,480
crawl.

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,760
Let me see it.

192
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
Well done.

193
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
Since you're so obedient,

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
tomorrow you'll wash clothes

195
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,080
instead of scrubbing nightsoil pots.

196
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,800
Thank you, Madam.

197
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,800
Off you go.

198
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,760
(Madam Li,)

199
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,360
(gluttonous snakes choke on elephants.)

200
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
(Tomorrow)

201
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,440
(will be your doom.)

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
Good morning, Madam.

203
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,080
You seem particularly cheerful today.

204
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,560
Has some happy occasion befallen you?

205
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,960
Lady Yu summoned me
for a chat at He'an Palace.

206
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,520
How's my outfit?

207
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,320
Is it appropriate?

208
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,960
Wisdom and elegance
blend perfectly within you, Madam.

209
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,560
No matter what you wear,

210
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,000
it always showcases
your impeccable taste.

211
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
You certainly know
how to flatter, Xiaoyu.

212
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,040
In the future,

213
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,600
I'll need to rely on your guidance.

214
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,880
Well, well.

215
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,960
Are you Chief Eunuchs
of the Manufacturing Bureau

216
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,800
and the Imperial Household Department?

217
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,960
What brings you

218
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,880
to this wretched Hard-Labor Ward?

219
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,040
Everyone, cease your tasks.

220
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Assemble all servants in the courtyard.

221
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
What's happening?

222
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,160
No idea.

223
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,600
What's it?

224
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,320
What happened?

225
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,280
No idea.

226
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,600
Well.

227
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,520
Eunuch Shun,

228
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
well...

229
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,200
what exactly is the matter?

230
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,048
Manufacturing Bureau's
Embroidery Workshop

231
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,000
has lost the embroidery intended
as an imperial gift for a consort.

232
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,400
An informant claims

233
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
it was stolen by someone
from Hard-Labor Ward.

234
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,880
Impossible.

235
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
How could that be?

236
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,320
Daring to steal imperial property?

237
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,760
Who has such audacity?

238
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
Confess now.

239
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,960
If I have to uncover it myself,

240
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,960
heads will roll.

241
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,560
Heavens above.

242
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,280
How could that happen?

243
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,520
Which Hard-Labor Ward member

244
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,160
would dare steal

245
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,120
from the Embroidery Workshop?

246
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,240
This is impossible.

247
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,000
Well...

248
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,920
Madam Li,

249
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,120
your boldness knows no bounds.

250
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,280
This handkerchief in your hand

251
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,440
is the stolen item.

252
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,520
What? It's stolen?

253
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,600
Is that true?

254
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,440
It can't be.

255
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,320
Could Madam Li have stolen it?

256
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
This handkerchief uses golden thread,

257
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,320
fireworm silk, and peacock plume thread,

258
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,120
three rare materials in total,

259
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,240
and the kesi silk
tapestry technique to craft.

260
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,800
It took ten master embroiderers

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,640
three months
to complete this single piece.

262
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,640
How dare you

263
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
use such a precious artifact?

264
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,760
You've truly tired of living.

265
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm innocent.

266
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,160
I'm truly innocent.

267
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,040
Wait.

268
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,480
It was Lu Jiuning.

269
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,640
It was her.

270
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,320
She gave me this handkerchief.

271
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,600
Yes, it was her.

272
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,640
You're the real thief.

273
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,400
Would she dare?

274
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,320
Exactly.

275
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Your Excellency,

276
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm serving punishment
in the Hard-Labor Ward.

277
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,880
I couldn't possibly have left.

278
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,080
How could I steal
from the Embroidery Workshop?

279
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,320
Stop lying.

280
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,840
Last night, you offered me
this handkerchief, you vile wretch.

281
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,680
You...

282
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,840
you vile wretch!

283
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,720
How dare you...

284
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,360
How dare you frame me!

285
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,040
Madam Li, at this point,

286
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
you still deny it?

287
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,360
Not even Lady Yu

288
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,880
could save you now.

289
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,560
What?

290
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,520
Don't you know what I want?

291
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,600
Jiuning,

292
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,840
I beg you.

293
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,320
I beg you, spare me.

294
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,600
I'll tell you

295
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
what you want to know.

296
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Everything.

297
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,400
When Wan'er was in the Cold Palace,

298
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,600
were you delivering her meals?

299
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,200
Yes.

300
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
It was me.

301
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,480
It was me.

302
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,680
You want

303
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,200
to know what happened

304
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,360
to her in the Cold Palace that day?

305
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,240
I'll talk.

306
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,840
I'll tell everything.

307
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,880
That day...

308
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,680
That day, Lady Yu

309
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,120
went to see her.

310
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,760
I remember

311
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,760
I delivered the meal

312
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,880
to the Cold Palace.

313
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,480
When I brought it in,

314
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,160
I saw Talented Lady Wan.

315
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,280
She appeared completely normal then.

316
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,760
After a while,

317
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,160
Lady Yu entered.

318
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,760
Later,

319
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
she came out.

320
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,640
After that, Talented Lady Wan

321
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,400
committed suicide

322
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,400
out of guilt.

323
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,200
So it was her.

324
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,440
Why must Lady Yu

325
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,360
kill Wan'er?

326
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,240
I don't know.

327
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
I don't know.

328
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,840
I only helped frame her
into the Cold Palace.

329
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,480
Lady Yu

330
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,680
didn't let me know anything else.

331
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,720
Jiuning, I beg you.

332
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,800
I beg you

333
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,720
to spare my wretched life.

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,480
Your Excellency, you may not know,

335
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,360
but Madam Li

336
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,080
has been embezzling funds
in the Hard-Labor Ward

337
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,200
and is utterly greedy.

338
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,760
Countless palace staff suffered.

339
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,920
About whether
she stole this handkerchief,

340
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,640
just go to her quarters

341
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,160
and search thoroughly,

342
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,680
and the truth will surface.

343
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,440
Someone.

344
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,880
Search.

345
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,800
- Yes.
- You wretch.

346
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,024
Your Excellency,

347
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:58,280
we found the late empress'

348
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,360
lost ceremonial robe.

349
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,600
The late empress' ceremonial robe?

350
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,800
You...

351
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
You vile wretch!

352
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,160
Madam Li,

353
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,080
possessing belongings

354
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,800
of the late empress

355
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,440
is a capital offense.

356
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Dare you deny it?

357
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,640
Madam Li,

358
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,720
you've been insolent daily,

359
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,880
greedy, and tyrannical.

360
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,120
Today,

361
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
you commit this treasonous act.

362
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,480
No one can save you now.

363
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,960
I'm innocent.

364
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm innocent.

365
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,440
This...

366
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,120
this robe

367
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,600
was given by Manufacturing Bureau
eunuchs to repay debts.

368
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,240
Outrageous!

369
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,640
You insolent wretch,

370
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,400
you hid the empress' robe

371
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,400
and slander us,
the Manufacturing Bureau.

372
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,320
Guards.

373
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,960
Strip her of the Hard-Labor Ward
overseer position.

374
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,360
Drag her away,

375
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,320
beat her

376
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,240
to break her limbs,

377
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,560
and dump her in a death cell.

378
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,280
No.

379
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,920
I'm innocent.

380
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,120
Move.

381
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I'm framed.

382
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,240
I swear I'm innocent.

383
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,560
I'm innocent.

384
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,920
I swear I'm innocent.

385
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,920
Hard-Labor Ward maid Lu Jiuning,

386
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,200
for meritorious exposure,

387
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,000
is appointed Hard-Labor Ward overseer
effective immediately.

388
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,360
I pledge diligent service,

389
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,000
honoring Your Excellency's
and Eunuch Yong's trust.

390
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,120
(Wan'er,)

391
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,680
(evil begets retribution.)

392
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,120
(Madam Li, who harmed you,)

393
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,000
(has finally paid in blood.)

394
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,400
(Next,)

395
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,360
(I'll bring Lady Yu before you)

396
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
(to beg your forgiveness.)
