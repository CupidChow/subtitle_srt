1
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:09,984
=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,288
=Episode 03=

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,944
(Make Her Carry the Child
for Your Highness)

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,680
(My love.)

5
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,920
(How can I)

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,480
(live without you?)

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,440
(Your Majesty.)

8
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,960
(I can no longer accompany you)

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,080
(and ease your burdens.)

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,680
(It also pains me deeply.)

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,640
(Please don't grieve, Your Majesty.)

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,680
(I will be thinking of you)

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,520
(every day in the afterworld.)

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,480
(What should I do)

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,160
(if I miss you?)

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,880
(I'll miss Your Majesty as well.)

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,240
(Whenever you miss me,)

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,320
(descend on rainbow clouds)

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,320
(to meet me again.)

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,040
My lord.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,200
His Majesty seems to be staying
at the Lijing Pavilion tonight.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,640
Please make arrangements in advance.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,880
So this is Beauty Song
of the Lijing Pavilion.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,000
That's right.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,880
She lives up to her reputation.

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,560
Pass down the order.

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,760
His Majesty

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,520
won't visit the Chengxi Palace.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,400
Head to

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
the Lijing Pavilion.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,560
Candles cast autumn's chill
on painted screens.

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,480
Gauze fan gently waving
to catch fireflies.

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,440
Night's chill seeps through
palace steps like water.

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,760
There she sits,
gazing at two stars in love.

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
The late Empress
once promised His Majesty

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,440
that she would appear

38
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,720
as fireflies

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,600
to meet His Majesty

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,440
whenever she misses him.

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,080
If Beauty Song

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,400
can ease His Majesty's grief,

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,880
she'll gain favor.

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,200
In the imperial harem,

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,080
fortune and misfortune intertwine.

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,720
Nothing is certain.

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,760
Guards.

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,520
Arrest this cunning maid

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,240
immediately.

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,360
Why would you arrest me?

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,640
How dare you

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,480
use scented ointment and syrup

53
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,080
to attract fireflies,

54
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,960
faking celestial visions to catch

55
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,440
His Majesty's eye?

56
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,280
Do you know

57
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
that scheming for favor
in the imperial harem

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,120
could be dangerous?

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,520
All I know is
that no flower blooms forever.

60
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,640
And serving

61
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,960
His Majesty is risky.

62
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
If not driven to desperation,

63
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,760
who'd take such a risk?

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,080
May I ask,

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,840
is vying for favor a crime?

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,600
Why would you arrest me?

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,080
You insolent maid!

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,680
Your bugs destroyed

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,040
(Yun Mi, Lord Ning)
the twin lotus buds

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,760
Lord Ning planted
for the Empress Dowager.

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,680
Her birthday banquet is next month.

72
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,760
These are

73
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,840
Lord Ning's gifts for her.

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,360
Palace maid,

75
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,560
do you confess?

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,800
I confess.

77
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,120
But I meant no harm.

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,560
You must be beaten to death

79
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,040
for what you did.

80
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,240
Lord Ning.

81
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,040
Lord Ning.

82
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
I have something to say.

83
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:56,608
Speak.

84
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,920
The twin lotus symbolizes
the love of a couple.

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,480
Precious though it is,

86
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,320
it's a bit improper as a birthday gift

87
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,840
for the mighty Empress Dowager.

88
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,400
Why don't you present
the remaining blossom

89
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,520
untouched by the bugs

90
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,280
as a gift?

91
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,880
A lone flower represents
peerless majesty,

92
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,320
perfectly matching

93
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,680
her supreme status.

94
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
"Peerless majesty" indeed.

95
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,480
I never expected

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,840
that there is

97
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,560
such a brazen

98
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,520
yet eloquent maid in the harem.

99
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,760
Lord Ning.

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,480
I will deal with her right now.

101
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,640
Forget it.

102
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,880
She was only trying

103
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,000
to serve her master.

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
The flowers might be precious,

105
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,520
but not as precious

106
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,720
as human lives.

107
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,280
I'll find another gift

108
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,640
for the Empress Dowager's birthday.

109
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,760
Thank you for your mercy.

110
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,280
I'll take my leave.

111
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,880
Your Highness.

112
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:36,360
Your Highness.

113
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,120
Greetings,

114
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,720
Your Highness.

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,440
Eunuch Zhang. Where is His Majesty?

116
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,480
Your Highness.

117
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,240
I came to inform you that

118
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,800
His Majesty met Beauty Song
in the Imperial Garden.

119
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,880
He may not

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,240
visit the Chengxi Palace this evening.

121
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,896
What did you say?

122
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,560
His Majesty is heading

123
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,040
to the Lijing Pavilion.

124
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,160
I must hurry to attend to him.

125
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,096
Your Highness.

126
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,760
I'll take my leave now.

127
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,480
How dare she sabotage my plans!

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
She must die!

129
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,800
I'll kill her and feed her to the dogs!

130
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Leave us.

131
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

132
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,360
Your Highness.

133
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:38,600
She stole the night
of Seven-Star Conjunction

134
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
to conceive the heir.

135
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,160
If she bears a child...

136
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,840
If she bears a child,

137
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,560
I'll seize the child as my own.

138
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
If she bears a child,

139
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,360
we'll make her carry the child
for Your Highness.

140
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,280
Then we'll

141
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,040
kill her and keep the child.

142
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,624
(Lijing Pavilion)

143
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,360
Wan'er, they're here.

144
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,360
- Greetings to Talented Lady Wan.
- Greetings to Talented Lady Wan.

145
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,520
Rise.

146
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,200
Thank you, Talented Lady Wan.

147
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,600
By His Majesty's decree,

148
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,840
Beauty Song Wan'er
has displayed exceptional grace

149
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,200
and is hereby elevated

150
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,960
to the rank of Talented Lady.

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,040
She shall receive
a pair of golden hairpins,

152
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,040
five sets of pearl earrings,

153
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,920
three jade bracelets,

154
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
four silver accessories,

155
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,200
and ten rolls of embroidered satin.

156
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,320
From now on,

157
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120
Talented Lady Wan
shall reside in the Lijing Pavilion.

158
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,888
My Lady.

159
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:06,600
Please sit.

160
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:08,320
Wait.

161
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,360
Be careful.

162
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:13,984
My Lady.

163
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,240
These are the palace maids and eunuchs

164
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,160
I chose to serve you.

165
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,120
- Greetings to Talented Lady Wan.
- Greetings to Talented Lady Wan.

166
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,400
Rise.

167
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,400
- Thank you, My Lady.
- Thank you, My Lady.

168
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:27,960
My Lady.

169
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,440
I will take my leave

170
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,200
now.

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,720
Eunuch Yong, wait.

172
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,360
Miss Jiuning,

173
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,040
I failed to recognize

174
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,080
your importance

175
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,560
and looked down on you.

176
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,360
Please don't hold grudges against me.

177
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,520
I wouldn't dare.

178
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,240
The provisions for the Lijing Pavilion

179
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,200
rely on your good care, Eunuch Yong.

180
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Should we displease you,

181
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,600
we might not even get scraps to eat.

182
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,320
Don't say that.

183
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:00,680
Please.

184
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,320
Miss Jiuning,

185
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,320
I sincerely apologize.

186
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,400
From now on, your affairs are my own.

187
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,360
I shall devote myself wholeheartedly.

188
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,080
I'll never be negligent.

189
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,120
No wonder you thrive

190
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
in the Imperial Household Department.

191
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,160
Your ability to assess situations

192
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,080
is truly admirable.

193
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
For us servants,

194
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,240
reading moods becomes second nature.

195
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
Talented Lady just got promoted,

196
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,920
but His Majesty's generous rewards

197
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,200
clearly show

198
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,200
his affection

199
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,560
for her.

200
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,480
Official ranks matter less

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,240
than His Majesty's true affection.

202
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,080
The imperial harem

203
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
is full of those who

204
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,600
kiss up to the powerful
and kick down the weak.

205
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,160
But I'd still advise you to stop

206
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,080
bullying anyone from now on.

207
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
My Lady tolerates your behavior

208
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,520
out of kindness.

209
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,120
But if you encountered someone vengeful,

210
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,520
they'd kill you

211
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,160
once they gain favor.

212
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,200
You're right.

213
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
You're absolutely right.

214
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,360
I'll never do it again.

215
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
Please forgive me.

216
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,040
Please forgive me.

217
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
Enough, Jiuning.

218
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,880
You've worked hard.

219
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,880
Go back to work.

220
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,280
Yes.

221
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,040
Thank you for showing mercy.

222
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,760
I'll take my leave.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,920
I'll take my leave.

224
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,840
Let's go.

225
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,320
Look at you.

226
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,760
People in the imperial harem

227
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
always kiss up and kick down.

228
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,200
They're from humble origins.

229
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't be so harsh on them.

230
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,840
Got it, Wan'er.

231
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,720
You two.

232
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,840
What are your names?

233
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,400
Miss Jiuning.

234
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,760
I am Bitao.

235
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,640
I am Xiao Fuhai.

236
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,960
I am Lu Jiuning.

237
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,760
From now on,
we all serve Talented Lady Wan.

238
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,400
Since you're here,

239
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
you need to serve Our Lady well.

240
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
From now on, we will share weal and woe

241
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,760
as one.

242
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,520
You'll be properly rewarded

243
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,960
as long as you do your jobs.

244
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

245
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:11,456
(Lijing Pavilion, one month later)

246
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,240
Wan'er.

247
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:22,440
Wan'er.

248
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,000
The private kitchen
made roasted goose for you.

249
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,120
Remember?

250
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,480
We craved roast goose so much as kids.

251
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:33,200
Wan'er.

252
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,400
What's wrong?

253
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,880
I'm fine.

254
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,560
I think I ate something bad.

255
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,160
I've had no appetite lately.

256
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,840
I can't stand rich smells.

257
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:52,400
Wan'er.

258
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,520
I've calculated.

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,080
Your menstruation
is delayed by half a month.

260
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,920
And you can't stand the rich smells.

261
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,280
Perhaps

262
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,640
you're pregnant?

263
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:06,120
I am really

264
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,880
bearing a royal heir?

265
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,320
Back in Chen's Mansion,
Lord Chen's concubine

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,880
was pregnant and her symptoms

267
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,600
matched yours.

268
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,080
It must be that.

269
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,280
I must inform His Majesty immediately.

270
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,520
A royal heir

271
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,000
will be our crucial support.

272
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:24,640
Wan'er.

273
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,960
Not so fast.

274
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:27,360
Why not?

275
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,760
In the harem, mothers rise through sons.

276
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,840
His Majesty has few heirs.

277
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
Even the mighty Consort Chun

278
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,160
schemes desperately to conceive.

279
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,680
If others learn of your pregnancy,

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,560
you might

281
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,200
become a target

282
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,280
and face danger.

283
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,160
Indeed.

284
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,920
You're right.

285
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,560
I got carried away.

286
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,640
We must

287
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,120
keep this secret

288
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,360
to avoid the schemers.

289
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,840
According to the rules,

290
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,040
imperial physicians
check my pulses monthly.

291
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,840
It will be very soon.

292
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:07,840
What if

293
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,080
they find out about it?

294
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:11,320
My Lady.

295
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
Here's some braised pork.

296
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,280
Please try it.

297
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,760
My Lady.

298
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:19,552
What?

299
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,280
Does the meat smell bad?

300
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,600
It's not the meat.

301
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,480
Our Lady is having a poor appetite.

302
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,160
That's it.

303
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,720
You may leave.

304
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:29,760
Yes.

305
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,280
Wait.

306
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:42,848
(Lijing Pavilion)

307
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,160
Physician Liu.

308
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,400
Miss Jiuning.

309
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,360
I am here to check
Talented Lady Wan's pulse.

310
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,560
Physician Liu.

311
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,160
Talented Lady Wan's eyes

312
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,360
became

313
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,760
bloodshot last night,

314
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,120
aching and itching.

315
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,240
She stayed up all night

316
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,920
and fell asleep just now.

317
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,920
Were her eyes sensitive to light

318
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,640
and tearing?

319
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,640
That's right.

320
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,920
That sounds like acute conjunctivitis.

321
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,920
It's contagious.

322
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:13,600
Oh no.

323
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,680
Is this

324
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,880
severe?

325
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,040
Don't worry.

326
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,760
Just boil dandelion and coptis roots

327
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,080
to cleanse her eyes.

328
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,040
Understood.

329
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Thank you, Physician Liu.

330
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,680
Physician Liu.

331
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,560
I'm afraid

332
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,560
you can't take My Lady's pulse.

333
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,576
But...

334
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,600
My Lady's conjunctivitis

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,960
may not be severe,

336
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,320
but it's still contagious.

337
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,160
Physician Liu, have you been drinking?

338
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,200
Yes.

339
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,040
It's my grandson's
full-month celebration today.

340
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,680
So I overindulged slightly.

341
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:46,304
Well,

342
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,040
you must be extra careful.

343
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,480
If a newborn infant got infected,

344
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,960
it would be disastrous.

345
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,400
You're absolutely right.

346
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,360
In that case,

347
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,920
I won't disturb Talented Lady Wan.

348
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Take care, Physician Liu.

349
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,112
Wan'er.

350
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,800
Your clever tricks worked again.

351
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,920
Physician Liu had a few drinks

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,680
for celebration.

353
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,160
That's why you got lucky.

354
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,160
Wan'er.

355
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,240
Rest assured.

356
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,240
Take care of the child.

357
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,600
I'll handle the rest.

358
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,000
We'll ensure my child is born safely.

359
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,480
What?

360
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,840
She's pregnant?

361
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,720
Your Highness.

362
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,880
It's absolutely true.

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,280
I saw it myself.

364
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,280
Talented Lady Wan has been retching.

365
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,920
Then

366
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,560
Lu Jiuning went to get some

367
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,840
sour apricots.

368
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
Talented Lady Wan hasn't stepped out

369
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,360
of the Lijing Pavilion.

370
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,440
I think she must
be pregnant and protecting

371
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,600
her child.

372
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,320
I thought Song Wan'er
is just a pretty woman

373
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,680
who is not smart.

374
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,800
Turns out she's cunning.

375
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,960
Do your job well,

376
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,720
and Consort Chun will reward you.

377
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,040
Take the money and keep silent.

378
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,000
Continue monitoring Song Wan'er.

379
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,840
Lu Jiuning is shrewd.

380
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Don't let her find out.

381
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,840
Yes.

382
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,840
I will be very careful.

383
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,560
Go ahead.

384
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
