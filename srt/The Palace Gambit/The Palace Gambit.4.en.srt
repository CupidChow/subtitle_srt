(Guards, Beat this Wretched Woman
to Death!)

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,000
Bitao.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,920
I just got some bird's nest for tonic.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,600
I'll make some

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,520
bird's nest soup for Our Lady.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,640
Iron this garment for Our Lady.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,520
She will wear it
at the Empress Dowager's

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,560
birthday feast tomorrow.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,760
Be very careful with it.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,440
Yes.

13
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:35,552
(Lijing Pavilion)

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,640
Jiuning.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,640
Chief Physician Zhang.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,680
Physician Liu

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,640
checked on Our Lady just a few days ago.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,880
Why are you here

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,440
to take her pulse in person?

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
I'm done.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,400
Congratulations.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,040
Your pulse is slightly taut and rapid.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,040
Signs of pregnancy

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,280
are emerging.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,640
(Chief Physician Zhang)
You are bearing a child.

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,920
Congratulations.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,320
From now on,

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,760
the Imperial Hospital

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,520
will assign specialists

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,120
to ensure the safety

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,880
of you and your child.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,504
Chief Physician Zhang.

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,080
Could we delay reporting my pregnancy?

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,720
Well,

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
why is that?

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,480
Having served long
in the Imperial Hospital,

37
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,720
you've surely witnessed numerous mishaps

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,760
during pregnancy.

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Some lost their children,

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,920
and some even

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,400
lost their lives.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,440
I dare not comment on the affairs

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,720
in the imperial harem.

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,560
However, the Imperial Hospital's duty

45
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,800
is to ensure your safety,
Talented Lady Wan.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,880
I'll devote full effort

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,440
to safeguard your health and well-being.

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,800
Thank you for sharing our concerns.

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,360
But if anyone found out
about My Lady's pregnancy,

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,520
and any accident occurred,

51
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,640
it would mean

52
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,520
certain death for all of us.

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,560
I'm aware.

54
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,240
I dare not be negligent.

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Rest assured, My Lady.

56
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,160
Having served for over twenty years
in the Imperial Hospital,

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,880
I strictly follow imperial decrees

58
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,160
with unwavering loyalty

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,480
witnessed by the universe.

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,040
Once I go back,

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,120
I must immediately report your pregnancy

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,040
to the Imperial Clan Court.

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
Once His Majesty learns of this,

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,400
he'll certainly

65
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,000
dispatch special attendants
to the Lijing Pavilion.

66
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,840
At that time,

67
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,640
all safety measures will be ensured.

68
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,520
We've long heard of
your exceptional medical skills

69
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,640
and integrity.

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,040
You are truly

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,800
worthy of His Majesty's trust.

72
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,560
Jiuning.

73
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,080
Let Chief Physician Zhang
follow protocol.

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,960
I believe

75
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,160
he won't betray His Majesty's trust.

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,360
Chief Physician Zhang,

77
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,960
please immediately

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,880
report Our Lady's pregnancy

79
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,320
to the Imperial Clan Court.

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,320
Rest assured.

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,240
The Imperial Hospital
will report it shortly.

82
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,960
Later,

83
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,480
I'll send prenatal tonics.

84
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,640
Please rest well.

85
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I'll take my leave.

86
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,960
Lord Ning sent me
to deliver the birthday gift first.

87
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,800
He'll pay respects

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,320
to the Empress Dowager later.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,520
Lord Ning commissioned craftsmen

90
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,680
to carve this lotus mutton-fat jade.

91
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,280
It symbolizes unique excellence,

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,480
nurturing benevolence,

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,520
and blessings to all,

94
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
to wish the Empress Dowager longevity.

95
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
Assure Lord Ning

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,680
that his gift will
reach the Empress Dowager

97
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,360
safely.

98
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,400
Be careful.

99
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,840
Please forgive me!

100
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Please forgive me!

101
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,280
I didn't do it on purpose.

102
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,600
Please forgive me.

103
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,400
Does it hurt?

104
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,800
I'm fine, My Lady.

105
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,520
It doesn't hurt.

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,360
How could you be so careless?

107
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,720
It won't happen again.

108
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,240
Please forgive me.

109
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,240
I'll fetch the wound salve for Jiuning.

110
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,080
Hurry up.

111
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,880
Yes.

112
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,480
Leave us.

113
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,840
Yes.

114
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
Wan'er.

115
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.

116
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,120
Jiuning.

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,240
It's the Empress Dowager's birthday.

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080
Blood is considered inauspicious.

119
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
You'd better not come with me.

120
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,800
Dress your wound first.

121
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
Wait at the palace entrance later.

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,800
Wan'er.

123
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,360
I'll be back in no time.

124
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,400
Be very careful.

125
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,560
Go ahead.

126
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,080
Alright.

127
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,240
May Your Majesty
live ten thousand years!

128
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
(Empress Dowager)
Rise.

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,040
Be seated.

130
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,880
We thank Your Majesty.

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,160
Noble Consort Xian of the Yongxiu Palace

132
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,440
presents a luminous pearl
from the Eastern Sea.

133
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,880
Consort Chun of the Chengxi Palace

134
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,760
presents a Nine Heavens
Auspicious Jade Seal.

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,320
Consort Shu of the Jingfu Palace

136
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,120
presents a Southern Mountain
Crimson Cloud Jade.

137
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,680
Lady Yu of the He'an Palace

138
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,400
presents a millennium-old lingzhi
from the Southern Sea.

139
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,800
Alright.

140
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,640
Alright.

141
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
Talented Lady Wan of the Lijing Pavilion

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,440
presents a pair
of Western Regions calming sachets.

143
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Sachets?

144
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,960
How could she present

145
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
such undignified items to Her Majesty?

146
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,800
Exactly.

147
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,440
Her Majesty possesses every incense.

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
How dare she offer such common items?

149
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
I heard Your Majesty has been having

150
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
restless nights.

151
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,160
I studied ancient texts for recipes,

152
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,840
ground Western tribute fragrances,

153
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,040
and mixed them with 32 medicinal herbs

154
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,400
to make these sachets

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
for Your Majesty's comfort.

156
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,280
I hope these sachets help you sleep.

157
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,760
Your gift shows great care.

158
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,080
No wonder His Majesty
praises your wit and charm.

159
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Come here.

160
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,720
Bring them to me.

161
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,440
Let me see those sachets.

162
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,280
So inauspicious.

163
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,640
Such grave disrespect.

164
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,280
You...

165
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
How dare you!

166
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
How dare you curse me?

167
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,800
- You...
- This isn't my gift.

168
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,304
Your Majesty.

169
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:18,960
Your Majesty.

170
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,080
Your Majesty.

171
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,320
Hurry. Summon the physicians.

172
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,920
Yes.

173
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,080
Song Wan'er.

174
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,760
This is the worst offense.

175
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,480
How dare you curse
the Empress Dowager on her birthday!

176
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,400
Do you have a death wish?

177
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,360
I didn't do it.

178
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,560
I put sachets in this chest.

179
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,520
No more excuses.

180
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,960
I tolerated it
when you seduced His Majesty.

181
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,960
But how dare you disrespect
the Empress Dowager!

182
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,200
You shall be executed.

183
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,040
Guards.

184
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,880
Seize this wretched woman.

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,720
- Your Highness.
- Yes.

186
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,360
Your Highness.

187
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,160
I'm innocent.

188
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,200
I swear.

189
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
Still denying it?

190
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,280
Beat her to death!

191
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,480
Wait.

192
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,520
Place her under arrest.

193
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,920
Let the Empress Dowager

194
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,480
investigate thoroughly

195
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,680
and then punish her.

196
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,280
Since Noble Consort Xian pleads for her,

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,280
confine Song Wan'er to the Cold Palace

198
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,520
and wait for trial.

199
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,760
Your Highness, I'm innocent.

200
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,040
Your Highness. I'm innocent.

201
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,160
Your Highness.

202
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,560
I'm innocent.

203
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,480
Talented Lady Wan.

204
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,480
You dare curse the Empress Dowager?

205
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,760
I've served in the palace for decades.

206
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Among all the imperial consorts,

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,640
you're the most audacious.

208
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
Sending you to the Cold Palace

209
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,600
is showing you mercy.

210
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,280
I'm innocent.

211
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,720
I never cursed Her Majesty.

212
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,320
I don't care if you're innocent.

213
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,240
Take her away.

214
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,240
Wan'er.

215
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,360
Jiuning.

216
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
- Jiuning!
- Let go of her.

217
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,400
Let her go.

218
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,320
Let her go.

219
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,360
My lord.

220
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,520
You can't treat her so roughly.

221
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,320
She carries the royal heir.

222
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,640
You can't do this to her.

223
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,560
What nonsense.

224
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,320
Are you lying

225
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,480
to avoid punishment?

226
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,680
- It's even worse.
- I didn't.

227
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,192
Take her.

228
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,920
Jiuning.

229
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,440
Wan'er.

230
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
Jiuning.

231
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,480
Jiuning.

232
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,280
Wan'er.

233
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Wan'er.

234
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,120
Let me go.

235
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,760
Jiuning.

236
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,840
(She carries the royal heir.)

237
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,480
(It could save her.
The Imperial Hospital.)

238
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,240
(The Imperial Hospital can confirm it.)

239
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,840
(I must save her.)

240
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,920
Let me go.

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,560
Let me go.

242
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,720
Jiuning.

243
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,160
Chief Physician Zhang.
Chief Physician Zhang.

244
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
Please save My Lady.

245
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
Miss Jiuning.

246
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,920
What's going on?

247
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,760
My Lady was sent

248
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,120
to the Cold Palace unjustly.

249
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,000
You know

250
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,240
she carries His Majesty's child.

251
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,040
If anything happens there,

252
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,360
the royal heir could perish.

253
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,320
Miss Jiuning.

254
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
Such claims are dangerous.

255
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,360
Talented Lady Wan is confined.

256
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,920
I understand that you're concerned,

257
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,360
but you shouldn't speak boldly

258
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
about the royal heir.

259
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,240
You'll be held accountable
for deceiving His Majesty.

260
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,680
Deceiving His Majesty?

261
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,280
What do you mean?

262
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
Miss Jiuning,

263
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,200
try something else

264
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,480
to save Talented Lady Wan.

265
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,440
I have work to do.

266
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,440
Please leave.

267
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
Then give me the medical records.

268
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,920
I'll talk to His Majesty myself.

269
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,800
This is ridiculous.

270
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,480
The medical records

271
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,720
document the health details
of the consorts

272
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,360
in the imperial harem.

273
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,040
You can't just demand them.

274
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,160
Give it back.

275
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,560
Stop!

276
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,560
How dare you

277
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,160
fumble through medical archives?

278
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,680
I must save my sister.

279
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,560
Forgive my offense.

280
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,120
How dare you, Lu Jiuning!

281
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,000
Know your place.

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,360
Do you have no respect?

283
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,080
I won't let you

284
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,200
disrupt our work.

285
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,200
Drag her out.

286
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,880
Chief Physician Zhang.
My sister is dying.

287
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,480
Please help us.

288
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,480
We won't implicate you.

289
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:51,240
When she rises

290
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,920
through her child,

291
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,360
she'll repay your kindness.

292
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,440
Nonsense.

293
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,360
Take her away.

294
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Chief Physician Zhang.

295
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,200
Please, I beg you.

296
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,880
Chief Physician Zhang.

297
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,560
I beg you.

298
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,120
Just testify for her.

299
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,600
If His Majesty knows she is pregnant,

300
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,200
he will be so happy.

301
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,480
Chief Physician Zhang. Didn't you say

302
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,280
that you'd personally
report her pregnancy

303
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,760
to the Imperial Clan Court?

304
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,920
Talented Lady Wan was never pregnant.

305
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,680
There was no medical record of it.

306
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,480
If you keep talking nonsense,

307
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,520
I'll send you to the Punishment Bureau

308
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,920
for spreading rumors

309
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,080
and deceiving His Majesty.

310
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,520
You took

311
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,880
my sister's pulse in person that day.

312
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,320
And you clearly recorded her pregnancy.

313
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,280
You set up my sister.

314
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,800
Why?

315
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,440
Who ordered you to do this?

316
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,600
How dare you!

317
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,120
A lowly palace maid

318
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,400
dares to slander

319
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,280
Imperial Hospital and me
to save your master.

320
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
What are you waiting for?

321
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,680
Drag her out.

322
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,360
Let go.

323
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
I'll walk myself out.

324
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,120
Chief Physician Zhang,
you're quite something.

325
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,640
You just wait.
