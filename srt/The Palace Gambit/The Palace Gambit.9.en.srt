=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,416
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,976
(I'll Wait for You Down There)

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,400
You are the one

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,920
behind the moneylenders
and casinos in the Hard-Labor Ward.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Your Majesty, spare me!

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,400
Your Majesty, have mercy!

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,440
It was me.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,960
I got greedy

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,640
and collected ill-gotten gains.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,360
But Your Majesty,

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,160
my salary was meager.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,112
Therefore...

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,760
We set up gambling dens
and moneylenders.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,080
We lured them into gambling

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,760
then forced them into debt.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,000
We exploited them
with compounding interest.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,680
Your Majesty, I admit my crimes.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,520
I beg for mercy.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,760
Outrageous!

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,640
A mere overseer

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,160
dares to abuse power

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,480
and resort to such schemes!

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,720
Is the Imperial Household Department

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,720
an empty shell?

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,000
Bring the chief here!

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,200
Summon Du Yong, chief of
the Imperial Household Department.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,720
I, Du Yong, pay respects
to Your Majesty.

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,280
Were you aware usurious loans were

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,920
illegally issued

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,840
in the Hard-Labor Ward?

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,560
I...

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,680
Yes, I was.

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,840
Madam Li secretly operated
underground casinos

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,800
and moneylenders

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,960
to exploit palace staff.

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,600
I should have investigated thoroughly.

38
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:42,960
But...

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,520
But...

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:44,920
She...

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Madam Li...

42
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,600
She...

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,640
She...

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,760
Out with it!

45
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,200
Now!

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,520
What is it?

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,520
Calm your wrath, Your Majesty.

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,360
I dare not speak, Your Majesty!

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,800
Your Majesty,

50
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,240
I once sought Eunuch Yong's help

51
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,560
with evidence

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,080
of Madam Li's crimes.

53
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,640
But he feared the power behind Madam Li

54
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,280
and dared not intervene.

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,160
Your Majesty!

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,640
I made a mistake!

57
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,240
What 'power'?

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,480
What force dares

59
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,800
operate under my very nose?

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Please investigate!

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,280
It's

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,320
Lady Yu

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,000
of He'an Palace.

64
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,760
She directed Madam Li

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,320
to extract wealth from Hard-Labor Ward

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,440
and abuse palace staff.

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,240
With Lady Yu's backing,

68
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
Madam Li disregarded

69
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,240
the Imperial Household Department.

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,080
And they had to turn a blind eye

71
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,760
to their lawless conduct.

72
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,600
Absurd!

73
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,320
You claim Lady Yu is involved?

74
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Where's your proof?

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Your Majesty,

76
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,600
when I

77
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,160
searched Madam Li's quarters,

78
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,400
I discovered the ledger.

79
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Please review it.

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
A royal consort truly involved in this?

81
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,760
Guards!

82
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
Bring Lady Yu!

83
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,920
Summon Lady Yu to the hall.

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,720
The ledger contains

85
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,760
records of you

86
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,760
bribing Madam Li and Lady Yu

87
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,400
with hundreds of silver taels.

88
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,160
Is this true?

89
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
Your Majesty,

90
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,920
it's...

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,560
It's true, Your Majesty!

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,040
I was forced into this,

93
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,120
Your Majesty!

94
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,400
To perform my duties,

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,080
I had to

96
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,280
pay them money.

97
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,320
Without payments,

98
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,440
I couldn't fulfill my tasks.

99
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,800
Failing my duties

100
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,680
would cost me my life!

101
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,680
They forced me!

102
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,320
Your Majesty,

103
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,400
please spare me!

104
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,360
I had no other choice.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,160
This is utterly preposterous!

106
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,280
You moron!

107
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,120
Greetings,

108
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
Your Majesty.

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
Lady Yu, do you admit your guilt?

110
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,160
Your Majesty,

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,960
I...

112
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,760
I made a grave mistake.

113
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,120
Your Majesty,

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
I was deceived by her.

115
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,560
This vile woman acted in my name

116
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,760
to abuse others!

117
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,920
When I found out, I tried to punish her.

118
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,120
She attempted to

119
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,600
bribe me to save her skin.

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
I lost my mind and fell into her trap.

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,120
She blinded me, Your Majesty!

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Lady Yu,

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,440
you're lying!

124
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,040
Your Majesty,

125
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
she made me do

126
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,520
all these

127
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,440
foul deeds.

128
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,240
Moreover,

129
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,320
every tael of silver I earned

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,880
went to her!

131
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,840
And she even

132
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,760
used her status to threaten me!

133
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,800
She swore that if I
ever revealed the truth,

134
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,240
she'd

135
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,760
slaughter my entire family!

136
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:02,800
You hag!

137
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,440
How dare you slander me!

138
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,040
You viper!

139
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,200
You exploit your position
as a royal consort

140
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,640
to manipulate me.

141
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,680
Now that your crimes surface,

142
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,480
you

143
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,800
make me your scapegoat!

144
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,240
Even in death,

145
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
I'll haunt you!

146
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,520
Nonsense!

147
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,200
You lowly fool!

148
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,160
Enough!

149
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,680
Guards, seize them!

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,760
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

151
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,840
Forgive me this once!

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
I truly didn't mean to!

153
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,080
I was so wrong!

154
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,560
I merely took some silver.

155
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,960
I've been good and loyal.

156
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,880
Please spare me,

157
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,840
Your Majesty!

158
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,160
Hear my decree.

159
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,320
Chief matron Li

160
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,160
abused her power,

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,160
resulting in deaths,

162
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,080
and shall be beaten to death!

163
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,800
Your Majesty!

164
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
Chief eunuch Du Yong

165
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,760
is stripped of position

166
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,960
for dereliction

167
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,512
and sent to Hard-Labor Ward.

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,440
Anyone involved

169
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,640
shall receive full punishment.

170
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Lady Yu of He'an Palace,
disregarding my authority,

171
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,440
defying imperial law,

172
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,760
murdering palace staff,

173
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,160
and abusing power,

174
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:22,960
is stripped of titles,

175
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,880
reduced to a commoner,

176
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,800
and granted poisoned wine.

177
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,240
Let death atone for your sins.

178
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
- Your Majesty, spare me this once!
- Your Majesty!

179
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,000
- I truly repent, Your Majesty!
- Thank you, Your Majesty!

180
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,360
Thank Your Majesty's mercy!

181
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,760
Your Majesty...

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,160
Get out!

183
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,160
I won't eat anything you bring!

184
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Lady Yu,

185
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,760
before execution,

186
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,560
if you don't eat your fill,

187
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,920
you'll end up a starving ghost.

188
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,840
You witch!

189
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,400
I warned you

190
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
I'd sever your allies first,

191
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,200
then strike at you directly.

192
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,480
Never imagined

193
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,720
retribution would come so swiftly.

194
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,400
To think

195
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,640
I'd fall to a lowborn wretch like you!

196
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,440
My imperial title

197
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,960
and status, you destroyed it all!

198
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,400
I'll haunt you from the grave!

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,760
You keep calling me 'lowborn',

200
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,672
claiming we're beneath you.

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,880
Yet look at yourself.

202
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,360
You're just a dog Consort Chun summons

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,240
and dismisses at will.

204
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,440
How exactly are you better?

205
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,760
These are the banknotes
I confiscated from Hard-Labor Ward.

206
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
They were meant to line your pockets.

207
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,800
Since you're so fond of money,

208
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,040
I'll burn them as offerings.

209
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
When you reach the underworld,

210
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,360
you can

211
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,960
spend them at your leisure.

212
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,640
You went through all this trouble

213
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,240
just to seek justice for that wench
Song Wan'er, didn't you?

214
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,080
Now you've gotten your wish.

215
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,880
I had her banished to the Cold Palace.

216
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,360
My people swapped the ceremonial money
during the birthday banquet.

217
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,640
Are you satisfied now?

218
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,960
You think I'd believe you?

219
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,480
With your status,

220
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,400
how could you order the imperial
physicians or Chief Physician Zhang?

221
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,440
I don't believe you acted alone
in killing Wan'er.

222
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,640
Someone powerful must
be pulling your strings.

223
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,640
Talk!

224
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,320
Is it Consort Chun?

225
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,304
You took down Madam Li,

226
00:09:10,304 --> 00:09:12,200
and get all cocky with me now.

227
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,320
You dare accuse Consort Chun?

228
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,840
She holds immense power in the harem.

229
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,520
None but Noble Consort Xian
can rival her influence.

230
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,400
You, a mere overseer,

231
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,400
dare to oppose Consort Chun?

232
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,360
Don't kid yourself.

233
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,880
Do you know why

234
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,480
I haven't reported this to His Majesty?

235
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,280
Because I won't ask
His Majesty to handle this.

236
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,600
I will

237
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,960
make each one of you who harmed Wan'er

238
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,360
confess your sins one by one before I

239
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,960
send you to join her.

240
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,520
Go ahead.

241
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,880
Go bring them down.

242
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,640
Lu Jiuning,

243
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,040
you're rushing to your grave.

244
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,640
She's the mastermind.

245
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,360
I'll wait for you down there.

246
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,760
Even now, you are still protecting her.

247
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,400
Having knelt for so long,

248
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,800
you forget to stand straight.

249
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,200
You fear Consort Chun,

250
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,400
but I don't.

251
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,960
Justice always prevails.

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,960
No matter how powerful she is,

253
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,160
I'll make her burn in agony.

254
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,520
Guards!

255
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,840
Bring in the wine.

256
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,720
Make her drink it.

257
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,640
Yes.

258
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,040
I underestimated that wench.

259
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,480
She brought down

260
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
Lady Yu!

261
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,960
That useless fool

262
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,360
was so stupid.

263
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,440
Please calm your anger.

264
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,800
Don't harm your health with rage.

265
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,160
I heard

266
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,000
Lu Jiuning went to the Cold Palace today

267
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,560
to deliver the poisoned wine.

268
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,200
Now there are rumors

269
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,960
that there's more to
Song Wan'er's death.

270
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,440
If this continues,

271
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,080
it may endanger Your Highness.

272
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,680
Dead men tell no tales.

273
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,840
What can she do to me?

274
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,440
Hard-Labor Ward's staff reported

275
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,960
Lu Jiuning seems to have evidence

276
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
to present to Noble Consort Xian.

277
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,080
She's courting death.

278
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,520
Keep digging.

279
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,480
See if Lady Yu gave her anything.

280
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,760
Understood.

281
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,280
A mere maid isn't frightening,

282
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,160
but if Noble Consort Xian
joins hands with her,

283
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,160
it's trouble.

284
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,120
The priority now

285
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,280
is to eliminate Lu Jiuning

286
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,920
immediately.

287
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,080
Yes.

288
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,520
Today, following Your Highness' orders,

289
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,000
I went to Hard-Labor Ward

290
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
for fertilizer

291
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,280
and learned they got a new overseer.

292
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,960
A younger maid now manages it.

293
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,600
Though young,

294
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,160
she's enforcing strict discipline

295
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,000
with efficiency.

296
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
That maid is called

297
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,360
Lu Jiuning.

298
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
Lu Jiuning?

299
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,240
Isn't she the one

300
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
who served Talented Lady Wan?

301
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,520
Yes.

302
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,600
It's said she crossed Lady Yu

303
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
while seeking justice

304
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,160
and got sent to Hard-Labor Ward.

305
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,000
Unexpectedly, fate favors her.

306
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,960
She uncovered the illegal loans
of Lady Yu

307
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,400
and Madam Li.

308
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,760
In the end,

309
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,560
she actually brought Lady Yu down.

310
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,160
Do you think it was mere luck?

311
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,720
How could such a coincidence exist?

312
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,240
In my opinion,

313
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
she came up with this plan

314
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
and going to Hard-Labor Ward
was part of it.

315
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,880
Part of her plan?

316
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,760
I don't understand.

317
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,200
Talented Lady Wan's death
is truly suspicious.

318
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,400
Such a clever and capable woman,

319
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,720
gone just like that.

320
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,080
What a tragic loss.

321
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
However,

322
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,720
that young maid isn't ordinary either.

323
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,240
Some people

324
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,200
are like tempered blades.

325
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
The more they're forged,

326
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,920
the stronger and sharper they become.

327
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,640
I actually

328
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,680
rather admire her.

329
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,240
The orchid resembles jade
adorned with dewdrops,

330
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
with unmatched elegance.

331
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,400
His Majesty has always
cherished rare orchids.

332
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,880
I shall present it

333
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,520
to His Majesty

334
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,360
myself in a few days.

335
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,880
This jade orchid is
Your Highness' treasure.

336
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,920
His Majesty

337
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,200
will surely be delighted.

338
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,240
Yanqiu,

339
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,680
instruct the gardeners

340
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,520
to tend it with utmost care

341
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,800
and keep it safe.

342
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,880
Understood.

343
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,960
Everyone, handle it carefully.

344
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,160
Especially

345
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,320
the jade orchid.

346
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,920
It's Her Highness'
birthday present to His Majesty.

347
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,760
Be extremely cautious.

348
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,440
No mistakes allowed.

349
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

350
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,680
Loosen the soil.

351
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,280
Right here.

352
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,320
Yes.

353
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,360
Your Highness!

354
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,240
This is bad!

355
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,400
What happened?

356
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,080
Your Highness,

357
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,280
I truly don't know.

358
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,520
It was perfectly fine yesterday.

359
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,880
I watered it at noon

360
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
and it wasn't like this.

361
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,080
I personally supervised everything

362
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,760
these past few days.

363
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,800
There were no oversights.

364
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,680
What fertilizer was recently used?

365
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,760
Hard-Labor Ward's special supply.

366
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,280
Their overseer delivered it
a few days ago.

367
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,880
Lu Jiuning, that's the name.

368
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,400
Since the fertilizer caused this,

369
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,480
I'll confront her immediately.

370
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,360
Lu Jiuning?

371
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,040
That troublemaker!

372
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,560
Rumor says she's been
stirring trouble everywhere

373
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,680
to avenge her mistress.

374
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,680
Since she provided the fertilizer,

375
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,280
we should ask her first.

376
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,600
Go.

377
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,480
Bring Lu Jiuning here for questioning.

378
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,120
Yes.

379
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,320
Your Highness,

380
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,800
we can't summon her now.

381
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,400
I just saw Consort Chun outside.

382
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,880
She's heading to
Hard-Labor Ward in a rage

383
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,856
to settle scores with Lu Jiuning!

384
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
These are for Her Majesty's use tonight.

385
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,560
Scrub them thoroughly.

386
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,480
Yes.

387
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
Ms. Lu.

388
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,040
Place that over there

389
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
where it gets sunlight.

390
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,040
Ms. Lu.

391
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,080
Consort Chun has arrived!

392
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

393
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,440
Seize her!

394
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,600
Consort Chun.

395
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:41,312
Consort Chun!

396
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:42,480
What is this?

397
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,920
Chop off her hands

398
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,440
and cut out her tongue!

399
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,880
Wait!

400
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,520
Consort Chun,

401
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,400
even offenders
deserve lawful punishment.

402
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,440
How can you do this?

403
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,280
Aren't you afraid
His Majesty will find out?

404
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,640
I will take responsibility.

405
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,880
Just do it.

406
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,200
Stop right there!
