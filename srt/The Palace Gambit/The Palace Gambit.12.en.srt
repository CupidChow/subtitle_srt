00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:09,888
=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:12,233
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,912
(I'll Make You Burn)

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,680
By order of Noble Consort Xian,

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,120
we deliver silk to all consorts

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,680
according to ranks and status.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,400
For Consort Chun,
two bolts of cloud silk,

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,520
two of plain silk, and 13 zhang
of crimson fabric.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,880
For Consort Yi,

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
two bolts of cloud silk,

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,448
and two of plain silk.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,000
For Lady Shen,

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,680
one bolt of plain silk
and five zhang of plain floral linen.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,160
For Lady Xin,

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,080
one bolt of plain silk
and five zhang of plain floral linen.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,760
For Lady Feng,

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,120
one bolt of plain silk
and five zhang of plain floral linen.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,800
Xiaotao.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,720
Yeah.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,400
Let's switch.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,920
You deliver Consort Yi's silk.

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,360
I'll deliver Lady Shen's.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,440
Why,

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,160
Jiuning?

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,560
I've heard Lady Shen
is rather domineering.

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,120
If she discovers

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,120
she received plain floral linen,

28
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,600
she'll surely throw another tantrum.

29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,760
Why subject yourself to that?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,640
Alright.

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,640
Jiuning,

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,480
you're too kind.

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,000
But what if you get scolded?

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,160
I'll be fine.

35
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:21,160
Here.

36
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:23,920
You go ahead.

37
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:39,168
(Lijing Pavilion)

38
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,800
(Lijing Pavilion)

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,360
Come here.

40
00:01:58,688 --> 00:01:59,280
Go on.

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,680
- A dog!
- There's a dog!

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,560
Where was it from?

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,320
- Guys!
- Catch it quickly!

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,520
Protect Lady Shen!

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Don't scare Lady Shen!

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,160
How careless to let a stray in!

47
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,480
You'll be dead if anything

48
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
happens to Lady Shen.

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,200
I am Lu Jiuning, maid of Yongxiu Palace.

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,640
Greetings, Lady Shen.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,560
I came by Noble Consort Xian's order

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,760
to deliver summer fabric.

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Leave it there.

54
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:00,360
Yes.

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,040
Lady Shen.

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,480
I notice your weary appearance.

57
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
Have you not been resting well?

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,240
Shall I massage your shoulders?

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,880
No need.

60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,800
You're Noble Consort Xian's chief maid.

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,240
Why grovel in my Lijing Pavilion?

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Return at once.

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,160
I made this sachet.

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,800
Please take it.

65
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,240
What's your game?

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Your Highness,

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,520
this sachet aids relaxation.

68
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,160
It contains sleep-inducing lavender,

69
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,000
silk tree flowers,

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,960
and precious musk.

71
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,040
Get out!

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,720
Take that thing and begone!

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,720
I said begone!

74
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,800
Must I repeat myself?

75
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:09,320
Yes.

76
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,320
I'll take my leave.

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,880
(This Lady Shen is truly cautious.)

78
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,840
(The medicinal herbs that day)

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,920
(and her reaction
at hearing musk just now.)

80
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,040
(She's definitely pregnant.)

81
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,680
(But)

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,200
(what's Consort Chun's role)

83
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,160
(in all this?)

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,400
Fool!

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
You must stay with her.

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,040
Why come to the backyard?

87
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,760
Thank God Lady Shen is fine.

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,320
But if she's disturbed,

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,280
you'll pay!

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,360
I made a mistake.

91
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,480
I merely feared for
Her Highness' safety,

92
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,760
hence lost composure.

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,600
Go get Chief Physician Zhang!

94
00:04:59,072 --> 00:04:59,600
Remember,

95
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,280
it must be him.

96
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,760
Got it.

97
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,760
Stock these medicines.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,552
Understood.

99
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Physician Liu.
Is Chief Physician Zhang here?

100
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,000
I need him

101
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,200
to check Lady Shen's pulse.

102
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,480
He went to Yongxiu Palace
to check on Noble Consort Xian.

103
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Miss Ruyue,

104
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,440
please wait.

105
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,800
Miss Jiuning,

106
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,560
how may I help?

107
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,360
I came to collect the cough medicine
for Noble Consort Xian.

108
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,320
Miss Yanqiu already took

109
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,800
Her Highness' cough medicine.

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,760
She beat me to it.

111
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,560
Physician Liu.

112
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
My lady suffered a shock.

113
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,840
She can't wait!

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,720
Will Chief Physician Zhang be long?

115
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,200
Ruyue,

116
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,280
don't be so rigid.

117
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,360
Since Lady Shen has been disturbed,

118
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
why insist on a specific physician?

119
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
You silly!

120
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,040
If any mishap occurs

121
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,600
and delays the treatment,

122
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,880
the consequences will be severe.

123
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,480
But it's always been
Chief Physician Zhang.

124
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,160
Don't worry, Miss Ruyue.

125
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,120
We keep medical records
for all consorts.

126
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,880
I've reviewed Lady Shen's records.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,120
A cold constitution

128
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,040
with stagnant qi.

129
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,080
I'll prescribe sedative herbs.

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,040
Take this to the pharmacy.

131
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,800
Very well.

132
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,680
I'll tell

133
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,040
Chief Physician Zhang

134
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,000
as soon as he returns.

135
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,400
Lady Shen has suffered a fright

136
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,760
and needs peaceful rest.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,240
The safflower and silk tree bark

138
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,200
will relieve stagnation and calm nerves.

139
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,240
Thank you.

140
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,240
(The calming medicine
prescribed by Physician Liu)

141
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,360
(has abortifacient herbs.)

142
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,760
(This means)

143
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,280
(the Imperial Hospital doesn't know
Lady Shen is pregnant.)

144
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,640
(Just like Wan'er's case,)

145
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,760
(Lady Shen's pregnancy)

146
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,240
(was never recorded)

147
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,920
(nor reported.)

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
(Now I see.)

149
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,560
(Consort Chun is behind the scenes.)

150
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,040
(Jinping is Consort Chun's maid,)

151
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,200
(yet she pretends to serve Lady Shen)

152
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,880
(diligently,)

153
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,560
(actually monitoring her.)

154
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,400
Uh!

155
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Are you hurt, my lady?

156
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,640
(Lady Shen knew about her pregnancy,)

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,720
(hence her extreme caution.)

158
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,360
(She even panicked on hearing musk.)

159
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Your Highness,

160
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,440
this sachet aids relaxation.

161
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,000
It contains sleep-inducing lavender,
silk tree flowers,

162
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,880
and precious musk.

163
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:46,320
Get out!

164
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,120
Take that thing and begone!

165
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
(Yet she concealed it.)

166
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,160
(No other imperial physicians knew.)

167
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
(She only consults
Chief Physician Zhang)

168
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,760
(because he conspired with Consort Chun)

169
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,920
(to use Lady Shen)

170
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
(for surrogacy.)

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,440
Talented Lady Wan was never pregnant.

172
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,800
There was no medical record of it.

173
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,160
(So back then,)

174
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,880
(they banished Wan'er
to the Cold Palace)

175
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,760
(because they)

176
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,520
(coveted the child)

177
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
(she is carrying.)

178
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,760
Your Highness.

179
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,040
Jiuning.

180
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,920
Where have you been so late?

181
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,320
Seeing Your Highness' cough persisting,

182
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,840
I visited Imperial Hospital

183
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,280
to fetch medicine.

184
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,400
But

185
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,480
Yanqiu beat me to it.

186
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,640
Fetch medicine?

187
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,360
Don't think I'm unaware

188
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,720
you visited Lijing Pavilion.

189
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,640
Using my cough as an excuse,

190
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
you told Yanqiu

191
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,000
to summon Chief Physician Zhang.

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
I knew

193
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
you were up to something.

194
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,240
Your Highness,

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
I saw Jinping from Chengxi Palace

196
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,400
frequently visiting
Lady Shen's quarters.

197
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
Finding this suspicious,

198
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,040
I volunteered to deliver the fabric

199
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
to investigate.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,520
Jiuning,

201
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,800
I know

202
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,400
no matter how hard I try,

203
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,800
you'll always want vengeance.

204
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,520
You seek justice for Wan'er

205
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,760
and you don't know when to quit.

206
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
But do you realize

207
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,880
you remind me

208
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,360
of my younger self, so full of passion,

209
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,200
undaunted and resolute?

210
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
This very resemblance

211
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,360
is why my heart aches so deeply for you.

212
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,280
Your enemies are mightier
than you think.

213
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
One misstep could spell eternal ruin.

214
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,560
These past days,

215
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,360
I've kept you occupied

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
with studies

217
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,240
and constant guidance.

218
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,760
Do you still not understand why?

219
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,680
I keep you by my side

220
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,560
not merely for your courage,

221
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,240
but to shield you.

222
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,280
To me, you are

223
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
a sister needing guidance

224
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,600
and protection.

225
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,680
Can't you understand me?

226
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,080
I can't watch hatred blind your reason

227
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,320
and lead you down a ruinous path!

228
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,160
Thank you

229
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,840
for such kindness, Your Highness.

230
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,680
I was sold

231
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
as a slave since childhood.

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,840
So much pain in all these years.

233
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,920
Peace always remains foreign to me.

234
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,800
Yet I've known

235
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,040
true compassion and respect

236
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,720
under Your Highness' care.

237
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,840
I am now more resolved than ever.

238
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,480
Though humble birth

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,360
was not my choice,

240
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,440
my fate

241
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,280
shall be in my own hands.

242
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,320
Even trampled by lofty nobles,

243
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,080
I'll carve a way out

244
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,360
step by step

245
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,320
to claim a life

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
worthy of dignity.

247
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,960
I want her dead!

248
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,640
Useless fools!

249
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,240
Why do I waste resources on you!

250
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,360
A simple trick lured you away?

251
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,520
Mercy!

252
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,280
Spare me!

253
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,920
A stray dog rushed into Lijing Pavilion.

254
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,800
We feared for Lady Shen's child.

255
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,920
That's why we fell for her tricks.

256
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,800
And you!

257
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,840
A mere sachet gave you away.

258
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,440
Why must it be Chief Physician Zhang?

259
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,200
Might as well announce the pregnancy!

260
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Witless fools!

261
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,480
Your Highness,

262
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,680
the sachet...

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,320
It contained musk.

264
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
I feared miscarriage.

265
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,120
That's why...

266
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,480
She lied!

267
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,640
All of you stay sharp.

268
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,280
One more blunder

269
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,160
to ruin my plans,

270
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,280
and I'll make you burn.

271
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,120
- Yes!
- Yes!

272
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,560
- It won't happen again.
- I'll be cautious.

273
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,920
Lady Shen,

274
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,400
what I promised you

275
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,240
shall be fulfilled.

276
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,080
Pull yourself together.

277
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Be extra careful with that sly maid

278
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,120
from Yongxiu Palace.

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,640
Should she harm your child,

280
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,360
your wealth,

281
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,560
your family's honor, and your future

282
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,520
will crumble to dust.

283
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,440
Understood.

284
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,920
I shall not

285
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,960
fail your expectations.

286
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:09,800
I will

287
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,640
act with utmost caution.

288
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,800
Focus on the baby.

289
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,960
After delivering the heir for me,

290
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,440
you'll have everything

291
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,560
you want.

292
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,200
Yes.

293
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
I won't let you down.

294
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Starting today,

295
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,880
feign illness in Lijing Pavilion.

296
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
Stay confined,

297
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,000
and keep my heir safe.

298
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,680
Yes.

299
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,280
Your Highness,

300
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,440
I'll do whatever you say.

301
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,440
(Why is the gate to Lijing Pavilion)

302
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,040
(shut tight?)

303
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
(That's really strange.)

304
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,120
Your Highness.

305
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,800
Your Highness.

306
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:04,040
Jiuning.

307
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,560
Lord Ning.

308
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,520
You look so hurried.

309
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,680
Where are you going?

310
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,000
I came to find you.

311
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,880
Find me?

312
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,520
His Highness was summoned today.

313
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,640
He came straight to you

314
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,520
after that.

315
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,080
What's the matter?

316
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,840
You can't

317
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,000
touch Consort Chun.

318
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,720
I advise you not to provoke her.

319
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
She's no ordinary foe.

320
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,440
What you must do now

321
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,960
is to keep a low profile

322
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,160
and bide your time.

323
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,680
She holds great influence

324
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,760
and has killed many people,

325
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,680
disregarding the law.

326
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
Every day we wait,

327
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,440
more innocent lives fall victim.

328
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,360
How long must I

329
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,960
lay low

330
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,640
and wait?

331
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,080
Why the caution now?

332
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,960
Are you afraid?

333
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,040
Afraid of Consort Chun's clan,

334
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,240
her favor,

335
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,640
or His Majesty's wrath?

336
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:55,160
Jiuning,

337
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,800
I share your hatred

338
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,280
for those who commit such atrocities.

339
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,680
But now,

340
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,160
child trafficking plagues
the common folk.

341
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,760
Violence against women too.

342
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,520
I've been investigating.

343
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,720
Now I can confirm

344
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,160
someone in here

345
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,600
is colluding with human traffickers.

346
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,280
Consort Chun might be their patron.

347
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,480
If we alert her now,

348
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,840
the trail goes cold,

349
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,920
and all efforts will be wasted.

350
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,360
You mustn't act recklessly.

351
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,160
Are you telling

352
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,040
the truth?

353
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,440
I swear.

354
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,280
When I was young,

355
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
I got separated

356
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,480
from Father

357
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
and was kidnapped.

358
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,160
Fortunately, I was rescued.

359
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,800
Otherwise,

360
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,720
I'd have ended up like those

361
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,280
sold into slavery and misery,

362
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
never knowing when I'd die.

363
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,160
That's why

364
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,760
I've been investigating

365
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,880
these deeply rooted
trafficking networks.

366
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,560
I must do something for those

367
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,360
stolen and enslaved.

368
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,520
If what you say is true,

369
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,240
then

370
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,480
I can stand down for now.

371
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,520
Since Your Highness
has such aspirations,

372
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,920
I have

373
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,800
something to tell you.

374
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,200
Consort Chun

375
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,960
and Lady Shen...
