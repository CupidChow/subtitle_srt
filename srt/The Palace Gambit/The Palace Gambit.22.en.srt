00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,080
=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,448
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:14,944
(Please Do Not Take
Jiuning into the Harem)

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,560
Your Majesty, summon the physicians.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,280
No need.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,720
It's an old ailment.

7
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:26,120
Even the physicians are here.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,240
They can do nothing.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,760
Every time it flares up,

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,240
the sound of wind

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,360
is as loud as thunder.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,080
I've taken medicine for years,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,400
yet no improvement.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Your Majesty, I may have a remedy

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,520
for your illness.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,016
Your Majesty,

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,000
would you permit me to try?

18
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:49,960
You?

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,160
Yes.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,280
Your Majesty, there's no time
to prepare now.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,360
Let's use my clothes temporarily.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Clever-Ear Pillow.

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,960
With lotus leaves, chrysanthemums,

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,920
and cassia seeds inside.

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,888
Good for the liver and eyes.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,840
It calms the mind

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,920
and alleviates tinnitus.

28
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,760
This Clever-Ear Pillow

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,840
is indeed effective.

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,080
With herbal fragrance.

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,400
Your Majesty,

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,960
the Clever-Ear Pillow
is a common folk practice.

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,760
Nothing particularly special.

34
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,560
Your Majesty's condition

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,600
requires peaceful recuperation.

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,280
You should avoid
all strenuous activities.

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,920
State affairs

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
are endlessly complex.

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,240
How can I rest peacefully?

40
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Where would I find
time for recuperation?

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,880
Blood!

42
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,320
Lu Jiuning!

43
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,232
How dare you

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
harm the royal body?

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,400
Have you grown a death wish?

46
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,280
Eunuch De, relax.

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,720
Your Majesty, do you feel better now?

48
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,960
Yes, I feel better.

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,440
Please forgive me.

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,880
Acupuncture

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,120
at the Yifeng acupoint

52
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,680
quickly

53
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,960
clears blocked meridians

54
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,680
and reduces ear discomfort.

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,960
Leave.

56
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,240
How do you know such things?

57
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,800
If this were curable,

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,960
the imperial physicians
would surpass you.

59
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:24,800
Why would I have suffered
for years otherwise?

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
You are the ruler of the realm,

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,880
the sovereign.

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,520
Which imperial physician would

63
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:31,840
apply needles to Your Majesty?

64
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,600
I suspect the imperial physicians

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,312
only prescribe mild,
slow-acting remedies

66
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:38,320
to treat Your Majesty.

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,080
Only a servant as loyal

68
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,400
and recklessly bold as me

69
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,080
can cure Your Majesty's ailment.

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,560
By that logic,

71
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,240
I shouldn't punish you?

72
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,240
Your Majesty,

73
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
the treatment works best
when you're calm.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
Acupuncture applied to

75
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,440
the Yifeng,

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,320
Tinghui,

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,760
and Zhongzhu acupoints

78
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,560
with long-term herbal treatment

79
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,520
will ensure recovery.

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,360
You maid

81
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,160
knows acupuncture techniques?

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,400
Your Majesty,

83
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,280
I had no family,

84
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,560
adrift like weeds.

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,240
When illness struck,

86
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,680
I had to

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
learn folk remedies
and acupuncture to save

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
myself and others.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,840
Illness teaches me.

90
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,000
Practice brings familiarity, that's all.

91
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,560
So I

92
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,120
always carry silver needles

93
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,440
for emergencies.

94
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,000
The physicians

95
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,160
are overly cautious.

96
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,960
Your unconventional method
is more effective.

97
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,600
Though crude, folk remedies

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,360
attempt bold solutions.

99
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,480
Your Majesty,

100
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,240
this chronic illness
may finally be cured.

101
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:42,920
What joyous news, Your Majesty.

102
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,480
Your Majesty,

103
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
may I

104
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,400
continue administering acupuncture?

105
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,360
Granted.

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,400
Understood.

107
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,920
Eunuch De,

108
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,680
after the acupuncture stimulation,

109
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,680
His Majesty requires peaceful rest.

110
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,160
Could you please

111
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,600
dismiss all personnel outside?

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,480
Let His Majesty sleep undisturbed

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,200
after the treatment.

114
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,160
Alright, Miss Jiuning.

115
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:07,040
Go.

116
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,200
Everyone, go.

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,688
Go now.

118
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,200
Outrageous!

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
Consort Shu just sent word saying

120
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,400
His Majesty and Lu Jiuning
are undressing

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,680
each other at the pavilion

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,440
in the Garden.

123
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,400
Eunuch De dismissed all attendants.

124
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,520
I shall witness personally

125
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:42,200
how this lowly palace maid

126
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,120
seduces our sovereign!

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,080
Shameless!

128
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
Calm your wrath.

129
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,360
Preserve your noble health.

130
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:53,400
Lu Jiuning and His Majesty
are intimate at the pavilion

131
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
in the Garden.

132
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,760
The Empress Dowager has already gone.

133
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:59,400
Your Highness, shall we not
watch the drama?

134
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,600
Patience.

135
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,040
The outcome is predetermined.

136
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,320
People

137
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,360
always believe
what they witness firsthand.

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,920
When the Empress Dowager
sees her with His Majesty,

139
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,072
she'll never pardon her.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,856
Lord Ning will panic

141
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,600
and offend both the Empress Dowager

142
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,200
and His Majesty.

143
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,240
A mere maid

144
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,320
gets entangled

145
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,320
with both His Majesty

146
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:32,000
and Lord Ning.

147
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,800
The Empress Dowager's fury

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
will ensure her execution.

149
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:39,880
Challenge me?

150
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,600
She courts death.

151
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,520
Truly brilliant, Your Highness.

152
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,960
Your Majesty?

153
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,160
Your Majesty?

154
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,528
Do you feel improved, Your Majesty?

155
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,280
I haven't slept this soundly in ages.

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
You maid

157
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,720
possess remarkable skills.

158
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,480
The Empress Dowager arrives!

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,640
Greetings, Mother.

160
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,720
Your Majesty.

161
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,480
Audacious servant!

162
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,080
Bewitching the sovereign,

163
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,120
defiling the harem!

164
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,240
How dare you
get entangled with Lord Ning

165
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,440
and seduce His Majesty?

166
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,560
This warrants execution!

167
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,880
Mercy!

168
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,640
Mother,

169
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,880
what is this?

170
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,480
Emperor,

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,240
the palace rumors proliferate,

172
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,920
saying maid Lu Jiuning commits

173
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,360
adultery with Lord Ning.

174
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,560
Now,

175
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,480
she even seduces Your Majesty too.

176
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,200
I've witnessed it myself.

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,000
If I don't intervene,

178
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,360
this disgrace

179
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,200
will shame our imperial family.

180
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,880
Guards.

181
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,440
Here.

182
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,880
Your Majesty,

183
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,120
I am innocent.

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,200
The rumors are false.

185
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,280
Please investigate it.

186
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,280
Drag her away!

187
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Mother,

188
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,720
wait.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,720
Your Majesties,

190
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,360
I vouch with my life.

191
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,880
Jiuning isn't the person rumors claim.

192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,480
She won't seduce His Majesty.

193
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,080
I implore your righteous judgment.

194
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,200
Lord Ning,

195
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,040
I was about to plead for her.

196
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,200
Why interfere?

197
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,560
Very well.

198
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,360
A mere palace maid

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,600
matters

200
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,320
so much to both of you?

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I demand her immediate execution.

202
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
What are you waiting for?

203
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,480
Drag her away!

204
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,280
Wait.

205
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,520
Mother,

206
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,680
this maid deserves credit for treating

207
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,520
my illness.

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,600
I wanted her

209
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
to be a Talented Lady.

210
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,160
Your sudden arrival

211
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,600
delayed my granting.

212
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,400
Mother, please

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,360
revoke your edict.

214
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,080
Spare her.

215
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,320
Your Majesty, please

216
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
revoke your edict.

217
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,960
Don't take her into the harem.

218
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,080
Lord Ning,

219
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,040
silence now.

220
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,680
I...

221
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
have shared trials with Miss Jiuning.

222
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,520
In childhood,

223
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,560
she saved my life.

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
Now, she's being framed.

225
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,280
I cannot stand idly by.

226
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,560
Both of you, silence!

227
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,840
Maid Lu Jiuning

228
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
exudes seductive charm,

229
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,920
disrupts imperial relations

230
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,840
and divides the court.

231
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,440
Such crimes

232
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,560
shame our ancestors

233
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,920
and betray the common folk.

234
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,720
Only dismemberment
can purify the palace.

235
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,160
Only death can appease imperial wrath.

236
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,000
Take her away.

237
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,720
Tear her apart.

238
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,920
Wait!

239
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,680
Wait!

240
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,120
Your Majesty.

241
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,680
Your Majesty. A mistake.

242
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,720
This is a misunderstanding.

243
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
I've just uncovered the truth.

244
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,040
Misunderstanding.

245
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
What misunderstanding?

246
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,840
Lord Ning and Lu Jiuning's rendezvous

247
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,920
in the Imperial Garden

248
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,320
was fabricated

249
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,160
by a maid

250
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,280
to curry favor.

251
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,640
Even I was deceived.

252
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,400
What eyewitness account?

253
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,760
What moral corruption?

254
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,880
All baseless rumors.

255
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,400
What did you say?

256
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
Challenge me?

257
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,840
She courts death.

258
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,760
Truly brilliant, Your Highness.

259
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Consort Shu,

260
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,640
you even manipulate His Majesty

261
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
and the Empress Dowager
to conspire against a maid?

262
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,440
Your audacity

263
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
knows no bounds.

264
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,800
Noble Consort Xian,

265
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,320
when did you return?

266
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,960
If I delayed my return,

267
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,360
your grand performance

268
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
may have ended unnoticed.

269
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,120
A mere maid isn't worth

270
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,760
such attention from a Noble Consort.

271
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,200
The show

272
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,480
unfolds in the Imperial Garden.

273
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,520
Will you not observe directly?

274
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,040
I've other matters

275
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,520
to attend to.

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,160
Goodbye.

277
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,800
I shall not see you out.

278
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,640
Your Highness,

279
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,960
it's been a long time.

280
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,080
Zhang...

281
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,440
Eunuch Zhang.

282
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,400
You...

283
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Weren't you dead?

284
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,200
My life is resilient.

285
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,120
Death cannot claim me yet.

286
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,280
Consort Shu,

287
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,320
you're ruthless.

288
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,800
Lu Jiuning

289
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
will not survive this night.

290
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,520
You orchestrated this trap.

291
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,080
Now, clean your own mess.

292
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,360
I...

293
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,560
command you to save Lu Jiuning.

294
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Have I gone mad?

295
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,160
You want me to save Lu Jiuning?

296
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,040
Confess false accusations before
His Majesty and the Empress Dowager?

297
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,320
Slap my own face publicly?

298
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,320
Fine.

299
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,080
You don't have to go.

300
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,600
Eunuch Zhang is now in my custody.

301
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,240
He can testify

302
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,480
to your conspiracy against consorts.

303
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,520
Either face the death of your family

304
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,240
or remain as Consort Shu.

305
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,920
- Choose wisely.
- You...

306
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,720
Your Majesty.

307
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,640
Your Majesty.

308
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
I failed in supervision.

309
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,360
I believed malicious slander

310
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,600
without investigation,

311
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,520
causing this misunderstanding.

312
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,280
Guards.

313
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,960
Bring the maid Xia Wei.

314
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,040
This wretched maid
envied Lu Jiuning for gaining

315
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,200
favor with her mistress.

316
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,240
She deliberately spread rumors

317
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,120
about Lu Jiuning's dates with Lord Ning

318
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,120
and falsely accused her

319
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
of seducing Your Majesty.

320
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,520
Thus the palace became
flooded with these lies.

321
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,120
I've already punished this wretch

322
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,760
by having her tongue removed.

323
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,200
Consort Shu,

324
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:59,200
I once held high hopes for you.

325
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,000
You've failed me miserably.

326
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,880
From now on,

327
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,472
keep your petty harem squabbles

328
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,320
away from me.

329
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,440
Understood.

330
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,840
I made a mistake.

331
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,200
Out with her.

332
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,000
Mother,

333
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,080
now that the truth is revealed

334
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,840
and Lu Jiuning is innocent,

335
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
I will grant her...

336
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,800
Your Majesty, I fancy Lu Jiuning.

337
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,800
We've maintained proper conduct,

338
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
never crossing lines.

339
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:27,840
In due time,

340
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,480
I shall formally request your decree

341
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,600
for our marriage.

342
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,160
I beg your approval.

343
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
Then I'll appoint her

344
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,400
as Chief Maid and assign

345
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,920
her to my study.

346
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,120
I gratefully accept

347
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,560
this decree.

348
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,856
Your Highness,

349
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,880
how does it feel to lose

350
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,520
the Majesties' trust?

351
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,160
So you deliberately seduced His Majesty

352
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,320
to make me file false accusations.

353
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
You schemed relentlessly,

354
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,520
fabricated rumors

355
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,880
and crafted such a masterful plan.

356
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,800
How could I

357
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,880
let you down?

358
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,880
You wanted me to anger Their Majesties.

359
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,400
They were indeed angered by someone,

360
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
but the one

361
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,520
was you.

362
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,360
Wretch.

363
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,240
Don't celebrate yet.

364
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,680
We'll see how this ends.

365
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,040
Take care, Your Highness.

366
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:06,944
(Lijing Pavilion)

367
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,080
Your Highness,

368
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,880
you may leave me here.

369
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,200
Jiuning,

370
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,432
serving directly before the Emperor

371
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,040
may bring prestige,

372
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,040
but it is risky.

373
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,640
The Imperial Study

374
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,040
isn't the Lijing Pavilion.

375
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,640
You must exercise utmost caution.

376
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
You're not even a mother yet

377
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,560
and already nagging.

378
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
Focus on your pregnancy.

379
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,120
Don't worry about me.

380
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,720
Jiuning,

381
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,320
Consort Shu's scheme

382
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,520
was utterly vicious.

383
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,960
I failed to consider

384
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,880
being close to you

385
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,840
would bring disaster.

386
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,840
Consort Shu

387
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,480
tried to make me provoke Their Majesties

388
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,120
but ended up humiliating herself

389
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,920
by retracting her accusations.

390
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,960
Truly a taste

391
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,240
of her own medicine.

392
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,440
When His Majesty

393
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
proposed making you a Talented Lady,

394
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,760
my heart nearly stopped.

395
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,560
Don't worry.

396
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,520
It's over now.

397
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,200
Once I gather evidence
and let Consort Shu

398
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,280
and her allies face justice,

399
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,280
I will request a decree

400
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,888
for our marriage.

401
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,320
Let you

402
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,960
become my wife.

403
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,320
Who wants to marry you?

404
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
I want to take you to see

405
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,960
my elder sister,

406
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
the Grand Princess.

407
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,080
In fact, she raised me herself.

408
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,840
Like you,

409
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,160
she's extraordinary.

410
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,960
She will like you.
