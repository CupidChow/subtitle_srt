00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:09,920
=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,303
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,912
(I, Lu Jiuning, Fear No One)

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,320
Miss Jiuning.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,240
This is where Xiao Zhuozi and I live.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,840
Xiao Luzi.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,040
What does Xiao Zhuozi

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,120
like?

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,200
Does he have any hobbies?

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,760
Speaking of hobbies,

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,840
he only cares about gardening.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,000
He's almost

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,440
obsessed with plants.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,360
Well, Xiao Zhuozi.

15
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:40,080
Tell me.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
You love gardening

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,000
and have exceptional skills
with balsam flowers.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,600
How did you let all the balsam flowers

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,240
die like this?

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,160
This one is dead, too.

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,840
I'll get a new one to replace this.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,560
(I'm Xiao Zhuozi
from the Yongxiu Palace.)

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,000
(This is a family letter)

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,040
(and my will.)

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,080
(I was coerced by Noble Consort Xian
of the Yongxiu Palace)

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,600
(and was doomed to die.)

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,520
(I have an impertinent request.)

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,520
(Whoever finds this letter,)

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,880
(please deliver my savings)

30
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,400
(to my younger brother)

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
(at Niujiazhuang Village ten li)

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
(away from the palace.)

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,600
(Your Highness.)

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,040
(Is this true?)

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
(I refuse to believe it.)

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,920
(I'm scared that you're related)

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,880
(to Wan'er's death.)

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,960
(You've been educating me)

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,000
(and offering me sisterly help.)

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,080
(Was all this an illusion?)

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,360
(If you're the mastermind)

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,640
(who used me to eliminate your rivals,)

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,520
(then you're truly dreadful.)

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,040
(Even you are so vicious.)

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,280
(Who else)

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
(is trustworthy in this world?)

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,440
Jiuning.

48
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,520
You look exhausted.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,600
Come sit here.

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,600
Let me massage you.

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,960
Sit down.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,160
That's very kind of you.

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
My pleasure.

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,320
Thank you, Yunxiang.

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,280
You're welcome.

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,680
I heard that Her Highness massages

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,000
the Empress Dowager

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
to relieve her neck pain.

59
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,280
That was how

60
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,000
the Empress Dowager got better.

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,400
You've served Her Highness for years

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,480
and learned many skills.

63
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,960
Of course.

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,280
I went with Her Highness

65
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
every single day.

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,880
I've learned her techniques.

67
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,160
Her Highness has worked hard

68
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,200
for three years without fail,

69
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,760
massaging the Empress Dowager.

70
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,560
Three whole years?

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,760
That's right.

72
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,440
The Empress Dowager
was moved by her sincerity.

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,160
No wonder
the Empress Dowager favors her.

74
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,400
She was utterly devoted.

75
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
Few could keep doing

76
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,840
the same thing

77
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,520
for three whole years.

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,080
But one day, she didn't go.

79
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
The Empress Dowager fainted

80
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
on her birthday.

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,640
Her Highness went to Eunuch Zhang,

82
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
probably to see His Majesty.

83
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,320
That was

84
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,560
the only day she missed.

85
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,360
You said that

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,960
after the Empress Dowager

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,720
fainted at the banquet,

88
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,840
Her Highness went to Eunuch Zhang

89
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,840
at the Imperial Study.

90
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,816
That's right.

91
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,080
(Imperial Study)
This concerns

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,000
the royal heir.

93
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,960
I'll report it once His Majesty

94
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,520
is done with business.

95
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,880
Please get up.

96
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,640
Yunxiang, could you be mistaken?

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,120
No way.

98
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
Because that day,

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,040
I was supposed to accompany her,

100
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,880
but my belly hurt a lot.

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,000
Yanqiu went in my place.

102
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,520
I remember clearly.

103
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,520
I can't be wrong.

104
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,400
Jiuning.

105
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
I have to go.

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
(No wonder His Majesty
never inquired about this matter.)

107
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,920
(Wan'er wasn't returned
to the Lijing Pavilion.)

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,840
(Because Eunuch Zhang)

109
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
(never reported Wan'er's pregnancy)

110
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,920
(to His Majesty.)

111
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,560
(Was Eunuch Zhang)

112
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,880
(following Noble Consort Xian's orders)

113
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,160
(and hiding it?)

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
(Then they killed Wan'er)

115
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,760
(in the Cold Palace.)

116
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:09,952
(Imperial Study)

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,640
Eunuch Zhang.

118
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,760
Miss Jiuning.

119
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,760
May I ask you

120
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
something?

121
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,640
You've been blocking my way
for three days.

122
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,080
What is this about?

123
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:32,736
Go ahead.

124
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
When my sister was sent

125
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,960
to the Cold Palace,

126
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,160
I begged you

127
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,040
to report her pregnancy to His Majesty.

128
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,600
In the end, did you

129
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,720
actually inform His Majesty?

130
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:46,120
Well.

131
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,280
That was unfortunate.

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,560
His Majesty was busy

133
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,720
with work

134
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,640
and wouldn't

135
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,640
even let me in the study.

136
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,480
The matter was delayed.

137
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,200
Then news came

138
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,480
that Talented Lady Wan

139
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,880
had committed suicide.

140
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,480
This...

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,080
This was beyond my control.

142
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,880
Still lying?

143
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm telling the truth.

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not lying.

145
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,880
That day,

146
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,480
you learned about this

147
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,840
and went to see
Noble Consort Xian first.

148
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
Am I wrong?

149
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,200
Must I report every visit

150
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,400
to a palace maid like you?

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
So you two colluded

152
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,240
to deceive His Majesty.

153
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,080
Lu Jiuning.

154
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,960
What's done is done.

155
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,440
Bury these words in your gut.

156
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,120
Further trouble benefits no one.

157
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,880
The one blocking the news

158
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,600
holds immense power.

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,320
Stay compliant, and you might survive.

160
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,600
Otherwise,

161
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,880
you'll die without knowing why.

162
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,120
I have come this far, fearing no one.

163
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,320
Just you wait.

164
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
One day,

165
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,560
I'll make that person pay.

166
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,080
All of you

167
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,440
will pay your blood debt.

168
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,200
Greetings, Your Highness.

169
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,880
Jiuning.

170
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,320
I heard you confronted

171
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,920
Eunuch Zhang today.

172
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:26,400
That's right.

173
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Eunuch Zhang

174
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,840
has confessed.

175
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,160
To what?

176
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,480
To his lies.

177
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,520
When Wan'er was sent to the Cold Palace,

178
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,280
I went to the Imperial Study,

179
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,120
hoping His Majesty
would release Wan'er for the sake

180
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,120
of the royal heir.

181
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,160
But Eunuch Zhang stopped me at the door.

182
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
He promised

183
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,280
to inform His Majesty

184
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,560
about the royal heir.

185
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,520
But he never did.

186
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,240
Today, he admitted

187
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,880
he was blocking me

188
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,560
under someone's orders,

189
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
preventing me from seeing

190
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,080
His Majesty.

191
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,160
Eunuch Zhang also said

192
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,240
that this person holds great power

193
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,520
and is not someone to be trifled with.

194
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,080
He warned me against

195
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,720
futile resistance.

196
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,200
But Your Highness,

197
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,000
however powerful that person may be,

198
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,000
I will expose the true culprit

199
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,960
to appease my sister's soul.

200
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,400
I'll make

201
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,520
that person pay the price.

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Jiuning.

203
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,560
Have you heard?

204
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
Rumor says that

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,720
Lord Ning has a daughter.

206
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,680
But Lord Ning is single.

207
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,640
Don't fall for

208
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,960
rumors so easily.

209
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,640
You didn't know?

210
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
He brought her to the palace
to see His Majesty.

211
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,120
Many people witnessed it.

212
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:05,600
Jiuning.

213
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:06,240
Look.

214
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,120
- Greetings, Lord Ning.
- Greetings, Lord Ning.

215
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,480
Greetings, Lord Ning.

216
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,600
Jiuning.

217
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,040
Is she "Sister Jiuning"
you often mention?

218
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,360
I'm Lu Jiuning.

219
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,400
What's your name?

220
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm Yuanyuan.

221
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,120
I've heard

222
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,160
about the rumors

223
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,360
saying that

224
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,400
Yuanyuan is my daughter.

225
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,600
But in fact,

226
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,320
I found her abandoned on the streets.

227
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,200
She was abducted

228
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,040
and fell ill.

229
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,320
I couldn't bear to see her die.

230
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
So I took her in to care for her.

231
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Sister Jiuning,

232
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,920
Lord Ning said you were unwell.

233
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,560
He's been worried about you.

234
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,160
Don't talk nonsense.

235
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
I thought Your Highness

236
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,600
wouldn't understand the hardships

237
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,840
of the common people.

238
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,360
I didn't expect

239
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,040
that you would be so righteous

240
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,200
and compassionate.

241
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,400
I got lost on a hunt with Father

242
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,280
when I was young.

243
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:23,968
Get up.

244
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,800
Pretty kids can sell

245
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,880
for a good price.

246
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,160
Behave.

247
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,840
The mark

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,120
won't ever come off.

249
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,520
I'll track you down

250
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,720
wherever you go.

251
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:50,112
He is of

252
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:51,280
royal blood.

253
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:53,560
I know.

254
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,200
Were you kidnapped

255
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,720
by human traffickers when you were

256
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,480
a child

257
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,960
and rescued by a little girl?

258
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
I knew you were the one

259
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,120
who saved me.

260
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,560
So you still remember.

261
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,680
They held you captive.

262
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,080
But your jade pendant

263
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,480
and fine robes

264
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,640
got you released.

265
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,640
That's why I remember you so well.

266
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,840
I recognized you when I first saw you

267
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,760
in the Imperial Garden.

268
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,280
Little maid,

269
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,760
do you confess?

270
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,440
I confess.

271
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,520
I've searched

272
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,040
everywhere for you

273
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,440
all these years.

274
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,520
Then we met in the palace.

275
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,160
Your facial features haven't changed.

276
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,920
But I dared not believe it.

277
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:50,048
Now, I've

278
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,760
finally found you.

279
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,240
I can finally repay your kindness.

280
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,240
Greetings, Lord Ning.

281
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,840
What's the rush?

282
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,160
Your Highness,

283
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,880
the Imperial Household Department

284
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,360
informed us that Eunuch Zhang

285
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,400
fell ill and died.

286
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
We must bury him now.

287
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,680
Go ahead.

288
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,240
Let's go.

289
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,120
Lord Ning.

290
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,440
I have things

291
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,280
to do.

292
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:25,160
Yanqiu.

293
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,120
My flowers.

294
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,000
Hurry. It's going to rain.

295
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,200
Hurry up, everyone.

296
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:30,080
Hurry.

297
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,160
Someone.

298
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,040
Hurry.

299
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:34,440
Your Highness.

300
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,320
Eunuch Zhang is dead.

301
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,240
Did you kill him?

302
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:41,080
How dare you?

303
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:41,800
Lu Jiuning.

304
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,240
How dare you repeatedly

305
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,520
offend Her Highness?

306
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Jiuning.

307
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,320
This is nonsense.

308
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,880
I only told Your Highness about

309
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,440
Eunuch Zhang's confession.

310
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,960
And he was silenced.

311
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,720
Your Highness, tell me.

312
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,360
Was it your doing?

313
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,480
I have

314
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
a clear conscience.

315
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,400
You are innocent?

316
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,040
Then why

317
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,120
did your loyal servant Xiao Zhuozi

318
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
attempt to kill Consort Shu?

319
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,160
You used me to take down

320
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,000
Consort Chun and wanted

321
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,280
to dominate the imperial harem.

322
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240
So you forced Xiao Zhuozi to do so.

323
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,840
Are you related

324
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
to Wan'er's death?

325
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,840
If you're innocent,

326
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,080
why did you silence Eunuch Zhang?

327
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,560
This was all your doing, wasn't it?

328
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,040
You've been

329
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,880
showing me kindness

330
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,440
to deceive me.

331
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,400
I was merely your pawn.

332
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,280
Am I right?

333
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,040
Your Highness,

334
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,200
you've really deceived me.

335
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,360
I thought you were genuinely kind to me.

336
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,120
I vowed

337
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,680
to stay faithfully

338
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,800
by your side,

339
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,400
serve you,

340
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,680
care for you,

341
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,720
and repay your kindness.

342
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,800
I thought you were a sister to me.

343
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,360
But what is the truth?

344
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,920
You liar.

345
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,200
This whole thing
is a carefully laid trap of yours.

346
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,880
Lu Jiuning.

347
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,760
I've spared you once.

348
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,480
If you dare spout madness again,

349
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,000
I will

350
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,000
cast you out of the Yongxiu Palace.

351
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,920
I've been nothing

352
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,480
but an expendable pawn to you.

353
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,200
I've served my purpose.

354
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
So I'm to be discarded.

355
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,080
Will Your Highness dispose of me

356
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,040
as you did to the others?

357
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,080
Outrageous!

358
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,080
It seems

359
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,560
I've spoiled you into insolence.

360
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,400
How dare you talk to me like this?

361
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,160
Lu Jiuning.

362
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,280
I don't need to

363
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,960
explain anything to you.

364
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,840
How dare you exploit my kindness

365
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,800
and throw those questions at me?

366
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,760
Hypocrite.

367
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,400
Viper.

368
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
I won't let you off.

369
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,640
Lu Jiuning has defied her superior.

370
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,160
She shall be stripped
of her position of overseer

371
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
and expelled.

372
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,360
Your Highness.

373
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,520
Jiuning acted rashly in passion.

374
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,760
Please show mercy.

375
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,120
Don't throw her out.

376
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,960
Whoever pleads for her

377
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,960
will also

378
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
be expelled.

379
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:38,816
Move.
