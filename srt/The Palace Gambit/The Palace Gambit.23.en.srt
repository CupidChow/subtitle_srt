=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,416
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,944
(Don't Blame Me for Pressuring You
with My Power)

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,072
Greetings, Your Highness.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,800
Jiuning,

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,800
long time no see.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,712
Your Highness,

8
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,280
I've missed you dearly.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,680
His Majesty worries about your health

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,560
and ordered the imperial kitchen
to prepare ginseng soup,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,720
sending me to deliver it.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,312
Please drink it now.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,080
During my absence,

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,400
have you been wronged?

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,200
Don't worry.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
I have been well.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,720
You...

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Make it sound so simple.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,440
Consort Shu is vicious

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,520
and stops at nothing.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,160
Her scheme this time

22
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:01,440
was truly vicious.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,360
She even dragged His Majesty into it,

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,480
using the Empress Dowager to kill you.

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,840
It was really dangerous.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,320
Luckily, I got your letter,

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,760
and rushed back in time.

28
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:13,280
I said before

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,000
that the day you return

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
would be when everything settles.

31
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:20,680
However,

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm now a maid
serving before His Majesty.

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,720
I cannot

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,720
attend to you as frequently anymore.

35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,280
You achieved the position

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,960
of imperial maid
through your own efforts.

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,080
It's truly remarkable.

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,920
But serving His Majesty is risky.

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,480
Be cautious in everything.

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,720
Yes.

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,720
I will keep it in mind.

42
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,232
What a shameless woman!

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,800
What a conniving Lu Jiuning!

44
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,720
What a scheming Noble Consort Xian!

45
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:57,600
These two harlots colluded
to put on a show for me!

46
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,960
Please calm down.

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,680
Please calm down.

48
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,792
How can I calm down?

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,400
They worked together

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,360
and made me dance like a dog

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,920
to their tune!

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,440
They pretended to fall out.

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,640
One left to investigate
my mother's family,

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,720
making my mother and brother
break with me.

55
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,440
The other checked water carts,

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,280
seizing a thousand taels of gold I had.

57
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,080
I stirred things up
with great efforts to make

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,560
the Empress Dowager act,

59
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,480
thought it was foolproof.

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,160
I never expected Noble Consort Xian

61
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,104
would hold this over me.

62
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:33,840
I've slapped my own face with this!

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,040
Now, I've lost everything.

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
All thanks to these two schemers!

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please calm down.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
Your Highness, Lu Jiuning now serves
before His Majesty.

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,016
Times have changed.

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,880
Why be afraid?

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
Why be afraid?

70
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,320
I still hold trump cards.

71
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,672
I'll make them beg for death!

72
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,880
They'll kneel at my feet

73
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,680
and plead for mercy.

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,600
Help me change clothes.

75
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm going to visit

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,080
the Grand Princess.

77
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

78
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,320
It's been days.

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,360
Are you feeling well?

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,760
(The Grand Princess)

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,520
Consort Shu,

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,400
you're here.

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,360
Bring her a seat.

84
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,560
I heard that recently,

85
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
you made quite a spectacle

86
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,280
before His Majesty,

87
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,480
causing him and the Empress Dowager

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,880
to lose faith in you.

89
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,640
If you came about this matter,

90
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,920
I'm afraid

91
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,520
I can't help you.

92
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,280
Your Highness, you joke.

93
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:49,120
I came today

94
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,520
for another thing.

95
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:56,200
You may all leave.

96
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,320
Then I'll speak plainly.

97
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
Your Highness, your leisurely days

98
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,760
may soon end.

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,160
Now, I've lost His Majesty's trust.

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,880
My misdeeds

101
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,280
will surely be exposed.

102
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,880
You'll be implicated too.

103
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,600
This concerns the dignity
of the royal family.

104
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Your Highness,

105
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
you must think carefully.

106
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:27,840
What

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,320
do they mean?

108
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,520
You look perplexed.

109
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,440
Then ask your dear brother

110
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,440
Yun Mi properly.

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,840
He's now taking his beloved maid

112
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,480
outside the palace

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,760
to investigate my business ventures.

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,760
We're tied together on the same rope.

115
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
If they bring this matter
before His Majesty,

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,304
and if His Majesty learns

117
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:56,600
that you,

118
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,136
his own aunt is involved

119
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,120
in human trafficking,

120
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,600
what do you think

121
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,000
His Majesty will do?

122
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:12,760
(Imperial Study)

123
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,360
Lord Ning?

124
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:16,440
Here to see His Majesty?

125
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,656
His Majesty is in poor mood today.

126
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,520
Be cautious.

127
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,360
I'm here for you.

128
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:23,800
For me?

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,280
What's it?

130
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:27,880
The Grand Princess invited me to her palace.

131
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:29,240
Come with me.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
I should decline.

133
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
With my humble origins,

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
I mustn't overstep.

135
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,672
Nor do I wish...

136
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,240
I know.

137
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,648
You refuse to cling to power

138
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:41,120
or be bound by the throne.

139
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:44,520
You cherish living freely.

140
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,920
The Grand Princess ordered me
to bring you.

141
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,680
She heard of you and wants to meet.

142
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,000
She actually

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,960
dotes on me.

144
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:53,040
Whatever I wish to do,

145
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,040
she supports it.

146
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
Just meet her,

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,800
alright?

148
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,360
Greetings, Your Highness.

149
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:03,640
Blessings to you.

150
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,800
Rise.

151
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,560
Thank you.

152
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,560
Sister,

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,680
this is

154
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:11,800
the remarkable woman
I've often mentioned,

155
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:12,520
Lu Jiuning.

156
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,320
Miss Jiuning truly possesses
extraordinary grace.

157
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,760
No wonder my brother
speaks of you constantly.

158
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:19,840
You flattered me.

159
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:22,440
You're the truly extraordinary one.

160
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,480
To witness your majesty today

161
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:26,920
is my great fortune.

162
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:30,520
Your taste is impeccable.

163
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:31,480
Sister,

164
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,000
you haven't offered us seats.

165
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,200
Sit, then.

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,760
Thank you.

167
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,600
Jiuning,

168
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,680
I've learned from my brother

169
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,040
that you've endured hardships
since childhood.

170
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:51,840
To rise to your position now

171
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,160
as an imperial handmaid

172
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
is no small feat.

173
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,160
Your Highness,

174
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,680
I

175
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,720
simply wish
for an ordinary, stable life.

176
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,592
Becoming an imperial handmaid

177
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,480
was accidental.

178
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,600
I see my brother cares for you deeply.

179
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm not one to obsess
over status or background.

180
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:13,760
If you both share true affection,

181
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,480
I'll gladly seek

182
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,760
the Empress Dowager's marriage decree.

183
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:21,920
However,

184
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,000
there's one condition

185
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:25,440
I want you to agree to.

186
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,360
Everyone out.

187
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,840
Stop investigating
the human trafficking case

188
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,200
Yun Mi is on.

189
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,120
Your Highness,

190
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,760
my sister and I
were trafficked as children,

191
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,560
and got humiliated.

192
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,320
Now, we found Consort Shu

193
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,080
colluded with officials

194
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
to traffic people

195
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
and harm women and kids.

196
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,760
Such crimes

197
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,240
mustn't go unpunished.

198
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,120
Outrageous!

199
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,064
This case involves too many people.

200
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,240
Its implications run deep.

201
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:16,040
Servant trade

202
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,400
has always been
under local authorities' supervision.

203
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,200
How many servants

204
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,200
don't suffer hardships and toil?

205
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,520
You can't assume
everyone is being harmed

206
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,800
simply because

207
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,880
you've endured suffering yourself.

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,920
I

209
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,000
can only express sympathy
for your plight,

210
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,040
but you must cease immediately

211
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,640
your investigation into the case.

212
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,560
I must return to my duties.

213
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,640
Your Highness,

214
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,320
Lord Ning,

215
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,120
I'll take my leave now.

216
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:47,360
Yun Mi,

217
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,520
stop!

218
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,800
If you keep investigating,

219
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
you would disregard our sibling bond.

220
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:54,200
Would you

221
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,400
also disregard
the royal family's dignity?

222
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,016
For a mere maid,

223
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,440
you'd expose imperial consorts,

224
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,696
involving in major cases.

225
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:03,600
Would you have

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,680
the royal family
and His Majesty become laughingstocks?

227
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,120
Sister,

228
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,840
could it be

229
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,400
you and Consort Shu

230
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,312
are also implicated?

231
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,320
I never imagined

232
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,272
that all my investigations

233
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,360
lead to my own sister.

234
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:22,400
You may create turmoil

235
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:23,400
and expose truth.

236
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:25,400
But do you truly believe

237
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,360
His Majesty would publicize this

238
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,280
for public condemnation?

239
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
His Majesty's wrath

240
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,280
will reach far.

241
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,960
Heed my counsel,

242
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,064
and abandon the investigation.

243
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:42,960
Yun Mi,

244
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,960
those insignificant people

245
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,600
are inconsequential.

246
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,280
I urge you to withdraw

247
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,760
for your own good.

248
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,648
Sister,

249
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,080
it seems you've made your choice.

250
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,920
If you cease your efforts,

251
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
you and Jiuning would remain safe.

252
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,600
If you persist in rocking the heavens,

253
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,720
do you think

254
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
she'll survive?

255
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:04,960
Sister,

256
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,640
Jiuning fears no death.

257
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,840
Or she wouldn't have come so far.

258
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:10,760
You don't know her.

259
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,440
Die speaking,

260
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:13,560
not live silent.

261
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,680
A commoner like her

262
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
grasps this truth,

263
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,480
yet nobles like us

264
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,160
feign ignorance.

265
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,680
I believe

266
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,520
His Majesty is wise

267
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,320
and understands a stable realm

268
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,496
begins with the people.

269
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,280
To exploit them for personal gain

270
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,680
is like cutting flesh to feed,

271
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
belly fills but body perishes.

272
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,320
Yun Mi.

273
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Where's Lu Jiuning?

274
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,000
Your Majesty,

275
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,680
Miss Jiuning was summoned by Lord Ning.

276
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,640
She's my maid.

277
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:57,280
Why would Lord Ning summon her?

278
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:59,760
It seems the Grand Princess

279
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,480
requested to meet Jiuning.

280
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:15,392
Your Majesty.

281
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,016
Jiuning,

282
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,000
can't you see His Majesty's tea
has gone cold?

283
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
Fetch a fresh cup immediately!

284
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:27,240
Yes.

285
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,288
Your Majesty.

286
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:45,920
So hot?

287
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,200
Forgive me.

288
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,280
I was careless.

289
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,080
I'll bring another cup at once.

290
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,000
Your Majesty,

291
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,280
Miss Jiuning is new to imperial service.

292
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,360
She may need time to adapt.

293
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:13,800
Your Majesty.

294
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,680
Have I not made clear

295
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,320
I only drink pre-rain Longjing?

296
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,240
Understood.

297
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,840
I'll replace it
with pre-rain Longjing immediately.

298
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
(What's with His Majesty today?)

299
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,080
(He's never been
this particular before.)

300
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,360
He's in poor spirits.

301
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:02,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

302
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,872
Rise.

303
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,280
Jiuning,

304
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,040
have you thought over what I told you

305
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:09,040
the other day?

306
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:12,440
For Lord Ning's sake, I implore you

307
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,480
to stop this.

308
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't side with Consort Shu

309
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,880
any longer.

310
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,000
You really don't know
what's good for you.

311
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:19,680
Do you truly believe

312
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,080
the imperial threshold

313
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:22,336
is so easily crossed?

314
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,000
Your Highness,

315
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,760
Consort Shu harms the people,

316
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,840
trampling on lives.

317
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,880
She'll pay for that.

318
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,960
You should abandon

319
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
this misguided path.

320
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,160
Stop!

321
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,800
Jiuning.

322
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,640
For Yun Mi's sake,

323
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,920
if this continues,

324
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
it will bring him no good.

325
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,480
I know

326
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
he values your counsel.

327
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,160
Persuade him for me.

328
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:43,776
He's my only brother.

329
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,520
I cannot watch him fall.

330
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:46,760
Jiuning,

331
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:48,120
help me.

332
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,152
I

333
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,360
shall personally arrange your marriage.

334
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm afraid

335
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,360
I can't help.

336
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:54,840
Jiuning,

337
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,920
I've sworn to Yun Mi

338
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,800
to never again shield Consort Shu.

339
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,640
He's done so much for you

340
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,280
and rescued countless
trafficking victims.

341
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,440
Enough is enough.

342
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,280
Jiuning,

343
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,560
both of you must stop.

344
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:07,400
Afterward,

345
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
we'll become family.

346
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,200
Let's live peacefully together.

347
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,040
Isn't that nice?

348
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,360
You should know

349
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
His Highness was abducted

350
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,880
as a child,

351
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
and nearly died.

352
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:18,960
You know his nature.

353
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,400
He's pursuing this case

354
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,960
out of compassion for the people

355
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,920
and mercy

356
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,120
for the suffering.

357
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,960
I advise you

358
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,520
to abandon efforts to stop him.

359
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,480
Lu Jiuning!

360
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Who do you think you are?

361
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:34,720
You're just a lowly maid.

362
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm the Grand Princess.

363
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,680
I've humbled myself before you,

364
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
yet you remain obstinate!

365
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,080
Know your place!

366
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:43,760
If you reject my mercy,

367
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,560
don't blame me

368
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,920
for pressuring you with my power

369
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,840
and taking your life.

370
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,840
I've survived this long

371
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,400
by fearing neither death nor tyrants.

372
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,640
Since you choose this path,

373
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,600
then I'll hold

374
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,760
nothing back.

375
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,720
Lu Jiuning!

376
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,000
(Wan'er,)

377
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,896
(after you left,)

378
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:36,000
(I vowed to hunt down your murderers)

379
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:38,200
(and make them pay in blood.)

380
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,880
(Now, the Grand Princess wields power)

381
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,320
(and uses my bond with Lord Ning
to manipulate me.)

382
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,104
(Pathetic.)

383
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,360
(The path I've walked)

384
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,640
(permits no redemption.)

385
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:56,120
(I'll never forget your unjust death.)

386
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,960
(We could have)

387
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
(lived simple lives.)

388
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,600
(Our greatest wish)

389
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,800
(wasn't wealth)

390
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,840
(nor luxury.)

391
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,840
(We just want a warm porridge at dawn)

392
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,600
(and waiting arms at dusk.)

393
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,280
(Wan'er,)

394
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,400
(if I spare them,)

395
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,200
(countless mothers)

396
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,200
(and children)

397
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
(will suffer trafficking,)

398
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,040
(families torn apart.)

399
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,440
(Knowing this,)

400
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,320
(my bond with Lord Ning)

401
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,880
(means little.)

402
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,304
(A good match is hard to find.)

403
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,560
(But I)

404
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,400
(don't need it anyway.)
