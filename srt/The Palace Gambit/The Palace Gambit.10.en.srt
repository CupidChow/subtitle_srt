=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,384
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,880
(My Fate Is in My Own Hands)

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,400
Stop right there!

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,680
Noble Consort Xian.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Forgive me,

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,800
but I don't know what I did

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,960
to anger Consort Chun so gravely

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,320
that she demands my hands chopped.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,360
I'm innocent!

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,440
I beg Your Highness to save me.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,240
Your Highness,

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,080
why would a mere convict maid

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,400
deserve your personal attention?

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,880
Consort Chun.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,040
What offense did this maid commit?

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,640
I've been cultivating orchids
for His Majesty.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,600
The fertilizer from Hard-Labor Ward

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,800
caused the leaves to wither.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,440
I came

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,760
to take Lu Jiuning

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,080
back to Yongxiu Palace to salvage them.

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,000
Unless she's committed serious crimes,

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,320
you shouldn't disable her, Consort Chun.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,240
Lest people say

26
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,160
you abuse palace staff.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,120
Release her!

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,400
Noble Consort Xian,

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
the fertilizer

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,080
is my fault.

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
I'll immediately

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,280
prepare new fertilizer for you.

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,160
Come with me.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,640
Yes.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,808
Come.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,080
(Consort Chun,)

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,600
(turns out)

38
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,200
(you're this desperate to eliminate me?)

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,600
(Lady Yu was right about you.)

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
(Your involvement in Wan'er's death)

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
(is undeniable.)

42
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:23,104
(Yongxiu Palace)

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
I've sinned.

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,560
Please punish me, Your Highness.

45
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
What did you do?

46
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:37,240
(Yanqiu, Chief Maid)

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,320
(Yunxiang, Chief Maid)
Yanqiu came to Hard-Labor Ward

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,200
requesting orchid fertilizer.

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,920
I took it upon myself

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,560
to add bean cake residue
to your fertilizer,

51
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,600
causing mole cricket disease.

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
So you mean

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,200
you lured me to Hard-Labor Ward

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,040
and used me

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,640
to rescue you from Consort Chun?

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,080
I anticipated

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,080
Consort Chun's outburst

58
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,880
and I knew Your Highness

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,840
values flowers above all.

60
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,600
Thus

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,640
I sabotaged your fertilizer,

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
forcing you to intervene

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
to save both orchids and me.

64
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
I manipulated Your Highness

65
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,200
to save myself.

66
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,920
I know my guilt.

67
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,200
I dare not lie.

68
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,760
Please punish me.

69
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,080
What insolence!

70
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,160
I know I was wrong.

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,440
I accept punishment.

72
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,040
Yanqiu.

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Fetch her an umbrella.

74
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,680
Yes.

75
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,080
Who do you think you are, little maid,

76
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,640
to scheme against me?

77
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,120
But given your desperation,

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,640
I'll forgive you this once.

79
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Because of you,

80
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,400
Her Highness antagonizes
Consort Chun further.

81
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,560
Show gratitude!

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
My deepest thanks.

83
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:06,800
Rise.

84
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
If the jade orchid dies,

85
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,280
I

86
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,000
shall charge you severely.

87
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Rest assured,

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,200
bean residue won't kill it.

89
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,640
I can save it.

90
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,080
You'd better.

91
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,440
Should I fail,

92
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,680
I'll pay with my life.

93
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
I'll begin at once.

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,040
Take the umbrella.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Thank you.

96
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,880
Make haste.

97
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,960
This maid

98
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,040
shows boldness and wit.

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
Reminds me of my younger self.

100
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,320
Full of passion

101
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
and unflinching resolve.

102
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,960
Now

103
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,400
after years in these palace walls,

104
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,720
(Yongxiu Palace)
my edges have been worn.

105
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,520
Seeing her

106
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,720
is like seeing my younger self again.

107
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,880
But Your Highness,

108
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,560
she's so reckless and bold,

109
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,720
full of cunning schemes.

110
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,640
If you keep indulging her,

111
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,240
will she bring disaster upon us?

112
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
Unyielding

113
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,600
yet fiercely loyal.

114
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,720
Such genuine devotion

115
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,880
is rare treasure in this palace.

116
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,040
Let her stay at Yongxiu Palace.

117
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,680
Discipline her.

118
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,440
I believe

119
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,520
she

120
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,360
won't disappoint me.

121
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

122
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,400
When mole crickets gnaw roots,

123
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,080
leaves wilt first before stems rot.

124
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,080
If commoners find these pests in fields,

125
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,160
just boil chinaberry bark

126
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,120
to drench the roots.

127
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,240
Within three days,

128
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,720
plants will fully recover.

129
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,480
That's reassuring.

130
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,360
I'll present this jade orchid
to His Majesty soon.

131
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,360
Tend it meticulously these coming days.

132
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,920
Yunxiang,

134
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,200
take charge of the greenhouse.

135
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,600
Yes, Your Highness.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,040
I'll care for the jade orchid
with utmost diligence.

137
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,920
Jiuning, you're so knowledgeable!

138
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,920
Indeed.

139
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,200
Even Xiao Zhuozi, our flower expert,

140
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,800
didn't notice the rotten roots.

141
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,640
This orchid's meant for His Majesty.

142
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,920
You've all been so cautious,

143
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,200
even with the soil,

144
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,600
so you wouldn't know.

145
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,080
You troublemaker.

146
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,240
The infestation

147
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,280
happened because of her!

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Yet you praise her?

149
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,400
Since when do you side with outsiders?

150
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,760
Her Highness ordered me

151
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,520
to oversee this.

152
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,880
Go sweep outside.

153
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,400
You aren't needed here.

154
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,640
Yunxiang,

155
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,600
we all serve Her Highness.

156
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,200
Jiuning will mend her ways.

157
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,560
She schemed against Her Highness
and nearly doomed us all!

158
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Have you forgotten so soon?

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,160
If she tampers with
the greenhouse again,

160
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,280
I can't take the fall!

161
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
From this day,

162
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
all of you must ensure

163
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
she stays out of the greenhouse.

164
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,160
Not a single step near the jade orchid.

165
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,720
Any mishap would doom us all

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
and implicate Her Highness.

167
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

168
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,712
(Yongxiu Palace)

169
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,280
Jiuning.

170
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,120
Greetings, Lord Ning.

171
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,360
I heard

172
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,600
you destroyed
Noble Consort Xian's orchid,

173
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,640
and

174
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,520
almost got

175
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,000
your hands chopped off

176
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,000
by Consort Chun.

177
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,040
You keep risking your life.

178
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,760
Should I call you lucky or blessed?

179
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,640
You jest, Lord Ning.

180
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,760
I don't wish to court danger either.

181
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,480
At first I thought you were merely bold,

182
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
but you dare anything

183
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,320
beyond imagination.

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
Ruthless enough to use anyone.

185
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,840
Speaking of which,

186
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,000
about that time you used me

187
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,800
to deliver the portrait,

188
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,440
how do you plan

189
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
to repay this favor?

190
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,640
Stop teasing, Lord Ning.

191
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,280
I wasn't using you.

192
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,680
You saw my desperation,

193
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,520
stepped forward,

194
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,664
and offered help.

195
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,848
Even now,

196
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,240
hearing I damaged
Noble Consort Xian's orchid,

197
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,840
you kindly sent this new plant

198
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,640
to spare me punishment.

199
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,440
That's so noble of you.

200
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
My gratitude, Lord Ning.

201
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,440
This Golden Hairpin Orchid

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,040
was specially acquired for my enjoyment.

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,520
A prized variety,

204
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
leaves like swords,

205
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,440
blooms as hairpins.

206
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,200
Then Your Highness
should admire it properly.

207
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,600
Why are you carrying it
to Yongxiu Palace?

208
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,640
Your Highness,

209
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,920
you rushed

210
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,600
to Dowager Consort's palace to get this

211
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,080
after you learned Ms. Lu

212
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,240
destroyed Noble Consort Xian's orchids.

213
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,320
Although

214
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,440
you're now serving at Yongxiu Palace,

215
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,840
you've already

216
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
become Consort Chun's sworn enemy.

217
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
Consort Chun holds immense power.

218
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,440
Her family's military achievements

219
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,360
have earned His Majesty's trust.

220
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,600
She's not someone you can topple

221
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,800
with petty tricks

222
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,520
or minor leverage.

223
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,320
Thank you for the reminder.

224
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,400
It seems you know a lot about
how to stay alive in here.

225
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,760
But my fate is in my own hands.

226
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,680
I don't believe power can eliminate

227
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,080
all of us normal people.

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
Now that you're in the eye of the storm,

229
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,440
you must be cautious from now on.

230
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
Your Highness.

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,720
Your Highness?

232
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,880
Your Highness?

233
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,400
Your Highness!

234
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,880
Has Miss Jiuning put some spell on you?

235
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
Why do you act so strangely around her?

236
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm not under spell.

237
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,080
It's just that

238
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,400
I truly

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,400
admire her.

240
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,200
Her fearless spirit

241
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,600
and defiance of conventions

242
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,240
are unlike anything I've ever seen.

243
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,960
Before,

244
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,440
I underestimated her.

245
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,120
Why can't I see these supposed virtues?

246
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,800
(Imperial Study)

247
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,280
Your Majesty's stroke
grows more vigorous.

248
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,400
I've recently copied scriptures,

249
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,440
thinking of presenting them
to Empress Dowager

250
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,600
upon her return.

251
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,120
Speaking of Her Majesty,

252
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,800
it reminds me of
Talented Lady Wan's tragedy

253
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,520
after the birthday banquet.

254
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,720
That day, Talented Lady Wan's present

255
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,600
should've been sleeping sachets,

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,840
but turned out to be
spirit money instead.

257
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,000
Talented Lady Wan was gentle

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,280
and meticulous in her duties.

259
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,120
She'd never curse Her Majesty.

260
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,880
Your Majesty speaks wisely.

261
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,520
The incident was

262
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,840
truly suspicious.

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,200
Yet Consort Chun

264
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,960
accused Talented Lady Wan of disrespect

265
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,800
and confined her to Cold Palace.

266
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,040
Then came news of her suicide.

267
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
It's deeply unsettling.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,480
Consort Chun's family
defends the borders

269
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,680
and had just won.

270
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
To maintain their morale,

271
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,000
I couldn't pursue this matter.

272
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,720
Understood.

273
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,320
Your Majesty's truly thoughtful.

274
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,280
Your Majesty,

275
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,880
Consort Chun brings loquat syrup.

276
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,080
Send her in.

277
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,880
At once.

278
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,800
Your Majesty.

279
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,960
Rise.

280
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,600
I heard of Your Majesty's cough,

281
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,880
so I prepared loquat syrup

282
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,520
to soothe your throat.

283
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,040
That's very thoughtful.

284
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,320
Your Majesty,

285
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
I made this just for you.

286
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,560
It should be taken warm,

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,560
lest it turns cold.

288
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Your Majesty,

289
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,680
I must tend to my orchids

290
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,560
and take my leave now.

291
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,240
Go ahead.

292
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,920
Your Highness.

293
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,440
I've heard

294
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,880
you cultivated precious jade orchid

295
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,320
and gifted it to His Majesty.

296
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,120
Pleased by this,

297
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,760
His Majesty bestowed rare flowers

298
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,680
including a unique

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
Yaohuang peony,

300
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,440
called 'Golden Thread Crown.'

301
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,400
Indeed.

302
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,080
His Majesty's so thoughtful.

303
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,840
I'm truly envious.

304
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
The Yaohuang peony

305
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,400
is the realm's treasure.

306
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,560
The only one specimen

307
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,280
was gifted to Noble Consort Xian.

308
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,520
If I come across a finer specimen,

309
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
I shall gift it to you.

310
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,720
Thank you.

311
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,760
However, this flower
is exceedingly rare.

312
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,760
Your Majesty, how about this?

313
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
Her Majesty will return from
the mountain retreat in a few days.

314
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,880
Let us take this opportunity

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,240
to host a flower banquet
at Yongxiu Palace.

316
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,160
Splendid idea.

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,040
The palace has lacked
such festivity for too long.

318
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,200
I will

319
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,560
leave it to you.

320
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,880
All shall attend to admire
the blossoms then.

321
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Understood.

322
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,120
I will devote utmost care
to this banquet.

323
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,040
Now I'll take my leave.

324
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
(Noble Consort Xian,)

325
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,400
(a flawless banquet is merely expected.)

326
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
(But any mishap)

327
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
(shall become your doom.)

328
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,160
Place it here.

329
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,840
Gently.

330
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,760
Set it down here.

331
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,640
Give it here.

332
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,760
Careful!

333
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,000
Polish this area thoroughly.

334
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,920
Slow and careful!

335
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,200
I've put it here.

336
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,800
Hmm.

337
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,120
Your Highness.

338
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,280
Peonies in tender spring air

339
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,800
pale before the golden bloom.

340
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,360
I have heard

341
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,240
commoners once queued with coins

342
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320
just to glimpse the Yaohuang peony.

343
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Now seeing it myself,

344
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,000
it truly is the king of flowers.

345
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,920
A peerless rarity indeed!

346
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,120
Your Highness,

347
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
this is the only one specimen,

348
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,840
truly priceless.

349
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,160
His Majesty gifted it to you

350
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,640
because he favors you much.

351
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,520
Moreover, His Majesty ordered
Imperial Household Department

352
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,600
to deliver other blossoms

353
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,000
to add to the splendor.

354
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,360
His Majesty entrusted me
to host this event

355
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,520
for the ladies to marvel at this wonder.

356
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,760
We shall need your assistance.

357
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,880
This...

358
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

359
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
I shall greet the Empress Dowager.

360
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,680
Yunxiang will be in charge here.

361
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,880
Execute your duties meticulously.

362
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Not a single error will be tolerated.

363
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

364
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,720
We bid Your Highness farewell.

365
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,120
Eunuch Liu, this way please.

366
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,520
Very well.

367
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,160
Low-born wretches
truly can't keep favor.

368
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,880
Tsk!

369
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,960
We might all be implicated
in their downfall!

370
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,760
(Xiao Fuhai?)

371
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,520
I've warned you to

372
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,040
stay away from the greenhouse.

373
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,120
What do you want?

374
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,920
If our banquet fails,

375
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,040
we'll all be doomed.

376
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,040
Now scram!

377
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,672
Indeed.

378
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,960
Your Highness.

379
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,760
All done?

380
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,120
Yes,

381
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,560
I've bought a minor eunuch.

382
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,640
He'll mix alum stones

383
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
into all flowerpots.

384
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,880
When watered,

385
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,320
the alum will react,

386
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,760
triggering a scorching boil

387
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,320
that destroys all blooms.

388
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,680
Excellent.

389
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,400
Damaging the Yaohuang peony

390
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,880
and ruining the banquet

391
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
will bring the entire
Yongxiu Palace down.

392
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,800
That maid Lu Jiuning

393
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,200
won't escape either.

394
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Your Highness is right.

395
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,000
That Lu Jiuning

396
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,680
thinks she's untouchable

397
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,440
in Yongxiu Palace

398
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,200
with Noble Consort Xian's favor.

399
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,840
But

400
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,080
today is the day she dies.
