00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:10,080
=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,416
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,944
(Favored Consort? Really)

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,560
I never expected

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,608
Lord Ning would actually defend

6
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:22,680
a powerless little palace maid.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
I've sorely underestimated her.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,760
Now, it seems

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,760
getting rid of her

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,280
will require careful planning.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
She knows the truth now.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,680
If Lord Ning supports her,

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,680
I fear

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,000
it may endanger you.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Why be afraid?

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,560
Lady Yu is dead.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,000
Consort Chun is imprisoned.

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,400
Even Eunuch Zhang is dead.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,800
Let them try to accuse
me before His Majesty.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,760
No evidence.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,720
What's there to be afraid of?

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,120
Thank you for saving me, Lord Ning.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,680
Consort Shu has confessed

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,120
that she murdered my sister.

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,160
At last,

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,600
I've found the true culprit.

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,160
Jiuning,

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,120
you sought her justice

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
at great peril.

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,760
She can finally rest in peace.

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,960
Not yet.

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Consort Shu is vicious and cunning.

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,120
She destroys innocent lives
to gain power.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,320
Wan'er died

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,920
for no reason.

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,360
I'll make her pay with her life.

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,040
Her crimes are unforgivable.

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,920
My investigation confirms

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,360
the one collaborating

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,280
with traffickers

41
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,440
for human smuggling

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,680
is Consort Shu.

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,960
She's amassed vast wealth from this.

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,600
You mean

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,160
Consort Shu controls the traffickers

46
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,840
who abduct people?

47
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,080
If not for those traffickers,

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,520
Wan'er and I had never been
torn from our families.

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,200
We

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
wouldn't have endured
such hardship since childhood.

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,400
Wan'er

52
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,800
wouldn't have ended up in the palace

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,120
and met such a cruel fate.

54
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,440
(When I was seven,)

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,920
(traffickers)

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,840
(snatched me from my parents)

57
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,160
(and locked me in that temple.)

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,624
Don't!

59
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,648
Don't!

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,160
(But there,)

61
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,280
(I met Song Wan'er.)

62
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,640
Is your hand okay?

63
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:49,000
It's fine.

64
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,880
(A year older than me.)

65
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,080
Eat quickly.

66
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,920
(From then on,)

67
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,120
(we became each other's only refuge)

68
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,160
(and sisters surviving together.)

69
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,096
Don't!

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,920
(When I was 14, we were sold
to Chen's Mansion as servants.)

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
(Old Chen was a drunken gambler)

72
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,760
(who beat and cursed us daily.)

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,160
(We starved more than we ate,)

74
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
(living worse than dogs.)

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
(My sister's beauty)

76
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,912
(became)

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,440
(her greatest curse.)

78
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,640
Wait.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,880
Don't leave.

80
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,520
Let me see you.

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,160
Stop this.

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,560
Stop this!

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,000
Wretch!

84
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,128
How dare you seduce my husband!

85
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:40,840
(Old Chen)

86
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,400
(repeatedly assaulted Wan'er,)

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,160
(but Madam Chen vented her fury)

88
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,880
(on both of us.)

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,680
(To eliminate threats,)

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,960
(she immediately)

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
(sold us to the Imperial Music Bureau.)

92
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,680
(There,)

93
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,240
(we outshone all others.)

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,440
(Forced to master arts and music,)

95
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,320
(we danced exquisitely)

96
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,560
(and wore splendid silks.)

97
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,800
(But no costume)

98
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,920
(could hide our slave status.)

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,320
(We were just)

100
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,080
(prized commodities.)

101
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,720
(Later,)

102
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,040
(a capital official
took an interest in us.)

103
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,320
(As easily as purchasing
two fine porcelain pieces,)

104
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,520
(he)

105
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,080
(purchased us.)

106
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,600
(One year later,)

107
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,240
(Lijing Pavilion)
(to curry favor with His Majesty,)

108
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,160
(we were sent to the palace)

109
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,880
(behind high walls.)

110
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Consort Shu's crimes are monstrous.

111
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,200
She deserves

112
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,840
to be cut into pieces

113
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,520
and torn apart!

114
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,600
We must uproot Consort Shu

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
and her trafficking ring

116
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,440
completely.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,880
We'll rescue all

118
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,640
they've traded and enslaved.

119
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,240
Together,

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,160
we'll bring her to justice.

121
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,000
(But mere execution)

122
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
(is too merciful.)

123
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,840
(I won't grant her quick death.)

124
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
(I'll make her suffer slowly.)

125
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,480
(Watch her writhe in agony,)

126
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:10,840
(longing for death.)

127
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,640
(Make her atone)

128
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,760
(for her sins.)

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
(Lijing Pavilion)

130
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,720
Why isn't she back yet?

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
Your Highness, don't worry.

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,280
Jiuning.

133
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,120
Greetings, Lord Ning.

134
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,840
What happened?

135
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,600
Go!

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,560
Bruise ointment!

137
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,560
Yes.

138
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,520
Jiuning,

139
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,760
you should return to rest early.

140
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,280
Don't catch a cold.

141
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,680
Wait here for me.

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,720
Yes.

143
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,280
Noble Consort Xian

144
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,200
delivered

145
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,640
a letter to me yesterday,

146
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,280
insisting I hand it to you.

147
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,200
But I was riding

148
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,240
with His Majesty,

149
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,760
hence the delay.

150
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,560
Could it be

151
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,000
that her departure

152
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,760
was your staged performance?

153
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
Eunuch Zhang mentioned

154
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,680
his backer

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
held immense power.

156
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,680
But you know.

157
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,200
I'll make her

158
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,360
pay

159
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,240
for her atrocities.

160
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,480
Innocence proves itself.

161
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,640
Though you suspect me,

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,080
truth remains unchanged.

163
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,320
No.

164
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,440
I believe you.

165
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,000
Though Xiao Zhuozi's suicide note

166
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,520
points to your involvement,

167
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,320
I can think for myself.

168
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,600
After my sister's passing,

169
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,280
in this imperial harem,

170
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,280
you've been my only true kindness.

171
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,720
From my palace arrival
to entering the Yongxiu Palace,

172
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,680
you've guided me

173
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,040
and advised me.

174
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
In my heart,

175
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,520
you've long been

176
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,400
my blood sister.

177
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,080
I've always known

178
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,360
your true nature deep down.

179
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,400
Your Highness,

180
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,520
I know you're innocent
of these accusations.

181
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,800
But,

182
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,320
why won't you

183
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,400
share your true thoughts with me?

184
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,760
Xiao Zhuozi's brother

185
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,520
was saved by Consort Shu.

186
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
She used

187
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,680
his debt of gratitude

188
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,040
to let him frame me.

189
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,240
I knew her scheme.

190
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
This framing

191
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,080
aims to turn us

192
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,240
against each other.

193
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,960
If I react,

194
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,320
we'd only

195
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,640
fall into her trap.

196
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,280
So that's it.

197
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,840
But one thing

198
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,200
surprised me.

199
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,160
You've proven

200
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
wiser than I anticipated.

201
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,560
Since

202
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,040
she schemes to divide us,

203
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,640
why don't we turn

204
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,680
her plot against her?

205
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,800
I pretended to test Eunuch Zhang.

206
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,800
Consort Shu immediately
silenced him by killing him

207
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,520
and then framed Noble Consort Xian.

208
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
Luckily, we had already cleared up

209
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,480
the misunderstanding.

210
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,800
Eunuch Zhang

211
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,040
was secretly rescued

212
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,800
by Noble Consort Xian.

213
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,040
So,

214
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,760
her departure

215
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,520
was actually

216
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,040
to safely relocate Eunuch Zhang

217
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,400
as a key witness.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,480
Exactly.

219
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,160
Moreover,

220
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,840
Her Highness's departure

221
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,160
served another crucial purpose.

222
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,440
What was it?

223
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,200
Come.

224
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,880
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

225
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,560
Cheers.

226
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,720
Cheers.

227
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,640
Only our Imperial Uncle
could afford this.

228
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,320
This banquet spread

229
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,080
cost a full 50 taels of silver.

230
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,320
(Jiang Wenbin, Consort Shu's brother)
Come on.

231
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,600
Mr. Jiang's sister

232
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,040
is Consort Shu!

233
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,880
A mere 50 taels.

234
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,000
A drop in the bucket.

235
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,320
This feast must have cost you dearly.

236
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
No need for formalities.

237
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,400
Honor weighs heavier than Mount Tai,

238
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,120
material desires lighter
than goose down.

239
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,560
Money

240
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,840
is but dung.

241
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,080
Filth.

242
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,040
Filth.

243
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,880
Filth.

244
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,280
Filth.

245
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm a man of integrity.

246
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,760
How could I be tainted by filthy lucre?

247
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,440
Right?

248
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,640
Right?

249
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,560
That makes sense.

250
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,320
That makes sense.

251
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,080
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

252
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,720
Another round.

253
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:39,760
You there.

254
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:42,040
Why do you barge in

255
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,240
so rudely?

256
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
I just heard

257
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,680
you claimed moral purity

258
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,040
and scorned money as filth.

259
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,560
Though my sister is the favored consort

260
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,640
and His Majesty's rewards are generous,

261
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,480
I'm a scholar

262
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,400
who disdains material possessions.

263
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,760
Exactly.

264
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
Hosting friends modestly

265
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,320
for their enjoyment

266
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,560
is worth

267
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
any expense.

268
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,840
Indeed.

269
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,320
You truly match your reputation.

270
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,680
Such noble bearing.

271
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,680
But...

272
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
the silver you spend

273
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,560
doesn't come from His Majesty, does it?

274
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,000
Rumors say your lavish spending

275
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,160
comes from illegal business ventures.

276
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Illegal dealings?

277
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,160
Is this true?

278
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,760
What?

279
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,680
Though I'm no genius,

280
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,120
I know honor and decency.

281
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,200
I'd never use tainted money.

282
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,480
Nonsense.

283
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,840
- Out!
- Out!

284
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,400
Stop!

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,600
Observe.

286
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Imperial silver

287
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,960
bears the seal

288
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,480
(Imperial Household Department)
at their base.

289
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,016
It's true.

290
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,264
If yours isn't dirty money,

291
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
show us for comparison.

292
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,560
Mr. Jiang,

293
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
show him to shut his mouth.

294
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,880
Terrify him.

295
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,840
Exactly.

296
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
Daring to slander our Imperial Uncle!

297
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,280
Seeking death?

298
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:58,440
I...

299
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,360
My sister is Consort Shu!

300
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,560
His Majesty's silver

301
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,080
is clean!

302
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,960
No tainted money here.

303
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,800
This Imperial Uncle...

304
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Could he be guilty after all?

305
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,680
A man of integrity.

306
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,840
Could this truly be ill-gotten money?

307
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,320
Let's get out of here.

308
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,200
Don't get implicated.

309
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,040
Using dirty money
means losing your head.

310
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,400
- Exactly.
- Right.

311
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,080
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

312
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,760
- See you.
- See you.

313
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,840
- See you.
- See you.

314
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,040
Hurry. Move.

315
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,000
Don't leave!

316
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,720
Mr. Guo!

317
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,720
This can't be.

318
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,840
He just left?

319
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,000
Mother.

320
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,760
Wenbin.

321
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,040
(Madam Qin, Consort Shu's Mother)
Why this sudden rush?

322
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,600
Fortunately, I now oversee the harem.

323
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,560
Otherwise...

324
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,600
Look what you've done!

325
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,000
Do you destroy our entire family?

326
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:03,480
Mother.

327
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
Why would you say that?

328
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
Didn't you claim the money sent home

329
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,720
was rewards from His Majesty?

330
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,880
Mother and I thoroughly checked.

331
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
That money wasn't imperial gifts at all.

332
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,400
People say your money
has dubious origins.

333
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Have you been engaged
in shameful dealings

334
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
to earn dirty money

335
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,560
and made us use it?

336
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,400
Mother!

337
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,120
This witch has destroyed
my honorable reputation!

338
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,440
I'll report her to His Majesty at once!

339
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,240
Our family remains spotless.

340
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,200
Her actions

341
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,040
have no connection to our family!

342
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,880
Let's go.

343
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,760
Mother!

344
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,520
Don't believe their slanders!

345
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,560
They're...

346
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,320
They're just envious of me!

347
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,000
- Mother, look.
- No!

348
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,680
She still tries to deceive us!

349
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,400
Aren't you the favored consort?

350
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
Have you no sense of decency?

351
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,160
How could someone as principled as me

352
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,800
have such a shameless sister?

353
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,880
You...

354
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,720
You shameless woman!

355
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,520
You'll bring trouble upon us all!

356
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,160
How can you be so incompetent!

357
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,880
So utterly useless!

358
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,880
Favored consort?

359
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,920
Really?

360
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,720
Kneel before your brother.

361
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,520
Apologize!

362
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,640
Kneel down.

363
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,680
Your Highness.

364
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:08,760
Wenbin,

365
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,560
I was wrong.

366
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,520
All you do is cry!

367
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,880
How dare you shed tears!

368
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
(Consort Shu,)

369
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
(how does it feel
to kneel before others?)

370
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
(From now on,)

371
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,680
(I'll bring about your utter defeat.)

372
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,560
(You'll gradually)

373
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,680
(be tortured
until death seems merciful.)

374
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,400
Why are you so worthless?

375
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Completely useless!

376
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,080
How could I have such a daughter?

377
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
Why don't you just die?

378
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,600
All you do is cry!

379
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,320
Disgraceful!

380
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,440
Our family disowns you!

381
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,560
Utter trash!

382
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,080
Surong.

383
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,920
Surong.

384
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,080
My mother and brother are angry.

385
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:51,920
They must think my money's tainted.

386
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
- They're angry.
- No.

387
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,440
- They need me, Surong.
- Your Highness.

388
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,400
Remain calm.

389
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,880
Your Highness, they don't value you.

390
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,640
Why torment yourself?

391
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Silence!

392
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,960
You lowly maid!

393
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,880
What do you know?

394
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,920
They must think I'm worthless

395
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,800
and that my offerings are meager.

396
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,200
Summon Eunuch Yu.

397
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,240
I'll send 1,000 taels of silver.

398
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,760
They'll rejoice upon receiving it.

399
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,320
Then they'll know I'm not useless.

400
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,960
Your Highness, too large!

401
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,000
It risks exposure.

402
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,400
1,000 taels.

403
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,640
1,000 taels.

404
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,960
1,000 taels.

405
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,832
Yes, yes.

406
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,400
1,000 taels of silver is too little.

407
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,920
1,000 taels of gold.

408
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,440
1,000 taels of gold.

409
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
Will they calm down then?

410
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,800
1,000 taels of gold.

411
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,160
They will forgive me, right?

412
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,800
Your Highness, 1,000 taels
of gold would attract attention.

413
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,000
If this comes to light,

414
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,160
it'll mean execution.

415
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,360
Go quickly!

416
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,160
1,000 taels.

417
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,960
1,000 taels.

418
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
1,000 taels.

419
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,400
Mother and brother.

420
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,040
When my mother and brother

421
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,400
see how capable I am,

422
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,480
they won't abandon me.

423
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,000
When they

424
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,720
see how capable I am,

425
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
they won't abandon me.

426
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,360
Eunuch Yu.

427
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,080
It's indeed Eunuch Yu who transports
water from Yuquan Mountain.

428
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,320
The real show is about to begin.

429
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,760
You and Noble Consort Xian

430
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,760
work in tandem.

431
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,360
Truly a well-connected scheme.

432
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,720
She left to investigate it.

433
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,640
That's how we found

434
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,760
Consort Shu's maternal family
is a facade.

435
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,880
All these years,

436
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
they've been using
her earnings to prop it up.

437
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,920
Madam Qin favors sons over daughters.

438
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,760
She mistreats her own daughter

439
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,680
but coddles her useless son.

440
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,960
Consort Shu appears flawless,

441
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,560
but her blood-sucking family

442
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,640
is her fatal weakness.

443
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,760
So,

444
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,160
you had me leave the palace

445
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,720
to provoke Jiang Wenbin.

446
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,280
This way,

447
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,920
they'd lose face

448
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,040
and surely make her suffer.

449
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,480
Then she'd reveal flaws.

450
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,680
Exactly.

451
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,160
What Consort Shu fears most

452
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,080
is her family's disappointment

453
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,280
and their scorn.

454
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,840
For that illusion
of dignity and their attention,

455
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,360
she'll stop at nothing

456
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,760
to keep filling that bottomless pit

457
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,120
with chests of silver.

458
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,720
Then...

459
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
how did you know

460
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,240
tonight,

461
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,680
Eunuch Yu would come?

462
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,480
To move illicit funds,

463
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,320
Consort Shu needs someone
with free access to the harem.

464
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,120
Someone powerful

465
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,200
to avoid inspection.

466
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,040
Well...

467
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
That makes Eunuch Yu,

468
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,760
who manages
the Emperor's water transport,

469
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,920
the best candidate.
