(I Enjoy Handling Lowlifes)

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,840
- Wan'er!
- Her Highness said it.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,640
Wan'er.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,920
Beauty Song,

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,880
remember clearly

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,560
the taste of the whip's punishment.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,000
- Stop it!
- Learn your lessons.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,640
Wan'er did nothing wrong!

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,240
Why are you torturing her?

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,720
You've framed her!

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,800
Jiuning, shut up!

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,600
Release me!

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,400
Let me go!

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,160
Stop beating her!

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,200
Stop it!

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,040
Wan'er.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,480
All you ladies,

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,480
look at this.

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,560
The one being beaten

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,040
is Beauty Song.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,680
She is presented to His Majesty
from outside the palace.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,600
When serving His Majesty in the future,

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,000
you must strive by any means
to win his favor.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,760
In this harem,

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
those who lose imperial favor

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,720
become lower than swine and dogs.

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,760
No matter what,
she's His Majesty's woman.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,560
How dare they humiliate her?

31
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,640
The favored consorts here

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,480
not only hold higher ranks

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,200
but also come from noble families.

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,760
Crushing a mere beauty

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
is easier than squashing an ant.

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,640
Alright, ladies.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,880
Cease your muttering.

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,440
Let's go now.

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,800
Stop the whipping!

40
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,200
Enough!

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,160
Wan'er.

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,760
Wan'er.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,528
Wan'er.

44
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,440
Wan'er.

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,720
Wan'er.

46
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:06,880
Move.

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,480
Wan'er.

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
Wan'er.

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,120
Wan'er.

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
Wake up, Wan'er!

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
(Imperial Hospital)
Physician! Open the door!

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
Physician!

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,720
Physician, please open up!

54
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,120
Physician!

55
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
What's the matter?

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,560
My lady is injured.

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,200
I need an ointment to ease her pain.

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,240
Which palace do you serve?

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,400
Lijing Pavilion.

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,560
Too late. Return tomorrow morning.

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,880
Don't shut the door!

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,280
Physician!

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,600
Physician!

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,720
Physician!

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
I've brought gifts for you.

66
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,000
Open the door!

67
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,280
Physician!

68
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,320
Physician, I beg you!

69
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,520
Please open!

70
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,720
Halt!

71
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,840
Come here.

72
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Chunyu.

73
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,080
This maid appears before me

74
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,320
without paying respects.

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,880
Slap her face.

76
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,360
Yes.

77
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,680
We never offended you.

78
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,800
Why did you frame Wan'er?

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
How dare you question me!

80
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,400
It's okay to tell you why.

81
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,520
Lowborn hussies with pretty faces

82
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,280
dare compete
with noble-born ladies like us?

83
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,760
You're unworthy!

84
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,720
Learn a lesson from what happened today.

85
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,760
Behave meekly henceforth.

86
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
Though lowborn,

87
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,960
we seek no trouble.

88
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,800
Lowborn hussies

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,880
shouldn't be beautiful.

90
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,480
You know what?

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
I enjoy handling lowlifes.

92
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,240
Countless beauties
enter the harem yearly,

93
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,160
but none survive three months.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Within three months,

95
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,920
I'll destroy you.

96
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,880
You wish!

97
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,360
If you drive us up the wall,

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,440
I will

99
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,440
do anything to fight back.

100
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,120
Very tough.

101
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,920
Let me see

102
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,480
what you can do

103
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,080
to challenge me.

104
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,440
Your Highness.

105
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,760
You don't know what we've endured

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,320
and how many bad men we've met.

107
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,490
Some used human blood for cure

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
and made incense holders
from human bones.

109
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,040
Some forced servants

110
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,320
to use hands with torn-off fingernails

111
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,960
to massage their legs.

112
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
You can't imagine

113
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,040
what we've endured.

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,120
But no matter what,

115
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,840
we just want to survive.

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
We don't seek trouble.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,800
From now on,

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
don't provoke us again.

119
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,680
We'll coexist peacefully.

120
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,840
But if

121
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,800
you deny us a chance to live,

122
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
I swear to you

123
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,520
I'll make you regret

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,240
ever meeting me.

125
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,296
(Lijing Pavilion)

126
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
This is all my fault.

127
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,400
I got you beaten too.

128
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,840
I'm fine.

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,160
It doesn't hurt.

130
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:49,760
By the way,

131
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,160
on my way back,

132
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
I met Lady Yu.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,400
She admitted framing you

134
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
out of jealousy for your beauty.

135
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
Why are the women in this harem

136
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,600
so vicious?

137
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:04,840
Jiuning.

138
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
Perhaps I was naive.

139
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,760
I thought

140
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,240
keeping quiet

141
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,120
and staying low

142
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,480
would let us survive.

143
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
But this incident made me realize

144
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,040
that in the harem,

145
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
those without power

146
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,760
who don't dare to fight

147
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,160
are destined to perish.

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,200
Are you saying

149
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,480
you'll compete for favor?

150
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,160
Better to take risks

151
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,680
than endure their abuse.

152
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Aren't they just afraid

153
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,480
I'll outshine them?

154
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,720
Since they fear it,

155
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,400
I'll fight harder

156
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,360
to seize every opportunity.

157
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,720
But we are powerless.

158
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,640
The path ahead

159
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,120
will be perilous.

160
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,920
Fighting might kill us.

161
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,040
But not fighting

162
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,120
means certain death.

163
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,440
Even the slimmest hope

164
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,920
is worth pursuing.

165
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,000
I won't stay trampled underfoot

166
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,600
like an ant.

167
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,600
Countless beauties
enter the harem yearly,

168
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,600
but none survive three months.

169
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,280
Within three months,

170
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,240
I'll destroy you all.

171
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,720
A desperate struggle

172
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,240
might bring new hope.

173
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,520
You possess unmatched beauty.

174
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,240
You are versatile in arts.

175
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,800
If you compete

176
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,160
for His Majesty's favor,

177
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
you can surpass them.

178
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,360
If you're resolved,

179
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I'll stand with you.

180
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
Even at the cost of my life,

181
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,280
I'll protect you.

182
00:07:58,496 --> 00:07:59,120
Wan'er.

183
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:01,960
Jiuning.

184
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,520
Don't sacrifice yourself.

185
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,240
You're my only family left.

186
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,280
We must strive together

187
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,680
to survive.

188
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:16,200
Yes.

189
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,640
Even through stormy paths,

190
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
we must

191
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,360
carve our way out.

192
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,800
(Lady Yu,)

193
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,600
(if you hurt Wan'er again,)

194
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,880
(I'll make you pay for it.)

195
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,160
Jiuning.

196
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
What are you doing?

197
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,360
I'm applying the scented ointment

198
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,840
made from nectar and herbs
to these plants.

199
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,240
Why?

200
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,120
I heard His Majesty

201
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,480
will pass through the corridor tonight.

202
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm trying

203
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,800
to bring His Majesty over to meet you.

204
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,640
Are you sure?

205
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,680
How can His Majesty do what you say?

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,840
Don't worry.

207
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,200
If His Majesty passes by,
it'll surely work.

208
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,920
You must shine tonight.

209
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,840
This is your big day.

210
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,800
We'll wait and see.

211
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:50,944
(Imperial Study)

212
00:09:56,544 --> 00:10:00,352
(Emperor)

213
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,080
Your Majesty.

214
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,520
It's getting late.

215
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,640
Time to choose.

216
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,880
Your Majesty.

217
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,560
A few days ago,

218
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
(Eunuch Zhang, Imperial Attendant)
When Consort Chun played chess with you,

219
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,520
she defeated you.

220
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,000
Pleased by this,

221
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,360
you promised Consort Chun

222
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
to dine with her at her palace

223
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,720
on the tenth of this month.

224
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,040
Today is the tenth.

225
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,760
Now that you mention it,

226
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,320
I do recall.

227
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
It's been too long
since I drank with her.

228
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,168
(Consort Chun)

229
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,760
To Chengxi Palace!

230
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,680
Yes.

231
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,432
(Chengxi Palace)

232
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,480
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

233
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
Tonight marks Her Highness's
huge occasion.

234
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
Do your work carefully.

235
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,240
Don't make any mistake.

236
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,040
If you jeopardize the plan,

237
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
(Jinping, Chief Maid)
you'll lose your heads.

238
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

239
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,000
Congrats!

240
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,400
Finally, the day has come.

241
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,520
The once-in-a-century
Seven-Star Conjunction

242
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,640
will show up.

243
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,760
The Imperial Astrologer divined

244
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,920
that if Your Highness serves tonight,

245
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,520
you'll surely conceive an heir.

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,920
In the future,

247
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,320
through your son's prestige,

248
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
you'll ascend to become Empress.

249
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,480
I've served His Majesty for years,

250
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,000
yet never conceived.

251
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,320
If I succeed this time,

252
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,080
I'll never bow
to the woman in Yongxiu Palace.

253
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,800
Pardon me, please.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,720
Spare me, please.

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,920
Mercy, Your Highness!

256
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,600
You vile fool!

257
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,960
You're so useless.

258
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,680
Guards!

259
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,120
Drag her out and execute her!

260
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,200
Wait.

261
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,440
Jinping.

262
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,080
Tonight is important to me.

263
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,800
No bloodshed tonight.

264
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
Don't jinx my fortune.

265
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,440
Thank you.

266
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
Thank you for your mercy.

267
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,320
Take her away

268
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,520
and bury her alive somewhere.

269
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,720
Your Highness!

270
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,680
Spare me!

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,160
Spare me, Your Highness!

272
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,400
Your Highness!

273
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:36,290
Your Highness!

274
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,600
Congrats, Your Highness!

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,680
His Majesty

276
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,560
has departed for Chengxi Palace!

277
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,680
His Majesty finally comes!

278
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,040
Jinping.

279
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,800
Xiao Dezi.

280
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,520
Serve flawlessly tonight!

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,760
This heaven-sent opportunity
comes once a century.

282
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,880
If anyone ruins my plans,

283
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,520
you'll never see the dawn again.

284
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

285
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,440
So many!

286
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,040
More over there!

287
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,120
Let me see!

288
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,800
Look!

289
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,360
Where are they from?

290
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,280
Look.

291
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,480
How beautiful!

292
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,880
These fireflies are transformed

293
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,600
from the rainbow
under the fairies' feet.

294
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,160
On nights with fireflies,

295
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,560
the fairy maidens will come.

296
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:51,360
Here!

297
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
Who's there?

298
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,200
What did you just say?

299
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,520
Answer His Majesty!

300
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,320
Your Majesty,

301
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,320
I just spoke of a tale.

302
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,480
My mother told me about it

303
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,360
when I was little.

304
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,520
It is

305
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,480
about fireflies that are transformed

306
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
from the rainbow
under the fairy maidens' feet.

307
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,280
On nights with fireflies,

308
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,160
perhaps an immortal fairy
who develops mortal desires

309
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,000
will come down

310
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:31,160
to meet her beloved.

311
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,480
Your Majesty.

312
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,320
Your Majesty.

313
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,560
Get ready to...

314
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,000
Lower it.

315
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,560
Your Majesty.

316
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:11,080
Your Majesty.

317
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,024
Your Majesty.

318
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
The Garden's that way.

319
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,880
Chengxi Palace is this way.

320
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:17,320
Your Majesty.

321
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,560
Come on!

322
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,600
Follow up!

323
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,472
- Yes.
- Yes.

324
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,600
Your Majesty.

325
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,440
Your Majesty.
