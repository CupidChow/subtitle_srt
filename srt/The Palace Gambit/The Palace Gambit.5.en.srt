00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,128
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:14,912
(You'll pay with your life!)

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,720
You just wait.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,960
What's going on?

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,560
I don't know.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,480
Lady Wan is with child?

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,280
Get back to work!

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,000
(Imperial Study)
You bold maid.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
His Majesty is discussing
with officials inside.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,920
How dare you?

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,560
My lord,

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,560
I'm Lu Jiuning, Talented Lady Wan's maid
from Lijing Pavilion.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,720
Do you remember me?

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,720
I recall now.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,560
You're the maid
catching fireflies that night.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,840
Yes, that was me.

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,160
(Imperial Study)
Please, let me see His Majesty.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,720
I have urgent matters to report.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,440
Get up first.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,320
My lord,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,480
Lady Wan

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,360
was sent to the Cold Palace
at the Empress Dowager's birthday feast.

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,400
But now she is

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,080
carrying the royal heir.

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,120
I beg you

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,280
to inform His Majesty of this matter

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,080
and ask him

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,440
to save Lady Wan quickly!

30
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,600
Lady Wan bears the royal heir?

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,880
Is this true?

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,160
I swear it's true.

33
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,600
Chief Physician Zhang confirmed
the pregnancy himself.

34
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,800
This concerns the royal heir.
It's of utmost importance.

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,840
When the discussion ends,

36
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,560
I'll report this immediately.

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,080
Get up first.

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,480
His Majesty dotes on Lady Wan.

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,760
Now she carries his child,

40
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,280
he'll surely intervene personally.

41
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,360
Don't worry.

42
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Thank you, My lord.

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,800
Please,

44
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,480
you must speak to His Majesty.

45
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:39,400
(Imperial Study)

46
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,880
You shouldn't be here.

47
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,560
Return calmly and wait.

48
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,480
Lady Wan

49
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,560
will be safely returned
to Lijing Pavilion.

50
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,520
Thank you, My lord.

51
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,640
Thank you, My lord.

52
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,480
It's nothing.

53
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,360
Go now.

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,280
I'll take my leave.

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Truly brilliant, Your Highness.

56
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,240
You arranged for me to bribe maids
to break vases in advance,

57
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,440
drove away that watchdog Lu Jiuning,

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,880
and then bribed eunuchs to swap gifts,

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,960
sending that shameless Song Wan'er
into the Cold Palace.

60
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,280
She offended the Empress Dowager.

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
Even if His Majesty is here,

62
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,480
he can't easily protect her now.

63
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,000
You've handled this well.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
My trust in you wasn't misplaced.

65
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,960
Thank you for your praise,
Your Highness.

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
It's my honor

67
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
to serve you.

68
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,520
Thank you for your grace.

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,080
Your Highness,

70
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Chief Physician Zhang has come
for your pulse reading.

71
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,920
Lady Yu,

72
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,160
you may leave now.

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,880
Make sure you've arranged trusted people

74
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
to keep a tight eye on Song Wan'er

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,320
in the Cold Palace.

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,840
Your command is received.

77
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,080
Greetings, Your Highness.

78
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,280
Dr. Zhang,

79
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,160
is the Imperial Hospital matter settled?

80
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,920
I've destroyed all
of Lady Wan's medical records.

81
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,040
The Imperial Hospital

82
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,400
totally remains ignorant
of her pregnancy now.

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,960
Rest assured, Your Highness.

84
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Well done.

85
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,600
As foremost
of the Four Chief Physicians,

86
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,760
your work always merits my confidence.

87
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,800
You flatter me, Your Highness.

88
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,960
In due time,

89
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,000
you may announce your own pregnancy.

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,200
I'll prepare

91
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,960
to transfer Lady Wan's pregnancy records

92
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,720
into your medical files.

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,080
By then,

94
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,200
the child she secretly gives birth
in the Cold Palace

95
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,280
will become

96
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,840
the royal heir you bore His Majesty.

97
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,480
You've been considerate, Dr. Zhang.

98
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,720
When I rule the imperial harem
as Empress,

99
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,200
you'll be richly rewarded.

100
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,480
Dr. Zhang,

101
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,320
this is Her Highness's reward.

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

103
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:39,360
(Lijing Pavilion)

104
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
Why hasn't Wan'er been returned yet?

105
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:48,224
(Lijing Pavilion)

106
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,032
(Lijing Pavilion)

107
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,360
(Lijing Pavilion)

108
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,120
(Meet her at the Cold Palace gate.)

109
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,168
(Lijing Pavilion)

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,200
Her Ladyship will be sent back tonight.

111
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,920
You two...

112
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,360
Bitao,

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,040
go tidy Her Ladyship's bedding.

114
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,840
Xiao Fuhai,

115
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
go get more hot water.

116
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,520
- Her Ladyship's returning tonight...
- What's the point of boiling anything?

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,560
She offended the Empress Dowager!

118
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,840
Could she return?

119
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,360
Bitao is right.

120
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,720
I thought I'd serve someone favored,

121
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
and live comfortably.

122
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,240
Who knew she'd be cursed with bad luck?

123
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,600
Low-born women truly can't keep favor.

124
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:51,320
Hey.

125
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
We might all get implicated.

126
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
I have no time for your nonsense.

127
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
You just wait!

128
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,600
You...

129
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:15,040
(Cold Palace)

130
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,360
Who are you?

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,480
My lord,

132
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm a maid serving Talented Lady Wan
of Lijing Pavilion.

133
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,320
I wish to send her some clothes.

134
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,560
Send clothes?

135
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,400
Do you know where this is?

136
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
This is the Cold Palace.

137
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,200
In the Cold Palace,
one's life is left to fate.

138
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,560
Send her clothes?

139
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,880
She lives worse than a servant here.

140
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,280
Still dreaming of her privileged life?

141
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,000
My lord,

142
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:44,960
I...

143
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,760
I've prepared some money for you.

144
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,000
Get away!

145
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,640
Who wants your measly money?

146
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,080
Let me make this clear.

147
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,400
Higher authorities ordered

148
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,160
that without explicit decree,

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,480
no one is allowed to see her.

150
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
Step aside. Move along.

151
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Wait!

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Please forgive me!

153
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,000
I didn't mean to!

154
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,440
My lady, please forgive me.

155
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,120
Does it hurt?

156
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,040
I'm fine, My lady. It doesn't hurt.

157
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,240
Wan'er.

158
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,800
(Wan'er,)

159
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,440
(our greatest wish
was simply to survive.)

160
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,160
(To stay alive,)

161
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,760
(we lived like ants
in the imperial harem,)

162
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,880
(trembling with fear,)

163
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,480
(even our breaths dictated
by others' moods.)

164
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,800
(Yet in the end,)

165
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,560
(you met a tragic death
in the Cold Palace.)

166
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,120
(Why?)

167
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,400
(Why do murderers)

168
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,400
(remain unpunished)

169
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,760
(and keep enjoying wealth and favor?)

170
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,000
(What kind of world is this?)

171
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
(They say)

172
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,600
(this is our fate.)

173
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,400
(Wan'er,)

174
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
(I refuse to accept this.)

175
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,960
(I will never accept this.)

176
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,920
Wan'er!

177
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,200
Enough weeping, lady.

178
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
Let us attend to our duties.

179
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,440
How did she die?

180
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,200
Overwhelmed by guilt, Lady Wan

181
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,240
took her own life at dusk.

182
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,000
She carried the royal heir!

183
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,760
How could she kill herself?

184
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
Let's go.

185
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,440
Wan'er.

186
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,160
Wan'er!

187
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,800
Wan'er!

188
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,480
(Wan'er,)

189
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,080
(someone killed you, right?)

190
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,080
(Wait for me.)

191
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,160
(I won't let your death
remain unexplained.)

192
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,880
(I'll find the killer.)

193
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,240
(I'll drag out everyone)

194
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,360
(who harmed you.)

195
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,840
(Be they noblewomen)

196
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,960
(or even the Heaven himself,)

197
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,480
(I'll spare none of them!)

198
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,680
(I'll make sure those who harmed you)

199
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,440
(pay in blood!)

200
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,040
You're all useless!

201
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,320
- Calm down, Your Highness.
- Calm down, Your Highness.

202
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,320
Your Highness,

203
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,080
I truly sent her the prenatal tonic

204
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,280
as you ordered.

205
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,200
But why she'd be so desperate
to kill herself?

206
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,880
Your Highness,

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,240
I truly did nothing else.

208
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,560
I treated her well!

209
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,280
Your Highness.

210
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Useless fool!

211
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,040
You've ruined my plan!

212
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,560
Spare me.

213
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,400
Calm your anger.

214
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,160
Spare me.

215
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,240
Calm your anger.

216
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,320
Lady Yu,

217
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,080
are you jealous of Song Wan'er's beauty

218
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
and thus harmed her?

219
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,080
Your Highness,

220
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,200
I've been under your gracious care
since entering the palace.

221
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,440
My entire family relies
on your protection.

222
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,800
Even if I had ten thousand lives,

223
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,680
I wouldn't dare disobey your orders!

224
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,920
I'm but your loyal hound.

225
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
Your command is my action.

226
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,680
Heaven and earth witness
my devotion to you.

227
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,160
Your Highness!

228
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,760
You fool!

229
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,600
Get out!

230
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,088
Thank you, Your Highness.

231
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:29,680
Thank you.

232
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,592
Thank you.

233
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:31,440
Thank you.

234
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Please soothe your wrath.

235
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,840
Your health should come first.

236
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,560
That Song Wan'er

237
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,680
was born shameless,

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,080
too feeble to bear honor.

239
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,920
If she couldn't handle the privilege
of bearing your child,

240
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,400
her death means nothing.

241
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,960
We'll find another way.

242
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,120
Fetch more low-born girls from outside.

243
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,480
Present them as court beauties.

244
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,880
I refuse to believe

245
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,400
finding surrogates could be this hard!

246
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,640
Yes, Your Highness.

247
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:15,648
(Chengxi Palace)

248
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,720
It scared me to death.

249
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,200
I almost lost my life.

250
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
I was terrified too.

251
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,280
I never saw Consort Chun
rage like that before.

252
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,680
Wan'er died in the Cold Palace.

253
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,960
Did you kill her?

254
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,520
How dare you hit me?

255
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,680
Seize her at once!

256
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,440
On the Fasting Day,

257
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,160
you framed her with the clothes.

258
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,600
You abused your power

259
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,200
and bullied us,

260
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,600
vowing we wouldn't survive three months.

261
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,160
You must have murdered Wan'er.

262
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,200
I nearly forgot

263
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,760
I said these things.

264
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,880
Answer me!

265
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,280
Did you do it?

266
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,280
What if I did?

267
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,360
What if I didn't?

268
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,880
I'll see justice done

269
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,600
for Wan'er.

270
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,080
You? Seeking vengeance?

271
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,680
Take this insolent maid
to the Punishment Bureau!

272
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,960
30 lashes.

273
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,520
Sent her to the Hard-Labor Ward.

274
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,200
Make sure they teach

275
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,960
this arrogant fool some humility.

276
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,680
Madam Li, you run
the Hard-Labor Ward splendidly.

277
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,200
This month's money from there

278
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,120
tripled last month's earnings!

279
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,160
Your Highness, I'll execute

280
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,720
your orders flawlessly.

281
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,040
I won't disappoint you.

282
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,560
Your Highness,

283
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,520
they say even the Cold Palace meal duty

284
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,160
is auctioned to convicts

285
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,240
at exorbitant prices.

286
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,880
Madam Li,

287
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,440
is this true?

288
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,240
Yes.

289
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,200
I only sought more revenue for you.

290
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,600
Good work.

291
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,640
Stop.

292
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,680
Come here.

293
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,840
(Lady Yu,)

294
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
(I'll uncover the truth
at the Hard-Labor Ward.)

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,680
(If you killed Wan'er,)

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,800
(you'll pay with your life!)
