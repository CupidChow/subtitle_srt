2
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:12,448
=Episode 26=

3
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:14,912
(I'll Wait for You Next Life)

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
The ledger seized outside the palace

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,840
details their trafficking.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,160
Please review it.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,440
I've seized Consort Shu's illicit money.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,280
Eunuch Yu, who transported gold for her,

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,480
has already confessed.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,256
See for yourself.

11
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:52,520
I'm so resentful.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,960
I've schemed with all my might

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,840
and calculated every move,

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,040
yet lost to a lowly maid like you.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,880
When entering the palace at fourteen,

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,200
I became my family's cash cow.

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,920
My brother wanted money,

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,040
and my father desired power.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
I clawed my way upward desperately

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,760
just to earn their notice.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,432
None of this
justifies harming the innocent.

22
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:31,800
By what right?

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,760
In this harem,

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,320
everyone vies for favor.

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,400
What fault is mine?

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,760
You climbed over innocent lives.

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,400
Those commoners you slaughtered

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,920
never got to plead their innocence.

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,800
For your own selfish desires,

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,320
you've been so malicious.

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,600
You are truly heinous.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,480
In the imperial harem,

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,920
whose hands are clean?

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,680
You all posture with false virtue.

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,080
Your Majesty,

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,520
look at these records.

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,120
Most of the wealth I amassed

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,360
has been given to your own aunt,

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,760
the Grand Princess.

40
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,800
If I'm left with no way out,

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,720
the imperial family's dignity

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,000
will be dragged through mud.

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,600
Guards!

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,320
Take her down.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,600
Consort Shu,

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,920
don't think I'm blind to your schemes.

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
You believe the Grand Princess's backing

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,160
makes you invulnerable?

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,560
So you dare to blackmail me

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
for leniency?

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,840
Someone!

52
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,280
Summon the Grand Princess.

53
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:35,328
Summon the Grand Princess.

54
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:42,000
The Grand Princess,

55
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,320
I warned you long ago

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,320
to stay away from Consort Shu.

57
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,192
Why did you not heed my warnings?

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,040
Your Majesty,

59
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,560
I admit my wrongs.

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,720
Consort Shu

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,504
deliberately bribed me.

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,160
I merely accepted her money.

63
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,320
I never got involved

64
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,200
in what she's done, Your Majesty.

65
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,120
I know nothing

66
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,600
about what she has done.

67
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:02,640
As the Grand Princess,

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,520
my own blood aunt,

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,200
of such noble standing,

70
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,760
you sold yourself for money

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,280
and were drawn

72
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,600
into her human trafficking crimes.

73
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,240
You've shamed the imperial family.

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,640
How do you expect me

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
to answer to the court ministers?

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,160
Your Majesty, I was momentarily foolish.

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,960
I beg your mercy.

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,040
Yun Mi,

79
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,960
help me. I'm your sister.

80
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,000
Yun Mi.

81
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,880
Yun Mi.

82
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,240
Help me quickly.

83
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,920
Persuade His Majesty for me.

84
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,880
This concerns imperial dignity.

85
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,200
How disastrous if made public.

86
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,880
Sister,

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,720
with your crimes,

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,200
even I cannot save you now.

89
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,520
Your Majesty,

90
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,320
the law applies to all,

91
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
high and low.

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
The Grand Princess took bribes
to cover Consort Shu's crimes.

93
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
She must be punished too

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
by national law.

95
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,400
As the nation's sovereign,

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,920
Your Majesty knows
the empire's foundation.

97
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,720
If you fail to love your people

98
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
and punish your kin,

99
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,640
where is the authority?

100
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,520
Water bears the boat

101
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,320
and capsizes it.

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
If you lose the people's hearts,

103
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,240
this empire

104
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
will cease to exist.

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,776
Lu Jiuning,

106
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:16,520
how dare you!

107
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,040
Your Majesty,

108
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,120
justice resides in people's hearts.

109
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
It shouldn't rest solely on your decree.

110
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,000
Nor should it

111
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,960
be confined
to imperial authority and power.

112
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,088
You're overstepping!

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,328
Your Majesty,

114
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
though Lu Jiuning
is merely a palace maid,

115
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,520
she cares for the people.

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,120
Her counsel today

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
is an act of loyalty.

118
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,320
Please calm down.

119
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,320
Your Majesty, Lu Jiuning

120
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,400
rescued many oppressed innocent maids

121
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,600
from Hard-Labor Ward

122
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,800
while investigating
Talented Lady Wan's case.

123
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:44,440
She exposed Consort Shu's crimes

124
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,920
for the greater good.

125
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,440
To expose
the trafficking of common folk,

126
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,440
she spared no effort.

127
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,600
Every action and thought of Lu Jiuning

128
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
serves the common people

129
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,960
and Your Majesty's sovereignty.

130
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,400
Please judge fairly.

131
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,440
Very well.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,520
Lord Ning speaks so eloquently.

133
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,800
Today, I shall

134
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,520
deal fairly with Consort Shu
and the Grand Princess.

135
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:07,480
However,

136
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,080
to preserve the imperial dignity,

137
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,360
Lu Jiuning and Eunuch Zhang,
two outsiders who know too much,

138
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,440
cannot remain.

139
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,360
They must die.

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,960
Your Majesty!

141
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,952
Bring it forth.

142
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,480
Lu Jiuning,

143
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,120
I promised you

144
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,640
a chance to plead your case.

145
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,720
I ask one final time:

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,880
Will you choose life or death?

147
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:35,120
The choice is yours.

148
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
If Your Majesty

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,160
can administer justice,

150
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,040
clear my sister's name

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
to give her justice,

152
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
and restore

153
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,920
righteous order to the realm,

154
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,880
I will die without regret.

155
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,960
Good.

156
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Drink this poison,

157
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,800
and justice shall be served.

158
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,040
Your Highness,

159
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
I

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,200
can no longer serve you.

161
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,840
Thank you
for your recognition and kindness.

162
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,768
Thank you for letting me

163
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,400
feel genuine warmth

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,720
in this cruel palace.

165
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,400
You cherished me like my sister

166
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,088
and treated me with kindness.

167
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,712
I can never repay you.

168
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,800
See you in the next life.

169
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,360
In the next life,

170
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,920
I'll surely repay your kindness.

171
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Lord Ning,

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,920
thank you

173
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,160
for always standing by me.

174
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
I'm eternally grateful.

175
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,520
Please set aside

176
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:27,600
your feelings for me.

177
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,240
As things stand,

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
we can never be together in this life.

179
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:38,000
Maybe next life.

180
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:39,760
I'll wait for you

181
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:41,120
next life.

182
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,320
Next life,

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,200
we'll surely

184
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
share our lives

185
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,880
and grow old together.

186
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,560
No, Jiuning!

187
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,360
My lord!

188
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,200
Jiuning!

189
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,400
Jiuning!

190
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,808
No!

191
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,120
Consort Shu

192
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,976
harmed consorts and imperial heirs,

193
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
colluded with officials,

194
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,960
and shielded traffickers.

195
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,240
The proof was ironclad.

196
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,360
Her evil was profound.

197
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,888
She will

198
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
be stripped of her title

199
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,200
and given poison

200
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,320
to atone with death.

201
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,600
The Grand Princess

202
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
traded her influence

203
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,120
for wealth.

204
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,560
Effective immediately,

205
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,960
she's confined to Wuhua Palace.

206
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,520
Without my decree,

207
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
she'll never be pardoned.

208
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,960
Jiuning!

209
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:55,360
Jiuning?

210
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,440
Jiuning.

211
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:11,200
(Lijing Pavilion)

212
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:22,848
(Imperial Study)

213
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,960
I didn't die?

214
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,960
Jiuning,

215
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,800
you're awake.

216
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,240
Your Highness?

217
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
It was just a sedative tonic.

218
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,760
You slept like a log.

219
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,120
Your Majesty.

220
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,160
I never intended to take your life.

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
I merely wanted to verify

222
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,920
whether it's, as you claimed,

223
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
genuine care for the people,

224
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,360
or just vengeance in disguise

225
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,000
by borrowing my power.

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,920
Thank you for sparing my life.

227
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,600
The human trafficking epidemic

228
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,840
manifested

229
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,800
through an avalanche of memorials

230
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
piling up endlessly.

231
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
My tinnitus

232
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,920
relapsed

233
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,960
during that period.

234
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you truly take me for a fool

235
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,440
and think me oblivious?

236
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,160
This matter
implicates powerful networks,

237
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,440
even reaching imperial kin.

238
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Tug one thread,
and the whole tapestry moves.

239
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,160
Then how

240
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,720
did Your Majesty resolve to act?

241
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,800
Because of you.

242
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,480
As a mere palace maid,

243
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,760
defying power

244
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
and obstacles,

245
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440
you pleaded for people.

246
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,520
You've shown me

247
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,760
a remarkable woman unlike any other.

248
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,480
Speak.

249
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,760
What reward do you seek?

250
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,760
Your Majesty,

251
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,560
might I request

252
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,160
leave from the palace?

253
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,880
I wish to fulfill

254
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,440
my sister's unachieved dreams.

255
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,640
I desire

256
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,200
to live freely and simply.

257
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,280
Very well.

258
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,120
If you insist on departing,

259
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,320
I grant your wish.

260
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,560
Go witness

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
the picturesque realm

262
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
under my governance.

263
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,840
Thank you for your grace.

264
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,800
You warned

265
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,920
Jiuning would never accept me.

266
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,480
I refused to believe

267
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,960
that in this world

268
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,360
exists anything beyond my grasp.

269
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,680
Jiuning

270
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,880
differs from other women.

271
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,200
Indeed.

272
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,560
I've never encountered
such an extraordinary woman.

273
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,800
Lord Ning,

274
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,440
have you truly made up your mind?

275
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,000
My sister faces punishment
because of her.

276
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
The imperial clan

277
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,680
will never accept her.

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,040
Reconsider carefully.

279
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,688
(Zhaoyang Gate)

280
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,440
Your Highness, stay.

281
00:13:01,376 --> 00:13:02,240
Cease your tears.

282
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,640
In your delicate condition,

283
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,560
weeping harms your eyes.

284
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,480
I must leave now.

285
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,280
Take good care.

286
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,600
Jiuning,

287
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:12,040
though palace walls

288
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,880
may merely separate us,

289
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,960
your departure means

290
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,480
we may never meet again.

291
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,880
Jiuning,

292
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,360
beyond these walls,

293
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,760
live freely and joyfully

294
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,000
and fulfill

295
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,560
both your and your sister's wishes.

296
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,520
Your Highness,

297
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,000
you will become an empress
who embodies maternal grace.

298
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,280
One as compassionate as you

299
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,200
as empress

300
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,160
would bless the realm.

301
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,440
For His Majesty

302
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,520
and our people,

303
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
I'll dedicate my utmost.

304
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:44,360
The imperial harem

305
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,760
forever churns with schemes

306
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,512
and surging undercurrents.

307
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,960
Speaking of Miss Jiu,
Noble Consort Xian's favorite maid,

308
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,720
from a lowly convict maid
in the Hard-Labor Ward

309
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,880
to a favored maid by the consort's side,

310
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,960
her favor flourished effortlessly,

311
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,520
rising meteorically through the ranks.

312
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,560
Later,

313
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,800
she not only helped
solve the Jiangnan trafficking case

314
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,080
but also earned His Majesty's favor

315
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,520
and was elevated to consort.

316
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,424
Everything was too smooth.

317
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:12,499
She became a consort.

318
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,440
But fate plays cruel tricks.

319
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,440
Fortune and misfortune intertwined.

320
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,560
On the very night

321
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,000
of her consort ceremony,

322
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,600
- Miss Jiu...
- What?

323
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,840
Suddenly died.

324
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,880
She died?

325
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,280
Her corpse vanished,

326
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,160
leaving only an empty tomb.

327
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,000
Who caused Miss Jiu's

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,640
untimely demise?

329
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,280
Was her death

330
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,440
a casualty of palace schemes?

331
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,040
Are there undisclosed truths?

332
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,640
What truths?

333
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,160
To know what happened next,

334
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,200
come back

335
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,160
for the continuation.

336
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,720
Sister,

337
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,480
you also came from the palace.

338
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,240
Did Miss Jiu

339
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:49,680
truly die?

340
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,200
Yes.

341
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,320
She's dead.

342
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,840
So the storyteller spoke truth?

343
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,440
Not entirely true.

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,680
One thing he got wrong.

345
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,160
What thing?

346
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
Miss Jiu

347
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,280
was never a consort of His Majesty.

348
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,480
Then what?

349
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,880
Then

350
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,560
if you don't go home to eat soon,

351
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,040
you'll miss dinner.

352
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,520
It's getting late.

353
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,760
At the bridge's end,

354
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,880
a scholar in blue

355
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,960
holding an umbrella hurries over...

356
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,640
Jiuning.

357
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,640
Lord Ning?

358
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,480
I'm no Lord Ning now.

359
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,480
I incurred the wrath

360
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,680
of the imperial clan.

361
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,680
Now I'm stripped

362
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,720
of royal status and lineage.

363
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,960
Henceforth,

364
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,360
no Lord Ning exists.

365
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,480
Before you stands

366
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,840
but a commoner.

367
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,560
Jiuning,

368
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,760
in our youth,

369
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
you shielded me.

370
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,080
Now I'll protect you.

371
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,080
I'll marry you

372
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,480
and guard you all my days.

373
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,200
None shall harm you again.

374
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:30,496
♪For you, I am willing♪

375
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:36,288
♪Do you understand♪

376
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:49,216
(The End)
