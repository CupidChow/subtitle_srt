00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,944
(I Willingly Accept Death)

4
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:21,696
Your Majesty,

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,600
your tea.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,720
Is she kneeling?

7
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:34,520
Your Majesty,

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,360
Miss Jiuning is still kneeling.

9
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:38,440
She disturbed the Empress Dowager,

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,232
spoke insolently,

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,560
and was slapped and expelled.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,320
In the entire harem now,

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,560
no one dares take her in.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,840
She wanders like a stray dog

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,200
with nowhere to go.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,000
She's been kneeling outside

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,120
for three days.

18
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:52,440
Has she admitted it?

19
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:54,600
No.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,960
She only pleads for Your Majesty

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,528
to investigate Consort Shu.

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Let her keep kneeling.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,800
I want to see whether

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,080
her knees are harder

25
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,888
or the ground tiles are harder.

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,040
(Imperial Study)

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,440
She's been kneeling for days.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
She's still here.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,720
How tragic.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,720
I couldn't endure that.

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,840
Nor could I.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,280
How pitiful.

33
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,560
Jiuning,

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,560
you haven't eaten or drunk
for three days.

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
Have some congee.

36
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,600
Your Majesty.

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,760
Forgive me.

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,840
Just some congee.

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,040
Let it be spilled.

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,520
Missing one meal

41
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,600
won't starve her.

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,520
Miss Jiuning,

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,840
you've seen the situation
these past days.

44
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,760
Not just in the imperial palace,

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
but throughout the entire realm,

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,840
everything hinges on His Majesty's word.

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
Do you want to be trampled underfoot

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,240
or live a life of power and influence?

49
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,880
Just bow your head
and apologize to His Majesty,

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,128
and you'll be second
only to the sovereign.

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,440
Make your choice quickly.

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,120
I...

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,760
I only beseech His Majesty

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,960
to investigate Consort Shu.

55
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,720
You...

56
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:30,080
(Imperial Study)

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,600
Oh my.

58
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,720
Come back.

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,840
Come here.

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,200
Over here.

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,280
Stop running.

62
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,720
I heard His Majesty

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,240
banned her from food and drink.

64
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,880
She must be starving.

65
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,400
When she

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,600
became an imperial handmaid,

67
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,960
we were so envious.

68
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,960
Serving His Majesty is indeed perilous.

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,760
We'll never envy that again.

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,600
The dried meat has gone bad.

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,840
Even the dog won't eat it.

72
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
How incompetent you are!

73
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,240
But...

74
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,720
it's not spoiled.

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,840
How dare you talk back!

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,760
Begone.

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,960
Yes.

78
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
How many days has it been?

79
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,480
Your Majesty,

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,200
it's already the sixth day.

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,480
Your Majesty,

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,280
it's raining outside.

83
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,040
Miss Jiuning hasn't eaten
or drunk for days.

84
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,680
If this continues,

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,320
she might not survive.

86
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:53,344
(Imperial Study)

87
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,160
Your Majesty,

88
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,680
I...

89
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,040
I admit my fault.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,176
The physician!

91
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,080
Get the physician!

92
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,480
Yes.

93
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
Your Majesty.

94
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,840
Earlier,

95
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,520
I had the physician examine you.

96
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,040
You caught a chill.

97
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
No need for formalities.

98
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:41,840
Your Majesty,

99
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I've come around.

100
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,880
I am

101
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,480
willing to become
Your Majesty's consort.

102
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Kneeling for days,

103
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,040
you've actually come around?

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,120
I can become Your Majesty's consort,

105
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,360
but I have one condition.

106
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,920
Would Your Majesty

107
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,840
grant it?

108
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,960
If you're willing to be my consort,

109
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
let alone one condition,

110
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,200
I'd grant

111
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,000
even a hundred

112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,120
or ten thousand.

113
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,840
Your Majesty,

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,160
my condition might be hard

115
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,120
to fulfill.

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,400
Look at her.

117
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,960
She must've conceived another smart idea

118
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
to challenge me with.

119
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,400
You're Heaven's Son,

120
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,000
loved by all.

121
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,160
It seems Miss Jiuning
has finally come to her senses.

122
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:56,960
I

123
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,080
congratulate Your Majesty.

124
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,320
Jiuning,

125
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,080
Why have you brought me here?

126
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
Silver candles cast autumn light,

127
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
cold screens shimmer.

128
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,240
Gauze fans flutter gently,

129
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,240
capturing dancing fireflies.

130
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,800
That day I came here
with my sister, Talented Lady Wan,

131
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,080
to watch fireflies.

132
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,320
She gained
Your Majesty's favor that night.

133
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,560
Yet that same favor

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,240
brought her doom.

135
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,680
Talented Lady Wan's death
was lamentable.

136
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,480
It pains me too.

137
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,760
Your Majesty,

138
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,720
if my sister could return from the dead,

139
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:50,360
it'd be wonderful.

140
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,680
The departed cannot be revived.

141
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,224
Indeed.

142
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,720
Your Majesty must also have

143
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,320
someone you desperately wish to keep.

144
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,360
I too am flesh and blood.

145
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:08,960
Of course there are those
I can't bear to lose.

146
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,160
Though Your Majesty reigns supreme

147
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,600
as Heaven's chosen,

148
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
wielding celestial power

149
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,920
and boundless authority,

150
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,920
even you cannot defy Heaven's will.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,160
For your departed beloved,

152
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,880
your late Empress,

153
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
even with all your might,

154
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,760
you remain powerless

155
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,080
to restore her to life.

156
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,280
You can only

157
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,440
bury the pain of loss

158
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,840
deep within your heart.

159
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,920
Therefore,

160
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,520
in this world,

161
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,120
even infinite power

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,640
has its limitations.

163
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,920
Your Majesty,

164
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,400
be it imperial nobility

165
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,560
or common folk,

166
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,040
every life is precious.

167
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
My sister shouldn't have been

168
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,560
deemed worthless
due to her humble origins

169
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,440
and casually destroyed.

170
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Is your condition

171
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,000
that I use imperial power

172
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,200
to resurrect your sister?

173
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,280
Your Majesty,

174
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,440
can you do that?

175
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,920
Issue my decree

176
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,680
to release Noble Consort Xian.

177
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,120
Yes.

178
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,144
I heard there are doubts
about Talented Lady Wan's suicide

179
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,160
in the Cold Palace.

180
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,840
She was framed by Consort Shu

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,880
and died wrongfully.

182
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,160
My investigation has revealed

183
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,040
greater crimes

184
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,960
behind Consort Shu.

185
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
With solid evidence now,

186
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,920
I beseech Your Majesty

187
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,320
to judge this fairly

188
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
and uphold the justice.

189
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,240
Consort Shu's case implicates many,

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,640
including imperial kin.

191
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,960
Since I'll grant you status

192
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,480
as my consort,

193
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,520
I'll champion your cause.

194
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,688
If you still refuse the harem,

195
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,960
I'll grant you a chance
to plead your case.

196
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,480
But imperial dignity

197
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,000
must be preserved.

198
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,760
If this case is pursued,

199
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,480
all involved palace members

200
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,240
with knowledge,

201
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,400
including you,

202
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
will face execution.

203
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,640
Are you willing?

204
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,560
If Your Majesty

205
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,960
will champion my justice,

206
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,160
I

207
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
willingly accept death.

208
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
Also, for those

209
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,680
who were implicated

210
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,080
in human trafficking

211
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,160
to die with bitter resentment,

212
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,680
I thank Your Majesty.

213
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,720
Lu Jiuning

214
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,320
What injustice drove Talented Lady Wan

215
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,920
to suicide in Cold Palace?

216
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,680
Explain everything to me.

217
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,800
Your Majesty,

218
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,240
I

219
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,720
originally served
as Talented Lady Wan's attendant.

220
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,480
We entered the palace together

221
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,800
as tribute offerings.

222
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,720
They say

223
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:43,680
Talented Lady Wan
cursed the Empress Dowager

224
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,080
on her birthday banquet,

225
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,040
was confined by Consort Chun,

226
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,960
and took her own life.

227
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,400
But the truth is

228
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
when Talented Lady Wan died,

229
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,600
she was carrying a royal heir.

230
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,840
Consort Chun

231
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,600
coveted her unborn child

232
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,040
to claim as her own

233
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,072
and framed her

234
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,560
to be confined.

235
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,120
Meanwhile, Consort Shu

236
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,640
feared Consort Chun would gain favor
by having that child

237
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,240
and threaten her own position,

238
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,360
so she secretly arranged

239
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,800
to kill Talented Lady Wan.

240
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,480
Consort Shu and Consort Chun

241
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,080
are both responsible
for Talented Lady Wan's death.

242
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,480
I beg your fair judgment.

243
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,360
By this account

244
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,160
Talented Lady Wan's demise mirrors

245
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,920
Consort Chun's use of the physician

246
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,440
and control over Noble Lady Shen

247
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,480
to claim another's child as her own.

248
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,040
Lady Shen was fortunate

249
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,280
to be rescued by you.

250
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,640
Yes.

251
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,824
Talented Lady Wan died unjustly.

252
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,400
She was caught helplessly

253
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
in Consort Chun
and Consort Shu's rivalry.

254
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,840
Her pregnancy caused her death

255
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,840
along with the child's.

256
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,320
Now

257
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,480
the culprit, Consort Shu,

258
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,240
remains unpunished.

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,800
I implore Your Majesty
to deliver justice

260
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,880
and clear

261
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,800
my sister's name.

262
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,720
Summon Consort Shu.

263
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,480
Summon Consort Shu.

264
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,840
Your Majesty.

265
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,160
Consort Shu,

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,520
answer me,

267
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,360
did you murder Talented Lady Wan?

268
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,520
Your Majesty,

269
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,920
I bore no grudge
against Talented Lady Wan.

270
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,480
I never harmed her.

271
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,600
Your Majesty,

272
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,600
your former imperial attendant,

273
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,320
Eunuch Zhang, can verify

274
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,840
Bring him forward.

275
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Summon Eunuch Zhang.

276
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

277
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,760
Eunuch Zhang,

278
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,080
tell me everything

279
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,240
you know

280
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,600
without omission.

281
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,520
Yes,

282
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,400
Your Majesty.

283
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,920
I acted under Consort Shu's orders

284
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,520
to intercept Lu Jiuning

285
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,920
outside the Imperial Study.

286
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,560
We learned from her

287
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,600
that Talented Lady Wan

288
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,776
kept her pregnancy

289
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,960
from Your Majesty.

290
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Consort Shu

291
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,560
then forced me

292
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,320
to threaten Lady Yu, ordering her

293
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,840
to poison Talented Lady Wan

294
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,240
in the Cold Palace,

295
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,720
causing her resentful death.

296
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,840
I...

297
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,120
I deserve death.

298
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
- I deserve death.
- Consort Shu,

299
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,480
anything left to say?

300
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,520
Your Majesty,

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,360
this maid is smooth-tongued
and quick-witted.

302
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,840
She manipulates people.

303
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,280
She even convinced

304
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
Noble Consort Xian

305
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,760
and Lord Ning

306
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,800
to willingly serve

307
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,800
her purposes.

308
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
I've been framed by them.

309
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,680
I've been wronged.

310
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,720
Your Majesty,

311
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,120
the death of my sister

312
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,480
is a personal grudge

313
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,400
between me and Consort Shu.

314
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,640
I can set aside

315
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,880
a personal grudge for now.

316
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,960
But Lord Ning discovered

317
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,000
Consort Shu colluded
with local officials

318
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,240
to traffic and enslave countless people

319
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,840
and amassed vast ill-gotten wealth
through this.

320
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,080
Furthermore,

321
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,800
she misused Your Majesty's
imperial water carts

322
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,200
to smuggle gold out of the palace.

323
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,320
The proof is solid.

324
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,000
She colluded with officials

325
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,120
and broke the law.

326
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,600
For such heinous acts of treason,

327
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,680
she deserves death.

328
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,880
Your Majesty,

329
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,680
it's true.

330
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,800
Child and woman trafficking is rampant.

331
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I've been investigating

332
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,640
to uncover the true mastermind.

333
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,480
After extensive investigations,

334
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,560
all leads we found

335
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,800
point to Consort Shu.
