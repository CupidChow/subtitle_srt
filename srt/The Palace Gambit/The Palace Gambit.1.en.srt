00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:09,984
=The Palace Gambit=

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,192
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,944
(Use Your Brain
Before Seducing His Majesty!)

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,400
Hurry up!

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,040
(My name is Lu Jiuning.)

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,840
(In the eyes of those people,)

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,120
(Lu Jiuning)
(I'm a worthless woman)

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,800
(who only brings losses.)

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
(I can)

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
(never control my own fate.)

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,760
(One month ago,)

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,200
(Wan'er and I
caught the eye of a capital official.)

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,840
(As easily as purchasing
two fine porcelain pieces,)

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,280
(we were bought
from the Imperial Music Bureau)

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,080
(Lijing Pavilion)
(As a gift to please the Emperor,)

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,600
(we were sent to the palace)

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,320
(behind high walls.)

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,600
Come on!

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,280
Go inside.

20
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:27,424
(Lijing Pavilion)

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,720
It's been two hours past lunchtime now.

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,080
They still haven't brought food for you.

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,320
They always mistreat us.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,920
You have

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
(Song Wan'er)
grown thinner.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,480
Later, I'll

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,120
confront them about it.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,152
Jiuning.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
In the harem,

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,640
it's normal to see snobby people.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,480
We have no power.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,240
Their neglect is to be expected.

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,640
Our low birth wasn't our fault!

34
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,680
I hate this unjust world!

35
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:02,040
Wan'er.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,240
Why can't everyone

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,560
be born equal?

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,200
Stop!

39
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,920
(Eunuch Yong, Chief Eunuch)

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,800
For over a month now,

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,280
you've brought nothing but scraps

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,680
and moldy steamed buns!

43
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,640
Eunuch, look.

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000
This spoiled food

45
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,200
is fit for humans?

46
00:02:27,392 --> 00:02:27,904
Listen,

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,320
watch your tone!

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,080
I'm being generous

49
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,840
by even bringing you leftovers.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,360
You should be grateful!

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,680
Besides,

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,480
you two are just tribute

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,440
from a sycophant.

54
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:48,200
You,

55
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,000
kneel!

56
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,040
Lick this mess clean!

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,560
What?

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,200
Calm down!

59
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,680
In the future,

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,200
we'll trouble you

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,720
to take care of us.

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,920
Wan'er.

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,920
Jiuning is young.

64
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
Please don't be mad at her.

65
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,840
Alright.

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,800
Newly presented beauties

67
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,120
can't compare to the noble consorts.

68
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,920
To be blunt,

69
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,280
you're beneath even palace maids.

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,480
Understood?

71
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:16,832
Hmph!

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,320
Outrageous!

73
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
You vile servant!

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,160
How dare you!

75
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,480
Madam Li.

76
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,600
What brings you here?

77
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,760
If I hadn't come,

78
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,240
how would I discover

79
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,160
that a lowly eunuch

80
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,040
(Madam Li, Chief Matron)
dares bully the ladies?

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Beauty Song

82
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
lacks formal rank now,

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,640
but soon

84
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,040
she'll serve the Emperor!

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
I won't let you boldly

86
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,320
humiliate her.

87
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,760
You're right.

88
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,320
I won't do it again.

89
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,840
Get out!

90
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,600
At once!

91
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,640
Beauty Song,

92
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,040
these eunuchs

93
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,360
only bully the weak.

94
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,160
I'm sorry that you're
being unfairly treated.

95
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,880
Thanks for your help.

96
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,360
May I know why you came?

97
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,240
Well,

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,360
I serve Lady Yu.

99
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,240
Today, by her order,

100
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,040
I bring ceremonial clothes for you.

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,240
Ceremonial clothes?

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,560
Indeed.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,040
Lady Yu

104
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,600
heard of you,

105
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,320
a talented beauty.

106
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,360
She guesses

107
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,120
you'll surely be favored.

108
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,320
That's why Lady Yu wants
to befriend you.

109
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,120
From now on,

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,560
you and Lady Yu

111
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,960
can support

112
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,800
and help each other.

113
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,440
I'm grateful for it.

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,360
But I'm from humble beginnings

115
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
and mediocre.

116
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,600
I fear

117
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,400
I'd disgrace Lady Yu.

118
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,560
Beauty Song,

119
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
you're too modest.

120
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,880
Lady Yu mentioned

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,160
tomorrow's banquet.

122
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,960
She specifically ordered me

123
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,160
to prepare new clothes for you.

124
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,280
She hopes

125
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,400
you won't lose face before others.

126
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:01,160
Madam,

127
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
please tell Lady Yu

128
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,120
that I'll personally thank her soon.

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,240
Sure.

130
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,480
Rest now, Beauty Song.

131
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:09,120
I will

132
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
take my leave.

133
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,984
(Lijing Pavilion)

134
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,440
Wan'er.

135
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,320
At tomorrow's banquet,

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,320
will you truly wear this dress?

137
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
In the harem,

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,440
having a backer

139
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,560
is better than surviving alone.

140
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,680
We're newcomers here.

141
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,920
We know nothing about the consorts.

142
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,680
We can't offend anyone.

143
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,640
What kind of person

144
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,600
is Lady Yu?

145
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
No one in the harem

146
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
can live peacefully

147
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,480
or remain neutral.

148
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Lady Yu's overture is obvious.

149
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,480
Perhaps we should

150
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,680
handle this with utmost caution.

151
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:09,960
Yes.

152
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,840
We seek no money or fame.

153
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,040
We only want to survive.

154
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,640
So, we must stay vigilant.

155
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,880
Never entangle ourselves
in harem power struggles.

156
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,600
I understand.

157
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,800
You didn't enter the palace
to vie for favor.

158
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,280
We just

159
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,160
don't want to be traded
like livestock anymore.

160
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,720
Nor end up as courtesans,

161
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,080
like a plaything.

162
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,840
Though palace life is harsh,

163
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,880
it's still better

164
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,960
than being whipped and humiliated daily.

165
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,640
So, for tomorrow's banquet,

166
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,200
we'll wear our own clothes.

167
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,560
We're meeting with the consorts.

168
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,720
We must

169
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,200
be cautious.

170
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:48,000
Agreed.

171
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,240
Work seriously and hold these steady!

172
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,400
These garments

173
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,680
are gifts from the consorts

174
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,360
to new ladies.

175
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,800
Stain any garment,

176
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,360
and I'll skin you alive.

177
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,240
Understood.

178
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:13,120
Madam.

179
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
Where are you going?

180
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Are you new here?

181
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,280
Yes.

182
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,640
For today's banquet,

183
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,720
consorts gift clothes to newcomers.

184
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,680
This displays their generosity

185
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,240
and care for newcomers.

186
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Newcomers will wear
these bestowed clothes

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,960
at the banquet.

188
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,840
It's a way to show their respect.

189
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,600
This is a rule.

190
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,320
We're delivering these clothes

191
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
to all new ladies now.

192
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,840
Go.

193
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,320
What now, Wan'er?

194
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,600
So it's mandatory etiquette.

195
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,120
We can't slight Lady Yu's gesture.

196
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,800
I'll change into her gift.

197
00:07:56,064 --> 00:07:56,640
Okay.

198
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,160
- Greetings,
- Greetings,

199
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,160
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

200
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,520
Rise.

201
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,320
Today,

202
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,600
we gather here.

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,400
(Noble Consort Xian)
As our tradition dictates,

204
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
His Majesty

205
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,520
performs rites this day.

206
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,160
From today,

207
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,440
all consorts

208
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,800
wear plain clothes and fast.

209
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
And chant for three days.

210
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,040
It's to support His Majesty

211
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
and pray for the people.

212
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

213
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,720
- I shall obey
- I shall obey

214
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,240
- and devoutly pray.
- and devoutly pray.

215
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,520
Please sit.

216
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

217
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,600
Have you all heard?

218
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,440
In the harem,

219
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,800
there's another peerless beauty
named Song Wan'er.

220
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,680
(Lady Yu)
They say Beauty Song

221
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
is seductively charming.

222
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,200
With such a temptress here,

223
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,120
the days ahead for all of us

224
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,240
will surely be more eventful.

225
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,640
Among countless beauties in the harem,

226
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,360
those who rely on their looks

227
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
can never last long.

228
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,000
According to regulations,

229
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
those eligible for promotion

230
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,920
(Consort Shu)
must be noblewomen.

231
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,000
A presented beauty is,

232
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,560
at most, ranked as a Talented Lady.

233
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
She's no threat.

234
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,640
Your Highness,

235
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,920
that's not certain.

236
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,120
I hear Beauty Song
is gorgeous and versatile.

237
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,840
When she arrives later,

238
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,800
and you see her in person,

239
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,360
then judge for yourselves.

240
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,200
Lady Yu.

241
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,640
(Consort Chun)
Beauties presented by outer officials

242
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
are merely His Majesty's playthings.

243
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,480
Beguiling as she is,

244
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,480
she can't beat ancestral rules

245
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,720
or trample over others.

246
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
You're right, Your Highness.

247
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,320
Entering the harem,

248
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,680
she belongs to His Majesty.

249
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,400
She's now our sister.

250
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,840
Let us cease such discussions.

251
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,920
Beauty Song arrives.

252
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,120
Greetings, Noble Consort Xian.

253
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,320
Greetings,

254
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,560
Consort Chun, Consort Shu.

255
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,520
Greetings to you all.

256
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,480
(Wan'er.)

257
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,280
(They're wearing plain clothes?)

258
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,320
Audacious!

259
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,320
Today is a fasting and chanting day.

260
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,160
How dare you dress ostentatiously?

261
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,360
You're scorning rules.

262
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,000
Do you have no respect for protocol?

263
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,280
Your Highness, look.

264
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
Dressed like this,

265
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,800
she clearly aims
to outshine all beauties.

266
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,480
Use your brain
before seducing His Majesty!

267
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,480
Can't you recognize today's occasion?

268
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,880
No offense.

269
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,160
Please forgive me.

270
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,440
Beauty Song.

271
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,640
You're wearing a gorgeous dress.

272
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,800
Explain yourself.

273
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,320
Your Highness.

274
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,720
I only knew of today's banquet, fearing

275
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,800
to breach decorum.

276
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
So I wear new clothes.

277
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,560
I beg your forgiveness.

278
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,520
Beauty Song is new here.

279
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,000
Given this first offense...

280
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,360
Your Highness.

281
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
The state has its laws.

282
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
The palace has its rules.

283
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,640
If all could beg mercy after wrongdoing,

284
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,240
what use are regulations?

285
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,720
Consort Chun is right.

286
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,440
Even with her excuses,

287
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
she can't break the rules.

288
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,920
If she doesn't get punished,

289
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,440
all harem members may follow suit.

290
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,160
That would be a disaster.

291
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,320
Your Highness,

292
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,520
Beauty Song scorns rules

293
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,480
and violates protocol.

294
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,760
By regulations,

295
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,320
she should be dragged outside,

296
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,800
stripped of clothes,

297
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,560
and publicly whipped.

298
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,560
Let it be done.

299
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,000
(Someone is framing Wan'er
intentionally.)

300
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,240
Your Highness!

301
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,080
May I say something?

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,160
Go ahead.

303
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,400
Your Highness,

304
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,320
my maid is trying to protect me.

305
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,880
But she has no voice here.

306
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,360
I accept punishment.

307
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,440
May I ask

308
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,776
which one of you is Lady Yu?

309
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,760
I am.

310
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,008
(Chunyu, Lady Yu's Maid)

311
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,680
- Why did you...?
- Shut up!

312
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,760
If you speak again,

313
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,360
I'll cut ties with you.

314
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,560
Come on!

315
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,520
Take them away.

316
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:36,400
- Yes.
- Yes.
