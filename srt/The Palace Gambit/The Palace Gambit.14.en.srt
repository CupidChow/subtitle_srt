00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,256
= Episode 14 =

3
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:14,944
(We'll Meet Again In The Next Life)

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,080
Please investigate!

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,240
You said that I'm manipulated.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,600
Then I'd like to ask

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,000
who is manipulating me.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,720
I long to conceive a royal heir

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,800
for His Majesty.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,800
But when no such blessing exists,

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,400
I would never dare
fabricate such a falsehood.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,560
Clearly, Lady Shen is scared
of Consort Chun

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,560
and too threatened

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,240
to speak.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,240
They're colluding with the physician

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,440
to deceive everyone.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,400
Miss Jiuning,

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,160
you mustn't make baseless accusations!

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,120
You said

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,040
that I bribed the imperial physician

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,360
and manipulated Lady Shen.

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,400
Where is your proof?

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
You can't possibly slander me

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,560
without a shred of evidence!

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,280
Your Majesty,

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,800
I beg you to summon another physician
for re-examination.

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,320
I stake my life on this.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,600
Lady Shen is truly pregnant.

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,200
This concerns the royal heir.

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,640
Please reconsider.

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,920
Noble Consort Xian,
you know medicine well

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,000
and can read pulses.

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,240
Go examine Lady Shen.

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,080
Yes,

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
Your Majesty.

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,880
Your Majesty,

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,520
Lady Shen

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,800
shows no signs of pregnancy.

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
How is this possible?

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,480
Jiuning,

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,720
you disgraced yourself.

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,000
Beg for mercy at once.

43
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,840
I know I was wrong.

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
I beg your forgiveness.

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,880
Noble Consort Xian,

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,680
a maid from your palace dared
accuse without evidence

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,520
before the entire court

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,000
that I bribed the imperial physician

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,240
and manipulated Lady Shen.

50
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,760
Did you train her to be this audacious?

51
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Or did she act recklessly

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,080
because you shielded her?

53
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,440
She's turned this Dragon Boat banquet
into chaos.

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,520
Is this how

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360
you normally instruct your maids

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,160
to disregard law and order,

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,760
acting without restraint?

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,680
Your Majesty,

59
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
I've failed in disciplining.

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
I willingly accept punishment.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,120
Noble Consort Xian has shown
incompetent governance.

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
Revoke Phoenix Seal.

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,904
She's confined to Yongxiu Palace
for self-reflection.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,240
All Yongxiu Palace staff
forfeit a year's wages.

65
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,800
Yongxiu Palace maid Lu Jiuning,

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
for slandering consorts

67
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,080
and insubordination,
shall get 50 strikes.

68
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Guards!

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,880
Take her away!

70
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,840
- Yes!
- Yes!

71
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,440
Now that you understand the truth,

72
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,000
don't be foolish.

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,040
Your Highness,

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
I'd never dare deceive you.

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,680
Last night,

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,960
Lu Jiuning

77
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,720
planned for me to eat greasy food

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,840
to induce vomiting

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,280
at the Dragon Boat banquet,

80
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,360
and then have the attending physician

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,800
declare my pregnancy.

82
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,440
Lu Jiuning

83
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,640
schemed against me
with elaborate cunning.

84
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,192
Chief Physician Zhang.

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

86
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,800
Your Highness, what are you doing?

87
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,840
Your Highness!

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,000
Lady Shen,

89
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,600
there's no need for fear.

90
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,640
This silver needle will pierce
your maihui acupoint.

91
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,480
Once embedded,

92
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,840
it suppresses pregnancy pulses,

93
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,640
making them undetectable.

94
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,840
No physician could diagnose

95
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,080
your condition accurately.

96
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,320
Lady Shen,

97
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,480
don't worry.

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,760
You just follow
Lu Jiuning's instructions.

99
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,840
I'll turn her scheme against her

100
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,560
and uproot Yongxiu Palace completely.

101
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,880
The Empress Dowager has arrived.

102
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,480
- Long life and health to Your Majesty.
- Long life and health to Your Majesty.

103
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,840
Greetings, Mother.

104
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,360
At ease.

105
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,400
Lord Ning,

106
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,320
I thought you wouldn't attend today.

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,200
So you went to escort my mother instead.

108
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,400
Your Majesty,

109
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,280
it's the Dragon Boat Festival.

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,080
Ancient people prayed for safety

111
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,960
and blessings.

112
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
With everyone gathering here today,

113
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
I'll join the fun.

114
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,640
Since it's an auspicious occasion,

115
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,560
why are they

116
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,840
punishing maids outside?

117
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,320
A maid suspected

118
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,640
a consort of hiding a pregnancy.

119
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,120
Don't mind it, Mother.

120
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,680
Mother,

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
please take a seat.

122
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
You manage countless state affairs

123
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,640
and are devoted to governance,

124
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:07,880
but

125
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,200
continuing the imperial lineage

126
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,440
remains your foremost obligation.

127
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,440
Only with thriving descendants

128
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,360
can the empire endure for millennia!

129
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,440
- We heed Your Majesty's wisdom.
- We heed Your Majesty's wisdom.

130
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
I beg your forgiveness.

131
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,320
Consort Chun,

132
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,520
what are you doing?

133
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,760
Your Majesty,

134
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,240
actually,

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,080
I am pregnant.

136
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,840
The Imperial Hospital has recorded it,

137
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,600
but the physician said

138
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,200
I'm too weak,

139
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,240
with unstable fetus

140
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,800
and a risk of miscarriage.

141
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,640
I couldn't bear to trouble
Your Majesty with this worry.

142
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,440
Hence, my silence until now.

143
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,920
Rise, my love.

144
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,160
Consort Chun has served for years

145
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,560
without conceiving.

146
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,000
Now, she's finally pregnant.

147
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,920
Truly cause for celebration!

148
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,320
- Congratulations on the royal heir.
- Congratulations on the royal heir.

149
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,160
Your Majesty,

150
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
since Consort Chun is pregnant,

151
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,880
she shouldn't see blood.

152
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
On such a joyous day, why not

153
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,080
let the maid go

154
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,200
unpunished

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,680
for good fortune?

156
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,288
Lord Ning, you speak wisely.

157
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,040
Suspend her flogging.

158
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,560
Thanks for your mercy
on Jiuning's behalf.

159
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,520
Rise, Noble Consort Xian.

160
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,600
Thank you.

161
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,480
Consort Chun rendered great merit today.

162
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,480
Name your reward, my love.

163
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,040
I shall grant it generously.

164
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,720
Your Majesty, your previous gifts

165
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,720
already overflow my chambers.

166
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,720
Instead,

167
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,280
may I request a companion?

168
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,800
Who?

169
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,360
Lady Shen.

170
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
We share kindred spirits

171
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,520
and often keep each other company,

172
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,240
but her distant residence
hinders visits.

173
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
If she could move to Chengxi Palace,

174
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,680
we might better support each other,

175
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,040
alleviating my solitary days.

176
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:10,880
Granted.

177
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,440
Lady Shen

178
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
shall live in Chengxi Palace's annex.

179
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,640
Move there tomorrow.

180
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you, Your Highness.

181
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,640
Your Highness,

182
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,280
Lady Shen has moved in.

183
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,824
Greetings, Your Highness.

184
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,320
You fear me?

185
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:47,520
No.

186
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,160
I wouldn't dare.

187
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
To serve you

188
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,600
is my greatest honor.

189
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,320
You carry my child now.

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,960
How could I let fear distress you?

191
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,168
Thanks...

192
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,360
Don't kneel so much.

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,920
You'll harm the baby.

194
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,440
You did well this time.

195
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,720
You not only revealed
Lu Jiuning's scheme to me,

196
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,000
but also enacted
that brilliant charade,

197
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,280
taking away Noble Consort Xian's seal.

198
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't worry.

199
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
Once you deliver the child,

200
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,760
you'll receive abundant rewards.

201
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you.

202
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
Thank you.

203
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,880
Thank you.

204
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,520
Go settle down.

205
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,120
I'll take my leave.

206
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,440
This crucial matter is finally settled.

207
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,080
My brother has secretly taken control
of Lady Shen's family.

208
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,800
Inform him

209
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
that after our success,

210
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,640
none shall be spared.

211
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes, Your Highness.

212
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,400
Moreover,

213
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,600
tell Physician Zhang
to check my pulse regularly

214
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
and prescribe prenatal remedies.

215
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,840
Don't let anyone notice

216
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,480
that I'm not truly pregnant.

217
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,680
Yes.

218
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,280
Serves her right.

219
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,048
Exactly.

220
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,520
Stay away.

221
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,120
Bad luck.

222
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Hurry, let's go.

223
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,080
Lu Jiuning,

224
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,600
you publicly slandered Consort Chun,

225
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,160
yet managed to escape death.

226
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,680
You got lucky this time.

227
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,880
Didn't we agree

228
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,920
to expose Consort Chun's schemes?

229
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,960
Why did you go back on your word?

230
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
Save your breath.

231
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,480
Are you the only clever one?

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,240
Consort Chun knew you approached me
with malicious intentions,

233
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,960
so she played along with your scheme

234
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,800
to eliminate you,

235
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,080
and simultaneously

236
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,080
drag Noble Consort Xian down with you.

237
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,000
To challenge Consort Chun,

238
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,920
you're too inexperienced.

239
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,920
Only by following

240
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,240
the noble Consort Chun

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
will I find the proper path.

242
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,000
You're beyond cure

243
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
and utterly hopeless.

244
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,240
You'd rather stake everything

245
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,200
on an uncertain future

246
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
than face the reality.

247
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,560
What utter foolishness!

248
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,600
You'll regret this.

249
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,600
This world is rigidly stratified,

250
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,640
with clear hierarchies.

251
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,680
The immense power and wealth

252
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,880
are beyond anything
we could earn in a lifetime.

253
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,200
But I...

254
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
As long as I deliver this child,

255
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
I'll rise above all others.

256
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,800
From then on,

257
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
my family

258
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,640
will never be trampled underfoot again.

259
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,200
Who wouldn't be tempted by this?

260
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,920
From this moment,

261
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,200
your life starts its countdown.

262
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,520
We'll meet again in the next life.

263
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,160
Is that so?

264
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
We'll see about that.

265
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,600
Your Highness,

266
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,280
Lady Shen struck Lu Jiuning today.

267
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
They've completely fallen out.

268
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,360
Lady Shen

269
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,360
is indeed a status-seeking opportunist.

270
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,920
She followed your instructions,

271
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,680
nearly finishing off Lu Jiuning.

272
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
You truly

273
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
remain several steps ahead.

274
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,120
When people have ambitions,

275
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,160
they become easier to manipulate.

276
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,640
You're truly brilliant.

277
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,680
Lu Jiuning relied
on her petty cleverness

278
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,600
and caused trouble.

279
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,760
She is in no position
to stir anything up now.

280
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,400
She is just a maid.

281
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,000
Crushing her is much easier.

282
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,360
Yes, Your Highness.

283
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
Everything looks fine.

284
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,480
Chief Physician Zhang.

285
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,056
Yes.

286
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,680
I entrust my pregnancy to your care.

287
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,680
Keep Imperial Hospital's records

288
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,280
straight.

289
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,400
Don't let anything slip.

290
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,840
Rest assured, Your Highness.

291
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,480
Your prenatal records

292
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,880
will mirror Lady Shen's

293
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,800
actual condition.

294
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,840
Nothing will go wrong.

295
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,640
Good.

296
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,280
Now, we'll await

297
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,160
Lady Shen

298
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,520
to deliver a healthy prince for me.

299
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,360
You two, clean this place up properly.

300
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

301
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,760
How dare she come?

302
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,160
Xiaotao,

303
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,120
here.

304
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,880
We wouldn't dare trouble you.

305
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,360
Jiuning,

306
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,080
don't take it personally.

307
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,240
Yunxiang,

308
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,560
we all had our salaries suspended
for a year.

309
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,440
How dare you approach this jinx?

310
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,920
Exactly!

311
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,880
Jiuning once saved my life
when I was in danger.

312
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,600
Don't treat her this way.

313
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,960
Yunxiang,

314
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,400
she slandered Consort Chun
like mad that day,

315
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,920
making our salaries suspended.

316
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,920
It even cost Her Highness
the Phoenix Seal.

317
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,000
Today,

318
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,560
she's the sinner of Yongxiu Palace,

319
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,660
our collective enemy!

320
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,920
- Exactly!
- She dares show up?

321
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
You jinx! You're good for nothing!

322
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,680
- Useless one!
- Exactly!

323
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,240
- What do you take us for?
- Your fault!

324
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,520
- All because of her!
- Yunxiang,

325
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
you were right.

326
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
She joined Yongxiu Palace

327
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,520
with ulterior motives.

328
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,240
She aimed to use Her Highness

329
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,320
against Consort Chun.

330
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
- That's right!
- That's right!

331
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,680
What's this argument about?

332
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
What crime is it
to disturb Her Highness?

333
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,480
Jiuning, Her Highness let you come in.

334
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,640
Yes.

335
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,640
Do you confess?

336
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,440
Jiuning,

337
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,840
Her Highness warned you
not to act rashly.

338
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,640
By slandering a consort publicly,

339
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,160
you dragged her into trouble

340
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,240
and got her confined.

341
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,320
Have you no remorse?

342
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,320
Consort Chun abuses power

343
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,120
and takes lives lightly

344
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
I'll avenge Wan'er

345
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,960
and stop her

346
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
from harming innocents.

347
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,280
I miscalculated this time.

348
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
But even with her immense power,

349
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
as long as I am alive,

350
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,800
I'll fight her to the end.

351
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,840
How dare you!

352
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,840
If you remain arrogant

353
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,200
and reckless,

354
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,040
you'll not only fail to avenge Wan'er,

355
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,440
but also lose your own life!

356
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,080
Hasn't this bloody lesson
taught you anything?

357
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,240
What are you thinking?

358
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,200
They're right.

359
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,960
I joined Yongxiu Palace

360
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,560
just to use you

361
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,520
against Consort Chun.

362
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
Now, I've brought ruin
upon Yongxiu Palace.

363
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,160
I've failed you.

364
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,000
I beg your permission
to leave Yongxiu Palace.

365
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,920
You...

366
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,360
You...

367
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,400
Your Highness!

368
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,720
How dare you!

369
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,720
Yongxiu Palace

370
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,880
isn't some place
you enter and leave at will!

371
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,440
Your Highness.

372
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,520
Let her go.

373
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,120
Once you leave,

374
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,800
never return.

375
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,000
Thank you,

376
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,320
Your Highness.
