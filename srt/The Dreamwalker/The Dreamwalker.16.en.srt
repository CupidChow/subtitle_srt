1
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,400
Found it.

2
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,480
I finally found it.

3
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,720
Turns out, the treasure I sought

4
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,239
was always hidden in this village.

5
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,760
And you’re still not scared off?

6
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:41,480
Rooster crows, lamp dies, no touching gold.

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,680
A Gou is here to score big.

8
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:50,639
Let me take a look.

9
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,919
What’s going on?

10
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,800
What’s the situation here?

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,760
No hesitation.

12
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,480
The treasure must be inside.

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,960
Oh my goodness!

14
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,720
The person we just mentioned—

15
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,639
Do you know him?

16
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,839
I know him.

17
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,279
He’s from out of town.

18
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,559
Don’t be fooled by his glasses and manners.

19
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,919
He’s a grave robber.

20
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,880
How do you know he robs graves?

21
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,119
Do you know where we are?

22
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,679
This is an ancient capital of the Central Plains.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
Tombs and graves everywhere.

24
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,919
Grave robbers all over the place.

25
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,880
When he first arrived in town,

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,800
he sneakily asked me about

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,399
the locations of Xiaoshang Village’s tombs.

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,240
Later on,

29
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,639
he dug holes every day.

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,679
If he’s not a grave robber,

31
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,880
what else could he be?

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,839
Exactly, exactly.

33
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,679
He often came to our shop

34
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,279
to ask about ancient tombs.

35
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,279
No wonder he died so strangely.

36
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,000
For sure,

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,759
he must’ve angered something unclean in the tomb.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,639
Don’t believe every rumor.

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,039
It was that grave robber—

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,960
He broke the rules.

41
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,520
Took what he shouldn’t have.

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,759
That’s why he was cursed.

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,279
A curse?

44
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,919
Yes, a curse.

45
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,520
That grave robber’s body—

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,360
didn’t you and Wang Mazi find it together?

47
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,399
Tell us about it.

48
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,000
That night,

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,279
I shouldn’t have cut through the graveyard.

50
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:29,919
Hurry up, hurry up!

51
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,240
Look at you, so scared.

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,639
There aren’t any new graves here.

53
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,880
Just ancient tombs everywhere.

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,600
Grave robbers have dug them all up.

55
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,720
Nothing to be afraid of.

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,199
Let’s go.

57
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,119
Who’s scared?

58
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,639
It’s late at night—

59
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:52,800
I can’t see the path.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,639
Wait for me!

61
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
What’s that?

62
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,919
A person.

63
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,399
How could a person float?

64
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,839
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,559
A ghost!

66
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,360
That’s a ghost!

67
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,559
Come on, come on!

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,799
Such a coward.

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,320
Always scaring yourself.

70
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,959
Look over here.

71
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,040
It’s just a scarecrow.

72
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,160
Nothing scary about it.

73
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,040
See?

74
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,160
So timid.

75
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,000
Who’s crazy enough

76
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,279
to tie a scarecrow to a tree?

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,920
Go.

78
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,519
A ghost!

79
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,200
Its eyes are gone.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,160
Blood’s coming out of every orifice.

81
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,279
It was terrifying.

82
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,799
This Mr. Luo—

83
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,959
he used to visit my shop often.

84
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,679
Now he’s died so horribly.

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
It’s really frightening.

86
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,760
So, Mr. Luo’s body—

87
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,640
where is it now?

88
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
It’s that person.

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,519
Is there only one body?

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,359
Yes.

91
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,920
Has the body been examined?

92
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,559
Prince,

93
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,839
our Patrol and Inspection Office

94
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,720
doesn’t have a coroner.

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,320
But don’t worry.

96
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,399
I’ll get someone from the county right away.

97
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,519
Let me take a look first.

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,480
No coroner?

99
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,640
Then is there anyone

100
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,079
who can investigate crimes?

101
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,040
Prince,

102
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,640
in our area,

103
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,440
him and me,

104
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,440
there are five of us.

105
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,720
Prince, rest assured.

106
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,959
Our Patrol and Inspection Office is small,

107
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,920
but we never slack off.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
These are the things from his luggage.

109
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,160
Go ahead,

110
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,799
what have you all found?

111
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,920
Don’t tell me after all these days,

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
you’ve found nothing.

113
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Prince,

114
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,720
everyone in town says

115
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,480
he robbed a tomb he shouldn’t have.

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,239
He broke a taboo, that’s why this happened.

117
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,959
You saw his body too.

118
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:34,519
This is no ordinary death.

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,799
Definitely not ordinary.

120
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,839
His eyes were gouged out.

121
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,519
His limbs were broken.

122
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,160
He was tortured before death.

123
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,799
This was done by a person.

124
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,279
Ghosts don’t have time for that.

125
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,320
What kind of grudge

126
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:53,839
would lead to such torture?

127
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,880
We’ll only know after we investigate.

128
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,679
Luo Yurong has been here for two months.

129
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,079
Has he offended anyone here,

130
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,399
or maybe

131
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,559
gotten into any trouble?

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,959
Actually, there is someone.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,200
That guy—

134
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,119
He’s definitely provoked him.

135
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,480
It’s like a leech you can’t shake off.

136
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,480
Really persistent.

137
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,959
Watch where you’re going!

138
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,519
Fragrant pear.

139
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,679
Fragrant pear.

140
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Master Jiao.

141
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,559
Fragrant pear, fragrant pear.

142
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,760
Master Jiao, grab two pears to eat.

143
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,720
Go on, go.

144
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
Don’t mess around with me.

145
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,559
I’ll pay you.

146
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,760
Stop trying to trick me.

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,480
I said I’ll pay you.

148
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,239
This, this—

149
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,160
I’ve got money.

150
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,920
Two copper coins.

151
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,519
Two coins, right?

152
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,119
Two copper coins.

153
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,320
If you can catch me,

154
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,239
I’ll give you the money.

155
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,720
You, you—

156
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,760
I won’t give it to you.

157
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,720
You filthy grave robber, trying to trick me!

158
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,399
Get lost!

159
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,640
I’m not a grave robber.

160
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,359
Over there.

161
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,040
You dirtied my pear.

162
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,880
So, what now?

163
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:07,600
I—

164
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,320
I’ll wipe it for you.

165
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,920
My back

166
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,959
got hurt by your lousy box too.

167
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,040
So, what now?

168
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,640
I—

169
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,880
I’ll help you to the clinic.

170
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,200
Consultation fee.

171
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,880
You have to pay me first.

172
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,520
Otherwise, you’ll run off.

173
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,919
How would I find you then?

174
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,000
Right, stranger?

175
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,000
A Gou.

176
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,520
What are you up to?

177
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,440
Up to your usual tricks again?

178
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,280
No.

179
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,239
His box hit and hurt me.

180
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,039
He should pay my medical bills, right?

181
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,159
Right now I—

182
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,039
This, this—

183
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,080
It really hurts.

184
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,359
See?

185
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:57,719
Faking it.

186
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,679
Keep pretending.

187
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,799
It hurts just because you say so?

188
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,320
Ignore him.

189
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,479
He’s the local thug.

190
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,159
Stay away from him in the future.

191
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,799
Go on.

192
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,679
Thanks, thanks.

193
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,880
Don’t go!

194
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,400
Damn grave robber!

195
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,559
What did you do?

196
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,479
I just told you,

197
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,400
his box hit my back.

198
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
Don’t pull me, don’t pull me!

199
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,719
I’ll let go, fine.

200
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,559
Stop doing shady things.

201
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,919
Make our town proud for once.

202
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:26,679
Alright, alright.

203
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,840
Let’s go.

204
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,280
Fine, I’m leaving.

205
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,280
Damn fool.

206
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,440
Just go die already!

207
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,159
You dare hit me? Go on, hit!

208
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,359
You must have a death wish!

209
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,760
Prince.

210
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,799
Prince, this is A Gou’s home.

211
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,679
This kid

212
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,840
is a notorious local thug.

213
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,000
Always cheating, stealing, causing trouble.

214
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,559
Never does anything decent.

215
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,400
This dream isn’t Luo Yurong’s.

216
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,919
It’s A Gou’s.

217
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,880
Then he probably—

218
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,799
Something’s wrong.

219
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:55,640
Prince.

220
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,159
What happened here?

221
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,200
Looks like a robbery.

222
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
Or maybe he ran off.

223
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,719
No, he didn’t.

224
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,440
There’s a weapon mark here.

225
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,760
It looks odd.

226
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,960
Not a knife.

227
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,400
Not a sword either.

228
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,719
A dart?

229
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,359
Not quite.

230
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,039
Really strange mark.

231
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,440
Where have I seen this before?

232
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,440
Prince.

233
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,520
Prince.

234
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,599
This belongs to Luo Yurong.

235
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,400
I’ve seen it.

236
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,320
Case solved!

237
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,960
A Gou definitely did this.

238
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,159
He stole Luo Yurong’s stuff first,

239
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,599
then killed Luo Yurong,

240
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,119
and finally fled in fear.

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,119
That’s all there is.

242
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:47,840
Nothing else.

243
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,880
That’s it.

244
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,280
Go check for more clues.

245
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,840
The punishment on Luo Yurong

246
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
was very precise.

247
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,719
No way a thug like A Gou

248
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:05,679
could pull that off.

249
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
Now it seems

250
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,280
there’s another force involved.

251
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,679
They’re searching for something.

252
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,799
Chasing down Luo Yurong.

253
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,080
And judging by the dream,

254
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,840
it seems more like

255
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,799
A Gou stole Luo Yurong’s belongings.

256
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,520
Our top priority now

257
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,880
is to figure out

258
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,760
what Luo Yurong came to Xiaoshang Village for,

259
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,679
and to find A Gou’s body.

260
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,840
Prince.

261
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,440
You have four officers here,

262
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
plus me,

263
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,919
that’s five.

264
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,080
In the county,

265
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,919
there should be a squad of Imperial Guards.

266
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,840
Take my badge and call them over.

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
Have them search for A Gou’s body.

268
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,280
A Gou is dead.

269
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
You want me to summon the Imperial Guards?

270
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,080
Yes, sir.

271
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,159
So that means,

272
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,039
Luo Yurong must have found something

273
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,039
extraordinarily rare treasure.

274
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,719
That's why he was hunted down.

275
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,440
Based on the clues we have now,

276
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,799
A Gou's obsession

277
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,239
should also be related to this item.

278
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,840
What exactly is this thing?

279
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,559
Someone is following us.
