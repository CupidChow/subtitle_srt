1
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,959
This girl was born with Yin Bones.

2
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,319
She even dared to tear the talisman.

3
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,680
She deserves to be the formation core.

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,599
To suppress the resentful energy in this mountain.

5
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,040
Mother.

6
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,080
Mother.

7
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,879
Please save me, Mother!

8
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:13,879
I'm your daughter, Mother!

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,919
Mother! Mother!

10
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,239
I won't let any of you go.

11
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,919
I'll become a vengeful ghost.

12
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,879
And return to kill every one of you.

13
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:30,279
Everyone.

14
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,519
Zhang.

15
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:52,239
Seal the coffin.

16
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,120
Bury her.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,919
Qiuju.

18
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,559
Qiuju.

19
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,160
Qiuju.

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,440
The air is dry.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,759
Be careful with fire.

22
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,240
That's so interesting.

23
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,199
You know what?

24
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,639
You're not the first to want me dead.

25
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,440
Are you sure this is the place?

26
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,399
Of course.

27
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,880
We saw it clearly in the dream.

28
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,799
There.

29
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,239
The village chief sacrificed himself.

30
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:27,119
He shielded us from evil spirits.

31
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,200
His merit is complete.

32
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:33,640
He has ascended to immortality.

33
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,000
Heifeng leads the way.

34
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,880
Heifeng leads the way.

35
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,079
Sacred Emperor protects.

36
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,399
Sacred Emperor protects.

37
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,920
All my disciples,

38
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,519
All my disciples,

39
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,359
All disasters are gone.

40
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,519
All disasters are gone.

41
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,279
I know about the Heifeng Cult.

42
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,239
As far as I know,

43
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,079
It was popular in Shandong and Henan a few years ago.

44
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,320
There were many followers.

45
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,720
They caused a lot of trouble.

46
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,200
Later,

47
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,959
The court sent people to deal with them.

48
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,119
They've vanished these past years.

49
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,480
I didn't expect

50
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,000
they'd hide in this remote place.

51
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,959
And harm the villagers.

52
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,079
That leader just now

53
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,160
was one of the killers who buried the girl alive in the dream.

54
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,839
What you saw in the Seven Stars dream

55
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,600
was likely Heifeng Cult performing a live sacrifice.

56
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,119
That mother was probably avenging her child.

57
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,799
They could even do such things.

58
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,640
Looks like the whole village

59
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,079
is completely under Heifeng Cult's control.

60
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,839
There.

61
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,160
That's where Zhang died.

62
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,119
Why are you running?

63
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,480
You're not from this village.

64
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,480
Miss,

65
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,279
could you help me with something?

66
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,440
Thank you.

67
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,320
There have been deaths in the village
one after another lately.

68
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,839
Rumor has it

69
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,760
Chu Yao turned into a ghost
and is killing people.

70
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,480
Everyone is terrified.

71
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,200
Hardly anyone walks the streets now.

72
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,279
I took this chance

73
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,040
to burn some paper money for Chu Yao.

74
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,799
When you came back,

75
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,839
I thought the villagers had found me.

76
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,920
That's why I ran.

77
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,679
Is Chu Yao the girl who was sacrificed?

78
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,399
Are you...

79
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,320
Sent by the authorities
to investigate the Heifeng Cult?

80
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:18,200
We...

81
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,119
We are the authorities.

82
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,640
Don't doubt it.

83
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,000
We're pretty high-ranking officials.

84
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:26,839
So tell us about the Heifeng Cult,

85
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,839
Chu Yao,

86
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,279
and the ghost killings.

87
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't worry.

88
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,920
I, as an official,

89
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
will stand up for you.

90
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,200
Sir,

91
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,479
you must destroy the Heifeng Cult.

92
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,719
They swindle money

93
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,960
and harm the people.

94
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,840
Chu Yao was killed by them.

95
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,119
Chu Yao's parents were Heifeng Cult followers.

96
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,840
They were obsessed to a fanatical degree.

97
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,119
The Heifeng Calamity is coming.

98
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,640
Only by following the Heifeng Cult

99
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,799
can we survive this disaster.

100
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,239
If you don't believe,

101
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
you'll ruin our blessings.

102
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,840
Do you want your mother and me
to die before you

103
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,599
before you believe?

104
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,400
If you don't believe, get out.

105
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,960
Your life or death is none of my concern.

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,479
Go.

107
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,119
Mother! Mother!

108
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
The Heifeng Cult is evil.

109
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,799
It will ruin you.

110
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,760
Come with me.

111
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,159
Let's leave this place together.

112
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,559
You worthless child!

113
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,119
I don't care if you live or die.

114
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,799
If you insult the Sacred Cult,

115
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,799
you'll be punished.

116
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,440
Go.

117
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,000
You are a cult!

118
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,760
I'll report you to the authorities!

119
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,320
Later, Heiye and the village chief found out.

120
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,719
Chu Yao kept urging my second aunt
to leave the Heifeng Cult.

121
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,880
She even wanted to report them.

122
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,159
They claimed to be exorcising evil spirits

123
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,599
and buried Chu Yao alive.

124
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,640
By the time I learned of it,
it was too late.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,919
I really don't understand

126
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:39,919
how parents can be so cruel.

127
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,359
She was their own daughter.

128
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,440
The cult's mind control

129
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,479
is the root of all this chaos.

130
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,400
The Heifeng Cult must be destroyed.

131
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:50,280
Don't worry.

132
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,239
I, as an official,

133
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,159
will stand up for you.

134
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,640
What's with the ghost killings?

135
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,640
Now the Heifeng Cult blames the village chief

136
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,919
and Zhang, Chu Yao's mother, for the deaths

137
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,640
all on the vengeful ghost?

138
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,719
Yes.

139
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,840
The Heifeng Cult fears exposure,

140
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,080
so they claim Chu Yao herself is the evil ghost.

141
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,200
They risked exorcising her and suffered backlash.

142
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,919
But if you ask me,

143
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,599
she's no evil ghost.

144
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,159
She's clearly a wronged spirit.

145
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,640
Chu Yao suffered terrible injustice.

146
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,440
She deserves to return for revenge.

147
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,679
What about Zhang?

148
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,880
Did Chu Yao's spirit kill her own mother too?

149
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:28,520
My second aunt is pitiful,

150
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,760
but the pitiful have their faults.

151
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,119
No matter how timid or scared she was,

152
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
she shouldn't have helped them kill Chu Yao.

153
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,280
But in my opinion,

154
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,919
it's my uncle who deserves to die.

155
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,200
But with so many dead in the village,

156
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,359
why is Chu Yao's father untouched?

157
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,880
He's not untouched.

158
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,039
He's been scared out of his wits.

159
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,359
He's been bedridden for days.

160
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,080
No, no, it wasn't me!

161
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,840
It wasn't me!

162
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,880
It was Heiye.

163
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,359
Heiye said you were evil.

164
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,159
He made me do it, all of it!

165
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,840
Even if you become a ghost,

166
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,479
I'm still your father!

167
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,719
Get out! Get out!

168
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,200
Why did he faint?

169
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,719
Stop fooling around.

170
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,359
I didn't scare him.

171
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,679
What's going on here?

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,080
In the dream, when Zhang Guifen killed,

173
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,840
she wore this same red ritual robe.

174
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,559
It seems those murders

175
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,559
are also linked to Zhang.

176
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,359
Th-three honored guests...

177
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,679
Th-this is...

178
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,320
What do you want from me?

179
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,599
Arrest the suspect!

180
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,599
You interrogate him.

181
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,679
I'll go stretch my legs.

182
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,400
This Prince

183
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,840
is quite amusing.

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,760
You!

185
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,799
Who are you?

186
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,440
Your ancestor!

187
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,320
If you oppose the Heifeng Cult,

188
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,520
you're an evil heretic.

189
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,880
Arrest him!

190
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,119
Where did this robe come from?

191
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,039
Uh...

192
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,479
I don't know.

193
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,280
That's the lamest excuse.

194
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,919
You're just wasting my time.

195
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:08,679
Fuyi,

196
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,039
how do I usually teach you?

197
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,479
To be patient, Master.

198
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,239
You could bury your own daughter alive.

199
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,520
Now that things are like this,

200
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,960
what are you still afraid of?

201
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,760
Listen up.

202
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,080
My patience ends here.

203
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,080
If you don't tell the truth now,

204
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,479
what you did to Chu Yao,

205
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,280
I'll do the same to you.

206
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:37,880
Answer me!

207
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,080
This red ritual robe—

208
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,719
what's the story behind it?

209
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,880
I'll tell you.

210
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,960
Th-this robe belonged to that wretched woman.

211
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,520
She was possessed by Chu Yao.

212
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,159
Chu Yao brought it out from the grave.
