1
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,159
Only summon me alone.

2
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,000
Then I'll go change into court attire.

3
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,279
Fifth Young Lord,

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,919
The Empress Dowager knows you have returned.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,560
She sent an urgent summons right away.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,919
No need to change into court attire.

7
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,360
Hurry and come with this old servant.

8
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,919
So when the fight breaks out later,

9
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,720
we just take the chance to escape.

10
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,239
Right?

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,639
Let's run first, talk later.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,519
That way, he won't get involved.

13
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,440
Then how will Fifth Young Lord find me later?

14
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:13,639
How about

15
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:14,879
leaving him a note?

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,480
Miss He,

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,319
please come with us.

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,120
You just need to create chaos.

19
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,959
Don't worry about anything else.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,199
Then I'll have to offend you.

21
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,680
Protect Miss He well.

22
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,919
What do you want with my young disciple?

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,039
Master,

24
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,039
Yun Yi, why are you here?

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,320
Before we parted last time,

26
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,080
didn't I promise you all

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
that once I reached the capital,

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,320
I'd come find you?

29
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,279
We shouldn't stay here long.

30
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,600
Let's leave first, then talk.

31
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,559
What's wrong, Fuyi?

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,839
I promised Bai Yintu I'd wait for him.

33
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,320
Then leave him a note first.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,399
Alright.

35
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,360
Fuyi,

36
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,520
Just write "Don't worry" on it.

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,960
Okay.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,720
Prince,

39
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,039
I don't know how it happened to be so coincidental.

40
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:52,080
Prince Ning just had an urgent report for the Empress Dowager.

41
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,559
Prince,

42
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,360
sorry to trouble you.

43
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,919
You made a wasted trip.

44
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,119
It's fine, it's fine.

45
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,160
Then I'll wait for the Empress Dowager's summons.

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,199
See you later, Master Xia.

47
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:00,679
Alright.

48
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,880
Yiru,

49
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,920
This is really impressive.

50
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,160
Yun Yi,

51
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,440
What's going on with He Fuyi?

52
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,839
Why has she

53
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,200
ignored me the whole way?

54
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,119
Don't worry.

55
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,320
She was just hit by a hypnosis technique.

56
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,959
Hypnosis?

57
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,600
It's like someone opened her mind

58
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,000
and wrote inside it.

59
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,799
Then whatever they want her to do,

60
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,279
she has to do it?

61
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Little Aqi,

62
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,279
you're so clever.

63
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,119
That's exactly right.

64
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,760
If they can write inside,

65
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,799
they can also erase her memories.

66
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:48,440
Right?

67
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,079
It seems

68
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,279
you already know quite a lot.

69
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,239
Fuyi,

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,079
wake up.

71
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,320
Master,

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,679
where is this?

73
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,079
Fuyi,

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,399
Ten years as master and disciple,

75
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,799
don't pretend in front of me.

76
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Besides,

77
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,720
you're not good at lying.

78
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,480
Is it really you?

79
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,640
Master,

80
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,920
To take the Seven Stars Lamp,

81
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,880
you killed the imperial secret agent,

82
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,959
and the one behind the massacre of my family—

83
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,040
was it really you?

84
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,799
That's right.

85
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,799
It was me.

86
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
One more thing—

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,720
besides them,

88
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,399
there was also your father.

89
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:06,959
Father...

90
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,760
Fuyi,

91
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,279
do you remember where Aunt's house is?

92
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Run forward.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,799
Don't look back.

94
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,959
Father...

95
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,920
Quick!

96
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,359
Go now!

97
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,440
Father...

98
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,399
Hurry!

99
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,399
Go!

100
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,200
Head Escort He,

101
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,119
if you want your daughter to live,

102
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,600
you shouldn't have given her that thing.

103
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,399
Everyone in Zhenhuan Biaoju,

104
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,559
so many people—

105
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,880
do they all

106
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,959
know the lamp's origin?

107
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,160
Aren't you all the same,

108
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,600
ruthless to the end?

109
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,920
You found out.

110
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,720
Little girl,

111
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,720
give me the package.

112
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,040
You killed my father!

113
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,400
You truly are He Baosheng's daughter—

114
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,080
you've got some backbone.

115
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,880
But...

116
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
you're quite an interesting girl.

117
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,359
I'll never forget

118
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,559
the look in your eyes as you fell.

119
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,760
So calm.

120
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,880
And then?

121
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,000
Why didn't you just take the Seven Stars Lamp then?

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,479
Why did you save me?

123
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,280
Why did you hypnotize me?

124
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,000
What do you think

125
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,039
the Seven Stars Lamp really is?

126
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,200
To extend life and longevity,

127
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,599
or perhaps

128
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,799
to summon souls and thoughts?

129
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,919
Few people throughout history truly know.

130
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,080
As an ancient artifact,

131
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,039
the Seven Stars Lamp's true purpose

132
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,640
is to help one achieve enlightenment.

133
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,919
After you fell off the cliff,

134
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,599
I followed down right after.

135
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,080
I found you barely alive.

136
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,320
But the Seven Stars Lamp was absorbing your blood.

137
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,960
I thought you had become a sacrifice.

138
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,159
But unexpectedly,

139
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,159
your blood summoned the Lamp Spirit.

140
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,479
And at the last moment,

141
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:59,400
using Spirit Aura,

142
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,599
the Lamp Spirit saved you.

143
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,119
I often say

144
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,280
you awakened the Seven Stars Lamp by chance.

145
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,760
But the word "chance"

146
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,599
sounds a bit too light.

147
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,919
That day

148
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:59,840
was the rare Seven Stars Alignment.

149
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,280
You,

150
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,039
a child whose birth date

151
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,039
perfectly matched, at seven years old,

152
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,039
gave all your Seven Stars power

153
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,799
entirely to the Seven Stars Lamp.

154
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,919
Such a coincidence,

155
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,159
right?

156
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,719
So at that moment, I understood

157
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
it was the Seven Stars Lamp that chose you.

158
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,599
Except for you,

159
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,159
no one else could do this.

160
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,719
To do this,

161
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,200
awakening the Seven Stars Lamp

162
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:29,159
is only the first step.

163
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,159
Gathering Spirit Aura is the second step.

164
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,599
When all seven Big Dipper stars are lit,

165
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,679
as A Qi said,

166
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,039
she will regain her true power.

167
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,039
The true power of the Seven Stars Lamp

168
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,559
is to help a mortal body

169
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,599
achieve enlightenment and become immortal.

170
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,960
I understand now.

171
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:55,640
I know

172
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,200
why you felt familiar the first time we met.

173
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,200
Because the Seven Stars Lamp was always with you.

174
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,760
Right?

175
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,479
We saw each other every day.

176
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,640
That's right.

177
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,440
My sect secretly worshipped the Seven Stars Lamp

178
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,760
for over three hundred years.

179
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,000
Ten years ago,

180
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,960
the Empress Dowager somehow heard about it.

181
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,520
She sent people to take the Seven Stars Lamp.

182
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,039
Of course, I couldn't fight the whole court.

183
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,280
So

184
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:24,280
I secretly allied with the Lan Hai Society.

185
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,479
We each got what we needed.

186
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,919
I knew it.

187
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,239
So that's how it was.

188
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,520
A Qi,

189
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,960
never sick, never weak,

190
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,080
the feeling of being immortal,

191
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,919
must be wonderful, right?

192
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:40,640
It's all right, I guess.

193
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,640
I've never known anything else anyway.

194
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,039
So I can't compare.

195
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,159
See?

196
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,400
That's how it is.

197
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,840
Even a tiny Lamp Spirit

198
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,919
can be so extraordinary.

199
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,799
To achieve enlightenment and become immortal—

200
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,840
how wonderful must that be?

201
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,239
A Qi,

202
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,119
go back into the lamp.

203
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,080
No.

204
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:03,200
Be good.

205
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,359
Don't hold us back.

206
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,640
To achieve enlightenment and become immortal—

207
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,960
you've planned for so long,

208
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,000
killed so many people,

209
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,440
all just to become immortal.

210
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,440
Maybe

211
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,200
I should apologize to you.

212
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,239
But Fuyi,

213
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,039
it's like walking down the road—

214
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,960
sometimes you step on a few bugs.

215
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:40,359
It's unavoidable.

216
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,440
If in this world

217
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
someone could achieve immortality with me,

218
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,760
that person

219
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,400
could only be you.

220
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,239
Fuyi,

221
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,799
come with me.

222
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,919
I don't understand.

223
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,559
Fuyi,

224
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,960
not everything in this world

225
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,599
can be explained by reason.

226
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,039
Since that's the case,

227
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,799
I won't force you anymore.

228
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,440
Then let me, once again,

229
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,239
send you on your way.
