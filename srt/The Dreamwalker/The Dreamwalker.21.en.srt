1
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:43,639
What's going on here?

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,680
Is this Prince Changfeng's psychic power?

3
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,319
Why is it so different from before?

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,240
His psychic power is strong,

5
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,560
but

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,439
it's also chaotic.

7
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,479
I'll make you lots of delicious chestnut cake.

8
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,839
I'll wait for my Changfeng to come home.

9
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,839
Killing her is ridding the nation of evil.

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,239
We must not let the Seven Stars Lamp extend her life.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,800
Our soldiers died for the country,

12
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,680
yet that witch ceded land and paid reparations.

13
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,839
It's her.

14
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:22,760
Only if she dies

15
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,559
Only if she dies

16
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,680
Seven Stars Lamp

17
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:27,839
As long as we steal this item,

18
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,959
she will die.

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,080
At least

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,519
she won't benefit from it.

21
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,360
Leave no survivors.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,599
If word gets out,

23
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,559
we'll all be killed.

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,800
Is anyone over there?

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,000
No.

26
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,279
We can't expose the Lanhai Society.

27
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,519
No one can be left alive.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,160
Seven Stars Descend upon the Child

29
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,160
He really didn't lie to me.

30
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:00,879
Who?

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,000
The one who killed you and Qin Yu.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,959
Who is it, really?

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,240
It doesn't matter.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,639
As long as we stop that witch from living longer,

35
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,880
nothing else matters.

36
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,520
Only if she dies

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
can the dynasty be saved.

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,559
Our lifelong goal is right before us.

39
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,800
I won't let you ruin all of this.

40
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,679
For that vague, unreachable goal,

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,199
you're willing to die so foolishly?

42
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,119
Over there.

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,039
Yes.

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
What about your grandmother?

45
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,919
You haven't come home in over ten years,

46
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,759
and now you're on the run.

47
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,720
Only now do you remember her.

48
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,600
You brought pursuers because of this,

49
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,320
putting your elderly grandmother

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,479
in danger.

51
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,639
Prince Changfeng,

52
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,559
you're unfilial,

53
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,800
and unjust.

54
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,919
Talking about grand ambitions,

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,399
pretending to be a man of ideals.

56
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,639
My grandmother is just a woman.

57
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,520
Those soldiers won't do anything to her.

58
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Such an excuse—

59
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,000
do you even believe it yourself?

60
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,360
Changfeng,

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
why are you leaving so soon?

62
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:54,479
Wait a little longer.

63
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,160
Grandmother's chestnut cake will be ready soon.

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,960
I've already said,

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,679
it's urgent, I must leave right away.

66
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:00,119
You—

67
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,240
why insist on making chestnut cake?

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,600
Look at you,

69
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,399
after all these years,

70
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,720
you finally came home once,

71
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,240
but you're still hiding.

72
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,479
You won't even let me

73
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,960
tell anyone you've come home.

74
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,399
Be honest with your grandmother—

75
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,039
did you do something wrong out there?

76
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,960
Grandmother,

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,959
even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,119
I'm acting for the people's sake,

79
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,440
it's a deed that will be remembered forever.

80
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Anyway, you don't need to worry.

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,679
I have to leave now.

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,000
The pursuers will be here soon.

83
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,119
There are pursuers.

84
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,119
It's my fault as your grandmother.

85
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,440
I shouldn't have nagged.

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,279
Go quickly, go quickly!

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,839
Don't let them catch up.

88
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,440
Go now!

89
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,160
Grandmother,

90
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,760
if they come,

91
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,119
just tell the truth—

92
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,959
I came back suddenly,

93
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,559
but you know nothing else.

94
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,959
You're just an old lady.

95
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,079
Those soldiers won't do anything to you.

96
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,640
Don't worry.

97
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,679
They—

98
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,839
how could they harm an old woman like me?

99
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,040
Go quickly!

100
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Be careful on the road.

101
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,720
Take care.

102
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,040
Go now!

103
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
Be careful.

104
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,640
Be careful on your way.

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,679
Safe travels.

106
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,079
Do you know why your grandmother

107
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,920
is so obsessed with chestnut cake?

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,799
As expected,

109
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,600
a casual remark you made as a child

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
became her lifelong wish.

111
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,559
From now on, every year at this time,

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,519
I'll have to eat grandmother's chestnut cake at home.

113
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,440
Alright.

114
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,760
When you grow up,

115
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,119
you'll have more things to do,

116
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,519
no time to come home

117
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,000
and keep this old lady company.

118
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,239
I defend our home and country

119
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,880
so you won't suffer through war again.

120
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,839
Your peace and happiness

121
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,799
matter more than anything.

122
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,920
Alright then.

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,559
Every year when this season comes,

124
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,119
I'll make you lots of delicious chestnut cake.

125
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,399
I'll wait for my Changfeng to come home.

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,559
Grandmother,

127
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,640
it's me, Feng'er, who is unfilial.

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,640
I can only repay your kindness in the next life.

129
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,079
Does it feel comfortable?

130
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,239
No need to wait for the next life—

131
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,079
you can see her right now if you go down.

132
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,720
What do you mean?

133
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,880
Your grandmother, last night,

134
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,040
hanged herself to death.

135
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,920
You lied to me.

136
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,440
You lied to me.

137
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,480
My grandmother has always been healthy.

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,079
She

139
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,679
She was always busy,

140
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,279
smiling all day long,

141
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,359
a

142
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,959
an old lady.

143
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,760
How could she suddenly hang herself?

144
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,720
How could she suddenly do that?

145
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,000
You lied to me.

146
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,279
You lied to me.

147
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,959
I didn't lie to you.

148
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,679
That's right.

149
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,679
She wouldn't hang herself for no reason.

150
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,119
After you left yesterday,

151
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,359
she received another guest.

152
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,000
The room was tidy and clean.

153
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,239
No signs of a struggle.

154
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,839
He seemed like a polite guest.

155
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,959
He came this time

156
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,760
just to ask about your whereabouts, Shen Changfeng.

157
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,440
He wouldn't press too hard,

158
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,920
but he wouldn't give up easily either.

159
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,320
And your grandmother?

160
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,320
What would she think?

161
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,559
To protect you,

162
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:54,519
what would she do?

163
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,440
Some things

164
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,720
aren't what I wish for either.

165
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,440
I never thought someone like Brother Changfeng

166
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,440
would be treasured by someone.

167
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,200
Protected with their life.

168
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,559
She made an excuse

169
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,160
and went into the room alone.

170
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,920
She put on the burial clothes she'd prepared.

171
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,959
She straightened her clothes

172
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,359
and quietly set off.

173
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,840
Eat more.

174
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,239
You child...

175
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,000
Grandmother.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,039
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,359
You, you...

178
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,760
It's fine, it's fine.

179
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:18,880
Grandmother.

180
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,239
You rascal.

181
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,719
Sorry, I'm sorry.

182
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,479
You rascal.

183
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,280
Let me lie down too.

184
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,479
Your grandson is going to join the army.

185
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,599
I don't know when I'll be back.

186
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:37,719
Grandmother.

187
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,159
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Forgive Changfeng for being unfilial.

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,599
Get up.

190
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,559
You, you...

191
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,719
You, you...

192
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Grandmother.

193
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,559
Grandmother.

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,159
Grandmother.

195
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,359
Changfeng is sorry to you.

196
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,679
It's the old lady's spirit and energy.

197
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,640
But Shen Changfeng,

198
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,239
you can't die yet.

199
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,559
You still haven't told me

200
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,559
who killed you,

201
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,280
who killed Qin Yu,

202
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,840
and who killed your grandmother.

203
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,640
Tell me.

204
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,919
At this point,

205
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,919
you're still stubborn, aren't you?

206
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,880
I don't know his identity either.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He's very mysterious.

208
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,320
I only know he's a cultivator...

209
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,320
A cultivator...

210
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,400
You're here.

211
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,159
Grandmother.

212
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,039
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,799
You, you...

214
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,280
Still the same as when you were little.

215
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,320
Let's go.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,719
Let's go.

217
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,159
Fuyi.

218
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,039
What's wrong?

219
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,239
It's nothing, Fuyi.

220
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,119
There are others.

221
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,000
There are other clues.

222
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,359
There will be more people.

223
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,479
Last time in the carriage, you said I was seeing things.

224
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,799
What about yesterday?

225
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,000
We all saw it with our own eyes.

226
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,280
So...

227
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,840
Does Xiao Wuzi like you?

228
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
Logically speaking,

229
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,359
yes.

230
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,719
I knew it.

231
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,640
And you?

232
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,559
I don't know.

233
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,320
They're here.

234
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,359
Why is no one here?

235
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,760
Just like this.

236
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,880
Who dares to come in?

237
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,400
Eat quickly.

238
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,640
Stop making eyes.

239
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,760
Fuyi doesn't know if she likes you yet.

240
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,919
Just eat.

241
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,039
Yesterday.

242
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,919
How did you get hurt yesterday?

243
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,280
Are you okay?

244
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,359
What happened exactly?

245
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,719
Actually...

246
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:50,919
Yesterday, I caught up with that person.

247
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,880
Why don't you dare to speak?

248
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,119
Are you afraid I'll hear your voice?

249
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,400
Chase...

250
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,679
That person could fly.

251
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,679
He could overpower you.

252
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,479
That means his skills are top-notch.

253
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,119
He escaped unharmed from a cliff.

254
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,479
His agility is also unmatched.

255
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,159
A master like that

256
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,239
should be famous across the land.

257
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,400
That's right.

258
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,719
Such a master

259
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,359
There are very few in the world.

260
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,280
I don't know.

261
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,679
How does he compare to Daoist Yun Yi?

262
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,719
My master...

263
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,880
His skills are a bit better than yours,

264
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,840
but his agility is average.

265
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,119
Can't compare to that person.

266
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,119
It's still a gain.

267
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,640
Next,

268
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,440
we can search among the world's masters.

269
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:11,960
Little brother,

270
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,440
you have no idea.

271
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:14,799
Although

272
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,559
I didn't see that person's

273
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,520
face clearly,

274
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,760
but I saw the back of his head,

275
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,799
and I felt an aura of immortality.

276
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,840
That's exactly it.

277
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,559
It's just so

278
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:27,760
so

279
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
otherworldly.

280
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,039
Yes, just otherworldly.

281
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Still otherworldly.

282
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,159
Wait,

283
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,520
is that person an immortal?

284
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,479
You better believe it.

285
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,799
That person's immortal aura

286
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:40,919
might mean

287
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,479
he's a Daoist.

288
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,039
Anyway,

289
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,200
we're close to the truth now.

290
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,039
And no matter who it is,

291
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,960
I won't let him

292
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,919
hurt you.

293
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,640
Here it comes—

294
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,719
Xiao Wuzi's romance mode.

295
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:14,719
Reporting to Prince,

296
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,599
a message arrived from the palace by carrier pigeon.

297
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:19,920
By order of the Empress Dowager,

298
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,920
we are to escort the Prince

299
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,800
and Miss He back to the palace for an audience.

300
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,319
We respectfully ask the Prince to depart at once.
