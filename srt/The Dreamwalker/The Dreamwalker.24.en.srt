1
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:43,759
Are you all right?

2
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,919
You weren't hypnotized by me.

3
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,560
You already had so many

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,880
strange things going on before.

5
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,799
Logically speaking,

6
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,639
I shouldn't be so defenseless.

7
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,800
Why force Shen Changfeng's grandmother to her death?

8
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,360
She's just an old woman.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,760
Her death

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,279
shouldn't be blamed on me.

11
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,760
I only asked her for a favor.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,440
Changfeng really left.

13
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,319
I believe what you said.

14
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,559
But I truly have urgent business with him.

15
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,680
Please come with me.

16
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,400
If he avoids me, fine.

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,559
But he can't

18
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,800
ignore his own grandmother, right?

19
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,839
Who are you, really?

20
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,959
Don't hurt others in this village

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,440
just for your grandson.

22
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,959
I'll wait for you here.

23
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:58,519
Okay.

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,519
I'll go inside and get something.

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,960
Even giving my all, I can't do it.

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,160
Throwing my life to shake the world,

27
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,960
no regrets.

28
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,360
Trying my best is still in vain.

29
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,639
In this rotten world,

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,039
how is there a fool like you?

31
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,880
Dying quietly, like an ant.

32
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,000
Xiulan.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,559
Why is it you?

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,559
That's how most humans are.

35
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,479
But sadly,

36
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,360
after so many Seven Stars Dreams,

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,520
and resolving so many dying obsessions,

38
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,399
you still don't understand.

39
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,559
Humans

40
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,080
are so weak,

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,360
and such a dull existence.

42
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,919
You're the best at pretending.

43
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,479
Weak.

44
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,759
The lingering love in mortal flesh

45
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,839
can shake life and death like a firefly's glow.

46
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,199
That's what lights the Seven Stars Lamp.

47
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,119
These bits of love gather into light,

48
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,279
carrying joy and sorrow,

49
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,080
illuminating the River of Forgetfulness.

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,160
Can't you see it?

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,880
The world before your eyes

52
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
exists because of this.

53
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,880
My fault.

54
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,000
Why say so much?

55
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,559
You can't even

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,160
see the Seven Stars Dream,

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,759
what do you know?

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Fuyi.

59
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,240
You shouldn't make things so complicated.

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,399
Or what?

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,759
Should I just lie down

62
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,960
and let you kill me?

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,640
No.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,239
Don't cry.

65
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
No.

66
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,279
No, don't scare me.

67
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,399
No.

68
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,239
No.

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,959
No.

70
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:40,480
No.

71
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,679
Wake up.

72
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,000
Prince.

73
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,239
Prince, where are you?

74
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,480
He Fuyi, someone's here.

75
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,040
Prince.

76
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,720
He Fuyi.

77
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,320
Zhenhuan Biaoju.

78
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,160
She was the only survivor back then.

79
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,760
She might know something.

80
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,040
If she dares to disobey,

81
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,559
losing an arm or leg doesn't matter.

82
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,799
As long as she can talk.

83
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,760
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,600
I'll have the palace staff handle it.

85
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,079
This is no small matter.

86
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,040
If anything goes wrong,

87
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,279
even you, Xiao Wu,

88
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,000
I won't show mercy.

89
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,799
So,

90
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,000
are you still going?

91
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
Baiyintu is willing to serve the Empress Dowager.

92
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,760
He Fuyi of Zhenhuan Biaoju,

93
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,920
entrusted by another,

94
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,880
came to collect Liu Chunru's body.

95
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,679
It's you.

96
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,440
I really found you.

97
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,440
He Fuyi.

98
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,920
Head Escort He.

99
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,839
You...

100
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,119
really are...

101
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,000
Well,

102
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,519
the fish is cooked.

103
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,079
Logically speaking,

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,799
this feeling

105
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,440
should be a flutter of the heart.

106
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,640
Right?

107
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,320
That's right.

108
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,880
Flutter of the heart.

109
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,320
Don't cry.

110
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
That day,

111
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,239
I lay alone in the cold grass.

112
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,000
I was truly, truly scared.

113
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,959
I knew I was about to die.

114
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,640
But in my mind,

115
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,719
only one wild thought appeared.

116
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,280
I hoped someone would come stay with me.

117
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,400
He Fuyi.

118
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
That day, you didn't just save my life,

119
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,200
you also fulfilled my obsession.

120
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:35,719
Fuyi.

121
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:43,960
You must stay safe.

122
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,559
That's my obsession now.

123
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,239
No.

124
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
No.

125
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,280
No.

126
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,000
No.

127
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,719
A Qi.

128
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,119
I'm counting on you.

129
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,000
No.

130
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,599
No.

131
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,919
No.

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,840
No.

133
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,239
Don't scare me.

134
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,919
Don't scare me.

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,479
The Way has no beginning or end.

136
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,960
All things have life and death.

137
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,719
Fuyi.

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,919
This is the fate of mortals.

139
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,039
But you still have a chance

140
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,400
to go with me.

141
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,440
Heaven and earth

142
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,679
endure for so long

143
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,719
and last so long

144
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,000
because they do not live for themselves.

145
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,479
So they can live long.

146
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,760
Heaven's law is like me.

147
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,239
My law is like heaven.

148
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,159
My fate is in my hands,

149
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,039
not in the heavens.

150
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,799
Seven Stars descends upon the child

151
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,359
to protect his body

152
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,280
The Seven Stars' aura gathers as one

153
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,799
above the crown of the head

154
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,760
three feet above the head

155
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,200
When one does good

156
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,559
the star shines bright and large

157
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,559
When one does evil

158
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,080
the star dims and shrinks

159
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
Good deeds bring fortune

160
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,239
Evil deeds bring disaster

161
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,840
When the starlight fades

162
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,760
the body

163
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:09,679
perishes

164
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,239
Master

165
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,719
Your cultivation

166
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,159
is still far from complete

167
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,760
He Fuyi

168
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,159
Can you hear me

169
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,679
The seven stars above are answering me

170
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,799
A Qi

171
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,000
From the first time you met him

172
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,440
you said his scent felt familiar

173
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,799
It's because my blood runs in his veins

174
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,960
Is that right

175
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,080
Yes

176
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,520
Now all seven Beidou of the Seven Stars Lamp are lit

177
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,440
This is what Master sought

178
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,880
the true power of the Seven Stars Lamp

179
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:49,960
A Qi

180
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,520
You can revive Baiyintu, right

181
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,559
Yes

182
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,760
As long as he still breathes

183
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,559
I can make him

184
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,400
just like I did for you

185
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,520
But

186
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,520
this power isn't limitless

187
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,760
If I save him

188
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,440
He Fuyi

189
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,239
you'll have only two years left to live

190
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:14,320
A Qi

191
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm counting on you

192
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,719
Alright then

193
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,760
Don't move

194
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,640
I can only bring you back

195
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,799
Your wounds will heal slowly

196
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,520
What did you do

197
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,880
Logically speaking

198
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,080
this is the best deal

199
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,640
Are you crazy

200
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,479
Trading your life for my twelve years

201
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,400
That's not a damn deal

202
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,680
Didn't the doctor tell you to rest in bed

203
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,520
I need to write to my father and mother

204
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,959
to tell them I'm marrying you

205
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,079
What nonsense are you saying

206
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,400
Who's talking nonsense

207
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,680
I only have twelve years to live

208
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,760
And you

209
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,400
only have two years left

210
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,319
How can we not hurry and do what's important

211
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,800
Gathering Spirit Aura quickly

212
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,839
is what matters most

213
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,439
Whether it's long years

214
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,439
or fleeting moments

215
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,599
I want to stay by your side always

216
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,400
Whether it's long years

217
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,040
or fleeting moments

218
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,400
It all depends on me, A Qi

219
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,000
Who says otherwise

220
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,160
Little living ancestor

221
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:00,920
Prince

222
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,160
The Prince Ning's manor sent someone

223
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,719
Tell me

224
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,000
Prince Ning invites you to a banquet tomorrow

225
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,920
What's the reason

226
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,640
Who cares what he wants

227
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,520
Going now

228
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,040
will surely attract the Empress Dowager's attention

229
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,319
Can't we just not go

230
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,239
You all

231
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:27,119
I haven't tried all the good food yet

232
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,079
Ancestor

233
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,920
This time, we really have to run

234
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:32,280
Before, I could use my injury as an excuse

235
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,800
Now they've lost all patience

236
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
Whether it's Prince Ning or the Empress Dowager

237
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,400
we can't afford to offend either

238
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,400
If we don't run

239
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,760
we're doomed

240
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,560
Looks like my fate is to always be on the run

241
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,520
I'll be counting on you from now on

242
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,119
Prince

243
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,239
Let's get ready to leave

244
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,160
Head Escort He

245
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,359
Didn't expect it so soon

246
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,239
There's already a new Seven Stars Dream

247
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,239
Yeah

248
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,000
This isn't looking good

249
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,319
We still have to run

250
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,239
What's wrong

251
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,280
Blessings to the Empress Dowager

252
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:32,959
It's the Empress Dowager's dream
