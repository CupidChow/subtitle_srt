1
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,240
Hurry up, hurry up.

2
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,919
Take a look at this female corpse.

3
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:56,080
Can it be turned into a Yin Corpse?

4
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,599
This female corpse—

5
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,319
She was born in a Yin year, month, day, and hour.

6
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,519
She is a person of pure Yin.

7
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:13,319
Then—

8
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,720
This time, you need to pay me more.

9
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,680
Wait a moment.

10
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,559
Why does her Yin meridian seem off?

11
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,199
What’s wrong with it?

12
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:25,440
With you, Immortal Lady, here,

13
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,199
are you still worried she won’t revive?

14
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
There’s something behind you.

15
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,119
Immortal Lady!

16
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,639
Immortal Lady, please spare me!

17
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,880
He Fuyi!

18
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,520
Wake up, wake up!

19
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,119
Where am I?

20
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,399
You’re finally awake.

21
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,639
You fainted on the street again last night.

22
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,399
Those people just picked you up.

23
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,479
They brought you here.

24
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,639
They said they’d use you to make a corpse.

25
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,800
You just watched me fall into danger?

26
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,279
If not for that nail just now,

27
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,240
I wouldn’t be able to leave the lamp.

28
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,039
You haven’t refilled the lamp oil in ages.

29
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,119
You ended up in kidnappers’ hands.

30
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Aqi.

31
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,080
I remember before I fainted,

32
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,279
the Seven Stars Lamp caught a new dream.

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,600
We need to enter the dream quickly.

34
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,720
Help the dead resolve their obsession.

35
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,039
Gather new spirit aura.

36
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,039
Refill the lamp oil.

37
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,240
Otherwise—

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,479
we’ll both be doomed.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,600
Seven Stars guides the lingering dream.

40
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,520
Lonely soul crosses the Yellow Springs.

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,639
Enter the dream.

42
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,199
Sir—

43
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,080
She won’t eat her last meal.

44
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,000
She may not rest in peace after death.

45
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,720
Liu Chunru.

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,520
Why won’t you eat?

47
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,639
If you have any last words,

48
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,639
speak them quickly.

49
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,960
I will fulfill your wishes.

50
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,600
After I die,

51
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,679
I want you to

52
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,479
bury me whole and intact.

53
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,479
This rebel—

54
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,000
is obsessed with a whole burial before death.

55
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,559
If you refuse,

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,559
I won’t eat this last meal.

57
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,519
How about this—

58
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,440
Liu Chunru,

59
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,799
if all your blood after death

60
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,880
can stain this white silk,

61
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,040
I

62
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,519
will make a red robe from it.

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,760
Then I’ll have you

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,839
buried whole.

65
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,040
How about that?

66
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,040
Swearing to the dead

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,079
must be kept.

68
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,839
If you break your promise,

69
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,559
I won’t let you go after death.

70
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,040
I agree.

71
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,679
Carry out the execution.

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Guards!

73
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,200
Hang this rebel’s head

74
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,480
on the city gate for all to see.

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,279
The body—

76
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,480
throw it in the mass grave.

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,279
Sir—

78
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,519
The white silk is stained red.

79
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,480
You fulfilled Liu Chunru’s last wish.

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,760
If you break your promise,

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,720
I’m afraid—

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,480
Th-this—

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,760
It’s another nightmare.

84
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,000
The person in the dream is Liu Chunru.

85
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:51,079
She wants to be buried whole in the dream.

86
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,880
So her obsession

87
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,839
is just to recover her body?

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,320
We need to hurry to town.

89
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,959
Steal Liu Chunru’s body.

90
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,559
I have a good idea.

91
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,119
Do you think these rebels are worth it?

92
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,480
She’s just a woman.

93
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,760
She didn’t even blink at her beheading.

94
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,359
I actually admire her.

95
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,519
Keep your voice down.

96
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,679
Do you want to die?

97
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,839
Why not do something else?

98
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,359
Why rebel?

99
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,239
Foolish child.

100
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,799
Liu Chunru—

101
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,799
Every wrong has its culprit.

102
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,880
Don’t come after me.

103
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,200
I’m just a humble coroner.

104
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,119
Your humble servant greets you, Prince.

105
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,640
I didn’t know the Prince would visit.

106
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,760
Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner.

107
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,200
Enough chatter.

108
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,839
Liu Chunru’s body is missing.

109
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,880
How could you be so careless?

110
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,799
The body is missing?

111
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,839
How is that possible?

112
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,440
You oversaw the execution today.

113
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,880
We saw Liu Chunru’s body

114
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
displayed after beheading.

115
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,640
Now—

116
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,959
her head is at the east city gate.

117
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,440
Her body is at the west charity graveyard.

118
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,640
Everything was done by imperial rules.

119
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
How could she be missing?

120
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,640
Enough nonsense.

121
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,440
Where’s your county magistrate?

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,320
Can he still sleep?

123
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,239
Please calm your anger, Prince.

124
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,079
I—

125
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,239
will fetch the magistrate right away.

126
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,079
What happened?

127
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,000
Did you kill him?

128
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,399
No, it wasn’t me!

129
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,760
It was a female ghost! A female ghost!

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
It was Liu Chunru!

131
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,880
Liu Chunru has returned for revenge!

132
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,559
Who is it?

133
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,640
Who is it, really?

134
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,479
Who?

135
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,159
Go and check.

136
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,520
Who is it, really?

137
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:56,520
Master—

138
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,719
I’m scared.

139
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,919
Go open the door.

140
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,640
Master—

141
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,880
There’s no one outside.

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,719
Ruizhi—

143
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,039
Ruizhi—

144
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,400
If you don’t believe me,

145
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,960
come and see for yourself.

146
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,119
She came back for her head.

147
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,119
If she can’t find her head,

148
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,840
she’ll come back again.

149
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,400
She will come back again.

150
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,200
She’s not dead.

151
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,000
She just fainted.

152
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,280
Why are you still standing there?

153
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,239
Call the doctor.

154
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,599
The one inside—

155
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,599
Who is she?

156
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,599
She’s a concubine of our household.

157
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,320
She’s a student at Jingyang Girls’ School.

158
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,159
A student?

159
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,039
No, no.

160
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,280
Prince, please judge fairly.

161
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Our concubine—

162
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,200
She was only working at the school.

163
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,640
Just doing cleaning chores.

164
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,520
She’s never been involved in anything rebellious—

165
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,799
Or any corrupt ideas.

166
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,880
Keep a close watch on her.

167
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:13,880
Let’s go.

168
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,000
Isn’t she trying to get that head back?

169
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,280
Let’s go guard it.

170
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,039
Her head that’s on display.

171
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,039
Sir, please judge fairly.

172
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:26,880
I—

173
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,359
Wouldn’t dare hide anything.

174
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,760
Every word is true.

175
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,159
There really was a haunting.

176
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,960
Liu Chunru’s corpse—

177
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,479
It really got up and walked.

178
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,119
Nonsense.

179
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:37,840
If not that—

180
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,760
Then you failed to guard it.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,039
And let the criminal’s body be taken.

182
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,080
Stop stalling. Tell the truth now.

183
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,840
While I’m still in a good mood.

184
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,400
I might spare you.

185
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,599
Sir, please judge fairly.

186
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,880
The mortuary’s rule is—

187
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,479
Both doors are locked at the hour of the pig.

188
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,559
When I woke up just now,

189
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,479
The red lock on the main door was intact.

190
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
But the black lock on the inner door—

191
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,520
Was open.

192
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,359
Liu Chunru’s corpse—

193
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,000
Was gone too.

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,599
Isn’t that her turning into a corpse fiend?

195
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,880
She left on her own.

196
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,080
Take him away.

197
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,239
Th-this—

198
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,559
Sir! Sir!

199
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:18,799
Sir!

200
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,280
Go.

201
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,960
It wasn’t me!

202
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,280
Who would dare—

203
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,960
Go to such lengths to bury a traitor?

204
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,119
They must have a death wish.

205
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,239
Prince.

206
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,239
Stop!

207
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,200
Whose girl is this?

208
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,080
Why is she so fierce?

209
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,960
She’s clearly not a normal girl.

210
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,520
A demon—demon child!

211
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,000
Protect!

212
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,359
I’ll trade something with you.
