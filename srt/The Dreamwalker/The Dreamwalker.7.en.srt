1
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,720
Why are you moving around?

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,840
Lie down right now.

3
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:48,919
You scared me to death.

4
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,520
I thought something happened to you.

5
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,200
The doctor said your injury is serious.

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,159
You need to rest for a few days.

7
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:12,639
What's wrong?

8
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,599
It's just an errand.

9
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,199
You're a bit too loyal, aren't you?

10
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,879
Aren't you supposed to help the Empress Dowager

11
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,639
by taking the Seven Stars Lamp from me?

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,599
No need to risk your life for it.

13
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:49,360
Man'er,

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,760
Mom brought medicine for you.

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,639
Mom!

16
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,120
I missed you so much.

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,919
Look.

18
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,919
Xiao Man,

19
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,239
You must be starving.

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,599
Let me make you

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,040
some steamed buns with chopped filling.

22
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:06,839
Okay!

23
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:39,839
Li Xiu Lan!

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,679
Where have you been these days?

25
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,000
Hurry, hurry!

26
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,240
Bring it over!

27
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,240
I'm starving.

28
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,520
Xiao Man,

29
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,639
Take your medicine first.

30
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,919
Isn't it hot?

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,279
You little rascal!

32
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,440
No one's fighting you for food.

33
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,000
Put it down!

34
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,559
I said put it down!

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,440
I said put it down!

36
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Wife,

37
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,759
Our son's neck

38
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,480
was sucked dry by bugs.

39
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,160
Xiao Man...

40
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,760
Xiao...

41
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,000
Man...

42
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,559
In the dream,

43
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,519
Xiu Lan's son was sick.

44
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,359
Xiu Lan was holding a packet of medicine.

45
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,839
So,

46
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,559
her obsession must be related to

47
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,920
her son Xiao Man.

48
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,799
That's progress.

49
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,239
But...

50
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,320
Where's Xiu Lan's body?

51
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,320
It rained heavily last night.

52
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,359
The traces were washed away.

53
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,279
But there's blood there.

54
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,959
It matches the dream.

55
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,320
Let's ask the yamen first.

56
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,119
Something's odd here.

57
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,959
No one reported it.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
No one found the body.

59
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Could it be...

60
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,440
But Xiu Lan clearly died here.

61
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Could it be...

62
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,480
the body ran off by itself?

63
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,399
Maybe someone

64
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,320
didn't want the body found.

65
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,799
Respectfully welcome Inspector Jin An.

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,959
What did Prince ask you just now?

67
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,679
Repeat every word exactly.

68
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,279
Not feeling well again.

69
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,079
Take your medicine quickly.

70
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,760
My master isn't here.

71
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,119
I have to ration the medicine.

72
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,600
The most urgent thing now

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,040
is to fulfill Xiu Lan's obsession.

74
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,959
That's more important than anything.

75
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,720
Her obsession

76
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,000
must be about her son Xiao Man.

77
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,679
Who gave this to you?

78
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,160
Be careful.

79
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,239
This medicine packet

80
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,799
was bought specially at Bao Zhi Tang.

81
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:49,799
It's for balancing yin and yang.

82
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,559
Is this mark unique to them?

83
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,720
Of course.

84
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,679
Bao Zhi Tang's medicine is expensive.

85
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
Only the rich here can afford it.

86
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,160
Look,

87
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,440
this mark proves it's authentic.

88
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,959
Otherwise, those street sorcerers

89
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
would fake it.

90
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,640
Think carefully again.

91
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,279
Yes.

92
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,359
It's a formula to repel bugs.

93
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,720
There is one like that.

94
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
But you said there wasn't.

95
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,320
But...

96
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,839
The person who picked it up wasn't a woman.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,079
It was a strong man.

98
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,079
He works at the dyehouse, I think.

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,000
His surname is Dong.

100
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,320
Dyehouse...

101
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,440
Don't you see we're busy now?

102
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,399
Everyone's quitting these days.

103
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,279
What about Xiu Lan?

104
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,839
She didn't come today either, right?

105
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,880
Just like her husband.

106
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:40,279
Do you have a worker

107
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,000
named Xiu Lan?

108
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,279
What's it to you?

109
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't you know the rules?

110
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,239
Yes.

111
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,119
She works here as a dyer.

112
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,279
Does she have a son named Xiao Man?

113
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,600
Where does she live?

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,359
Where did she go last night?

115
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,880
Who are you people?

116
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,440
You can't even recognize this?

117
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,239
God of Wealth.

118
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,519
Those who work here

119
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,359
are all from nearby villages.

120
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,720
I never ask.

121
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,079
There's no work at night in the dyehouse.

122
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,640
Where Xiu Lan goes

123
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
I have no idea.

124
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,959
That's as good as saying nothing.

125
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Do you have a worker named Dong?

126
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,000
You mean...

127
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,359
Dong Dachang?

128
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm looking for him too.

129
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,920
He's worked here for years.

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,719
He settled his wages yesterday.

131
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,080
Now he's disappeared.

132
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,400
Does he have any usual hangouts?

133
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,159
Him?

134
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,679
He only knows how to work and earn money.

135
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,320
Wait, that's not right.

136
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:50,479
He's been acting strange lately.

137
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,719
I've seen him at the gambling house a few times.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,640
Gambling house...

139
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,280
This guy...

140
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:58,640
Maybe his old habit is back.

141
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,679
What are you guys doing here?

142
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,039
If you're not gambling, get out.

143
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,080
You're like a money-giving kid.

144
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,000
The Dong Dachang you two mentioned—

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,960
I remember now.

146
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,320
That big, dumb guy.

147
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,359
He doesn't gamble either.

148
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
He comes every day just to find Zhang Shuisheng.

149
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,320
Zhang Shuisheng.

150
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,039
What's your relationship with Zhang Shuisheng?

151
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,000
Does he owe you money?

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,799
Aren't you tired of watching him all day?

153
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,520
We're just friends.

154
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,039
Sorry to trouble you.

155
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,200
Please don't let him come again.

156
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,080
Brother,

157
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,280
That's not up to me.

158
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,679
He goes where he wants.

159
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,280
Can you help us out?

160
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,039
He has a seriously ill son.

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,599
Does Zhang Shuisheng have a wife?

162
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,840
I think her name is—

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,679
Xiu Lan.

164
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,440
Sir, you guessed right.

165
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,520
Why not play a couple rounds?

166
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,000
It'd be a shame not to play.

167
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,880
That bastard Zhang Shuisheng—

168
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,640
His son is so sick,

169
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
yet he still comes to the gambling house.

170
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,320
That kid isn't his biological son.

171
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,760
Xiu Lan remarried into his family.

172
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,719
Now you get it, right?

173
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,960
You dared to lend him money back then,

174
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,520
so you must know where he lives.

175
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,760
Of course.

176
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,880
Finally, we know Xiu Lan's address.

177
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,479
Prince,

178
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,359
The body you mentioned has been found.

179
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,000
Is it Xiu Lan?

180
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,799
Yes.

181
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,280
A man named Dong Dachang.

182
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:47,400
Dad,

183
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,239
I'm so hungry.

184
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,960
Eat quickly.

185
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,359
The food on the table

186
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,799
was all brought home for you by Dad.

187
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,880
I can't eat.

188
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,640
Where's Mom?

189
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,719
In a bit,

190
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll take you to see your mom.

191
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,559
The grave in the painting was dug up.

192
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,400
