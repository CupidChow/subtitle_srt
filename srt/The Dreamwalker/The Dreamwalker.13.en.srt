1
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:41,200
Daughter

2
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,040
Mother

3
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:43,439
Your father has gone mad.

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,040
He actually wants to kill you.

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,560
We can't just sit and take this.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,680
We must find a way for you to escape.

7
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:50,720
He has spies everywhere in the house.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,279
There are guards at the city gate too.

9
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,680
I can't get away.

10
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:58,439
At night, over at the yamen,

11
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,000
they take the bodies of dead prisoners

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,919
out to be buried.

13
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,240
When the time comes,

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,400
hide yourself inside a coffin.

15
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:06,160
Once they're outside the city,

16
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,800
Qin Yu will come to save you.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,360
Then you two can run far away together.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,680
Mother

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,199
You approve of me and Brother Qin now?

20
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:16,839
Silly child.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,440
I'm still your mother, after all.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,199
No, that's not possible.

23
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,239
No, it can't be.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,720
Mother

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
If you let me go,

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,040
Father won't spare you.

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,959
It'll be fine.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,480
Don't worry.

29
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,199
Mother

30
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm leaving now.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,080
You must stay safe.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,240
Qin Yu, if you don't come soon,

33
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,240
I'll suffocate in this coffin.

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,679
Mother

35
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,320
I still can't get used to these nightmares.

36
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:55,080
There's just too little information in this dream.

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,000
I can't make out anything from it.

38
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,320
Is there someone named Qin Yu in the dream?

39
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,279
Do you know him?

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm not sure.

41
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,000
Earlier, the Empress Dowager ordered the Inner Court

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,559
to arrest the Reformist faction's followers.

43
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,080
One of them

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,199
was known as the top fighter in Qilu,

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,080
named Qin Yu.

46
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,559
But I'm not sure if it's the same person.

47
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,919
The name and place do match, though.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,039
Anyway,

49
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,800
we need to find this deceased person first.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Madam Gu

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,360
This Qin Yu—

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,160
let's discuss further after that.

53
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,679
Why is there no one here?

54
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,600
This scent...

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,039
I heard that Wu Ma died mysteriously.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,880
Manager Liu

57
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,360
Did Madam really get possessed?

58
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,399
Don't talk nonsense.

59
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,000
Watch what you say.

60
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:53,800
Yes.

61
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,720
Have those two arrived?

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,679
Are you the exorcist priests?

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,160
Finally, you're here.

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,119
Come with us quickly.

65
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,279
Master

66
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,519
The priests have arrived.

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Don't come any closer!

68
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,200
I think she's truly possessed.

69
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,279
What's going on?

70
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,799
Didn't Madam Gu die?

71
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,079
How is she still alive?

72
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,200
And now she's possessed too.

73
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,320
Stay back!

74
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,359
If she's possessed,

75
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,920
did Madam experience anything unusual before?

76
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,000
That's not for you to ask.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,760
I called you here

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
just to perform the ritual.

79
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,600
We need to know what kind of evil spirit it is.

80
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,839
So we can perform the right ritual.

81
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,480
A few days ago,

82
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,480
on her way back from visiting relatives,

83
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,480
Madam encountered something strange.

84
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,119
It was late at night.

85
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,000
Why would anyone be traveling then?

86
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,559
Those four people look odd.

87
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,160
Don't worry, Madam.

88
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,359
Four noble figures in black are leading the way.

89
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,760
It's a sign of safety and stability.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,799
Stop staring, let's hurry on.

91
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,839
Madam

92
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,959
It feels like we're pressing on something.

93
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,119
Quickly,

94
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:27,839
let's get out of here.

95
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,440
Yes.

96
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,160
Don't worry, Madam.

97
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,640
We've run so far already.

98
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,200
We should be far from those evil things now.

99
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,559
The carriage didn't move at all.

100
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,200
It just sat there, shaken by those filthy things.

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,519
After returning,

102
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,720
everyone who traveled with her died suddenly.

103
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,880
Madam ended up like this too.

104
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,959
So many evil things have happened.

105
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,399
Everyone is terrified.

106
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,279
That's why we asked you to perform rituals.

107
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,480
To drive away the evil spirits.

108
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,920
To calm people's fears.

109
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,799
Besides those who traveled with her,

110
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,799
is everyone else in the house fine?

111
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,760
No, no one else.

112
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,640
We've explained everything to you.

113
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,040
Please start the ritual now.

114
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,600
Manager Liu, Manager Liu!

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,920
There's been a mistake.

116
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,440
These two are the priests we invited.

117
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,720
Who are you, really?

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,440
Why are you pretending to be priests?

119
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,839
We never once

120
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,600
claimed to be priests.

121
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,320
How dare you!

122
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,279
Don't be angry, Master Gu.

123
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,480
It's all a misunderstanding.

124
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,440
We didn't know there was trouble here.

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,119
We were entrusted by someone

126
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,160
to find Madam Gu and Miss Shuyin.

127
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,040
Entrusted by someone?

128
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:52,160
Master Gu, do you remember Qin Yu?

129
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,359
Qin Yu?

130
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,040
Wasn't he a rebel?

131
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,640
He died long ago.

132
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:00,640
You—

133
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,399
Who are you really?

134
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,320
My son-in-law is a Commander in the Beiyang Army.

135
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,119
You must have nerves of steel

136
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,880
to cause trouble in our house.

137
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,640
Get out, now!

138
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,279
Or you'll regret it!

139
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,040
That's right!

140
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,959
So Gu Shuyin married this man.

141
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,000
The Seven Stars Lamp captures the dreams of the dying.

142
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,119
Does that mean Madam Gu isn't dead yet?

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,760
Indeed.

144
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,880
I've encountered this once before.

145
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,640
I followed the dream's clues,

146
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,440
and found the person was still alive.

147
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,919
Wake up.

148
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:57,000
But Madam Gu is clearly not like that.

149
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,520
When you were just at the Gu residence,

150
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,359
did you notice a strange incense smell?

151
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:05,479
It's made from galangal, cogongrass,
and magnolia.

152
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,799
That incense is specially blended.

153
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,000
It purifies the air and removes odors.

154
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,679
It's usually used inside coffins.

155
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,280
Are you saying

156
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,640
Madam Gu is already dead?

157
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,119
But Gu Songbai keeps her death secret.

158
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,479
He even spreads ghost stories outside.

159
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,280
He uses tales of spirits to hide the truth.

160
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,359
That only means one thing.

161
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,559
Madam Gu's death

162
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,880
is suspicious.

163
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,559
If that's really the case,

164
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,679
then at the Gu residence,

165
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,559
there's no way to find clues about her.

166
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,239
Luckily,

167
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:34,479
her dream has two key figures.

168
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,640
Gu Shuyin and Qin Yu.

169
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,159
I'll have Yiru look into it right away.

170
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,000
As expected,

171
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:48,159
Yiru found out

172
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,719
Qin Yu was once a city constable.

173
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,799
Fifteen years ago, he served four years
for theft.

174
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,760
Later, he was released in a general amnesty.

175
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,719
He was let out.

176
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,479
After that,

177
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,760
he worked with the Reformist faction,

178
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,919
and was hunted by the court.

179
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,080
In the dream,

180
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,559
Gu Shuyin clearly has feelings for Qin Yu.

181
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,039
But Master Gu wants to break them up.

182
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:10,000
Madam Gu wants them to be together.

183
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,760
But the situation now is,

184
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,000
fifteen years ago,

185
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,359
Gu Shuyin had already married

186
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:15,559
the local gentry, the Yang family.

187
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,280
Her husband, Yang Kaizhi,

188
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,400
is a Commander in the Beiyang Army.

189
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,760
He's a third-rank official.

190
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,760
In this region, if he stomps his foot,

191
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,880
everyone trembles three times.

192
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,239
No matter what,

193
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,640
Madam Gu's obsession

194
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,280
is clearly tied to those two.

195
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,280
Let's go ask Gu Shuyin for answers first.

196
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,559
Sit down quickly.

197
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,200
She's the wife of a third-rank official.

198
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,840
Don't offend her.

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,679
That's perfect.

200
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,520
I heard

201
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,880
the two are dining at Yurui Pavilion today.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,520
Watch my cues and follow my lead.

203
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,159
Alright.

204
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,239
Neither you nor Yiru are easy to handle.

205
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,280
Every time I use that spy,

206
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,400
I have to stay alert.

207
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,679
He always tries to get intel from me.

208
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,479
Which side is Yiru really on?

209
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,440
From what I've seen on this trip,

210
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,000
he's been diligent with you.

211
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,599
I can't see any clues.

212
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,320
I truly don't know.

213
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,559
The capital is a complete mess.

214
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,640
Spies watching other spies.

215
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,039
Agents stacked on agents.

216
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,359
But,

217
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,159
if you ask me,

218
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,880
he's with Prince Ning's people.

219
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,080
Because only he both relies on and fears
the Empress Dowager.

220
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,919
He depends on her, but is wary of her.

221
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,440
Um...

222
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,400
Along the way,

223
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,919
I've received a lot of help from you.

224
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
It's nothing, really.

225
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,400
Honestly, no matter

226
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,559
why you chose to follow me,

227
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,119
you don't need to get caught in this mess.

228
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,760
But,

229
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,359
I don't want you to leave now.

230
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:55,440
Not just because

231
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,640
the seventh star of the Big Dipper
will soon be lit,

232
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,039
but also because of the person I'm seeking.

233
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,119
The truth from ten years ago

234
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,239
may soon come to light.

235
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,039
So,

236
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,599
I need you now.

237
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,119
He Fuyi,

238
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,000
don't worry.

239
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,840
I, Bai Yintu, always keep my word.

240
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,960
If I say I'll protect you,

241
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
I will definitely protect you.

242
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm not afraid of any danger.

243
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,799
Put it on my tab.

244
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,440
Consider it a debt I owe you.

245
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,799
I'll repay you, no matter what.

246
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,440
You don't owe me anything.

247
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
These people below

248
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,479
can't recognize greatness.

249
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,039
Prince, please forgive them.

250
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,239
No need to say that.

251
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,599
After all, everyone knows

252
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,119
the Beiyang Army is rising these days.

253
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,559
I'm just a leisure Prince.

254
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,359
I can't compare to Commander Yang's prestige.

255
00:12:58,599 --> 00:12:59,320
Prince,

256
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,719
you're flattering me too much.

257
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,479
I'm just joking.

258
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,239
Commander Yang,

259
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,559
please don't take it seriously.

260
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,000
Actually, I came this time

261
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:10,919
on behalf of the Empress Dowager.

262
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,440
I'm tracking a wanted criminal.

263
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,719
And this person

264
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,960
has ties to your wife's family, the Gu residence.

265
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,080
So I came to see your wife.

266
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,239
To ask about old matters.

267
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,280
I...

268
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
I've been married for fifteen years.

269
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:28,559
I'm afraid I don't know much about my family's past.

270
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,520
Since it's for the Empress Dowager,

271
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,559
we'll cooperate for sure.

272
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,359
This person's name is Qin Yu.

273
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,520
He was a city constable.

274
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,080
Madam, do you remember him?

275
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,200
I do not recall.

276
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,760
If he truly has ties to the Gu family,

277
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,919
Prince, you can ask my parents.

278
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,799
Judging by her reaction,

279
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,119
Qin Yu

280
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:57,039
is the Qin Yu from the Reformist faction.

281
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,919
That's him.

282
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,159
As far as I know,

283
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:04,280
the Inner Court once hunted him for joining the Reformists.

284
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,719
But after the storm passed,

285
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,320
the matter faded away.

286
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,559
I wonder, Prince,

287
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,880
why are you looking for him now?

288
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,799
So it seems

289
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,840
Commander Yang and Qin Yu are close.

290
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,359
More than just close.

291
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,239
Qin Yu did me a great favor.

292
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,119
Many years ago,

293
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,799
I was in danger while on duty.

294
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,840
Qin Yu risked his life to save me.

295
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,119
When did you last see him?

296
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,200
About a year ago.

297
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,960
What on earth is going on here?

298
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,039
No idea.

299
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,239
But I can be sure of one thing.

300
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,719
This person

301
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,400
is not Gu Shuyin.

302
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,159
What?
