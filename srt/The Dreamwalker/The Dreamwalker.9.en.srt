1
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,319
When Dong Dachang brought the child over
this afternoon,

2
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:42,720
he was barely hanging on.

3
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,599
He went to find the Daoist Master
to let the child's blood.

4
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,520
Look,

5
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,319
he vomited filthy blood all over me.

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,759
It was all poisoned blood.

7
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:52,080
I remembered you two were looking for him.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,720
So,

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,840
I rushed to the county office
without even changing clothes.

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,360
Are you sure it's Xiu Lan's son, Xiao Man?

11
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:57,959
Yes.

12
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,639
We've all seen that child before.

13
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,560
Look,

14
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,680
he's right inside.

15
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,160
Master.

16
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:07,360
Fuyi.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,599
They said there was a Daoist.

18
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:10,720
I didn't expect it to be you.

19
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:11,559
Yes.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,879
Master.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,599
This is Xiao Man, right?

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,559
That's right.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,720
You're Dong Dachang.

24
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,480
Why is Xiu Lan and

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,040
Zhang Shuisheng's child with you?

26
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:28,919
I...

27
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:31,879
I went to their house today.

28
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,760
I found Xiu Lan wasn't home.

29
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,720
Xiao Man was collapsed on the floor.

30
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,360
And Zhang Shuisheng

31
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,440
was passed out from smoking opium.

32
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:40,559
I panicked,

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,040
so I brought him here.

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,440
Master.

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,680
Last time I traveled here,

36
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,000
I ran into some trouble.

37
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,360
Sir,

38
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,440
thankfully Brother Dong helped me out.

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,800
So we became acquainted.

40
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,559
This time, I happened to pass by.

41
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,120
He rushed to find me

42
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,680
just to save this little one.

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,360
What's wrong with this child?

44
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,680
He's not sick.

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,839
He probably ate dirty river snails

46
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,839
or undercooked river fish or crab.

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,039
He has internal parasites.

48
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,440
C-can he still be cured?

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,880
The poisoned blood has been removed.

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,240
But to expel the parasites,

51
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,520
it will take some more time.

52
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,960
Don't worry.

53
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,600
Fuyi.

54
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:34,520
And this is...

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,839
I'm just a humble man.

56
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,880
I am

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Lord Baylor,

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Baiyintu.

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
I accepted a personnel escort

60
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,679
to take him back to the capital.

61
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,479
I've heard He Fuyi

62
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,919
and A Qi mention you before.

63
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,679
Daoist Master,

64
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,800
so you are the Prince.

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,600
My apologies.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,880
Let's get to business.

67
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,600
What exactly happened?

68
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,600
Boss,

69
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,839
please, have mercy.

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,839
Let me advance some more wages.

71
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,320
Save my son, please.

72
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,000
He...

73
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,399
He's really very sick.

74
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,279
When your husband left,

75
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,520
didn't he take your wages with him?

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,160
Why are you still asking me?

77
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,679
He...

78
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,639
He hasn't come home.

79
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,919
Probably off gambling again.

80
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,679
Boss,

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,639
Boss,

82
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,199
Boss, I'm begging you.

83
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,279
Boss,

84
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,839
Xiao Man...

85
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,479
What should we do?

86
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,039
What should we do?

87
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,360
Sister Xiu Lan,

88
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,479
how old is your child?

89
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,800
What illness does he have?

90
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,479
Uncle,

91
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,360
will I die?

92
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,600
If I die,

93
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,199
Mother

94
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,160
won't be so tired anymore, right?

95
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,240
Silly child,

96
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,320
what are you saying?

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,480
You won't die.

98
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,839
Without you,

99
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,359
your mother couldn't go on.

100
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,320
You have to be strong.

101
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,600
Build up your body and get healthy.

102
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,200
Your mother is waiting to enjoy your blessings.

103
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,600
Brother Dachang,

104
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,519
everyone says you're a good man.

105
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,480
Please,

106
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,040
help Xiao Man.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,160
A good man...

108
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,320
What kind of good man am I?

109
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,440
Once,

110
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,040
I had a daughter this small.

111
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,079
It was my own sin.

112
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,279
I caused her death.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,880
Sister Xiu Lan,

114
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,559
don't worry.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,959
I will help you for sure.

116
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,279
I'll cure Xiao Man's illness.

117
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,239
Madam Boss,

118
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,399
I'd like to get some wages in advance.

119
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,119
It's urgent.

120
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:23,959
Doctor,

121
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,279
my child keeps fainting now.

122
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,920
What should I do?

123
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,480
Any other symptoms?

124
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,679
Just his neck...

125
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:32,160
It's like there are worms inside his neck.

126
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,000
Sister Xiu Lan

127
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,799
Look,

128
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,200
this medicine

129
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,160
is from Bao Zhi Tang.

130
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,760
Take it

131
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,839
and give it to the child.

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,760
From Bao Zhi Tang.

133
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,600
Brother Dachang,

134
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,160
thank you on my child's behalf.

135
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,399
It's pouring outside.

136
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Put this on.

137
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,359
Don't get soaked.

138
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,000
Brother Dachang,

139
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,959
please help me one more time.

140
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,640
Can you help me again?

141
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,079
I'm begging you, please.

142
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,239
Just

143
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,959
lend me some more money.

144
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,440
I...

145
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,119
You saw it yourself.

146
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Xiao Man is very weak.

147
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,200
One dose won't cure him.

148
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,200
I want to help him

149
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,440
recover his health.

150
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,000
Brother Dachang,

151
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,239
I promise I'll pay you back.

152
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
Even if I have to work myself to the bone,

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,480
I'll return the money to you.

154
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,559
Come, come.

155
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:54,399
Get up first.

156
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,559
Stand up.

157
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,600
Let's talk standing.

158
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,679
Come.

159
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,559
That money,

160
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,160
I spent it all on medicine.

161
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,600
I really have no money left.

162
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,720
How about

163
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,040
I try to find another way?

164
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:28,920
Xiu Lan,

165
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,399
Xiu Lan,

166
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,160
Xiu Lan...

167
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,359
I borrowed a bit more.

168
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,160
Here,

169
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,640
take it.

170
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,399
You have to hold on.

171
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,399
Xiao Man

172
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:42,600
can only rely on you now.

173
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,760
That day,

174
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,799
after I found the longevity lock missing,

175
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,480
I rushed out to look for it.

176
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,119
But I couldn't find any trace of Xiu Lan.

177
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,519
Today I got Zhang Shuisheng's address.

178
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,799
I wanted to ask her again,

179
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,640
but as soon as I entered,

180
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,119
I saw Xiao Man collapsed on the ground.

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,119
I panicked

182
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,760
and brought him here.

183
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,279
How did this happen?

184
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,079
I shouldn't have gone to Bao Zhi Tang.

185
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,040
I shouldn't have helped Xiu Lan

186
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
borrow money for her.

187
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,079
It's none of your business.

188
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,000
That's called karma.

189
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,480
Do evil,

190
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,440
harbor wicked thoughts,

191
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,479
and there will always be consequences.

192
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,159
But you,

193
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,200
just do good deeds

194
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,159
and don't worry about the future.

195
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,559
This is your daughter's longevity lock.

196
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,799
I got it back from Zhang Shuisheng.

197
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,359
What he spent

198
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,520
I'll make up for it.

199
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,799
The rest

200
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,239
is a reward for you.

201
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,559
No, no.

202
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,840
So...

203
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,520
Xiao Man is now an orphan.

204
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,039
I'm willing to adopt him.

205
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,599
As long as he takes his medicine,

206
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,919
he'll be fine.

207
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,359
But finding the truth isn't enough.

208
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,520
We must cure Xiao Man

209
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,359
to resolve Xiu Lan's obsession.

210
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,119
Master,

211
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,599
you've helped me a lot again.

212
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,200
As expected,

213
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,679
you're investigating this case

214
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,479
because of the Seven Stars Dream.

215
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,599
Daoist Master Yun

216
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:57,200
also knows about the Seven Stars Dream.

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,799
Of course.

218
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,239
The way we decipher Spirit Aura

219
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,880
was taught to us by Master

220
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
step by step.

221
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,039
So...

222
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,960
Daoist Master Yun can enter the Seven Stars Dream?

223
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,559
Can Prince

224
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,799
you enter the Seven Stars Dream?

225
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,440
I can.

226
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,239
But I don't know how he does it.

227
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,719
So,

228
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,559
Daoist Master Yun knows a lot,

229
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,559
but can't enter the Seven Stars Dream.

230
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,080
He Fuyi had a special chance since childhood

231
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,679
and can activate the Seven Stars Lamp.

232
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,400
Logically,

233
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,159
no one but her

234
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,000
should be able to see the Seven Stars Dream.

235
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,799
So it seems

236
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,799
Prince and the Seven Stars Lamp,

237
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,760
or rather, with He Fuyi,

238
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,719
are deeply connected.

239
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,159
Of course.

240
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,960
Me...

241
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,080
Mother...

242
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,559
Where are you?

243
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,359
Mother...

244
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,400
I thought I'd survived,

245
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,239
but lost my home.

246
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,520
One thought, pure paradise.

247
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,280
One thought, endless hell.

248
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,039
Karma and retribution

249
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,080
follow us everywhere.

250
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,840
No matter what,

251
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,479
Xiao Man is still alive.

252
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,919
This is Xiu Lan's dying wish

253
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,400
fulfilled at last.

254
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,119
Mm.

255
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,119
And Xiao Man

256
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,280
is adopted by a good man like Dong Dachang.

257
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,640
She'll surely be at peace.

258
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,239
Mother...

259
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,840
Spirit Aura

260
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,000
Finally, another one is lit.

261
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,320
Fuyi.

262
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,440
Congratulations.

263
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,599
The day all seven stars are lit

264
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:33,520
is not far away.

265
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,880
Just three or four more people's spirit aura.

266
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:37,960
Mm.

267
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,119
It's really exciting.

268
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,320
Six stars

269
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,200
are all shining now.

270
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,559
I feel so strong now.

271
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,239
How is her master such a Daoist?

272
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,159
The day I met He Fuyi,

273
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,640
she fell off a cliff.

274
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,159
Yun Yi saved her.

275
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,719
Maybe cultivators believe in karma.

276
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,280
So he took He Fuyi as his disciple.

277
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:09,119
So he must be very old.

278
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,359
But you can't tell at all.

279
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,440
Yun Yi's Daoist arts are profound.

280
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,919
Many secrets of the Seven Stars Lamp

281
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,359
I didn't know at first.

282
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,840
How to explain to He Fuyi,

283
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,440
Yun Yi searched everywhere,

284
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,799
checked ancient texts,

285
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,919
and guided He Fuyi to figure it out.

286
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,320
Aqi.

287
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,200
You're too honest with me.

288
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,400
You and He Fuyi both carry secret treasures.

289
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,359
Enough people are watching you already.

290
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,559
So,

291
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,960
you can't share this info easily.

292
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,479
It'll only bring you trouble.

293
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,719
Xiao Wuzi isn't just anyone.

294
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,719
Aqi.

295
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,760
But you really aren't just anyone.

296
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,640
Your scent feels so familiar to me.

297
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:53,479
Even closer than what Yun Yi gives me.

298
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,359
So what's Prince's background?

299
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,280
The Empress Dowager sent him for the Seven Stars Lamp.

300
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,679
He must've targeted me from the start.

301
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,960
So he made up a lame excuse

302
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,919
to stick with me.

303
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,320
As long as you know.

304
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,320
But he really can enter the Seven Stars Dream.

305
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,799
He sees spirit aura.

306
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,880
That's why I kept him.

307
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,960
Master.

308
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,280
You said

309
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,760
only those kindred with the Seven Stars Lamp

310
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,440
can enter the Seven Stars Dream.

311
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,760
What's so special about him

312
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,400
that he can truly sense all this?

313
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,320
Our analysis of the Seven Stars Lamp

314
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,520
is just scratching the surface.

315
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,640
Everyone has their own fate.

316
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,719
Many things

317
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,359
can't be forced.

318
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,039
I have something to tell you.

319
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:03,520
Go ahead.

320
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,119
Come here.

321
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,719
Come on.

322
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,719
What are you doing?

323
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,359
What's up?

324
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,960
Nothing now.

325
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,239
No, no, no.

326
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,760
Let's finish our earlier talk.

327
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,039
Indeed.

328
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,320
I act on the Empress Dowager's decree

329
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,960
to seek the Seven Stars Lamp.

330
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,919
It was wrong to lie to you.

331
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,239
Hit or scold me as you wish.

332
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,960
But I truly meant no harm.

333
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,479
Oh.

334
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,080
Just "oh"?

335
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,320
I don't care about your motive.

336
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,200
Since you came to me,

337
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,280
you must know

338
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,239
ten years ago,

339
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,599
Zhenhuan Biaoju was wiped out overnight.

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,039
Only I survived, right?

341
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,479
Everyone who knows this story

342
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,000
is curious

343
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,400
how such a little girl

344
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,719
was hunted down,

345
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,039
even jumped off a cliff,

346
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,919
and still survived.

347
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,119
Baiyintu.

348
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,559
Do you think

349
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,599
I'm really alive?
