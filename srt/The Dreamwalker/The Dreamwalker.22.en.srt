1
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,520
Fifth Young Lord has been found by the Empress Dowager.

2
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:45,599
She has already issued an imperial decree.

3
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:48,159
She ordered the Imperial Guards to escort him back.

4
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:50,560
Will Beile really give the Seven Stars Lamp

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,439
and He Fuyi to the Empress Dowager?

6
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,639
Then his agreement with you, Prince,

7
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,919
and our own promise would be abandoned.

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,200
Fifth Young Lord wouldn't stir up trouble for no reason.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,160
After all, the Seven Stars Lamp

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,040
is just a legendary artifact.

11
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,440
If used well,

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,120
reward.

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,400
But if misused or broken,

14
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,559
the first to lose his head

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,360
will be Baiyintu.

16
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,680
Old Buddha has summoned him by decree.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,639
And sent Imperial Guards to escort him.

18
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,279
Even if Fifth Young Lord wants to hide,

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,199
he has no chance now.

20
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:28,519
Fifth Young Lord seems sly usually,

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,440
but he has no grand ambitions.

22
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,599
And in the whirlpool of power,

23
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,839
he struggles to keep afloat.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
He just wants a peaceful life.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,599
But this time, this hot potato

26
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,160
has somehow landed on him.

27
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,639
Maybe it's because Fifth Young Lord

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,319
is quite skilled.

29
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,559
Anyway, no matter what,

30
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,599
the Seven Stars Lamp

31
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,400
must never fall into the Empress Dowager's hands.

32
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,199
Oh, right.

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,760
I, the Prince,

34
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,760
have drafted a secret letter in advance.

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,839
You must secretly

36
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,680
deliver it to Fifth Young Lord at Beile Mansion.

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,639
Also,

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,679
when the time comes,

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,320
arrange some men.

40
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,000
Find an opportunity

41
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,679
to create some chaos.

42
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,479
It will help He Fuyi escape.

43
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,800
If anything goes wrong,

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,720
destroy the Seven Stars Lamp

45
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,839
and kill He Fuyi.

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
We've already gathered the old lady's Spiritual Qi.

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
The seventh Big Dipper star

48
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,800
has also been lit.

49
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,839
But the Seven Stars Lamp

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,000
shows no reaction.

51
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,320
I don't feel anything either.

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,839
Maybe it's just like before.

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,639
Lighting it alone isn't enough.

54
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,039
We need more spiritual light and Spiritual Qi

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,000
to fill it up.

56
00:02:59,399 --> 00:02:59,919
Right.

57
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,679
After lighting the sixth Big Dipper star,

58
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
we gathered two more people's Spiritual Qi

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,199
to light the seventh star.

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,639
So it seems

61
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,759
we need more time

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,279
to collect more people's dreams.

63
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,679
But now it's difficult.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,240
Of all times, Old Buddha is watching us now.

65
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,880
And brought so many people.

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,039
Now we really can't run.

67
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,919
Can't hide either.

68
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,399
It's fine.

69
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,119
If worst comes to worst, just hand me over.

70
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,399
Anyway,

71
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,839
not just anyone can activate the Seven Stars Lamp.

72
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,199
The Seven Stars Lamp is an ancient artifact.

73
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,360
For hundreds and thousands of years,

74
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
who knows how many hands it's passed through.

75
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,800
But there are many legends about it.

76
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,000
Plenty, in fact.

77
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,279
Whether it's Zhuge Liang who divided the realm,

78
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,440
or Liu Bowen who unified the land,

79
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:49,080
they only knew a little about it.

80
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,880
The reason I could summon A Qi

81
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,240
was pure chance.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So even if you take me and the lamp to the palace,

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,800
probably nothing will happen.

84
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,679
If only that were true.

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,440
I'm just afraid Old Buddha

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,399
has too many talented people around her.

87
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,720
In the end,

88
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,800
it's all my fault.

89
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,320
I shouldn't have come to you.

90
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,720
It's not your fault.

91
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,000
I was the one who spread the word.

92
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,640
If not you, it would have been someone else.

93
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,839
The situation isn't so bad now.

94
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,000
Seven Big Dipper stars

95
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,480
are all lit.

96
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,040
With two more Spiritual Qi at most,

97
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,399
I can survive.

98
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,160
Also,

99
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Before Shen Changfeng died, he said

100
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,679
What did he say?

101
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,679
I don't know either.

102
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:33,720
His identity

103
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,799
is very mysterious.

104
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,720
Back then, your father protected you and fought your way out.

105
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,880
He personally hunted you down.

106
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,440
I only know he was a cultivator—

107
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:47,720
A cultivator...

108
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,079
Now that you mention it,

109
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,720
I do remember

110
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,119
when my father took me fleeing,

111
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,799
someone chased us from behind.

112
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,399
I definitely saw him.

113
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,320
Do you remember what he looked like?

114
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,239
He was masked.

115
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,320
It's normal not to remember.

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,399
After all, at that time

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,920
you were only seven.

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,239
But

119
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,760
from when my father fled with me

120
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,320
to when I woke up below the cliff,

121
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,040
such a long stretch of memory

122
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,920
I can't remember any of it.

123
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,399
Did I hit my head too hard?

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,760
I used to think

125
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,399
it was because I was young,

126
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,320
plus the urgent situation,

127
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,839
and the trauma.

128
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,920
It's normal not to remember.

129
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,880
But now that I think about it,

130
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,480
this missing memory

131
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,839
doesn't seem so simple.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
It can't be

133
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,959
someone opened your head

134
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,720
and stole that memory, right?

135
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,399
Actually,

136
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,359
I've always wanted to tell you something.

137
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,880
About our first meeting?

138
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,559
What are you talking about?

139
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
It was that day at Shen Changfeng's house.

140
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,760
What do you want to say?

141
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,640
I want to say,

142
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,839
if the missing memory

143
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,000
really wasn't an accident,

144
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,519
then the day you fell off the cliff and were in danger,

145
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,200
the first person you saw when you woke up

146
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,760
is the most suspicious.

147
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,640
The one who harmed you

148
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,279
was me?

149
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,480
The reason you suspect my master

150
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,200
Is this the only reason?

151
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,200
There’s more.

152
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,239
It’s nothing.

153
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,160
Whether it’s memory loss

154
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,679
or so-called eyewitness accounts,

155
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,440
they’re just our own speculations.

156
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,480
If my master

157
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,279
really wanted to steal the Seven Stars Lamp

158
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,160
and was the one who wiped out my family,

159
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,480
then the moment he saw me,

160
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,279
he should have taken the Seven Stars Lamp.

161
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,040
He had no reason to save my life.

162
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,760
Even less reason to teach me his skills.

163
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,040
I know.

164
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,160
He,

165
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,760
was with you for ten whole years.

166
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,000
He’s the master you trust most.

167
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,600
So this is your home.

168
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,200
How is it?

169
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:02,959
Not bad, right?

170
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,559
Our Beile Mansion

171
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,239
among all the Beiles in Four-Nine City,

172
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,720
is truly one of a kind.

173
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:10,920
Beile Lord.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Please wash your hands first.

175
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,040
It’s pretty nice.

176
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,320
Now it seems

177
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,760
you really look like a noble.

178
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,920
It’s been hard on you.

179
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,079
All along the way,

180
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,880
you’ve endured hardship with me.

181
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,159
What’s wrong?

182
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,760
Don’t move.

183
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,599
There’s something on you.

184
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Be careful tonight.

185
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,280
Leave as soon as you get a chance.

186
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,799
Don’t trust anyone.

187
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,080
What’s wrong?

188
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,520
When I get close to someone,

189
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,840
my heart starts racing.

190
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,880
Logically speaking,

191
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,640
this feeling

192
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,239
should be attraction.

193
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,520
Right?

194
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,239
Zhang Wei and his men are guarding Beile Mansion.

195
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,799
And they’re the best fighters

196
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,559
in the Imperial Guards.

197
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,039
If we reach a stalemate,

198
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,239
we have only one goal.

199
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
That’s the Seven Stars Lamp.

200
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,119
If we can’t get it,

201
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,400
we destroy it.

202
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,919
Urgent summons from the Empress Dowager.

203
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:08,799
Deliver.

204
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,080
Oral decree from the Empress Dowager.

205
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,679
To Dorobele,

206
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,679
Baiyintu,

207
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,000
enter the palace at once.

208
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,559
for an audience.

209
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,440
Only me is summoned.
