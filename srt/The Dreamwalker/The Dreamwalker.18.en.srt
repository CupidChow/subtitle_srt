1
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,279
Dig.

2
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,840
Hurry, dig.

3
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,319
Are you sure it's here?

4
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,919
I'm sure. Absolutely.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,880
Right here.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,799
Right here.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,200
Here.

8
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,360
You dare mess with me?

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,480
This Japanese sir,

10
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:14,160
aren't these the turtle shells
you're looking for?

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,120
So many turtle shells,

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,680
aren't they enough for you?

13
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:31,760
I'll make you pay for Yi Yi's life.

14
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,919
I just won't tell you.

15
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,319
You little bastard.

16
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Go to hell.

17
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,199
That Luo Yurong refused to talk
no matter what.

18
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:51,239
And that bitch

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,680
kept us trapped all night for nothing.

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,720
Both who knew where the oracle bones went
are dead.

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,400
I've wasted so much time.

22
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Where's his body?

23
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,760
The body?

24
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,520
Of course, chopped up and fed to fish.

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,240
And you?

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,160
Are you ready?

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,639
Mr. Luo is gone.

28
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,600
Big Brother is gone too.

29
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:29,800
Who will protect me from now on?

30
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,199
Heaven sees what people do.

31
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,080
This kid survived

32
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,960
because he did something remarkable.

33
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,360
What about A Gou?

34
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:40,600
No matter what,

35
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,160
he still held his ground in the end.

36
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,880
It's just a pity about Luo Yurong.

37
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,559
Yeah.

38
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,919
You two are fools.

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,839
For some worthless turtle shells,

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,520
you risked your lives.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Yi Yi.

42
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,559
Dead.

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,360
It's all my fault.

44
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,839
If I hadn't betrayed you,

45
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,800
maybe you would've escaped long ago.

46
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,639
If not for me,

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,360
Not me,

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,880
being so greedy.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,080
Yi Yi.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,600
Yi Yi.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,559
Yi Yi wouldn't have died.

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,279
A Gou.

53
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,479
But don't worry.

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,119
I won't make the same mistake again.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,119
Where are the oracle bones?

56
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,440
I know.

57
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,199
But that's the treasure

58
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,080
you protected with your lives.

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,679
No one can take it away.

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,559
Old Luo.

61
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,440
Old Luo.

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,799
What's going on?

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,519
Didn't you collect A Gou's spirit aura?

64
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,600
If it were that easy,

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,959
I'd have finished long ago.

66
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,239
Besides, things always get harder

67
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,239
at the very end.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,399
Your servant greets Prince.

69
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:53,480
What's wrong?

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,320
Prince.

71
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,200
Prince Ning is passing through here.

72
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,959
He wishes you and Miss He

73
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
to join him for a talk.

74
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,119
Greetings, Prince.

75
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,480
Rise.

76
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,160
Xiao Wu,

77
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,839
you've been away from the capital so long.

78
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,200
The Forbidden City

79
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,079
isn't as lively as it used to be.

80
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,279
Honestly,

81
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,679
I, the Prince,

82
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,399
actually miss you.

83
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,239
Of course.

84
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,720
Who else is like me,

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,119
skilled in both pen and sword,

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,519
loved by all?

87
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,359
I suppose this is

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,160
He Fuyi, Miss He?

89
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,799
Good.

90
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,839
Come, sit with us.

91
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,079
I heard

92
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,480
Miss He often has

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,359
a seven or eight-year-old girl with her.

94
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:51,920
So,

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,720
she didn't come this time?

96
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,679
Prince,

97
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,320
she's staying with relatives on the way.

98
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,359
That's a shame.

99
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
I really wanted to meet her.

100
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,760
Prince.

101
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,839
Why did you suddenly come to this remote place?

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,679
Lately,

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,640
the Yellow River floods have been frequent.

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,239
I, the Prince, am concerned.

105
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,760
So I came to see for myself.

106
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,279
So those below

107
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,679
don't slack off.

108
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
Prince, you serve the country and people

109
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,679
with tireless effort.

110
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,720
You sly fox.

111
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,600
No wonder the Empress Dowager

112
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,760
likes him.

113
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,040
Even when I greeted her this time,

114
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,720
she asked me

115
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,440
about his news.

116
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,640
Really?

117
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,559
I really am popular.

118
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,959
But Xiao Wu,

119
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,519
now

120
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,320
you're not so well-behaved.

121
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,239
Forgive me, Prince.

122
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,720
Prince.

123
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,799
Feel free to speak plainly.

124
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't scare him.

125
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,559
Seems Miss He is quite straightforward.

126
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,600
Prince,

127
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,079
mainly,

128
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,040
I'm not good at beating around the bush.

129
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,320
I just don't get it.

130
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,200
All right.

131
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,040
I'll do it for Miss He Fuyi's sake.

132
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,200
Let me give you some advice.

133
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,799
The Empress Dowager lately

134
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,079
has not been feeling well.

135
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,399
But still,

136
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,679
she keeps worrying about your schedule.

137
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,880
She talks about you,

138
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,920
and also about Miss He Fuyi,

139
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,239
and the lamp she holds—

140
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,359
the Seven Stars Lamp.

141
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,320
Prince.

142
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,200
This lamp

143
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,119
is indeed with Miss He Fuyi.

144
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,880
Since that's the case,

145
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,559
why have you been dragging your feet

146
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,640
instead of returning sooner?

147
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,519
It's not that I don't want to.

148
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,320
I simply can't.

149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,679
The lamp has a problem.

150
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm afraid to use it for the Empress Dowager.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,799
That's something new.

152
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,640
Miss He Fuyi,

153
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,760
what do you say?

154
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,200
He's right.

155
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:58,679
The lamp is broken.

156
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
It's broken.

157
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,239
So that means,

158
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,200
even if the Empress Dowager wants you,

159
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:09,839
and you aren't rushing back,

160
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,559
not eager to report back,

161
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,440
aren't you afraid she'll blame you?

162
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,839
Even if she does,

163
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,200
we can't give her something broken.

164
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,959
No.

165
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,000
We still don't know how

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,320
to use the lamp exactly.

167
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,359
That's true.

168
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,559
Get up now.

169
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,359
I also heard

170
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,039
Lan Hai Society rebels chased you.

171
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,000
Is that true?

172
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Yes.

173
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,880
I was so mad I sent word to the palace.

174
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,159
Later, I

175
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,719
will keep a close eye on this.

176
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Thank you, Prince.

177
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,080
There's another coffin under the tomb's coffin.

178
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Luo Yurong put the box of oracle bones

179
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
inside it.

180
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:12,919
Good.

181
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,719
Glad you found them.

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,280
I'll take the oracle bones

183
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,799
back to Master Li.

184
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,000
He's an expert in this field.

185
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,239
He won't let down Luo Yurong's

186
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,599
sacrifice to protect them.

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,119
Thank you, Prince.

188
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,119
For honoring Luo Yurong and A Gou's devotion.

189
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,799
Farewell, Prince.

190
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,599
First, I met the Prince.

191
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,440
Then, the Royal Prince.

192
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,359
In this life,

193
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,200
I've finally brought honor

194
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,039
to the Li family.

195
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,119
Prince Ning came here on purpose

196
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,479
to expose the situation.

197
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,840
He wants us to join him.

198
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,200
But the Empress Dowager

199
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,520
keeps watching you.

200
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,039
It's never over.

201
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,679
Who knows what trouble will come next?

202
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,479
It's like gods fighting,

203
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,359
and mortals suffer.

204
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,559
Logically speaking,

205
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,880
whether it's the Empress Dowager or the Prince,

206
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,400
I can't resist either.

207
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,200
I can only deal with things as they come.

208
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,559
Prince Ning is held back by her.

209
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,479
So he recruits us in secret.

210
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,559
If the Empress Dowager

211
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,119
really has an accident,

212
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,200
he'll go after the Seven Stars Lamp first.

213
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
There's no way around it.

214
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,400
The legend of the Seven Stars Life Lamp

215
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,520
is too tempting.

216
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,559
We can't avoid it.

217
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,119
We must quickly light up

218
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,080
the Big Dipper Diagram in the lamp.

219
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,359
To keep you safe first.

220
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,320
And Shen Changfeng.

221
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,760
We must find him quickly.

222
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,840
Otherwise,

223
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,200
I'll lose all my leads.

224
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,679
Why did things suddenly get so urgent?

225
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,679
It's as if

226
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,080
an invisible hand

227
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,239
has tangled everything together.

228
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,000
It started when you suddenly showed up

229
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
and shamelessly tagged along.

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,159
Don't talk nonsense.

231
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,159
Have some conscience.

232
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,280
I'm not making things up.

233
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,599
I've found you odd several times.

234
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,359
This time, you must answer me.

235
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,039
At the execution ground in Shaoxing,

236
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,719
wasn't our first meeting,

237
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,520
right?

238
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,559
So it's true.

239
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,119
Though I don't remember,

240
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,159
you've saved me from harm twice.

241
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,679
So I never hurt you before.

242
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,080
I helped you, didn't I?

243
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,679
You wouldn't repay kindness with hatred.

244
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,239
But logically,

245
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,840
if it's to repay a favor,

246
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,239
saving me twice is enough.

247
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,640
To risk yourself again

248
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,559
and get involved in this mess

249
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,280
caught between the Empress Dowager and the Prince,

250
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,520
is a bit much, isn't it?

251
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,359
Be careful.

252
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,599
Be careful.
