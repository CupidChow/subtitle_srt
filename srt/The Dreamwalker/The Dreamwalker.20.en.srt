1
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:41,479
A bunch of blockheads

2
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,400
You attack without asking questions

3
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,240
If I weren't truly skilled

4
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,680
I might've been beaten up by you

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,639
Let's see how many heads you have to pay

6
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:50,240
Servant

7
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,240
Blind fool

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
You hurt the Prince

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,279
You deserve a thousand deaths

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,959
Don't talk nonsense

11
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,520
Just you few

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,680
Think you can hurt me?

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,080
Yes

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,760
The Prince's martial arts are superb

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,720
Of course

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,319
Enough

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,199
Get up

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,639
I can't be bothered to argue

19
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,760
Thank you, Prince

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,360
Speak

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,599
Why are you here

22
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,519
Who exactly are you after?

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,919
Replying to the Prince

24
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:21,199
Recently

25
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,120
We've been ordered to arrest

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Lan Hai Society rebels

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,279
Their base in the capital

28
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:27,639
Has already been destroyed by us

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,680
The others have all been captured

30
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:30,919
Only

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,360
The owner of the photo studio

32
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,599
Seems to have gotten wind of it early

33
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:35,760
He ran off long ago

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,519
We tracked him all the way here

35
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,120
Found this is his hometown

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,319
We believe he's hiding at home

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,760
So

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,760
We confirmed the address and came

39
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,919
Didn't expect

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,559
To run into the Prince

41
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,599
That person

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,760
Who is he?

43
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,559
He is the leader of the Lan Hai Society remnants

44
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,319
Shen Changfeng

45
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,000
What?

46
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,240
Prince

47
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,919
You're also looking for him?

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,839
More or less

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,679
But he's already gone

50
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,440
I guess

51
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,600
He sensed something beforehand

52
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,479
And already fled

53
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:19,919
He's truly clever

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,800
Escaped right under our noses several times

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,199
But

56
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,839
After tracking him all this way

57
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,559
We found

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,360
He was seriously injured recently

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
He shouldn't get far

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,240
Injured?

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,199
Alright

62
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,720
Then hurry and go find him

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,600
Remember

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,600
Find him as fast as you can

65
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,320
And

66
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,479
I want him alive

67
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,839
If he's dead

68
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,839
I won't forgive you

69
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,559
Yes

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,119
Didn't expect

71
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:52,240
This old lady is Shen Changfeng's grandmother

72
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,839
Looks like Shen Changfeng

73
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,759
Has really been hiding here

74
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,759
He can't hide much longer

75
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,240
Don't worry

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,679
We'll catch him this time

77
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,720
The old lady was fine a few days ago

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,119
Carrying a basket

79
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,679
Went to pick chestnuts

80
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,360
How did it suddenly...

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,919
Who doesn't wonder

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,600
But no matter what

83
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,199
We can't just leave her like this

84
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,240
Her funeral

85
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
We have to handle it

86
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,520
Right

87
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,720
Shouldn't we ask

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,919
Changfeng's opinion?

89
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,639
He's her only family after all

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Don't mention that ungrateful wretch

91
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
Ungrateful wretch

92
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,759
Don't talk nonsense

93
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,919
He hasn't visited in over ten years

94
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,360
And after all these years

95
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,240
Have you ever heard her mention him?

96
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,320
It's not like that

97
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,600
She must be heartbroken

98
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,440
She probably forgot him long ago

99
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,240
Forget it

100
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,000
We've received her kindness since childhood

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,759
Her funeral

102
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,919
Let us handle it

103
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,240
Alright

104
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,919
Everyone lend a hand

105
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,839
Let's give her funeral

106
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,119
A grand send-off

107
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,800
Alright, yes

108
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,800
I have no idea what you all came here for.

109
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,919
Hey, young man, look.

110
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,559
Now the old lady is gone.

111
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,880
We still have to handle the funeral.

112
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,199
It's fine.

113
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,600
We're just here on someone else's behalf.

114
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,360
We came to check things out.

115
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,880
With something like this happening,

116
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:07,679
we...

117
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,039
won't trouble you any further.

118
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,320
Dali.

119
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,279
Who is this person?

120
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,119
He came looking for the old lady.

121
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,399
These past few days,

122
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,000
why are so many people coming for her?

123
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,640
Someone came yesterday too.

124
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,679
When was that?

125
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,679
What did that person look like?

126
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,839
Uh, uh...

127
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:24,920
It was yes—

128
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
last night.

129
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:27,959
Last month,

130
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,760
the old lady

131
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
asked me to buy flour for her in town.

132
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,640
Grandmother.

133
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:33,000
I just bought it back yesterday.

134
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,519
Grandmother.

135
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,839
When it got dark,

136
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,200
I hurried over to deliver the flour.

137
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,920
Grandmother.

138
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,920
It's me, Zhuzi.

139
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,640
Grandmother.

140
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,480
The flour you asked me to bring,

141
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,559
I've brought it for you.

142
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,440
Sorry to trouble you again.

143
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,679
Yesterday, as soon as I entered,

144
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:48,920
I saw a stranger.

145
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,000
Grandmother.

146
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,679
You have a guest at home.

147
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,200
So tomorrow,

148
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,839
are we still going to pick chestnuts?

149
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,399
No, not going.

150
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,000
Grandmother has other things tomorrow.

151
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:02,799
Then, grandmother,

152
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,119
I'll head out now.

153
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,040
Go on, go on.

154
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:06,720
Go ahead.

155
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,799
Why didn't you say so earlier?

156
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,279
But what if

157
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,640
that person was the one who harmed her?

158
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,119
How could that be possible?

159
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,160
Besides,

160
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,359
nothing was stolen.

161
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,679
The old lady

162
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,640
hanged herself, didn't she?

163
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,959
She wore those burial clothes.

164
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,399
She made them herself

165
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,839
in town a few years ago.

166
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,839
She always had me bring her clothes back.

167
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,119
That's right.

168
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,119
Her things—

169
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,959
no outsider could know where she hid them.

170
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,679
Exactly.

171
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,480
So she must've found them herself

172
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,559
and put them on.

173
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,480
She dressed neatly,

174
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:39,519
clean and tidy.

175
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,359
You could tell

176
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,839
she'd made up her mind to die.

177
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,799
Even though

178
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,000
I didn't see clearly,

179
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:46,880
but

180
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,600
I don't think that person was a bad guy.

181
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,320
How can you be sure?

182
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,000
Were you close with her?

183
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,760
My house is just behind hers.

184
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,600
She pretty much watched me grow up.

185
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,079
So you know Shen Changfeng too?

186
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,079
Do you also think he's an ungrateful wretch?

187
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,640
No way.

188
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,079
Changfeng had no choice.

189
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,239
The old lady understood him.

190
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,839
If Changfeng knew what happened to her,

191
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,519
he'd be more upset than anyone.

192
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,920
Grandmother.

193
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:24,959
I'm back.

194
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,040
Changfeng.

195
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,559
Cuicui.

196
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,239
How did you carry so much firewood alone?

197
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,320
It's fine, it's fine.

198
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,399
I can do it myself.

199
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,559
I'm going to study at the Naval Academy.

200
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,320
After that,

201
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,239
I'll join the Beiyang Army.

202
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,320
If I can't carry this much firewood,

203
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,720
how will I protect home and country?

204
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,040
Grandmother,

205
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,920
I've told you before,

206
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,160
these chestnuts are hard to peel.

207
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,959
Wait for me to peel them for you.

208
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,160
How could I let you,

209
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,839
a future hero who'll protect home and country,

210
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,959
do such a small chore?

211
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,559
Grandmother.

212
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,239
I protect home and country,

213
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:58,839
I join the army,

214
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,160
but not to be a hero.

215
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,200
Hurry, hurry!

216
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,600
There's fresh chestnut cake inside.

217
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,000
Go on!

218
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,480
Really?

219
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,920
Grandmother.

220
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,799
Your chestnut cake is the best in the world.

221
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,480
What do you know about "the world," kid?

222
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,239
It's just a chestnut cake.

223
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,359
It tastes good

224
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,519
because it's made with fresh chestnuts.

225
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,279
You can only eat it at this time of year.

226
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,399
After this season,

227
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,359
it won't taste the same.

228
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
If that's the case,

229
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,079
every year at this time,

230
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,279
I'll have to eat your chestnut cake at home.

231
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:33,959
Sure!

232
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,920
Give me one.

233
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,920
None left, I ate them all.

234
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,320
I'm not giving you any.

235
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,880
Come on, give me one.

236
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,519
No, no.

237
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,160
Not giving.

238
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,720
Give me.

239
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,640
Every year at this time,

240
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,160
the old lady would make lots of chestnut cake.

241
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,399
She just wanted Changfeng to have some

242
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,880
when he came home, fresh from the oven.

243
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,720
But he never came back.

244
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,200
He had no choice.

245
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
What do you know?

246
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,239
Nothing.

247
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,839
I have to go now.

248
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,640
Brother Dali.

249
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,160
Do you still have any Tianqi at home?

250
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,119
I hurt my leg a few days ago.

251
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,679
Yes, come with me to get it later.

252
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,239
Let's talk about the old lady first.

253
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,480
That person seemed off.

254
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,279
We'll all have to handle her funeral.

255
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:34,719
Changfeng.

256
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,719
Shen Changfeng.

257
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,400
Who was the one who killed you?

258
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,119
Who is the mastermind behind all this?

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Liu Cuicui has fainted.

260
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,719
The killer can only leave from here.

261
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,280
Darn it, I'll go take a look.

262
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,159
Be careful.
