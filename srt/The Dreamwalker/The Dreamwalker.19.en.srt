1
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,360
Who is it?

2
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,119
Grandma.

3
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,799
It's me.

4
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,560
Open the door.

5
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:55,919
Are you Rong?

6
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,599
Grandma, it's me.

7
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,479
Open the door.

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,959
Grandma.

9
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:03,599
It's me.

10
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:04,239
Open the door.

11
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,800
How could there be three people

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,919
coming together?

13
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:16,279
I knew you would come.

14
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:17,279
I told you,

15
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,760
I won't go with you.

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,400
I still have many important things to do.

17
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:22,839
I can't die.

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,040
Grandma.

19
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:25,599
You can keep hiding,

20
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,519
but Lord Yan Wang won't wait.

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,440
If you don't want to die,

22
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,400
then I'm afraid

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,360
we'll have to take your family

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,720
down with us.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,480
I'll go with you.

26
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,919
I'll go with you.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,160
Don't you dare hurt my grandson.

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,199
I won't hide anymore.

29
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:55,879
I won't hide anymore.

30
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,959
I'll go with you.

31
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,440
Wait for me.

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,480
Lord Yin Chai,

33
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,279
please, have mercy.

34
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,360
Let me finish these chestnut cakes,

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,919
can I finish them all?

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,559
You can,

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,520
but you must hurry.

38
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,839
My dear grandson,

39
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,119
this is Grandma's last time making chestnut cake for you.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
Grandma will make you extra.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,080
You must eat them slowly.

42
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,960
Lord Yin Chai,

43
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,559
do you know where my grandson

44
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,240
is right now?

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,679
In a wealthy room.

46
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,320
In a forest.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,080
There's one more piece

48
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,919
at the mass grave.

49
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,320
No.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,199
That's not right.

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,759
You're lying to me.

52
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,639
The last piece

53
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,399
is in my mouth.

54
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:44,399
Sir,

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,360
may I ask about an old grandma?

56
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,399
Old grandma?

57
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,160
Which old grandma?

58
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,720
She was famous as an embroiderer

59
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,000
since she was young.

60
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,039
She's a good person.

61
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,199
She often makes delicious food

62
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,919
and shares it with neighbors.

63
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,520
So we visit each other

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,639
quite often.

65
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,039
As for her grandson,

66
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,679
don't even mention him.

67
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,600
He's an ungrateful brat.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,440
She raised him herself.

69
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,360
But since he left to join the army over ten years ago,

70
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,720
he's never come back.

71
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,160
Isn't that heartless?

72
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,640
Not even once.

73
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,239
Exactly.

74
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:21,320
Sir, look,

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,959
in such a tiny place,

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,440
if he ever came back,

77
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,760
we would know.

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,679
Old lady,

79
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,320
someone's looking for you.

80
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,200
Old lady.

81
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,600
How did this open?

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,959
Old lady.

83
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,559
This...

84
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:56,920
This...

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,200
She asked me to help pick chestnuts yesterday,

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,399
how did she end up hanging herself today?

87
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
No matter what,

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,600
I must inform the others in the village.

89
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,239
This old lady lived alone.

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
We need to discuss

91
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,079
how to handle her funeral.

92
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,440
Alright.

93
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,799
Brother Dali, you go first.

94
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:26,640
We'll stay here.

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,239
Thanks, young man.

96
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,279
I'll be right back.

97
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,200
Well?

98
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,640
Did she really hang herself?

99
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,720
There's only one mark on her neck.

100
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
The mark is deep.

101
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,200
Most likely suicide by hanging.

102
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,720
And look at her burial clothes,

103
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,640
they're brand new.

104
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,640
No signs of creases from wear.

105
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,959
That means

106
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,160
before she hanged herself,

107
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,160
she dressed herself neatly

108
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,760
and stood up alone.

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,839
But I took a quick look earlier,

110
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,600
there's still firewood by the stove,

111
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,119
and half a bag of flour left.

112
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,519
Doesn't seem like she

113
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,320
was planning to kill herself.

114
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,959
Let's keep looking

115
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,239
for other clues.

116
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,040
Beiyang Naval Academy diploma.

117
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:17,040
Not everyone could study there back then.

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,839
That's why they say,

119
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,320
if you have a talented child,

120
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,200
send them to the Naval Academy.

121
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,640
Seems her grandson is no ordinary person.

122
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,440
These are letters her grandson wrote to her.

123
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,119
Since the twelfth year of Guangxu,

124
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,959
there were a few each year.

125
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,480
But by the twentieth year of Guangxu,

126
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,920
they stopped completely.

127
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,519
The twentieth year of Guangxu

128
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Jiawu Naval Battle

129
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,399
Could it be

130
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,559
that Grandma's grandson died for the country long ago

131
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,359
and that's why he never came back to see her?

132
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,119
That's possible

133
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,519
but I think

134
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,920
something feels off

135
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,760
What?

136
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,480
The weather hasn't been that cold lately

137
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,679
Although elderly people do feel cold easily

138
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:14,760
and use extra blankets

139
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,279
but this stack

140
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,679
is just too much

141
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:21,839
Besides,

142
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,920
even the bottom two layers

143
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,480
don't feel damp at all

144
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,399
I get it

145
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,559
If the blankets hadn't been used for a long time

146
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,159
they would be a bit damp

147
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,960
So logically,

148
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,200
someone must have stayed here

149
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
in the past couple of days

150
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,159
And Grandma

151
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,119
even aired the blankets for them

152
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,320
You suspect it was her grandson?

153
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,359
That's possible

154
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,080
But it must be someone who can't be seen

155
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,640
Even her closest neighbor

156
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,359
was kept in the dark

157
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,159
In her dream, she was making chestnut cake

158
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,479
but this is way too much

159
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,760
It's exactly like in her dream

160
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,640
Looks like before the incident yesterday

161
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,880
she was busy with these chestnuts

162
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,000
What exactly happened

163
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,760
to make her suddenly choose to hang herself?

164
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,359
If there was someone else

165
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,960
in the room at the time

166
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,840
did they just watch her hang herself?

167
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,039
Her resolve to die

168
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,119
came so suddenly

169
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,280
and was so absolute

170
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,599
She was even willing

171
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,599
and determined

172
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,159
Someone's here

173
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,919
There are many people

174
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
It's the Imperial Guards

175
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,479
Did the Empress Dowager send people to arrest me?

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,039
Imperial Guards

177
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,200
Ordered to arrest Chao Ting rebels

178
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,440
Anyone who resists

179
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,200
will be killed without mercy
