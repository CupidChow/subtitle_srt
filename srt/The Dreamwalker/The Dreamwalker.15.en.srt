1
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:40,759
Stop right there.

2
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,840
Don't come any closer.

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,840
Put down the knife.

4
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,119
Surrender now.

5
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:48,080
We only steal from rich merchants
and officials.

6
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:49,200
You little constable,

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,360
why risk your life for this?

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,880
Punishment knows no rank.

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,479
Reward misses no commoner.

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,599
The law comes first.

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,040
That's my duty.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Next,

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,319
let's see if the constable

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,759
can still keep up

15
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,879
that righteous tone.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,559
All together!

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,279
Filthy woman!

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,559
Attack together!

19
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,480
You win.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,639
We only caught this one.

21
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,120
The other thief

22
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,000
got away.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,040
You're really impressive.

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,839
No, no.

25
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,000
It was Miss Gu

26
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,239
who stepped in to help.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,879
Qin Yu was able to escape danger.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,400
Just now,

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,919
I heard what you said.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,680
Then,

31
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,680
Thank you, Constable.

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,720
For protecting the innocent.

33
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,239
Constable Qin,

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,120
what a coincidence.

35
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,080
Miss Gu.

36
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:10,679
Miss,

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,119
where did you go?

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,399
Master is looking for you.

39
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,080
This is for you.

40
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:39,520
It's "bo."

41
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:41,839
Correct, Miss Gu.

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,000
I heard that person

43
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,160
is skilled in music, chess,
calligraphy, and painting—

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,199
the eldest Miss of Gu Manor.

45
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,039
Truly like a banished immortal.

46
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,960
But I wonder

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,520
which noble family she'll marry.

48
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,160
It's "music."

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,440
Correct again.

50
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,880
Constable Qin,

51
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,320
be careful of the cold.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Miss Gu.

53
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,199
Thank you.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,679
By the way,

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,559
the other thief

56
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,240
still hasn't been caught.

57
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,559
You should be careful.

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,039
Miss, what's this?

59
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:55,800
Don't say anything yet.

60
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,039
Let's check their background first.

61
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,080
What's happened?

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,399
Don't move!

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,559
Stay back!

64
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,119
Let her go!

65
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,639
Come closer and I'll kill her.

66
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:15,919
If not for you two,

67
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,320
my brother would've escaped last time.

68
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,519
It's just a little money stolen.

69
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,000
Why hunt us to the end?

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,079
We can talk this out.

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,079
Let's negotiate.

72
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,440
This is my home.

73
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,279
You really think you can escape?

74
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,000
If I can't escape,

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,640
I'll take you down with me.

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,679
Miss Gu,

77
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,079
are you alright?

78
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,239
Mother.

79
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,079
Father.

80
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,519
What are you trying to do?

81
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,640
Shut your mouth!

82
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,600
You shameless thing!

83
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,640
Losing your reputation is minor,

84
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,679
but you disgrace the Gu family's name.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,679
That's truly unforgivable.

86
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,359
Master Gu,

87
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,720
what do you mean by this?

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,640
Qin Yu broke into Gu Manor at night.

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,679
A thief crying "catch the thief."

90
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,920
I've already caught him.

91
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,920
Father.

92
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,679
Fuyi.

93
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,880
It's alright.

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,040
Let's

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,640
go.

96
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,119
Where to?

97
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
Wu Ma's body—

98
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,760
Why so fierce?

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
She's just a young girl.

100
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,679
Heard she died suddenly,
possessed by evil.

101
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,519
So her family won't bury her.

102
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,320
We found her body
at the mass grave.

103
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,239
That's where we discovered her remains.

104
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,640
Did you find out Madam Gu's schedule?

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,760
She did return home
to visit family that night.

106
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,079
But on her way back,

107
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,000
Madam Gu

108
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,399
went to Fenghe Village.

109
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:53,279
She was poisoned by arsenic.

110
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,320
The evidence is solid.

111
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:58,480
Madam Gu must've gone to Fenghe Village

112
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,600
and learned something there.

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
The couple

114
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,880
grew apart because of it.

115
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,799
Gu Songbai killed his wife over this.

116
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,040
Besides Madam Gu,

117
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,320
Wu Ma, who was with her,

118
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,239
must also know the truth.

119
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,880
What could it be

120
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
that made Gu Songbai

121
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,679
commit such a reckless act?

122
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,000
Madam Gu's final wish

123
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:24,480
was for Gu Shuyin and Qin Yu
to escape together.

124
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,440
But Yang Kaizhi's wife

125
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,160
is a fake Gu Shuyin.

126
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,119
Qin Yu doesn't know this.

127
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,359
What we need to know now

128
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,880
is where the real Gu Shuyin

129
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,760
actually went.

130
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,880
Only one person knows the truth.

131
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,600
The funeral will be held soon.

132
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,119
Daughter and son-in-law must return.

133
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,200
Do you want to explain
to Yang Kaizhi

134
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,760
about the fake Gu Shuyin?

135
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,239
You all—

136
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,920
who are you, really?

137
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,239
What are you planning?

138
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,000
You killed her.

139
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,839
You poisoned Wu Ma too.

140
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,720
If the evidence from these two bodies
isn't enough,

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
we can go ask in Fenghe Village.

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,760
That day, Madam Gu

143
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,040
what exactly did she learn
in Fenghe Village?

144
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,040
It's all because she has no shame.

145
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,000
That's why our family suffers this misfortune.

146
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,440
I was taken hostage.

147
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,039
Qin Yu tried to save me.

148
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,159
Enough!

149
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,440
If it weren't for Qin Yu,

150
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,919
that bandit wouldn't have dared touch you.

151
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,159
Gu Shuyin.

152
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,440
Do you have any sense of shame left?

153
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,000
We raised you to be reserved.

154
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,320
Not for you to disgrace yourself.

155
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,559
You sheltered and gave flowers to a lowly man.

156
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,919
Our Gu family can't afford that disgrace.

157
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,320
Qin Yu and I have never crossed any line.

158
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,799
Master.

159
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,960
Our daughter has always been obedient.

160
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,719
It must be that Qin Yu.

161
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,000
He approached her on purpose.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,719
That's why our daughter was led astray.

163
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,520
Blame Qin Yu for all this.

164
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,119
Don't be angry with your daughter.

165
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,000
So I was the one who harmed him.

166
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,760
I was the one who approached him.

167
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,039
It was me, clearly.

168
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,919
I'm the one who had feelings for him.

169
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,919
If you must punish someone, punish me.

170
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,039
Don't drag others into this.

171
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,719
Just a mere constable,

172
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,200
dares to covet

173
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:33,640
a lady from a noble family.

174
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,000
Even if you beat him to death,

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,320
he wouldn't be wronged.

176
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,039
And you.

177
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,000
Do you think

178
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,520
I don't dare punish you?

179
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,760
If the Yang family hadn't proposed already,

180
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,599
I would've drowned you for your shamelessness

181
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,599
in the pond long ago.

182
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,359
Father.

183
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,239
So you truly want Qin Yu dead.

184
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,640
All of you must remember

185
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,559
your own status.

186
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:07,799
This...

187
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,119
Father.

188
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,599
Mother.

189
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,640
If you let Qin Yu out of prison,

190
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,080
I will marry into the Yang family.

191
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,719
Support my husband and raise children.

192
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,599
Forget the past.

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,039
Otherwise,

194
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,080
forgive me for being unfilial.

195
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,200
Shuyin, you mustn't!

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,679
Master.

197
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,520
Say something, please!

198
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,599
This...

199
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,400
This is the good daughter you raised.

200
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,039
For a darn lowly man,

201
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,840
she threatens her parents with suicide.

202
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,400
Fine.

203
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,679
If you want to leave,

204
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,880
then go.

205
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,239
You're not worthy to be a Gu daughter.

206
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,640
Father won't care

207
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,280
about a mere daughter's life or death.

208
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,840
But...

209
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,679
What about the Yang family?

210
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,799
The Yang family wants to marry

211
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,679
Gu Manor's eldest daughter, Gu Shuyin.

212
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,919
If I die,

213
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,760
how will you explain it?

214
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,239
How will you reach the Yang family's status?

215
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,200
Fine.

216
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,119
Fine.

217
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:39,000
You're really something.

218
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,760
Father.

219
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,039
I only beg you to spare Qin Yu's life.

220
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,760
From now on,

221
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,400
I will never see him again.

222
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,880
I will only be your good daughter.

223
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,320
I will willingly

224
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,359
be your pawn to revive the family.

225
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:01,320
You brought shame upon yourself,

226
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,280
isn't that enough?

227
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,679
And you still dare

228
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,280
to threaten me?

229
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,440
Do you think the Yang family

230
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,960
really values you as a person?

231
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,599
It's only because you're a Gu.

232
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,239
Today,

233
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,520
I'll pick a girl from a side branch

234
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,719
who looks like you.

235
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,599
From now on,

236
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,799
she will be Gu Shuyin.

237
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:29,960
Master.

238
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,400
Shuyin is our own flesh and blood!

239
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,520
Shut up!

240
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,599
It doesn't matter who gave birth.

241
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,280
What matters is

242
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
she serves the family.

243
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,200
I feared

244
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,280
unexpected trouble.

245
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,679
So I lied to Madam,

246
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:51,359
saying I sent that wretch to Fenghe Village.

247
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,679
Locked her up.

248
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,200
I even forged her handwriting

249
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,559
to write letters to Madam.

250
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,479
That way,

251
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,679
fifteen years passed in peace.

252
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,640
Until recently,

253
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,880
I let her return home to visit family.

254
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,799
Unexpectedly,

255
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,440
she secretly went behind my back

256
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,239
and went to Fenghe Village.

257
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,599
Wait...

258
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,760
What do you mean, lied to her?

259
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,159
What did you do to Gu Shuyin?

260
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
In this world,

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,760
there can't be two Gu Shuyins.

262
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,679
She's your own flesh and blood.

263
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:36,039
Madam Gu went to Fenghe Village, found no one.

264
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,239
After asking around,

265
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,159
she learned you had killed Gu Shuyin.

266
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:43,039
She confronted you in anger at home.

267
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,000
Afraid of being exposed,

268
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,679
you killed her outright.

269
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
And silenced Nanny Wu as well.

270
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,200
Then blamed it all on ghosts and spirits.

271
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
She attacked me first.

272
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Give me back my daughter's life!

273
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,200
I'll fight you to the end!

274
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,000
Get out!

275
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,679
I'll fight you!

276
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,679
I'll strangle you!

277
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,679
Strangle you! Strangle you!

278
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,679
Our Gu family

279
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,440
cannot have

280
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:21,479
a legitimate daughter without shame.

281
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,599
nor a mad mistress.

282
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:27,440
nor a master who has killed.

283
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,919
Now,

284
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,559
there's no evidence left.

285
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,400
As long as you die,

286
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,159
in this world,

287
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,599
no one will care about this.

288
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,159
You really think you're being clever.

289
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,719
Yiru.

290
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,640
Killed two people in one go.

291
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,880
You weak old dog, you couldn't do it.

292
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,640
The accomplice has already confessed.

293
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,760
And you still claim there's no evidence.

294
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,359
Speak.

295
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,320
Where is Gu Shuyin's grave?

296
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,359
Someone so rebellious and unfilial,

297
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:14,119
I surely wouldn't bury her in the family tomb.

298
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,239
Just tossed her aside.

299
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,320
Mass grave.

300
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,559
Wild dogs have already eaten her remains.

301
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,960
The evidence is solid.

302
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,760
Arrest them.

303
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,679
Tell them

304
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,760
to sentence them harshly.

305
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,119
No plea will work.

306
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,760
Everything I've done

307
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,320
was for the Gu family.

308
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,559
I have no shame before my ancestors.

309
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,159
No shame before my ancestors.

310
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,760
Fine.

311
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,159
Then go down

312
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,440
and beg for their praise.

313
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,760
Honor the ancestors.

314
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,000
I thought Qin Yu, for Gu Shuyin,

315
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,359
had secretly protected Yang Kaizhi for years.

316
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,479
Even to death, he remembered her kindness.

317
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,799
That was already moving.

318
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,000
But unexpectedly,

319
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,479
Gu Shuyin, for him,

320
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,080
had also given up everything.

321
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,320
All these years,

322
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,440
if Qin Yu had met Gu Shuyin once,

323
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,200
it wouldn't have ended up

324
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,719
with someone else reaping the reward.

325
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,599
In his eyes,

326
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
Gu Shuyin was already married.

327
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,200
Someone like him

328
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,840
would never break the rules.

329
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,479
He’s already died once.

330
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
Why stick to the rules now?

331
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,760
This time,

332
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,840
we finally gathered two people's dreams,

333
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,520
but couldn't solve either.

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,479
It's such a pity.

335
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,280
That's normal.

336
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,520
If everything could be solved,

337
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,440
there’d be no regrets.

338
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,320
And no obsessions.

339
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,039
Luckily,

340
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,640
we've already collected six.

341
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,080
We're almost there.

342
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,559
And we did gain something this time.

343
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,400
Qin Yu was assassinated.

344
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,960
Maybe it was his enemy.

345
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,000
Or someone targeting Lan Hai Society.

346
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,559
We must find Shen Changfeng quickly.

347
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,200
If he’s assassinated too,

348
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
we’ll be in trouble.

349
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,640
The one who killed Qin Yu—

350
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,520
what do you think their goal was?

351
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,520
Could it be related to that mysterious man?

352
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,119
Not sure.

353
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:15,400
You chased after them that day and found nothing.

354
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,040
When I ran out,

355
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,599
there was no one left.

356
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,439
I slept for a long time.

357
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,800
Who doesn’t agree?

358
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,439
When you’re not around,

359
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,160
I really miss you.

360
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,000
How did this thing get here?

361
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,359
There really is a tomb passage inside.

362
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,400
What I’m looking for

363
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,959
must be in there.

364
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,359
We agreed

365
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,599
just to dig the grave.

366
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,079
Going into the tomb

367
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,839
costs extra.

368
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,599
This place is haunted.

369
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,800
This place really is haunted.

370
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,199
If you want to dig, do it yourself.

371
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,040
I’m not dying with you.

372
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,640
Go get yourself killed.

373
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,719
I—Darn it.

374
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,560
Found it.
