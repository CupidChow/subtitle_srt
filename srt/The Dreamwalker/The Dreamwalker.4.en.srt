1
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,600
Uncle

2
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,360
What happened here?

3
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,639
Whose children are you?

4
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,759
I'm Kangkang.

5
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,839
This is my younger brother, An'an.

6
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
We live in Yunshui County.

7
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,240
Please, help me.

8
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,520
Get up first.

9
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,520
I'll take you home.

10
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,440
Come, follow me.

11
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,440
Brother, we're finally home.

12
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,559
Don't worry, An'an.

13
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,399
No one will ever bully us again.

14
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,479
Mom, will Dad and you forget me?

15
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,320
Of course not.

16
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,520
Mom must have already made

17
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,839
your favorite osmanthus cake.

18
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,919
It's waiting for you at home.

19
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,839
Let's go.

20
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,519
This isn't real.

21
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,559
He's pretending.

22
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,760
He's just playing with us.

23
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,480
No.

24
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,839
He's just playing with us.

25
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,839
Can anyone save him?

26
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,239
He's not breathing.

27
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,200
What should we do?

28
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,839
What do we do?

29
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,399
He's not breathing.

30
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,160
What do we do?

31
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,679
Can anyone save him?

32
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,799
He's not breathing.

33
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,760
No breath.

34
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,799
An'an.

35
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,920
I'm sorry.

36
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,399
Well?

37
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,880
Did you see the dream clearly?

38
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,279
It felt so real.

39
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
The main character in the dream

40
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,640
is this boy, Akang?

41
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
What do you think Akang's wish is?

42
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,440
Akang and An'an

43
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,640
were both kidnapped by that strange man.

44
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,279
They probably died because of it.

45
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,239
But with such a vague dream,

46
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,440
how can we find anyone?

47
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,239
Let alone

48
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,480
fulfill his wish for him.

49
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,640
The Seven Stars Lamp only catches nearby dreams.

50
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,679
So the person can't be far from us.

51
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,799
Let's go to Yunshui County first.

52
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,119
Aqi said

53
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,160
we only capture the dreams of the dying.

54
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,559
They're the last obsessions of their lives.

55
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,359
What you need to do

56
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,679
is to help them

57
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,920
fulfill their wishes.

58
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,200
And collect that thing, what's it called?

59
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,239
Spirit Aura.

60
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:20,839
Right.

61
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,720
Spirit Aura.

62
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,440
If we need to collect it,

63
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,760
why not catch more dreams?

64
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,119
After all, these days

65
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,920
there are more dead than living.

66
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,320
It's not that easy.

67
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Everyone has wishes,

68
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,959
but only some become dreams

69
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,640
that we can capture.

70
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,760
They must be extremely strong.

71
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,119
That's true.

72
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,920
But even if we collect them,

73
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,119
we might not

74
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,399
be able to fulfill them.

75
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,160
Last time, Liu Chunru's dream

76
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,440
was so bizarre and supernatural.

77
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,359
And this time, Akang's

78
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,799
is just as unclear.

79
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,440
The dying

80
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,160
must have a confused mind.

81
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Their dreams

82
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,519
are bound to be unclear.

83
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:01,279
Sweet dreams,

84
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:02,239
nightmares,

85
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,959
strange and fantastic,

86
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,519
real and unreal,

87
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,640
we must unravel them

88
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,440
to learn what the dead

89
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,559
truly wished for

90
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,519
in reality.

91
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,239
We must solve the case first

92
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
before we can resolve their wish.

93
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,359
It's really not easy.

94
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,559
He Fuyi is a master at solving cases.

95
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,399
True,

96
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,519
but not so good at emotions.

97
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,359
By the way,

98
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,239
how was this dream

99
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,119
actually collected?

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,920
Don't ask about things you shouldn't.

101
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:32,839
Alright.

102
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,040
Looks like Young Master Wu follows He Fuyi

103
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,079
just for the Seven Stars Lamp.

104
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,640
So the master's order is

105
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,799
to keep watching He Fuyi and Young Master Wu.

106
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,760
If we really find the Seven Stars Lamp,

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,000
even if we destroy it,

108
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,480
we must never let the Empress Dowager get it.

109
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,880
Prince, please calm down.

110
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,200
Is this about An'an?

111
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,920
This is Jiangnan,

112
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
a land of wealth and riches,

113
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,519
a place of comfort and luxury.

114
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,079
You're just a minor county magistrate,

115
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,480
yet you live so well,

116
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,519
better than the governor of a poor region.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,799
You have plenty of people and money.

118
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,200
So many children have gone missing in half a year.

119
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,160
Do you want to lose your head?

120
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,160
Prince, please judge fairly.

121
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,920
I will definitely increase efforts.

122
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
I will increase efforts.

123
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,559
Now you're scared.

124
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,160
Get up quickly.

125
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:24,799
Continue.

126
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,359
Yes.

127
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,399
Prince.

128
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,000
The eunuch you mentioned,

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,119
I know

130
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,280
who he is.

131
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,359
He's called Blood Yan Luo.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Rumor has it

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,679
he's a ruthless killer,

134
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,000
a notorious villain.

135
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,919
The missing children case isn't solved yet,

136
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,960
and now Blood Yan Luo shows up.

137
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,400
In your jurisdiction,

138
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,799
strange things happen a lot.

139
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,719
Prince, I'm being wronged!

140
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,000
That man

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,599
died twenty years ago.

142
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Dead.

143
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,520
It was twenty years ago.

144
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,760
Are you sure we're talking about the same person?

145
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,880
I'm sure.

146
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,960
I have written records.

147
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,840
How did he die back then?

148
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,880
Back then, he...

149
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,599
His death, it was...

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,880
Really strange.

151
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,039
He just suddenly appeared

152
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,960
at that abandoned place in our county,

153
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,239
in front of the Asura Temple.

154
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,479
When he died,

155
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,440
even his heart was ripped out.

156
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,880
Speaking of which,

157
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,599
this temple

158
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
is also kind of eerie.

159
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,719
It used to worship

160
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,960
the Asura.

161
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,000
The locals say

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,840
it was the Asura

163
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,840
who killed Blood Yan Luo.

164
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,960
Everyone was terrified.

165
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,679
The previous county magistrate

166
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,440
to calm the panic,

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,919
held a special ritual there.

168
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,200
In the end,

169
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,919
they even buried Blood Yan Luo

170
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,599
in the Asura Temple.

171
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,320
And placed a Soul-suppressing Beast on top.

172
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
What does that strange thing mean?

173
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,200
Xuan Fish Spitting Swallow, a tomb beast.

174
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,359
It's common in Chu tombs.

175
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
Chu people love sorcery.

176
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,200
They use this creature

177
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,760
to ward off evil and suppress spirits.

178
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,559
This one looks pretty old.

179
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,960
Seems the magistrate wasn't lying.

180
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,559
Twenty years ago,

181
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,359
they buried Blood Yan Luo here

182
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,000
and used this beast to suppress him.

183
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,479
Why is this all so messy?

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,559
If Blood Yan Luo died twenty years ago,

185
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,080
then who is in Akang's dream?

186
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,119
What's the name of the latest missing child?

187
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,200
Duo Duo.

188
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:37,880
My Duo Duo was harmed by that Asura!

189
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,799
Please, don't cry yet.

190
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,320
If you want to save your son, tell us everything.

191
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,840
My son has always had health issues.

192
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,159
I heard there's someone in Yunshui County

193
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,559
who's good at treating children's illnesses.

194
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,640
So I brought him here to recover.

195
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,760
But unexpectedly,

196
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,559
the night we arrived,

197
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,640
there was a heavy storm.

198
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,799
We went into that

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,880
Asura Temple.

200
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:06,799
Dad, come in quickly!

201
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,280
Son!

202
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,000
Dad!

203
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,359
The guards are still behind us.

204
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,280
Everyone got separated.

205
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,159
What should we do?

206
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:18,919
It's fine.

207
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
We're almost there.

208
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:21,520
Let's wait here.

209
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,719
They'll catch up soon.

210
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,559
A ghost!

211
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,039
Ghost!

212
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,479
Duo Duo!

213
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,520
Come here, come here.

214
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:44,799
There's no ghost.

215
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,000
Master Qian!

216
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,799
Why are you in this evil temple?

217
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,159
There are ghosts inside!

218
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,359
Hurry, let's go!

219
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,719
Go, hurry!

220
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,840
Go, Duo Duo, hurry!

221
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,599
I never expected

222
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,799
that filthy thing would target my Duo Duo.

223
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:13,320
It even followed us home.

224
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,559
Alright.

225
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,440
Young master was probably

226
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,559
bewitched by something dirty.

227
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,440
Now the Spirit-Dispelling Bell is at the door.

228
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,599
Nothing dirty can get in.

229
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,640
Let the young master take my medicine.

230
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,200
He just needs to rest quietly.

231
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,599
Don't worry, it's nothing serious.

232
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,239
Thank you so much, Divine Doctor Cui.

233
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,320
Please wait a moment.

234
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,200
I'll go get your tea money now.

235
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,520
Master Qian!

236
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,440
Is that you?

237
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,039
Young Master Qian!

238
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,239
Young master! Young master!

239
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:57,119
Duo Duo!

240
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,400
Young master, where are you?

241
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,559
Young Master Qian!

242
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,080
Duo Duo!

243
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,359
Young master!

244
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,719
Young master!

245
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,599
Would you like some food?
