1
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,200
So, in that case,

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,520
Chu Yao really didn't die.

3
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
It was Zhang Guifen who saved her.

4
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,040
And then,

5
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,560
Chu Yao and Zhang Guifen disguised
themselves as ghosts to get revenge.

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,840
But Zhang Guifen died again
to save Chu Yao.

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,799
What about Chu Yao?

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,919
No, I can't...

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,520
I'm about to faint.

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,000
In all this,

11
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,439
there must be more to the story.

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,439
Only by finding Chu Yao
can we figure it out.

13
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,560
So where do we look?

14
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,360
There's someone who knows.

15
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:08,680
You all...

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,080
Why are you up?

17
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:12,199
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,239
Miss He,

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,199
what are you doing?

20
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,480
Chu Yao was shot.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,760
Trauma medicine won't help at all.

22
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,199
If she doesn't get proper treatment,

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,120
she might lose her arm.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,360
Is it Aman?

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,360
It's me.

26
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,319
The village chief and Hei Ye—

27
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,519
I did it all by myself.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,680
Aman didn't know.

29
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,319
I only found out later

30
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,400
that Chu Yao was buried alive by them.

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
At midnight,

32
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,479
I snuck over there alone.

33
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,639
I wanted to burn paper for Chu Yao.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,039
But I actually heard

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,080
sounds coming from underground.

36
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,119
Help!

37
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,160
Help!

38
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,080
Help!

39
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,399
Help!

40
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,199
Help!

41
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,320
Help!

42
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,440
Was it Chu Yao?

43
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,759
It wasn't hard to pry open the coffin.

44
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,399
There were

45
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,199
seven nails on the coffin.

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,639
Two of them were odd.

47
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,160
They didn't seem nailed in at all.

48
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:51,279
There were copper coins wedged upright.

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,080
The lid wasn't sealed, there was a gap.

50
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,800
That's how Chu Yao lasted
a few more hours.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,399
When I got her out,

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,600
I was in a rush, didn't think much.

53
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,240
But looking back now,

54
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,000
those oddities on the coffin

55
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,759
weren't a coincidence.

56
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,679
Definitely not.

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,520
You must have realized—

58
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,759
your mother left those for you.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,880
She wanted to secretly save you.

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,000
But your father found out.

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,240
He knocked her out and tied her up
for two days.

62
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,080
After that, she thought you were dead.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,520
No.

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
She knew I was alive all along.

65
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,479
The day I killed the village chief,

66
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,360
I planned to run away.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,919
But unexpectedly,

68
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,399
I ran into her.

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,080
I thought

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,119
killing the chief would be exposed.

71
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,919
But after two days,

72
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,320
Aman told me

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,119
the rumor was a vengeful ghost
did the killing.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,240
The day she saw you,

75
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,479
your mother knew you wanted revenge.

76
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,320
She was afraid you'd be discovered.

77
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:06,520
So she spread rumors about
a murderous ghost.

78
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,800
She even made

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,679
a dress just like your red ritual robe.

80
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,800
So that, if needed,

81
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,679
she could do things in your place.

82
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,759
Like with the village chief—

83
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,279
that day,

84
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,480
he probably wasn't dead yet.

85
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,079
Your mother finished him off for you.

86
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,119
And in the end, to help you escape,

87
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,880
she was killed by the Heifeng Cult leader.

88
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,399
Yaoyao...

89
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,440
Run!

90
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,799
But why?

91
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,440
For as long as I remember,

92
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,160
she always obeyed my father.

93
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,000
Even when I had a fever and needed a doctor,

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,640
she had to kneel and beg him
for three days.

95
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,480
She ignored my pleas

96
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,920
and became a puppet of the Heifeng Cult.

97
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,920
She watched coldly

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,119
as I was treated as a hated demon.

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,079
She even watched me get buried alive.

100
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,079
Now, after all this,

101
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,600
why?

102
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,959
Why did she do all that?

103
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,279
Because, like many others,

104
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,920
she was conditioned from birth.

105
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Enslaved and exploited.

106
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,839
Her environment doomed her
to be timid and ignorant,

107
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,000
even numb.

108
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,679
So your expectations of her

109
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,839
were too much for her.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,640
But even such a timid, ignorant,

111
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,000
even numb woman,

112
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,600
for her daughter,

113
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,600
for the first time in her life,

114
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,679
she defied her husband,
who was like a god to her,

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,440
and her faith, sacred as heaven.

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,559
I don't understand.

117
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,040
I truly don't understand.

118
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,679
Before she died, your mother
left two symbols.

119
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,040
They're here too.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,880
Do you recognize them?

121
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,000
This upward triangle

122
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
means "go."

123
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,760
It means "go."

124
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,839
Downward means "come back."

125
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,119
This circle

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
means

127
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,000
"eat."

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,320
This square means "sleep."

129
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,239
This one...

130
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,359
And this one?

131
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,279
It means "I miss you."

132
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,920
And this one?

133
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,799
This one...

134
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,839
means "I'm sorry."

135
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,760
This flower—

136
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,760
Why does it mean "I'm sorry"?

137
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,760
Because every time I did something wrong,

138
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,119
I'd pick a flower for my mother,

139
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,279
and she'd forgive me.

140
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,959
The ones my mother left—

141
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,920
which two symbols were they?

142
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,239
Yaoyao...

143
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,079
Mother misses you.

144
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,839
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,600
Mother.

146
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,279
Heifeng Cult followers and remnants

147
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,640
have all been sent to the county office.

148
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,640
The two of us plan to keep watch.

149
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,679
In case those fools let someone escape again.

150
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,079
I've been invited to travel to Tianjin.

151
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,559
So I can't go with you this time.

152
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,399
Even before I left,

153
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,679
I still hadn't received Zhang Guifen's
Spirit Aura.

154
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,000
That shouldn't be.

155
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,399
The symbols she left before dying

156
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,239
each represented

157
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,160
her longing and guilt for Chu Yao.

158
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,959
The hidden meaning

159
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,679
was simply wishing her peace, right?

160
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,399
Now that we've eliminated Heifeng Cult,

161
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,119
isn't she already safe?

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
Chu Yao's murder case hasn't been tried yet.

163
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,559
Though her actions are understandable,

164
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,880
she still broke Qing law.

165
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,840
Even with leniency,

166
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,679
there will be a price to pay.

167
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,400
Maybe for Zhang Guifen,

168
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
this isn't the peace she wished for.

169
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:50,359
Nothing is more complex than the human heart.

170
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,880
Especially the wishes of the dying.

171
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,599
How could we easily understand them?

172
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,359
Remember,

173
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,479
the External Elixir is only a support.

174
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,679
Normally,

175
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,799
you must cultivate your Internal Elixir.

176
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,799
Six stars of the Big Dipper in the Lamp
are lit.

177
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,000
No matter what,

178
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:11,799
the last one will light up soon.

179
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,440
We must be patient.

180
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,440
I understand, Master.

181
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,880
Be careful on your journey.

182
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,559
The world is growing more chaotic.

183
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,559
Corpses of the starved line the roads.

184
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:24,880
The dead are everywhere.

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,239
Collecting Spirit Aura is important,

186
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,200
but you must stay cautious.

187
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,000
Like this time—

188
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,520
if I hadn't been here,

189
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,280
Prince might've been fatally poisoned.

190
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
Don't worry.

191
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,039
On this journey,

192
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,080
Miss He and Aqi were lucky
Prince helped.

193
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,559
But there's one more thing
I'd like to ask.

194
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:49,760
Sure.

195
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
I heard from Miss He

196
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,760
that Prince has clues about those

197
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,799
who massacred Zhenhuan Biaoju
ten years ago.

198
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,479
Back then, they were hunting

199
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,200
the Imperial Guard protecting
the Seven Stars Lamp.

200
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,679
That's how they found Zhenhuan Biaoju.

201
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,760
Though the Seven Stars Lamp is a treasure,

202
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,039
in this world,

203
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,400
who dares to steal from the Empress Dowager?

204
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:12,960
Besides,

205
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:16,359
when Miss He vanished with the Lamp,

206
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,760
they stopped searching for it.

207
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,200
So it seems

208
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,960
their goal wasn't the treasure.

209
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,719
They just didn't want the Empress Dowager
to succeed.

210
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,400
That's right.

211
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,719
We guessed the same before.

212
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,719
Many want to harm the Empress Dowager.

213
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,840
But ten years ago,

214
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,359
only the Lan Hai Society

215
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,679
were truly mad.

216
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,280
Prince himself

217
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,840
is even more decisive than he appears.

218
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,679
He acts swiftly and firmly.

219
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,880
But that's not what I want to ask.

220
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,919
You've seen it too—

221
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,840
Miss He is naturally indifferent.

222
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,599
She doesn't understand emotions well.

223
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,080
So she might not realize

224
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:04,960
Prince has

225
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,919
special feelings for her.

226
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,679
Keep your voice down.

227
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,679
You—

228
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,320
You haven't told her, right?

229
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,320
You've only known her a few days.

230
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,919
Plus, the Seven Stars Lamp
complicates things.

231
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,919
Now you act this way—

232
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,840
do you think I'd believe

233
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,479
you have no other motives?

234
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:28,880
Indeed.

235
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,960
This isn't my first time

236
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,400
meeting Miss He.

237
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,679
There—

238
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,880
The person in the dream
was really him.

239
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,000
That's right.

240
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,679
This is the first Seven Stars dream
you've caught.

241
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,200
If you solve the dream,

242
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,919
fulfill his final wish,

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,599
you'll collect the Spirit Aura.

244
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,280
But what should we do?

245
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,520
Still haven't figured it out?

246
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,239
He's almost dead.

247
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,280
Forget it, I can't think of anything.

248
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,119
Miss He.

249
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:16,679
You and I are now
closely connected.

250
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,159
Your blood is precious.

251
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,479
He still has a breath left.

252
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,960
My blood can keep him alive
for a while.

253
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,119
Prince.

254
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,359
Prince, where are you?

255
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:38,320
Aqi, someone's here.

256
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,080
He Fu Yi from Zhenhuan Biaoju.

257
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,320
Entrusted by another,

258
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,039
here to collect Liu Chunru's body.

259
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,200
He Fu Yi.
