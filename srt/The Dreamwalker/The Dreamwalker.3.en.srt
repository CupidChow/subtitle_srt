1
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,840
Winter, 24th year of Guangxu

2
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,680
Seventeen at Jingyang Girls' School
hanged themselves to show resolve

3
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,119
This is not suppression

4
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,680
It is martyrdom

5
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,760
This time

6
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,080
We made Liu Chunru come to us herself

7
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,959
If I follow your logic

8
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:47,160
there's another group faking ghosts

9
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,720
just to bury Liu Chunru's body

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,879
Exactly

11
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,599
So who are they?

12
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:57,879
Come out

13
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,919
It's you

14
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,320
Last night, you were on the city tower

15
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,919
and took Liu Chunru's head

16
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,679
You two

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,600
So the smoke was your doing

18
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,000
You said someone asked you

19
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,320
to bury Liu Chunru's body

20
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,880
Who entrusted you?

21
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,199
Liu Chunru herself

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,199
Her last wish before death

23
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,800
was to be properly buried

24
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,759
And what about you two?

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, that

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,199
That's Lin Ruizhi

27
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,440
the magistrate's concubine

28
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,960
The one beside her?

29
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,240
Should be her accomplice

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,960
The ghost of Liu Chunru

31
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,399
was likely her disguise

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,679
These two women are truly bold

33
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,440
First at the mortuary

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,000
they stole Liu Chunru's body

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Liu Chunru

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,639
Then at the magistrate's and the school

37
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,679
they pretended to be ghosts

38
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,440
Master

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,880
No one outside

40
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,960
When did you find out?

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,279
First

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,600
And you?

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,600
You worked at Jingyang Girls' School

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,160
likely crossed paths with Liu Chunru

45
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,479
Second

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,679
You told us a story

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
about a vengeful ghost seeking her head

48
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,800
But in your room

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
there were no signs of struggle

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,119
and the magistrate was only drugged

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,440
That alone is suspicious

52
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,679
Until later

53
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,600
we discovered

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,600
you and the mortuary elder

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,520
share the same eye disease

56
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,399
What's on your left cuff?

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,800
Ink stains

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,919
You just said

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,839
what kind of lock?

60
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:34,800
Black lock

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,080
Once questioned

62
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,399
we found you're father and daughter

63
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,039
Then everything made sense

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,759
My father knew nothing

65
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,440
I secretly made a key

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,360
and snuck in

67
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
We staged a scene to fool him

68
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,360
and stole the body

69
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,279
Don't blame him

70
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,559
So you went through all this

71
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,800
just to bury Liu Chunru

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,440
Now the authorities search the city

73
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,839
for anyone linked to rebels

74
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,479
Even Liu Chunru's family

75
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,520
avoid her at all costs

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,080
afraid to be associated

77
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,399
But you two

78
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,880
dare to claim her body

79
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,240
Aren't you afraid of losing your heads?

80
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,880
As sworn sisters

81
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:09,880
how could we

82
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,440
stand by and watch her body

83
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,479
left exposed in the wild

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,119
Such a vast world

85
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,359
can't even hold a woman's desk

86
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,959
The principal and teachers

87
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,799
resisted the closure in this way

88
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,440
Such good people

89
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,880
shouldn't end like this

90
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,519
They use blood and fire

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,600
to warn us

92
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,239
This world

93
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,320
shouldn't be like this

94
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,880
Lianfang

95
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,279
Ruizhi

96
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,160
I came this time

97
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
to say goodbye to you both

98
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm preparing to leave here

99
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,839
to seek a true path to save our country

100
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,640
Lianfang

101
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,160
Ruizhi

102
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,679
Hope this letter finds you well

103
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,959
I've enrolled in school

104
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,920
and joined several hometown associations

105
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,920
There are many new ideas here

106
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,000
I've met many insightful people

107
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,320
Life is fulfilling

108
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,480
I work hard every day

109
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,679
never daring to slack off

110
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,799
Chunru

111
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,640
Reading your words feels like seeing you

112
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,200
The court and country are in turmoil

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,480
Life is even harder for common folk

114
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,600
It's been months since we parted

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,480
Now I hear you're well

116
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:27,880
and I am relieved

117
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,000
But I fear I won't be able

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,359
to write to you freely anymore

119
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,239
Ruizhi became the magistrate's concubine

120
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,000
Because my family

121
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,559
promised me as a concubine

122
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,040
I resisted

123
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,799
but they didn't care

124
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,000
Feudalism

125
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,720
is rotten and backward

126
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,519
I've decided

127
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,079
to join the revolution

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,760
The road ahead is hard

129
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,679
but it's the path of hope

130
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,160
I'll return home in February

131
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,239
then

132
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
I'll meet you both as soon as I arrive

133
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,040
Wishing you peace

134
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,720
Rebel Liu Chunru

135
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:05,119
You seek to overthrow the Qing dynasty

136
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:05,720
Kneel

137
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,920
Your crime is unforgivable

138
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,959
By order of the Empress Dowager

139
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,559
You are sentenced to beheading and public display

140
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,799
Execution date to be set

141
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,239
No one

142
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,600
may claim your body

143
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,399
Throw my head

144
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,399
to shake the land

145
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:19,559
No regrets

146
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:20,880
Take her away

147
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,600
There's something I need to ask.

148
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,600
I want to ask my dearest friends.

149
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,519
Right now,

150
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,079
I've cut ties with my whole family.

151
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,480
If I die,

152
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,079
my body may be left in the wild.

153
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,040
So,

154
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,679
you must stay alive, no matter what.

155
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,279
When the time comes,

156
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,559
please bury me.

157
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:50,959
Chunru,

158
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,040
I won't let you say such unlucky things.

159
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,640
Alright, alright, I won't say it.

160
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,640
It's a promise.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,239
If anything happens to you, Liu Chunru,

162
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,279
even if it's through hell and high water,

163
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,760
we'll come to bury you.

164
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:12,720
Beheading and public display.

165
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,600
No one is allowed to bury the body.

166
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,839
It's a punishment meant to warn and deter.

167
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,040
That's why it's so cruel.

168
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,079
Actually, this punishment

169
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
was abolished years ago.

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,839
I guess

171
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,519
when Liu Chunru made that promise with you two,

172
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,760
she was thinking about this.

173
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,880
She just didn't expect

174
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,079
the Empress Dowager, because of the revolutionaries,

175
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,720
would be so furious about what they did.

176
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,640
She personally issued the decree

177
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,679
for her beheading.

178
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,600
She probably didn't want

179
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,440
you two to get dragged into danger.

180
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,279
She sacrificed herself for her ideals.

181
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,119
How can we just watch her body

182
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,839
be humiliated like this?

183
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,040
But with just the two of you,

184
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,160
going against the Forbidden City for her head,

185
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,200
it's just not realistic.

186
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,679
Mountains may fall and seas may dry,

187
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,079
but a promise remains.

188
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,079
Wait, that's not right.

189
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
I've already buried Liu Chunru's body.

190
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,559
Why didn't any spirit aura appear?

191
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,399
Even though

192
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,079
you said Chunru asked you

193
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,279
to bury her,

194
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,239
we still want to thank you.

195
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,159
As for payment,

196
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,640
letting her rest in peace,

197
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,919
fulfilling her last wish,

198
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,679
is all the reward I need.

199
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,919
Actually, Liu Chunru's final wish

200
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,679
wasn't just to be buried by someone.

201
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,679
Liu Chunru thought

202
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,880
if someone buried her,

203
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,280
you two wouldn't have to risk your lives.

204
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,039
So,

205
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,440
this revolutionary who died with lofty ideals,

206
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,119
her final wish

207
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,679
was just for you two to be safe.

208
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,359
Hurry!

209
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,320
Offer incense to her yourselves.

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
Spirit aura.

211
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,919
It's Liu Chunru's spirit aura.

212
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,479
Her wish is truly fulfilled.

213
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,039
He Fuyi, let me out now!

214
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,080
Go on.

215
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
You're no use to me now.

216
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,239
Don't follow us.

217
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,520
He Escort Chief,

218
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,280
look,

219
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,960
I helped you find Liu Chunru.

220
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,280
Just treat me as a delivery.

221
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,599
Send me back to the capital.

222
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,719
I'm not taking this job.

223
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,080
Come on!

224
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,599
Look,

225
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,719
burying Liu Chunru

226
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
the authorities won't just let it go.

227
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:17,760
But actually,

228
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,080
the Old Buddha really likes me.

229
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,320
Once I finish this job,

230
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,559
I'll put in a good word for you.

231
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,599
I guarantee

232
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,159
you'll get through this.

233
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,000
How about it?

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,679
He Escort Chief,

235
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,799
I like him.

236
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,080
He can enter dreams.

237
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,359
His scent is so familiar.

238
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,559
And he's so smart.

239
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,840
Let's take his job.

240
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,359
We can earn money,

241
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,479
and along the way,

242
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,880
he can help us collect

243
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,520
lots of spirit aura.

244
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,599
It's been so long since we gathered

245
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,239
this much spirit aura.

246
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:56,640
I feel so strong now.

247
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,280
How about you?

248
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,880
I feel much better too.

249
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:03,799
Why aren't you convinced?

250
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,080
Not convinced.

251
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,039
He found Liu Chunru's true wish before you.

252
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,919
Different paths, same destination.

253
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,799
It all means the same thing.

254
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,679
You think I meddled too much.

255
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,840
How did you figure out

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,640
Liu Chunru's true wish?

257
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,679
I want to know

258
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,799
how you were so sure from the start

259
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,159
her wish was to be buried by someone.

260
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,799
Liu Chunru said it herself.

261
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,000
She hoped someone would bury her.

262
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,679
After hearing Lin Ruizhi

263
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,280
and Xu Lianfang's story,

264
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,960
it's the same.

265
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,559
She asked them to bury her too.

266
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,159
Let me ask you again,

267
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,919
Xu Lianfang and Lin Ruizhi,

268
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,280
two women with so many burdens,

269
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,239
why would they risk their lives

270
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,320
just to bury Liu Chunru?

271
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Because

272
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,799
they promised Liu Chunru.

273
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,440
He Escort Chief,

274
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,960
you really

275
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,359
are something.

276
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,200
So,

277
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,320
what do you think my action just now

278
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,200
meant?

279
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,719
You wanted to provoke me.

280
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,440
I finally get it.

281
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,400
He Escort Chief,

282
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,400
you seem naturally indifferent.

283
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,119
You can't feel emotions like normal people.

284
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,440
That's right.

285
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,000
He Fuyi is like a big rock,

286
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,400
so stiff,

287
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,080
so cold,

288
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,159
and kind of clueless.

289
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,479
Come out.

290
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:15,359
Greetings, Prince.

291
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:16,359
Prince.

292
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,280
You were startled.

293
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Go back and tell Yiru.

294
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,039
I'm running errands for the Old Buddha.

295
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:21,280
You follow me.

296
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,840
But don't act rashly.

297
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,280
Yes.

298
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,760
Want something to eat?
