1
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,959
Dad

2
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,000
She's crawling over here

3
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,279
Xiaoman

4
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:14,839
Xiaoman

5
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,279
Dear

6
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,440
Is that you

7
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,040
You're back

8
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,080
Dear

9
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,839
D-don't scare me

10
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,000
It was just a dream

11
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,559
Scared me to death

12
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:02,959
Xiaoman

13
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,440
Husband

14
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,240
Help me

15
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,119
Dear

16
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
Is that you

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,679
Dong Dachang

18
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,600
I-I didn't mean to

19
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,639
I'll burn paper for you

20
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,440
I'll burn it for you

21
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,119
Spare me

22
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:27,639
Let me go

23
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,160
Let go

24
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,160
Dong Dachang

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,240
I didn't mean to

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,440
I'll burn money, give you money

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,919
Please let me go

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,919
Dong Dachang

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Let me go

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,479
I didn't mean to

31
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,240
I didn't mean it

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,679
Please let me go

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,440
Such a strong opium smell

34
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,559
Dong Dachang

35
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,000
He must be hallucinating

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,479
Let me go, let me go

37
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,240
I'll burn paper, I'll burn money for you

38
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,320
Ghost!

39
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,320
Who are you

40
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,160
Xiaoman

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Xiulan

42
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:09,639
Stop howling

43
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,559
There's no one here but you

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,679
What's going on

45
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:14,839
Could it be

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,440
Dong Dachang

47
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,600
Dong Dachang

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,440
Did you kill Dong Dachang

49
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,679
Why

50
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:24,919
You all

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,800
It's not my business

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,240
I didn't do anything

53
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,600
It's not my fault

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,240
We're from the authorities

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,919
Dong Dachang's body

56
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,800
is at the yamen right now

57
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,160
His wages from yesterday are with you

58
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,960
And you just admitted killing Dong Dachang

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,880
No use arguing

60
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,320
What exactly happened

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,039
Speak quickly

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,240
Don't make me use force

63
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,199
I slipped up

64
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:54,800
It's all him

65
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,399
If he hadn't meddled

66
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,720
I wouldn't have ended up like this

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,240
Someone's stealing

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,000
Stop

69
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,880
Stop

70
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:12,600
It's you

71
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,919
Zhang Shuisheng

72
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,320
How could you steal

73
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,279
I-I

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,720
Brother Dong

75
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,359
I won't dare next time

76
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,480
Brother Dong

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,600
Please have mercy

78
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,559
Let me go

79
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,399
Otherwise

80
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,440
Xiulan

81
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,600
My son Xiaoman won't survive

82
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,440
Brother Dong

83
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,480
You had a daughter too

84
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,480
It's hard enough for poor folks like us

85
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,799
We can't lose a father too

86
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,000
Brother Dong, Brother Dong

87
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,040
Just this once

88
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,320
Next time with someone else

89
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
You won't be so lucky

90
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,320
Get lost

91
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,839
Where's the thief

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Sir

93
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,519
Thanks to you

94
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,519
Kind soul

95
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,559
So it was you

96
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,480
This is Dachang from the East Cloth Shop

97
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,320
He once saved a drowning child

98
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,559
That was my nephew

99
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,399
I remember that

100
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,200
I remember

101
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,720
Heard you were always kind

102
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,640
Always doing good deeds

103
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,760
Just because he caught you robbing

104
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,040
He didn't turn you in

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,279
He was kind enough

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,959
Yet you still killed him

107
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,279
Kind enough

108
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,880
He used that against me

109
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,880
Always watching me

110
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,079
What's it to him how my family is

111
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,440
What's it got to do with him

112
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,399
He can't get enough of being good

113
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,959
There are plenty he could help

114
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,399
Why focus on me

115
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,160
He had bad intentions

116
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,559
He had bad intentions

117
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,399
Shuisheng

118
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,640
What did you promise me

119
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,320
What about Xiaoman and Xiulan

120
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,320
Quit pretending

121
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,160
You think I don't know

122
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,959
You used to be a gambler too

123
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,519
You

124
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:55,920
Lost all your money

125
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,480
Let your sick child die

126
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:58,799
Your wife left too

127
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,279
And you still meddle in my life

128
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,519
Stop right there

129
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,200
If you go in again

130
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
I'll tell Xiulan

131
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,040
Get out of my way

132
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,839
Don't block my comeback

133
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,320
If you don't pay in three days

134
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,760
You'll lose your life

135
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,600
Get lost

136
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,799
Dong Dachang

137
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,720
You like snitching, huh

138
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,160
Fine

139
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,160
Since you love being a good guy

140
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,399
I'll help you out then

141
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,679
If he hadn't snitched

142
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:07,079
I'd have won it all back

143
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,880
All on six

144
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,920
All on six

145
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,679
Why are you gambling again

146
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,559
-The kids can't eat  -Just this round

147
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,200
Stop gambling.

148
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Everyone, stop gambling.

149
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,959
That day at the pai gow table,

150
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,200
it was clearly a Supreme Pair.

151
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,959
My wife suddenly barged in.

152
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,279
She pleaded like she was mourning.

153
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,720
She brought all the bad luck.

154
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,000
That thirty taels of gambling debt—

155
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,679
he deserved to pay it back.

156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,559
I—I know.

157
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,320
Dong Dachang, these past years,

158
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,160
saved up quite a bit of money.

159
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,519
I wanted to rob him.

160
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,799
I waited outside.

161
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,519
But the cold wind sobered me up.

162
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,799
I was about to leave.

163
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,880
But...

164
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,040
he came out right then.

165
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,519
That day,

166
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,760
it was already late.

167
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,760
No one was on the road.

168
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,839
I’ll earn merit for you.

169
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,440
Send you to enter Nirvana early.

170
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,679
Let go.

171
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,080
Let go.

172
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,320
You beast.

173
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,640
I could kill you right now.

174
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,400
Dong Dachang forced me into this.

175
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,679
Where did you go after killing yesterday?

176
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,159
Did you see Xiulan?

177
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,280
When did Xiaoman go missing?

178
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,320
That day,

179
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,080
I stole the money,

180
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:05,719
bought some things,

181
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,799
then went home.

182
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,200
Xiulan wasn’t home.

183
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,640
Xiaoman was home.

184
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Xiaoman was always at home.

185
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,960
Xiao... Xiaoman.

186
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,599
Just now, Xiaoman—

187
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,799
was just sitting there.

188
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,239
But...

189
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Suddenly, the portrait came alive.

190
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,880
Dong Dachang’s ghost appeared.

191
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,599
Dong Dachang’s ghost appeared.

192
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,719
That’s an opium hallucination.

193
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,919
Are you sure Xiaoman was always home?

194
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,359
Xiaoman.

195
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,000
Xiaoman was home.

196
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,679
Xiaoman was always home.

197
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,880
Xiulan wasn’t there.

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,679
Xiulan.

199
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,880
She didn’t come home all night.

200
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,559
Guards!

201
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,440
Take him to the yamen first.

202
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,679
Let’s go check Dong Dachang’s body.

203
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,799
Prince.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,799
The body—

205
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
there’s a problem.

206
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,520
What exactly happened?

207
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,960
Prince, please calm your anger.

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,119
We found the body not far from the corner.

209
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,239
We discovered this corpse.

210
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,320
He probably crawled there himself.

211
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,719
But he died soon after.

212
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:17,400
We found this bundle beside the body.

213
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,760
I hurried to report to you, Prince.

214
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,039
So I didn’t look closely.

215
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,320
I ran to find you.

216
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,559
Let go of me! Let go!

217
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,119
Zhang Shuisheng, look carefully.

218
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Is this Dong Dachang whom you killed yesterday?

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,760
Are you sure?

220
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,080
I saw Dong Dachang with my own eyes,

221
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:47,440
wearing this raincoat.

222
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:48,840
In the bag, there’s also—

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,640
his Longevity Amulet he always wore.

224
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,440
I couldn’t be mistaken.

225
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,719
What about his build?

226
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,880
Don’t you think he’s much thinner now?

227
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
Wearing these clothes—

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,880
and it was pouring rain.

229
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,799
Couldn’t see clearly.

230
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,080
But...

231
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,239
Isn’t this Dong Dachang?

232
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,799
I followed him all the way here.

233
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,320
Saw him enter the dye house.

234
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,119
See for yourself.

235
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,280
See who you killed.

236
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,440
Xiulan.

237
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,320
What’s going on?

238
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,119
Why is it you?

239
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,960
Did you know Xiulan is pregnant with your child?

240
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,880
If not for the unborn child,

241
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,000
she wouldn’t have to endure you.

242
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,840
Impossible. Impossible.

243
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,640
What is happening?

244
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,159
Xiulan, tell me.

245
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,159
Tell me.

246
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,719
Tell me.

247
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,679
Tell me.

248
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,799
Xiulan.

249
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,840
Where is Xiaoman?

250
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,239
He even killed the wrong person.

251
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,280
He probably really doesn’t know where Xiaoman is.

252
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:24,119
Xiulan’s obsession must be tied to Xiaoman’s illness.

253
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,320
If we delay, we won’t be able to solve it.

254
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,200
The dream we finally captured—

255
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,760
will be wasted just like that.
