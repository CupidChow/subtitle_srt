1
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,000
Enlightening the masses,

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,375
unhindered in his deeds

3
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,541
Homage to the holy sages

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:20,166
Homage to the
Western Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,583
This represents
the immeasurable virtues of the Pure Land

6
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:31,041
Homage to Amitabha Buddha,
whose very name embodies his being

7
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,666
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,291
Amitabha Buddha.

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,833
Come in and have a seat.

10
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:44,750
No, thanks.

11
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,000
I can't really stay.

12
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,083
FUNERAL OFFERING

13
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,166
My condolences.

14
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,291
It must be hard.

15
00:00:58,708 --> 00:00:59,666
Where's An Chi?

16
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,041
Something came up at school.
She couldn't make it.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,916
She won't even see Hsin-yi off?

18
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,291
I'm here on her behalf, right?

19
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,833
Sorry. I have a prenatal check-up.

20
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,000
I have to go.

21
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,541
What are you doing here?

22
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,541
This is the document
you asked me to sign.

23
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,666
You could've sent it.
No need to come yourself.

24
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,708
Thank you.

25
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,958
Won't you invite me up?

26
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,541
I just came back to grab something.

27
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,166
Is An Chi home?

28
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,583
Is that why you came here?

29
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,458
I really don't understand
what you want with her.

30
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,208
She told the police everything.
You saw that.

31
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,250
But her statement didn't explain
why Hsin-yi was tortured to death

32
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,416
or why Jin Jin is in a coma.

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,916
Because she doesn't know.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,416
They lived in the same complex
for half a year.

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,125
Surely she knows something?

36
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,375
Any detail
could be related to Hsin-yi's death.

37
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,291
Actually, An Chi's gone to the US.

38
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,833
She's had a hard time emotionally.

39
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,083
I sent her to get help.

40
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,625
Her dad's gone with her.

41
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,791
When was this?

42
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,000
Last week.

43
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,875
Huang I-chen.

44
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,583
What are you hiding from me?

45
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,000
What have I got to hide?

46
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,208
I honestly don't understand.

47
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,083
Can't you just leave An Chi alone?

48
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,458
Let her be.
She was a victim just like Hsin-yi.

49
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,041
Leave her alone.

50
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,041
05 INVESTIGATION NIGHT

51
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,791
This is a real-life case.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,250
An assailant indiscriminately attacked

53
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,208
passengers on the MRT.

54
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,708
The assailant was a young man
weighing less than 60 kg.

55
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,666
And there were over 70 passengers
in the two carriages at the time.

56
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,916
But not one of them tried to stop him.

57
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,833
This is a photo of the crime scene.

58
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,333
I'd like to pose a question.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,958
Imagine this.

60
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,458
If you were in this carriage that day,

61
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,833
would you have tried
to subdue the assailant?

62
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,500
Or, at a time like that,

63
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,041
would it be wiser to keep your distance

64
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,791
and protect yourself?

65
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,708
Either way,
if that was me before I turned 17,

66
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,625
I would have chosen the latter.

67
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,333
But when I was 17,

68
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,916
my life

69
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,166
took a drastic turn.

70
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,625
I was kidnapped.

71
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,375
As a victim and survivor
of a major telecom scam in Southeast Asia,

72
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,125
I realized one thing.

73
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,458
Silence and obedience
only encourage evil.

74
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,041
So we started resisting,

75
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:30,958
trying to escape

76
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,083
and contact the outside world.

77
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,000
Even though we kept failing,
and were repeatedly punished

78
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,166
and beaten after we were caught…

79
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,125
Even though in the end,

80
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,125
my best friend

81
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,291
lost her life...

82
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,291
...this seemingly unwise choice

83
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,250
actually formed an invisible force.

84
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,916
It was this force
that kept me motivated,

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,291
giving me the opportunities and courage

86
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,041
to seek help during a visit to the bank.

87
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,583
Although it was a small move,

88
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,541
it gave the police a clue
and an opportunity

89
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,000
that led
to the destruction of the notorious

90
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,875
Southeast Asian crime syndicate.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,083
Because of that,
I am able to stand here

92
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,958
and talk about my topic today,

93
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,791
"Be Brave or Be Wise".

94
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,458
Being wise isn't wrong.

95
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,000
It's just that this world
needs more brave people.

96
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:34,916
Thank you.

97
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,666
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PROMOTION

98
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,666
WELL DONE AN CHI
FOR GETTING INTO YALE LAW SCHOOL

99
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:07,916
Congratulations.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,666
You finally won the case.
He got the death penalty.

101
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,333
Hardly something to celebrate.

102
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,500
Where's Ms Huang?

103
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,333
She got promoted and moved offices.

104
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,916
An Chi's such a talent.

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,708
-Thanks.
-I mean, Yale Law School.

106
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,875
I know.

107
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,458
-Apologies. Sorry I'm late.
-It's okay.

108
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,416
-Where's I-chen?
-She changed offices.

109
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,916
Your clients are here.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,416
-I'd better get to work. Thank you.
-Okay.

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,708
This way, please.

112
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,458
In my office.

113
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,166
THREE MOTHERS' BATTLE

114
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,958
We won the case, right?

115
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,291
They want to publish our autobiographies.

116
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,625
Don't worry, they'll find ghostwriters.

117
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,958
Write what, exactly?

118
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,750
Write what happened,
your experiences and the like.

119
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,833
Wasn't that already covered in the news?

120
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:16,958
Yes.

121
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,500
But there are lots of details
people don't know.

122
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,500
Like what?

123
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,125
For example,

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,583
how An Chi alerted the police.

125
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,500
And Jin Jin.

126
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,833
The syndicate
was using her travel vlog as a tool.

127
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,625
And how Hsin-yi brought up her late dad

128
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,208
to alert you.
I think these details are important.

129
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,791
That's all private, no?

130
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,666
Sure it is.

131
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,375
But without these exclusive details,

132
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,000
no one would buy the book.

133
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,291
Sounds like exploiting our own children.

134
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,791
My daughter was a victim too.

135
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,750
If I saw it as exploitation,

136
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,083
would I have agreed?

137
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,791
Hui-chun. You know me.

138
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,333
You livestream daily
to raise money for Jin Jin.

139
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,958
Is that exploiting her?

140
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,750
That's different, okay?

141
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,791
Look, I'm not doing this for myself.

142
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,125
If we can publish this book,

143
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,833
it will be of value to society

144
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,791
and the royalties
will help ease your financial burdens.

145
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,666
I promise I'll vet the content.

146
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,458
Just give me an hour-long interview.

147
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,666
Can I have an hour with An Chi?

148
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,875
She's going to Yale.

149
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,708
How bad can her mental state be?

150
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,291
I remember she used to be into music.

151
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,791
When did law become a thing?

152
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,500
What are you two implying?

153
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,750
After such a terrifying experience,

154
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,708
it's normal that she would change.

155
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,083
Was it her choice, or did you force her?

156
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,375
Aren't you happy for her?

157
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,125
She suffered so much
and still managed to alert the police.

158
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,875
Can you imagine
how much pressure she was under?

159
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,083
Of course.
So why are you pressuring her--

160
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,875
How am I pressuring her?

161
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,583
Come on. We're all happy
she got into college, okay?

162
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,708
But we'll need time to think about

163
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,333
publishing this book.

164
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,416
Forget it.

165
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,583
Take your time.

166
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,333
It's not me that needs the money.

167
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,541
I want the best for you.

168
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,500
If that's really what you want,

169
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,000
then spend more time on the civil damages

170
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,666
rather than this nonsense.

171
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,125
She kept An Chi
hidden away from everything before,

172
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,833
saying she didn't want
her daughter to have to relive it all.

173
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,625
Now the case is over,

174
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,583
she lets her go on TV every day
and play the victim.

175
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,583
Why isn't she worried about her now?

176
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,541
Today's the last day of
the Youth Elite Forum.

177
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,000
Another round of applause
for everyone on stage.

178
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,916
Hello, could we interview you?

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,125
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,791
Congratulations.

181
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:39,916
Ms. Wang.

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,291
Thank you.

183
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,916
Can I treat you to dinner?

184
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,166
Ms. Wang, I have work to do.

185
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,958
Let's have a chat then.

186
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,458
Over there. Come on.

187
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,958
I haven't seen you for a long time.

188
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,500
You got into such a good college.

189
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,541
You must have studied really hard.

190
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,750
It wasn't so bad.

191
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,000
Nowadays, famous US schools

192
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,416
want unique and versatile students.

193
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,833
Like getting into law school,

194
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,541
I just had to show
what sets me apart from others.

195
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,875
And what sets you apart?

196
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,041
That's not what I meant.

197
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,250
I've always thought you were exceptional.

198
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,125
Jin Jin always spoke highly of you.

199
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,750
I found this.

200
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,250
Since you're going to the US,

201
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,208
think of it as a memento.

202
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,375
Actually, I came today
to congratulate you on Jin Jin's behalf.

203
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,791
She always said you were her best friend.

204
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,250
One day, she bought

205
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,916
a bunch of sunflowers home.

206
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,583
I thought they were for me.

207
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,250
But she said, "No.

208
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,000
Tomorrow is An Chi's birthday,
they're for her."

209
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,833
I was a little disappointed.

210
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,708
You got into such a good school.

211
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,125
You're going to have a brilliant future.

212
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,625
Both Jin Jin and Hsin-yi

213
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,500
would be so happy for you.

214
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,583
If Jin Jin and Hsin-yi were still alive,

215
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,166
I know they'd be
pursuing their own dreams too.

216
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,791
Jin Jin is still alive.

217
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,041
Or do you think she's as good as dead?

218
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,250
Ms. Wang, I didn't mean that.

219
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,541
I know you didn't mean that.

220
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,791
Ms. Wang, the lights are out. Let's go.

221
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,125
I keep forgetting to say

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,208
thank you.

223
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,541
Jin Jin only made it back alive,

224
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,958
because of your bravery in
alerting the police.

225
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:14,625
An Chi.

226
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,250
You forgot this.

227
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,541
Ms. Wang, thanks for the flowers,

228
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,875
but you should keep Jin Jin's things.

229
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,375
ONE MOTHER'S BATTLE

230
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,208
Eat.

231
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,041
If you don't eat, you'll starve.

232
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,875
Do you want me to get out of this alive?

233
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,625
Die and you'll never see your daughter.

234
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,958
You didn't know?

235
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,541
Hello?

236
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,083
Are you here now?

237
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,541
We're here.

238
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,416
Can you tell me
what exactly you are up to?

239
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,708
Put An Chi on.

240
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,041
You can say it to me.

241
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,083
I repeat.

242
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,125
Put An Chi on.

243
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,041
Hello, Ms. Chao?

244
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,666
An Chi.

245
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,666
Okay. Just making sure you're here.

246
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,125
See you soon.

247
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,333
Give me some.

248
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,041
Eason.

249
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,333
What do you think?

250
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,291
Beautiful.

251
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,166
Do you like it?

252
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,333
Yes.

253
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,166
But that's okay.
I've got lots of similar outfits.

254
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,125
It's on me.

255
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,916
No need, it's not like I can't afford it.

256
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,416
I've already paid.

257
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,750
These shoes match your dress.

258
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,833
Your card, thank you.

259
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,416
-I want these too.
-Okay, yes.

260
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,416
You don't have to do this.
It's embarrassing.

261
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,791
It's fine.

262
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:45,708
By the way,

263
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,166
I'd like to ask a favor.

264
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,750
Go somewhere with me?

265
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,250
You'll need to dress up.

266
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Have a look.

267
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,000
It's the info we compiled
on the association.

268
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,083
I had my suspicions before.

269
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,750
But their accounts were so clean.

270
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,500
Completely airtight.

271
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,000
Now that we know they're
using cryptocurrency to launder money,

272
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,125
we should change tactics.

273
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,750
I've asked my colleagues
to look for evidence.

274
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,166
I've even hired a cryptocurrency expert

275
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,458
as our consultant.

276
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,416
Don't worry.

277
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,458
I've called in every favor this time.

278
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,416
I'll do my best
to present evidence to the court

279
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,791
and sue for civil damages.

280
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,916
-Okay?
-Okay.

281
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,541
So you mean
you weren't doing your best before?

282
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,125
What I mean is, as your lawyer,

283
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,000
I hope that from now on,

284
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,958
we won't hide anything from each other.

285
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,291
Okay?

286
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,166
We never hid anything from you.

287
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,833
Alright.

288
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,500
So we can trust each other.

289
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,500
Then can you tell me

290
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,083
why Chang Shih-kai is alive?

291
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,375
What did you do to him?

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,041
We found a village in the countryside here

293
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,041
where villagers worship a goddess.

294
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,833
This goddess uses witchcraft
to resurrect people.

295
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,375
So we paid the cops
to get us Chang Shih-kai's corpse,

296
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,458
then got the goddess to breathe on him.

297
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,375
And he came back to life.

298
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,791
It's true.

299
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,750
Forget it.

300
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,500
You still don't trust me.

301
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,416
Never mind.

302
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,041
But I must remind you.

303
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,916
Chang Shih-kai was on death row.

304
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,041
I don't care
if you bought off the guards or whatever,

305
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,041
do you know how serious a crime it is

306
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,375
sneaking him out of prison?

307
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,625
Don't worry.

308
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,791
We'll handle Chang Shih-kai.

309
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,166
We won't drag you
or An Chi down with us.

310
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,916
Then why did you

311
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,583
take photos of my daughter?

312
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,500
Sure she's your daughter?

313
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,583
I confess.

314
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,625
She's An Chi's daughter.

315
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,375
Why didn't you tell us?

316
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,000
Because she's Chang Shih-kai's.

317
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,333
He raped An Chi.

318
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,500
I didn't tell you
because I wanted to protect her.

319
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,250
Was that wrong?

320
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,791
We asked you here

321
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,833
to help us find evidence
that Sanching Tai Chi is laundering money.

322
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,500
You didn't have to threaten me.

323
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,250
Would you have come if we didn't?

324
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,833
You said to go our separate ways

325
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,291
and not contact you again.

326
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,250
Have you forgotten?

327
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,375
I felt cornered.

328
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,208
Okay, I promise.

329
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,500
-I will do my best to help you.
-I believe in you.

330
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,541
But before we get to the bottom of it,

331
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,708
you and An Chi must stay here.

332
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,333
Why must An Chi stay here?

333
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,666
She's going to the US and has to do--

334
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,458
So hurry up.

335
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,833
No, I can stay here.

336
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,666
My entire team can come here.

337
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,750
But An Chi must go.

338
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,208
-She's got to go to--
-Mom.

339
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,375
Can I talk with them in private?

340
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,458
Why wouldn't you want me here?

341
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,791
I thought we trusted each other.

342
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,791
What are you afraid of?

343
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,250
I'll wait outside.

344
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,625
Can I see Chang Shih-kai?

345
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,708
What?

346
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,416
Wouldn't seeing him bring back--

347
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,750
I want to know if he's really alive.

348
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,291
Why did you keep the child?

349
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,375
I've thought about it a lot.

350
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,875
Of course I know who the dad is.

351
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,416
But for some reason,

352
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,958
I just felt I had to keep the baby.

353
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,750
After all, the baby is innocent.

354
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,083
Can't have been easy persuading your mom.

355
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,541
I forced her.

356
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,458
But I have to tell other people
she's my sister.

357
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,125
She doesn't want my future ruined.

358
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,916
Do you want a book?

359
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Want a book?

360
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,625
Thank you.

361
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,333
Have a great day.

362
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,416
Christina.

363
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,500
Why didn't you visit Nana
when you got back?

364
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,875
Why did you come here?

365
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,875
Hello, I'm Christina.

366
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:59,125
I came here
to pick a gift for your fiancée.

367
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,833
Mom, let me introduce you.

368
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,708
This is Christina. She's my--

369
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:03,791
Hey.

370
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,000
What do you think
of this pair of bangles?

371
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,208
Wouldn't they suit Lisa perfectly?

372
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,041
I plan on buying them,

373
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,750
one for me and one for her.

374
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,208
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,125
It's fine.

376
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,875
Mom, let me introduce you again.

377
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,000
This is Christina.

378
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,333
She's my girlfriend.

379
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,416
I brought her to meet you today.

380
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,125
I'm not in love with Lisa.

381
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,083
Don't worry.

382
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,791
Lisa doesn't love you either.

383
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,500
Love and marriage are separate matters.

384
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,000
You know very well
why you must marry her.

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,083
Mom, listen to me.

386
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:43,250
I want to marry the one I truly love.

387
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,708
That will make me happy.

388
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,083
You'll be happy, but I won't.

389
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,458
Family influence and wealth are the only--

390
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,875
I'm sorry.

391
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,208
Mom, wait for me.

392
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:02,750
She looks so poor.
Lord knows where you met her.

393
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,041
Mom, lower your voice.

394
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:08,541
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Then, at 950,000 US dollars,

395
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:09,791

396
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,333
Are you okay?

397
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,000
Going twice…

398
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,791
And the bid is sold to the gentleman
at 950,000 US dollars.

399
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,041
Congratulations.

400
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:25,958
And the next item,
we have a pair of sun green jade bangles.

401
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,875
This is a very rare variety

402
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:30,458
with a green ribbon-like strap inside.

403
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:33,833
It has abundant water content
and excellent transparency.

404
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:36,375
The overall appearance
of these bracelets--

405
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,041
This is the one.

406
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,541

Do we have 750 in the room?

434
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:04,958
Ladies and gentlemen,

435
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,125

at 700,000 US dollars. Congratulations.

439
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,291
Hello, ma'am.

440
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,500
Those bangles are my gift to you.

441
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:25,250
Christina Chang.
My father does business in Fujian.

442
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:26,916
Nice to meet you.

443
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:37,125
Eason.

444
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,958
Arrange a dinner engagement.

445
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,708
I'd like to get to know her.

446
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,000
Okay.

447
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:01,333
I'll pay.

448
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,208
You shouldn't have to pay for them.

449
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,166
But my mom said she's really pleased.

450
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:12,375
She never likes anyone this much.

451
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,291
It's okay, it's not that much.

452
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:19,416
And I'm happy to help you
stand up to her.

453
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,875
I hate overbearing mothers.

454
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,958
Even if I'm not your real girlfriend.

455
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,125
I wish that all of this was real

456
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,500
and you were my girlfriend.

457
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,208
I've got to find my mom.

458
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,166
I'm taking her to visit Grandma.

459
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,458
I'll contact you later.

460
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,958
Sure, it's okay, go.

461
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:00,916
I'll see you later.

462
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,541
Excuse me, madam.

463
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,625
Sorry, excuse me, madam.

464
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,125
You can check again, please.

465
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,166
Here is your document, madam.

466
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,166
Please transfer the remaining money

467
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,625
into the designated account
within seven days.

468
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,833
Otherwise, this item
will be considered out of auction.

469
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:27,791
And please be reminded
your deposit will not be returned.

470
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,625
How did I do?
Was my acting believable?

471
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,375
No.

472
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,166
You're too young.

473
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,041
You look nothing like my mom.

474
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,333
You promised to spend next month with me.

475
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:31,625
Sure.

476
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,333
It's been a while.

477
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:27,250
GPS TRACKING FAILED

478
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,291
Does the child look like me?

479
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,208
She's not your child.

480
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:05,708
She's not my child?

481
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh, right.

482
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,750
I forgot, we all fucked you.
Anyone could be the dad.

483
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,583
Hey.

484
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,583
Let go.

485
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:24,500
What's up?
Don't you love me anymore?

486
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,750
I never loved you!

487
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,666
You murderer!

488
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,541
You're a killer too.

489
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:53,541
Who exactly

490
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:55,541
did she kill?

491
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:58,916
No.

492
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:01,583
I never killed anyone.

493
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,125
If I tell you,

494
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,666
will you let me go?

495
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,041
I never killed anyone!

496
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,125
Answer me. Who exactly did she kill?

497
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,625
I didn't.

498
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,375
I didn't.

499
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,333
No, I didn't.

500
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:29,708
She killed many people.

501
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,125
No, he's lying!

502
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,708
Which scammer never got anyone killed?

503
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,166
People's lives get ruined.

504
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,750
-They commit suicide.
-Liar.

505
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,791
Think your daughter didn't?

506
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:41,625
Chao Ching.

507
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,583
Chao Ching.

508
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,250
MONEY GRUBBER

509
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,041
Peace be upon you.

510
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,375
Police!

511
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,458
Open up.

512
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:10,958
How can I help you?

513
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Miss.

514
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,458
We received a report…

515
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,541
What?

516
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,791
…about weird sounds
coming from your store.

517
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:24,208
We suspect illegal activities,
so we need to check.

518
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,458
What? I don't understand.

519
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,708
Wait. There's something at the back.

520
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,041
-What's inside?
-I'll go.

521
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,708
-Hey, you can't…
-Miss.

522
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,375
You stay here, okay?

523
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,291
What are you looking for?

524
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:16,958
Found anything strange?

525
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:19,375
Nothing so far. Did you find anything?

526
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:20,875
No.

527
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,416
If we can't find anything,

528
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,208
let's go back.

529
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,833
Let's go.

530
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,416
Let's go.

531
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,625
Let's go have supper.

532
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,500
Why'd you turn your phone off?

533
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,750
An Chi came over for a chat.

534
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:06,875
It got late,

535
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,708
so I gave her a ride back.

536
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:11,958
Thanks. Let's talk tomorrow.

537
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,083
Here's her phone.

538
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,166
-Why'd you take her phone?
-You can turn it on.

539
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,375
Your daughter's a grown-up.

540
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:28,625
Give her some space
and stop tracking her location.

541
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:47,500
Did you see him?

542
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,416
I know he'll tell them.

543
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,458
Don't worry.

544
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,250
I'll protect you.

545
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,708
What's going on?

546
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,583
There was a haunting last night.

547
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,041
A lot of bugs
crawled out of your brother's urn.

548
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,125
So horrible.

549
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,208
What utter BS.

550
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,041
Don't make a scene.

551
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,708
Mom, I need to talk.

552
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,875
We'll talk later, I'm busy.

553
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,125
Tell everyone to go.

554
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:39,000
Let's all take a break.

555
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,416
Mom, I need some money.

556
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:46,625
After money again?

557
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,166
How much?

558
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,666
One million US dollars.

559
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,500
Are you insane?

560
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,708
Mom.

561
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,583
You don't seem too good lately.

562
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:00,791
Did you make a promise
that you didn't keep?

563
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,166
So someone came back to get even?

564
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,708
What are you talking about?

565
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:06,500
About what happened last night.

566
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,916
Why else would a load of bugs
crawl out of his urn?

567
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,041
-That was your doing?
-You're the one with a guilty conscience.

568
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:17,208
You promised Kai to give me some money,
but kept putting it off.

569
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,041
No wonder he came back for revenge.

570
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,333
Nonsense. There's no such thing as ghosts.

571
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,458
No such thing?
Then what's this ritual for?

572
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:28,083
One last time.
One million US dollars, yes or no?

573
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,458
I can't give it to you.

574
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:33,750
I've given all the money
to the Sanching Association.

575
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,375
I don't have access to it.

576
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,625
Ask me again later.

577
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,916
Need I remind you?

578
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:45,916
Don't forget

579
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,083
what you did to Kai before he died.

580
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:51,958
He might not know,

581
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:53,916
but I,

582
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,083
I know all too well.

583
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:10,958
Transfer me the money tomorrow morning.

584
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:14,041
Or it won't just be ghosts after you,

585
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,000
it'll be the police too.

586
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,250
All clear, let's go.

587
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:48,250
Can't you be more careful?

588
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:50,541
You better not mess up

589
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:51,833
and drag me into it.

590
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,500
Sorry, understood.

591
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,041
Thanks for warning us.

592
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,958
Or we'd have been screwed.

593
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,958
I'll keep my eyes open.

594
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,333
-I'd better go.
-Thank you.

595
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:40,375
Stop making a noise.
No one's coming to save you.

596
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:05,125
Surprise!

597
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,083
I told you. Just a few days.

598
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,000
So soon.

599
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:13,375
Well…

600
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:15,250
I…

601
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,583
Long time no see.

602
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:44,666
He said some friends inside
took care of him.

603
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,083
Did he get any leads?

604
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,125
He said we’re not the only ones
who want Chang Shih-kai dead.

605
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:55,166
Others want him dead too?
