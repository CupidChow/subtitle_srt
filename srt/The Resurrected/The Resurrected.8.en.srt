1
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,125
Think hard about

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,916
your performances in the mock exam.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,166
Think that's acceptable?

4
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,291
Did I say you could stop?

5
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,458
I couldn't help it.

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,458
Get back up there.

7
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,416
-My shirt fell down.
-I didn't notice.

8
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,291
An Chi's doing just fine.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,833
Look at her shirt.

10
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,666
What's going on?

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,875
Get back up.

12
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,583
Sir, is this necessary?

13
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,958
You need to be punished.

14
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,208
What's the problem?

15
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,041
Our shirts keep falling down.

16
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,083
No one cares. Get back up.

17
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,708
You pervert.

18
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,541
What's with your attitude?

19
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,500
Am I wrong?

20
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,416
What?

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Want to be class rebel now?

22
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,958
Hey, back up, all of you.
Want to join her rebellion?

23
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,791
I can wait as long as it takes.

24
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,083
Don't you want to leave?

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,208
Go on.

26
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,625
Having them
do handstands is unacceptable.

27
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,333
And they made it clear
why it was unacceptable.

28
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,833
Girls their age
are sensitive about that stuff.

29
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,916
Let's keep things in perspective.

30
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:21,916
The exams are coming up.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,333
Changing teachers now
will have a big impact.

32
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:25,833
Right, Mrs. Wang?

33
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,208
Right.

34
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,375
It won't help them
changing teachers now.

35
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,875
Mr. Cheng is well-respected.

36
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,375
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

37
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,958
You're overreacting.

38
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,583
I'm overreacting?

39
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,958
Mrs. Huang, you're a lawyer.

40
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,041
Isn't this obviously sexual harassment?

41
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,250
It's not like that.

42
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,750
I asked the students.

43
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,416
The teacher acted appropriately.

44
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,416
Mr. Cheng is a good man.

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,583
He treats his students

46
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,666
like they're his own children.

47
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,833
It's not even an issue
for kids their age.

48
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,250
Kids? They're 16 years old already.

49
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,291
Your daughter
can come and strip for us.

50
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,750
See how she likes it.

51
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,958
Getting into college
should be the priority right now.

52
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,958
We mustn't jeopardize
their future over such a petty issue.

53
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,500
Petty issue?

54
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,666
I think Mr. Cheng should be fired.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,916
My mom's gonna kill me
when I get home

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,541
for interrupting her at work.

57
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,333
Sorry.

58
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,291
It's not your fault.

59
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,250
You were helping.

60
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,791
But that was pretty dumb.

61
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,875
You called him out
in front of the class.

62
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,333
He was in the wrong.

63
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,041
He deserved it, but our parents
got called in and it's your fault.

64
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,000
An Chi's so dead now.
And the teacher will have your ass.

65
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,500
It sucks for all of us.

66
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,250
You should've threatened
to out him on social media

67
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,791
for being a perv.

68
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,958
He would've apologized to An Chi then

69
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,208
and maybe
treated us better to shut us up.

70
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,708
Then we'd be the ones blackmailing him.

71
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,166
He's scum.

72
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,500
-Don't we have to be--
-You're calling me scum?

73
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,375
-Decisions like that aren't ours to make.
-Right.

74
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:57,833
How about this?

75
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,916
Since opinions are divided,

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,916
why don't we vote on it?

77
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,166
As parents of the three students,

78
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,041
if you believe
Mr. Cheng's behavior was inappropriate

79
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,166
and he should be held accountable,

80
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,750
please raise your hand.

81
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,000
Then that's settled.

82
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,166
Good.

83
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,458
Right is right. Wrong is wrong.

84
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,375
A vote does not change that fact.

85
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,625
The school respects
the decision of the majority.

86
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,583
-Thank you.
-Thank you all.

87
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,916
Thank you.

88
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,041
I agree with Ms. Hsu.

89
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,500
What Mr. Cheng did
really wasn't appropriate.

90
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:46,916
Okay.

91
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,708
This will be reported
to the Ministry of Education.

92
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,791
Mr. Cheng will be suspended for now.

93
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,333
What did I do wrong?
I was protecting you.

94
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,416
-You messed up.
-Let's drop it, okay?

95
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,375
Let's go.

96
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,083
Maybe I was too hot-headed.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,166
You don't say.

98
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,041
-Mom.
-Let's go.

99
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,333
-We're going.
-Bye.

100
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,250
-Bye.
-Thank you.

101
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,625
What did they say?

102
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,458
Did I mess up?

103
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,625
In what way?

104
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,625
I shouldn't have pushed the teacher.

105
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,375
He was in the wrong.

106
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,875
You did the right thing.

107
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,375
You're so brave.

108
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,833
It was An Chi at the counter.

109
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,500
And her name was
on the withdrawal slip.

110
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,166
According to the employee on duty,

111
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,958
she saw the plea for help
on the banknote An Chi gave her.

112
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:36,166
-So she called the police.
-Jin Jin. Look, it's Jin Jin.

113
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,833
Can I get a photo
of the banknote as well?

114
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,083
The banknote.

115
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,500
The evidence should all be here.

116
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,541
But I don't remember where…

117
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,458
It might take a while

118
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,541
to find it.

119
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,666
A few months ago, the association

120
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,125
held a small fundraiser
to test the waters.

121
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,458
Here.

122
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,583
Ever heard of Chang Ching-tsai?

123
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,208
He donated 15 million dollars.

124
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,000
But he was going through

125
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,291
a divorce at the time.

126
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,458
To divide their assets,

127
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,125
his ex-wife got the court

128
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,958
to freeze all his accounts.

129
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,208
He shouldn't even
have been able to donate a dime.

130
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,541
So where did the 15 million come from?

131
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,458
Based on the info you gave me,

132
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,416
I suspect the Tai Chi Association
did a deal with these donors

133
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,291
to transfer money to themselves

134
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,583
disguised as donations.

135
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,708
The goal is to convert
cryptocurrency into cash.

136
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,291
Mr. Chang, 10 million dollars.

137
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,375
Taiwan dollars.

138
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,416
Li Min-hsuan, 450,000 US dollars.

139
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
-450,000 US.
-50,000 NTD.

140
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:58,958
1.25 million US.

141
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,833
-950,000 US.
-9.5 million NTD.

142
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,000
That way,

143
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,458
the dirty cryptocurrency gets laundered

144
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,666
and appears legitimate
in the banking system.

145
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,250
You know all that.

146
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,083
But I wonder,

147
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,500
all these people are well-known figures.

148
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,750
Why would they risk
helping the association launder money?

149
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,750
Pure profit.

150
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,500
It costs them nothing.

151
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,000
Once donated to the association,

152
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,083
the funds are exchanged for good karma

153
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,666
and returned to your accounts.

154
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,541
Fake donations for real tax breaks.

155
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,875
For the wealthy,

156
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,250
even a few percent in tax

157
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,916
is a lot of money.

158
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,791
The Tai Chi Association

159
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,958
probably gives them a small cut as well

160
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,166
using the same cryptocurrency model.

161
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,541
No one would ever know
or suspect a thing.

162
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:48,000
Who'd have thought
Mrs. Chang was so well-connected?

163
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,083
So many politicians
and businessmen helping her out.

164
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,500
It's not her.

165
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,708
He's the key.

166
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,708
He makes it all happen.

167
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,541
Kuo Chih-chieh.

168
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,666
He's a legislator.

169
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,666
Why would he risk getting involved?

170
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm sure it has its benefits.

171
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,541
Elections are expensive.

172
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,041
Now we know
how they're laundering the money,

173
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,041
can't we bring the cops in?

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,041
If someone as high up
as Kuo Chih-chieh is involved,

175
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,500
imagine how deep this must go.

176
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,166
And we've got no idea
which other players are involved.

177
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,750
I suggest

178
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,000
we hold off
until we have substantive evidence.

179
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,791
What exactly
counts as substantive evidence?

180
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,208
Ledgers.

181
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,208
Or witnesses,

182
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,000
ones who'll testify.

183
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,541
KUO CHIH-CHIEH, CITY COUNCILLOR

184
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,416
I didn't sleep until 3 a.m.

185
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,000
My eyelids keep twitching.

186
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,125
Maybe it's a bad omen.

187
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,125
You're just tired.

188
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,458
You need to relax.
I'll book a massage for you tonight.

189
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,291
Do I have time?

190
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,791
Sure.

191
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,500
Okay, whatever.

192
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,291
HE'S ARRIVED IN BENKHA.
CONTROL YOUR EX-WIFE.

193
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,875
DON'T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE!

194
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:09,875
Look.

195
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,625
Jin Jin gave the banknote
with the message on it to An Chi.

196
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,041
So she alerted the police.

197
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,333
She got them to arrest Chang Shih-kai.

198
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,916
They weren't working together.

199
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,416
But An Chi…

200
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,791
Why's she insisting
that she alerted the police?

201
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,166
What's she trying to hide?

202
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,416
This video

203
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,375
doesn't even show what she gave An Chi,

204
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,916
let alone what was written on it.

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,291
It's just guesswork. It proves nothing.

206
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,958
You're convinced it was Jin Jin.

207
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,875
Nothing I show you will be enough.

208
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,791
That's not true.

209
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,458
Then why did you kidnap her?

210
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,791
I still suspect her.

211
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,958
Do you know why
no one liked Hsin-yi in school?

212
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,708
Because she was as stubborn as you.

213
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,833
She always thought she was right.
To hell with everyone else.

214
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,458
So no one liked her.

215
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,208
Did Jin Jin tell you that?

216
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,250
You know well enough.

217
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,500
You caused Hsin-yi's death.

218
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,541
Acting the way you taught her,

219
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,916
and being so stubborn

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,125
and impulsive
in such a dangerous situation,

221
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,666
I'm not surprised she ended up dead.

222
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,291
Who betrayed them?

223
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,750
I will find out.

224
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,458
Don't be surprised
if it turns out it was Jin Jin!

225
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,916
Kill her if you think she did it!

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,083
Do you think I won't?

227
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,000
I know you won't.

228
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:52,875
Will you?

229
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,083
Let's get the crypto wallet first.

230
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,958
What are you doing?

231
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,083
How will you prove
Jin Jin's innocence if I'm dead?

232
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,375
Jin Jin wasn't my girlfriend.

233
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,833
An Chi was.

234
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,958
She recruited Jin Jin.

235
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,583
It was An Chi who pushed Jin Jin.

236
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,083
Say that again.

237
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,000
Repeat what you just said!

238
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,083
An Chi tricked Jin Jin
into coming here.

239
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,083
An Chi was my real girlfriend.

240
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,375
It was An Chi who pushed Jin Jin.

241
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,500
You idiot!
Think anyone will believe that?

242
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,541
-You idiot!
-You enjoy messing with me?

243
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,666
Kill me!

244
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,458
Just kill me.
Chao Ching won't let her go either way.

245
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,416
Or how about this?

246
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,541
Release me

247
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,416
and I'll kill Chao Ching.

248
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,083
Chang I-ting contacted me.

249
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,500
She's waiting at the hotel.

250
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,125
What's our next move?

251
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,291
Proceed with the original plan.

252
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,375
You're back.

253
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,291
Yeah.

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
Where did you go last night?

255
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,708
Why didn't you tell me?

256
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,291
I was worried.

257
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,791
My mom's having me followed

258
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,333
so I hid at a friend's place.

259
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,916
Were you hurt?

260
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:54,666
I'm fine.

261
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,958
By the way, I got the wallet.

262
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,583
But I don't know the password.

263
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,125
Can we still get the money?

264
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,000
Of course not.

265
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,750
I thought you were an expert?

266
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,375
You must know how to crack it.

267
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,916
It's not that simple.

268
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,166
It can't be cracked.

269
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,000
I see.

270
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,250
I see.

271
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,000
I see.

272
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,583
Then why bother keeping you?

273
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,000
When did you find out?

274
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,750
Ages ago. You think I really liked you?

275
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,000
I only liked you
for your money, your status,

276
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,416
and your fake persona.

277
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,375
But you're just a cheap gigolo!

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,250
You think
that pretending to be rich can hide

279
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,916
what a cheap loser you are?

280
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,833
Who do you think you're fooling?

281
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,583
You.

282
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,750
Just quit projecting.

283
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,708
Remember that German phrase I said?

284
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,458
Du bist dumm.

285
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,375
It's not "you're beautiful."

286
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,500
It means you're stupid.

287
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,375
Since you know who I really am,

288
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,583
you must also know

289
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,083
that we have your brother.

290
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,625
Will you exchange this money
for your brother's life?

291
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,666
You only bring me trouble!

292
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,041
Didn't I teach you how to torture someone

293
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,333
to get what you want?

294
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,500
Why couldn't you get the passcode
to the safe out of him? Why?

295
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,000
Stop hitting him!

296
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,750
Wanna protect him?

297
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,125
I'll hit you too.

298
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll send you back to the orphanage.

299
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,291
You dare touch her!

300
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,791
Think it costs nothing to raise her?

301
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,375
I'll make twice as much!

302
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,083
I'll do anything

303
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,291
you want me to.

304
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,000
But I have one condition.

305
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,875
Let I-ting

306
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,500
live a clean life.

307
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,875
Live a normal life.

308
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,666
Fine.

309
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:30,916
Fine.

310
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,750
I-ting has a good brother.

311
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:48,083
-What lame-ass lawyer did you hire?
-The problem is a lack of witnesses.

312
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,583
Can't you get some fake ones?

313
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,750
That's not easy
with you being caught here.

314
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,125
I told you. I was set--

315
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,666
Be quiet!

316
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,666
I was set up.

317
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,041
Stop crying.

318
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,666
I've always said family comes first.

319
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,291
We must all
make sacrifices for the family.

320
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,416
-So you want to sacrifice me?
-Think I want this?

321
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,541
It'd be like losing a limb.
Like losing a part of myself.

322
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,791
You just want me silenced, right?

323
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,208
Think of the family.

324
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,250
Think of I-ting.

325
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,416
Decide for yourself.

326
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,583
If I were in your place,
I'd sacrifice myself.

327
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,375
Okay.

328
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,416
But promise me this.

329
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,500
Half of everything I made for you

330
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,666
must be left to her.

331
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,708
I can do that.

332
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,583
Okay.

333
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,708
Why wasn't I told
when Jin Jin was transferred?

334
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,291
-I thought she--
-That she was dead?

335
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,208
I didn't say that.

336
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,458
Don't tell Hui-chun that.

337
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,541
I heard your mistress is in Benkha.

338
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,916
What do you want from me?

339
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,916
I've done everything Hui-chun wanted.

340
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,583
I signed the divorce papers.

341
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,666
But I am not Hui-chun.

342
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,000
I need your help.

343
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,500
-What can I do?
-Not you.

344
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,791
Chou Shu-ting.

345
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,791
I want records of transactions between
Mr. Kuo and the Tai Chi Association.

346
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,750
Not a chance. That would ruin her.

347
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,916
I can't help you with this.

348
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,041
I've seen your divorce agreement.

349
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,791
Most of the terms
are related to Jin Jin.

350
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,000
Your current residence goes to Jin Jin,

351
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,958
as does a generous annual alimony.

352
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,208
You have to pay this

353
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,833
no matter what happens
between you and Chou Shu-ting.

354
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,041
But if Jin Jin dies,

355
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,250
all those terms will be void.

356
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,750
What do you mean?

357
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,041
Jin Jin is currently in my care.

358
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,000
Persuade Chou Shu-ting
to get me what I want,

359
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,708
and anything

360
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,250
you might want done to her

361
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,333
I can do for you.

362
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,041
What do you mean?

363
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,458
A problem with the money?

364
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,958
No, just a technical problem.

365
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,916
It's not that serious.

366
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,083
We're working on it.

367
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,833
But it might not be ready
for the event tomorrow--

368
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,291
Stop beating around the bush.
Get to the point.

369
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,375
Could we postpone the event
for a day or two?

370
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,750
Just for a few days.

371
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:51,958
Are you kidding?

372
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,250
I have to be back
for the primary the day after tomorrow.

373
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,958
Think it was easy getting them on board?

374
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,583
How will you launder money without them?
Run for election without money?

375
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,500
What are you saying?

376
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:05,958
Nothing.

377
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,666
We just wanted to discuss

378
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,625
the possibility of changing the date

379
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,833
and the theme.

380
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:12,875
No chance.

381
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,291
Proceed as planned tomorrow
or don't bother.

382
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,958
This is a critical moment.
Every day counts.

383
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:20,708
Understood.

384
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,625
Understood.

385
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,083
I'll see you out.

386
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:09,708
Shih-kai!

387
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:11,833
Where is it?

388
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:30,916
There's a dashcam.

389
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,583
Doubt you want this going viral.

390
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,125
I-ting, listen up.
There's a dashcam in the car.

391
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,125
Don't push me.

392
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,291
Release my brother.

393
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,041
Now!

394
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,708
Let's go.

395
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,583
Why didn't you kill them just now?

396
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,125
I'll drive.

397
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,500
First time firing a gun?

398
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,541
Fuck, you should've just killed them.

399
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,625
Once the old hag
gives us the password,

400
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,083
we can enjoy our lives.

401
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,291
I'll take you to Myanmar.

402
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,416
I know a ton of people there.

403
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,333
I'll get them all together

404
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:41,458
and make a comeback.

405
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,833
What's the matter?

406
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Shih-kai.

407
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,583
You've always been good to me.

408
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:04,791
You worked hard to make money
and put me through school.

409
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:07,708
I've always been grateful.

410
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,916
But we live
in completely different worlds.

411
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,875
You made your choice.

412
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,041
And I had the life I wanted.

413
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,666
But my life wasn't what it seemed.

414
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,125
Do you know how much I had to suffer?

415
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:28,583
In other people's eyes,

416
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,291
I was still just the sister
of a con artist and a murderer.

417
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,291
What are you saying?

418
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,166
Didn't you tell her back then

419
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,166
to let me live a clean life?

420
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,250
I think I get it now.

421
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,166
Only once you're dead

422
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,750
can I truly be clean.

423
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:57,541
What're you doing?

424
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,125
I want half of the money.

425
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:00,833
-Put the gun down.
-The money.

426
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,000
-Put it down!
-Give me the money!

427
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,291
-Give me the money!
-Cut it out!

428
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,833
Give me the money!

429
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:26,250
I-ting. I-ting.

430
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,000
Remember your promise.

431
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,875
Kill Chao Ching

432
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,833
and I'll give you back the wallet.

433
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,541
Has she been found?

434
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,166
Not yet.

435
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:52,625
Two police officers
are here to see you.

436
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:13,750
Chang I-ting was in the passenger seat.

437
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:17,500
We need to verify whether her mother knows
who she might have been with.

438
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,541
Here, Sergeant.

439
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:26,375
See if these belonged to your daughter.

440
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:29,708
We know how
you must be feeling right now.

441
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:32,666
But there's one more thing
we need to confirm with you.

442
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,500
Chang I-ting was found
in the passenger seat.

443
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,625
Someone else was driving.

444
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,708
Do you know who she might have been with?

445
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:48,416
I don't know.

446
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:52,833
Breaking news.

447
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,291
A car accident in the suburbs of Benkha

448
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,333
resulted in one fatality.

449
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,208
The victim has been identified

450
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,333
as 26-year-old woman Chang I-ting.

451
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:05,291
Police are still
investigating the accident.

452
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:09,125
We will keep you updated
as more information becomes available.

453
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:12,125
And now,
let's move on to the next headline.

454
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,166
CHANG I-TING

455
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,250
Can we really just leave like this?

456
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,708
Someone's dead.

457
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,083
If things escalate
and we get caught up in it,

458
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:35,583
they won't let us leave.

459
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,416
But Chang Shih-kai is still alive.

460
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,458
If he talks about what I--

461
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:41,500
About what?

462
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,583
What have you done?

463
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,875
Who would believe a murderer?

464
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:48,916
From now on,

465
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,500
just forget everything that happened.

466
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:52,625
Forget about him.

467
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,458
Forget Hsin-yi. Forget Jin Jin.

468
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,625
This was a tragedy.

469
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,458
You're the sole survivor.

470
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:02,166
If you truly cared about them,

471
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,000
then you should concentrate on

472
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,458
making the best of your life
for their sakes.

473
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,083
I've planned everything out for you.

474
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,125
Do you understand?

475
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:19,791
An Ning.

476
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,291
Mom, when are you coming home?

477
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,958
We're on the plane back right now.

478
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:25,875
Okay.

479
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:27,833
See, your sister's here.

480
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:30,208
Hi, An Ning. Did you miss me?

481
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:31,625
Yes, I missed you.

482
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,666
Did you memorize
the 20 words I gave you yesterday?

483
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:36,708
No.

484
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,458
An Ning,

485
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,500
I've told you.

486
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,000
You can't just play all day.

487
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:47,125
You think your sis is amazing
and want to be like her, right?

488
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,750
-So study hard.
-Be right back.

489
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,666
Okay.

490
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:53,083
I've planned out everything for you.
It's for your own good.

491
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,958
-Do what I say, okay?
-I know.

492
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,041
Excuse me, miss. The aircraft is--

493
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,166
-That's all for now. Bye.
-Bye-bye!

494
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,833
Okay.

495
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:02,416
-Please put your phone--
-Okay.

496
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,000
We're about to close
the cabin doors for departure.

497
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:09,291
Please take your seat. Ground staff,
please leave the aircraft. Thank you.

498
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,750
Ladies and gentlemen,
the cabin doors are about to be closed.

499
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,916
Miss, please return back to your seat.

500
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,291
The plane is taking off.

501
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,666
Miss, the plane is taking off immediately.

502
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,458
Please return to your seat
for your own safety, miss.

503
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:34,291
The victim has been identified as
26-year-old woman Chang I-ting.

504
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:37,583
Police are investigating the accident
and report evidence

505
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:41,375
suggesting a male was driving the vehicle
at the time of the crash.

506
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:44,708
The driver's whereabouts post-accident
remain unknown.

507
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,625
Authorities are continuing their--

508
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,041
He's a male prostitute.

509
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:53,541
He's posing as a trust fund baby.

510
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,750
We used the same lame trick
in our scams.

511
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,291
How could I-ting fall for it?

512
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,125
She's an idiot.

513
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,833
Whatever happens, find him

514
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,750
and get the crypto wallet.

515
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,541
Understood?

516
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:08,916
Any means necessary.

517
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,833
Yes.

518
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,083
You really want Chao Ching dead?

519
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,208
She wants Jin Jin dead.

520
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,125
Is she really that kind of person?

521
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,041
She wouldn't kill an innocent person.

522
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,041
What if Jin Jin isn't innocent?

523
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,416
Chang Shih-kai told me

524
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,541
he'd transfer money to her account
every time she recruited someone.

525
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,791
Have you checked this account?

526
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,541
I have.

527
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,250
She does have another account at TMBC.

528
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,416
But I've tried her birthdate,
lucky number,

529
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,166
and even her license plate,
but none of them worked.

530
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,166
Let me see.

531
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,125
How about your birthday?

532
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:26,000
Lots of people use their loved ones'
birthdays as passwords.

533
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,791
LOGIN SUCCESSFUL

534
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:41,291
ACCOUNT BALANCE

535
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,125
She got paid for everyone

536
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,208
she helped recruit.

537
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,166
Hello, I'm Jin Jin.

538
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,208
It's June 1st, 2 p.m.

539
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,708
This is my good friend, An Chi.

540
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,208
Hello!

541
00:35:57,291 --> 00:36:00,125
Jin Jin already knew Chang Shih-kai.
She started all this.

542
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,250
Jin Jin was Chang Shih-kai's girlfriend.

543
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,500
She tricked Hsin-yi
and An Chi into coming.

544
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,208
Hello?

545
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,333
Where is he?

546
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,416
He's here.

547
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,333
You're lying.

548
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:23,541
I'll video call you.

549
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,875
Wait, he…

550
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,083
He got away.

551
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,125
They had a gun.

552
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:30,708
There was nothing I could do.

553
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:31,875
You let him go.

554
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,250
Think you can ruin my plan?

555
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,916
Don't you believe

556
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,375
I'll kill Jin Jin right now?

557
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:57,958
Where is Chang Shih-kai?

558
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,041
Hui-chun let him go.

559
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,958
You wanted to get revenge,

560
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:15,916
but now
the Tai Chi Association is after you.

561
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:19,750
You've put yourself…

562
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,041
…in grave danger.

563
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:27,333
Hsin-yi would be so sad if she knew.

564
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,666
Can't you let her back?

565
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,583
We'll leave here.

566
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:44,708
Together.

567
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,291
She wouldn't just kill an innocent person.

568
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,083
It wasn't easy getting this far

569
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:26,791
and you've been through so much.

570
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,458
They're looking for me everywhere now.

571
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:32,916
They know who I am and how I tricked
Chang I-ting into running away,

572
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,166
but not
that Chang Shih-kai is still alive.

573
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,250
So if you
and Chao Ching work together,

574
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,958
your plan should still work.

575
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:39,958
Eason.

576
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,625
You should leave.

577
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,166
Chang I-ting is dead.

578
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,416
Your cut of the ransom money

579
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,125
should be enough

580
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:53,166
to take care of you and your grandma.

581
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,416
You think I agreed to help you

582
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,583
for the money?

583
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,791
I don't know
if this will make any sense,

584
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,250
but as I got older,

585
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,750
I learned
that being good doesn't pay off.

586
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,333
No matter how hard I tried,

587
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:20,125
the world always seemed unfair.

588
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,666
Good people never defeated the bad.

589
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:25,000
That was until I met you guys.

590
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,500
You made me see
that maybe good people can win.

591
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:31,416
So can't I at least stick around
until all this is over?

592
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,791
-I--
-But you're of no more use to me.

593
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,208
I don't care. You can--

594
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,291
Stop following me around like a puppy.

595
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,500
Just leave.

596
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:40,500
Hui-chun.

597
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:42,625
Hui-chun!

598
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,083
Sign here.

599
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:01,208
And here.

600
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,666
That puts an end to it all.

601
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:24,041
I'm doing this for Hui-chun.

602
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:27,541
She can stop suffering
and live a better life.

603
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,750
Do you want to see her one last time?

604
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:20,500
Hello?

605
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,541
Ms. Chao,
there's something I want to tell you.

606
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:24,625
Can we meet?

607
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:25,958
I'll send the location.

608
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,041
CHAO CHING

609
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,833
LOCATION INFORMATION

610
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,333
TAI CHI ASSOCIATION
HOLDS GRAND CEREMONY TONIGHT

611
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:54,916
POLITICAL AND BUSINESS LEADERS
OFFER THEIR SUPPORT

612
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,000
I'll cut the bandage for you.

613
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,125
What?

614
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:30,000
Think I'm gonna kill you?

615
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
As if I'd dare.

616
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:39,083
Like you wouldn't.

617
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:41,041
You're tougher than them.

618
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,833
Think I didn't see?

619
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:44,416
You pushed Jin Jin.

620
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,625
She deserved it.

621
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,500
She tricked Hsin-yi into coming.

622
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,041
Now Hsin-yi's dead.

623
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,208
Know why Hsin-yi came?

624
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,416
-Do you?
-You told me before.

625
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,833
Because Jin Jin hated her.

626
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:11,583
You believe that?

627
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,750
I had my eye on you
the first night you arrived.

628
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:23,583
We had a lot of fun that night, right?

629
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:24,833
Do you remember?

630
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,166
Later, you fell asleep.

631
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,583
You wouldn't have known,

632
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:32,583
but there was
a long queue of guys outside the door.

633
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,458
They all wanted to bang you.

634
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,791
But I didn't let them.

635
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:39,833
I was the only one who touched you.

636
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:41,791
That child is mine.

637
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,000
I promised Jin Jin

638
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:46,666
that if she brought another girl,

639
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,291
I wouldn't let anyone else touch you.

640
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:53,125
And look what you did to her.

641
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:14,791
Officer Li.

642
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:16,291
Where's Jin Jin?

643
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,958
Sorry, we were too late.

644
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:22,125
What do you mean too late?

645
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,833
Didn't you say she was here?

646
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,583
The nurse said that Jin Jin was discharged

647
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,375
just before I got here.

648
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,458
Someone took her.

649
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:31,916
Also,

650
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:35,958
a family member signed this consent form
to turn off life support.

651
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,791
SUN KUO-CHIANG

652
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,875
What're you doing? What's up?

653
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,166
Bastard, I'll kill you!

654
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,083
What is it?

655
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:55,583
-How could you?
-What is it?

656
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:56,708
How could you?

657
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,000
What are you doing?

658
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,750
What're you doing? Are you insane?

659
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,083
You'll burn in hell.

660
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,041
That's a problem for another day.

661
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:20,541
Sorry.

662
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:59,875
You screwed up.

663
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,833
What good is this?

664
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:05,666
Things changed, all right?

665
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:09,291
The original plan likely won't work.

666
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:13,083
Why'd you take matters
into your own hands and tell her?

667
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,500
Figure it out yourself.

668
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,416
Who do you think you are?

669
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,416
Asshole.

670
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:33,500
I just want you to pass on a message.

671
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,458
Don't forget your place.

672
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,500
Keep hold.

673
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,041
Pong, what was that?

674
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:58,333
Bothering you again?

675
00:46:58,416 --> 00:46:59,291
It was nothing.

676
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,041
Repaying some debts.

677
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,833
Sure it's just money you owe?

678
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:05,875
Did you want something?

679
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,208
Is Jin Jin still alive?

680
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,333
-Who wants to know?
-Just answer.

681
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
When I left the hospital this morning,

682
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,291
she was still alive.

683
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:40,041
Do you think Chao Ching
is that kind of person?

684
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:44,583
Pong, don't you think
this is all getting a bit out of hand?

685
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:46,833
We just wanted revenge.

686
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:48,708
Why all this infighting?

687
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,083
I never expected it.

688
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,208
Hui-chun let Chang Shih-kai go.

689
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,791
She told him to kill Chao Ching.

690
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:00,458
Forget revenge now,

691
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,750
they'll be lucky just to survive.

692
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:06,083
Why would she do that to Chao Ching?

693
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:09,083
They don't trust each other.
Nothing we say will help.

694
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:12,166
I know you care about Chao Ching.

695
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,125
And I care about Hui-chun.

696
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,250
We have to do something

697
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,750
to get them to stop.

698
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:20,291
How?

699
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:23,458
Tell me which hospital Jin Jin is in.

700
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:25,875
And I'll give you the wallet.

701
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:30,125
Then Hui-chun
can take Jin Jin back to Taiwan.

702
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:34,458
And Chao Ching can stop
the association from getting that money.

703
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:38,208
Everyone can go their separate ways.

704
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:43,625
Okay.

705
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:56,708
Record this.

706
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,708
Your good friend, Wang Hui-chun,

707
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,708
wants me to take your life
in exchange for the crypto wallet.

708
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,458
Sorry.

709
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,291
Who's there?

710
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,666
Sorry.

711
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:07,583
Split up and chase him!

712
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,500
After him!

713
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,583
Eason.
