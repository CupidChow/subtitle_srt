2
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,556
=Episode 21=

3
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,199
I'm leaving.

4
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,599
Bye-bye.

5
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,039
(I don't know how much longer
it will take)

6
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,879
(before the Drunk Pub of my dreams)

7
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,000
(can meet everyone.)

8
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,479
(But I will still keep on working hard)

9
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,520
(and go on striving.)

10
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,639
The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

11
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,400
Please dial again later.

12
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,400
Outrageous.

13
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
How is it?

14
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,879
Still no one answering.

15
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,840
Pretend you're my sister

16
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,120
and just sign it for me.

17
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,199
This hospital isn't stupid.

18
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,800
Keep calling.

19
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,599
What?

20
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,719
You reek of smoke and alcohol.

21
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,479
Liu Yali,

22
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,840
did you work part-time again?

23
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,120
Are you killing yourself?

24
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,479
No.

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
No?

26
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,240
You can fool me.

27
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,639
But don't deceive yourself.

28
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,039
I'll check out now.

29
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,000
I won't have surgery.

30
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,000
Stop it.

31
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,719
I borrowed the money from Ada.

32
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,360
Are you out of your mind?

33
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,199
Why borrow from her?

34
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,800
There's nothing I can do.

35
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,520
I have lost my father too.

36
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,840
Now...

37
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,319
Jiang...

38
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,959
Do you want me to lose you as well?

39
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,160
Moreover,

40
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,720
am I all you have left too?

41
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,040
Get the surgery done properly.

42
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,720
I promise you,

43
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,160
once the money is paid off,

44
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,519
I'll quit.

45
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,879
Okay.

46
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,240
(If Flower Moon Night
can be successfully brewed...)

47
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,079
Anyway, I'm allergic to alcohol
and can't drink.

48
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,639
But in today's gathering,

49
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,240
we don't have to compete fiercely.

50
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,480
Just a peaceful meal

51
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
and a couple of drinks.

52
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,160
In a word,

53
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,079
never ever upset the other party.

54
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,120
Rest assured, I am professional.

55
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,319
I'm sorry, Mr. Zou.

56
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,560
I'm afraid

57
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,000
I can't take this order.

58
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,199
Are you kidding me?

59
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,480
Well?

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,120
You are already at the door.

61
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,240
Don't you dare to come in?

62
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you do something wrong?

63
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,439
Go on in.

64
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,240
Please.

65
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,360
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

66
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm late.

67
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,639
Why is your face red
before starting to drink?

68
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,959
Mr. Zou,

69
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
this subordinate of yours

70
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,360
doesn't seem sincere.

71
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,160
Don't say that, Mr. Jiang.

72
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,160
Ms. Liu, quickly.

73
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,360
Show Mr. Jiang.

74
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,839
Okay.

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,199
Punishing with three drinks.

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,399
I've finished all three drinks.

77
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
But you wouldn't drink a single drop?

78
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,600
Ms. Liu, what are you doing?

79
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
Mr. Jiang, I'm truly sorry.

80
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,360
You don't need to...

81
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,399
Bring the wine.

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't do business at dinner.

83
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I just make friends.

84
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
To be happy.

85
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,319
Today,

86
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,920
we won't go home sober.

87
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:31,920
Hold on.

88
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,040
Ms. Liu,

89
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,279
what do you want?

90
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang.

91
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,040
I've seen those
with poor drinking manners

92
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,879
and those who switch drinks.

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,439
So I need to check it.

94
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,519
Ms. Liu.

95
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,480
Ms. Liu, have you finished checking?

96
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,879
You really can hold your liquor now.

97
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,319
I am just happy today.

98
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,399
Yes, happy.

99
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,279
Mr. Jiang is happy today.

100
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,319
It's because

101
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,000
a good thing is imminent.

102
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,200
A good thing is imminent?

103
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Congratulations to you.

104
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,279
Congratulations.

105
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,879
A good thing is imminent.

106
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,200
Sorry, I drank too quickly
and lost my composure.

107
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,200
I'll go to the restroom.

108
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,000
How did you get drunk?

109
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,519
None of your business.

110
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,120
Come on, I'll take you home.

111
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,200
Let go of me.

112
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,720
Tell me,

113
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,360
why are you so drunk?

114
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,840
For whom?

115
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
For Lin Siqiao?

116
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,120
Or for me?

117
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,919
Let me ask you,

118
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,879
have you ever actually liked me?

119
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,240
You can lie.

120
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,159
Mr. Jiang,

121
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,480
shall we continue?

122
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,840
No need.

123
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,480
Mr. Huang, you can go back.

124
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,039
You're no longer needed.

125
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,279
Okay.

126
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,159
(Liu Yali,)

127
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,320
(don't you never get drunk?)
