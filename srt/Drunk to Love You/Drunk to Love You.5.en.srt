=Episode 5=

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,000
You mean

4
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,759
Lu has a complicated relationship
with his assistant?

5
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,560
That's totally unacceptable.

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,439
That's not the case.

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,320
I didn't say that.

8
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,079
Anyway,

9
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,159
sir,

10
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,439
you have to stand up for me.

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
Mr. Jiang has just returned
and knows nothing.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,840
What are you doing?

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,000
Sir,

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,399
Mr. Jiang's just returned...

15
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,560
You are back.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,799
Ms. Liu.

17
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,439
Prepare some refreshments.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,959
Okay.

19
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,439
Thank you for speaking well of me.

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
Your assistant...

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,799
Has character and ability.

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,560
What do you think of the sales data?

23
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,439
How did you negotiate

24
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,120
with the French winery?

25
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,680
What are you doing?

26
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,599
No deal.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
It's always Ada

28
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,439
who helps you
with what you can't handle.

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,080
Your contribution is
incomparable to hers.

30
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,960
She quickly found
an alternative Italian winery.

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Take a look at this.

32
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,159
She decided on this marriage

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
within a month.

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,759
The engagement ceremony is tomorrow.

35
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,479
(Jiang Lu, welcome to the engagement party...)
When your stepmother died,

36
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,800
(of Jiang Chuchu and Qin Yao)
you didn't come back.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,919
She didn't blame you.

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
She even arranged a blind date for you.

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,439
I won't go.

40
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,240
You figure it out.

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
(You are back.)

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,080
(I arranged a blind date
for you tomorrow.)

43
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:02,080
(So you're getting engaged tomorrow.)

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,120
(Congratulations.)

45
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,680
It's not like you don't know

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm short on time.

47
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,759
Why don't you schedule
a couple more for me?

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,199
Ms. Liu.

49
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,039
Get ready.

50
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,479
We have interviews later.

51
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,000
Mr. Huang has left.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,759
Need to meet a few candidates.

53
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,520
I want a beer.

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,919
(As for the questions,)

55
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,719
(here.)

56
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,599
What your plans are regarding marriage

57
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,319
and having children?

58
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,000
What?

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,360
Is it so direct?

60
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,079
Of course, I can get married.

61
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,839
But as for having children...

62
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,839
If there is a conflict between work

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,279
and family, how would you choose?

64
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,920
I would certainly prioritize family.

65
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,759
My thought is,

66
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,839
if my husband needs me to,

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
I could resign

68
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,800
and be a full-time housewife.

69
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,160
Why did you break up last time
you were in a relationship?

70
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,920
Mr. Jiang shows too little respect
for others.

71
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,759
Not showing up for a blind date

72
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,680
and even bringing a female companion.

73
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,720
Blind date?

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,040
What?

75
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,399
It's not easy to get a meeting
with Mr. Jiang.

76
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,480
No more interviews today.

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,680
What happened?

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,480
Not satisfied with any of the three?

80
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,560
It's been five years.

81
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,399
And this is how you greet me?

82
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,839
I might be second only to your father

83
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,199
who cares about your lifelong happiness.

84
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,480
Let me introduce.

85
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,000
This is...

86
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,000
Ms. Liu.

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
She has character

88
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,759
and ability.

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,399
Then tell my dad

90
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,000
I have someone I like.

91
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,079
- Don't waste your effort then.
- (I see.)

92
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,879
Okay.

93
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,600
Did you get the invitation?

94
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,519
I will attend.

95
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,839
What?

96
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,120
You like that lady, right?

97
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,279
Well?

98
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,079
Jealous?

99
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,480
Don't drink it.

100
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,279
This is Irish coffee.

101
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,240
It contains alcohol.

102
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,000
Another glass, please.

103
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,480
You brat can really hold your liquor.

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,759
Don't drink anymore.

105
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,199
Firstly,

106
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not a brat.

107
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,199
Secondly,

108
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,360
last time,

109
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,079
we did that.

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,279
I should be responsible for you.

111
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,879
Thirdly,

112
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,600
since you told me not to drink,

113
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,759
I will stop.

114
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,000
Xiaofa,

115
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
you're really a bit clingy.

116
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,240
If you're like this,
it'll stress me out a lot.

117
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,560
You go home first.

118
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,199
When I need you,

119
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,480
I'll call you, okay?

120
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,399
Be good.

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,199
Really?

122
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,199
Really.

123
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,399
Okay.

124
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,680
I'll behave.

125
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,279
I'll go home.

126
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,279
Bye-bye.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,959
Bye-bye.

128
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,800
Ning Shuang,

129
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,439
you must remember to call me.

130
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,000
How can you get this drunk
from just one sip?

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Hold on to me.

132
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,160
I've had too much to drink.

133
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,439
Liu Yali,

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,040
tomorrow,

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
go with me to the engagement party.

136
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,800
Is that lady going as well?

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,480
And you said you didn't like her.

138
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,279
Wherever she goes, you go too.

139
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,759
That's making me cringe.

140
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,440
We grew up together.

141
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,039
How could it be possible?

142
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,120
Why couldn't it be possible?

143
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,039
She arranged the blind date today.

144
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,279
And you had the nerve to go.

145
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,440
She must be heartbroken.

146
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,399
I don't just like her.

147
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,000
It's love.

148
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,080
The kind of love you have for family.

149
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,879
Look at you.

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
Only say it after drinking.

151
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,440
Wouldn't dare to say it sober.

152
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,279
I will

153
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,120
do you this favor.

154
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,919
Go ahead.

155
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,559
How do you usually confess your love
to a girl?

156
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,919
I don't know.

157
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,320
Well,

158
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,200
give it a try today.

159
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,039
The first time I saw you,

160
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
I didn't really like you.

161
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,799
But then I found

162
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,919
you are quite interesting.

163
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,639
I even started

164
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,399
to develop an interest in wine
because of you.

165
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,679
What Jiang's, what wedding…

166
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,960
Can you get to the point?

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,399
Stop talking nonsense.

168
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,759
I like you.

This confession

175
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,679
is not bad.
