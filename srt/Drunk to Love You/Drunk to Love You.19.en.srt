3
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,560
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
(CEO Jiang Lu)
Regarding this incident,

5
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,359
what is your final resolution?

6
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,399
Regarding the incident
caused by Luna Bianco,

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,920
we deeply apologize.

8
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:51,904
(Luna Bianco Incident Briefing)

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,479
After repeated inspections,

10
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,799
Luna Bianco meets all safety standards.

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,679
Do you mean

12
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,719
to blame the consumers
for improper consumption?

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,880
The lack of warning
for the mixing instructions

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,759
is our oversight.

15
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,239
Starting from today,

16
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,640
Luna Bianco will be

17
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,040
withdrawn from shelves.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,920
For the person responsible
for the project,

19
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,280
what actions will be taken?

20
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,879
We will employ

21
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,159
the whistleblower who first
raised the alarm for safety

22
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,239
as a product consultant for our group.

23
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's welcome

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Lin Siqiao.

25
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,959
Members of the media,

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,359
after this, the Jiang's Group will be subject
to both my supervision and that of the public

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,599
to prevent such incidents
from happening again.

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,760
Here, I have a question.

29
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,599
I have a question, here.

30
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,280
I have a question.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,200
Alright, one at a time.

32
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,719
I just don't know how to tell you.

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,480
I might need to sell this shop.

34
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,000
Why?

35
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,400
I might need to have a minor surgery.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,879
It's not a pregnancy.

37
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,879
That's good then.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you, Doctor.

39
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,159
Are you married?

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
Do you have children?

41
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,319
This could be a bit difficult.

42
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,520
The lesion is on your uterus,

43
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,360
and it may require surgical removal.

44
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,639
Is the surgery dangerous?

45
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,199
It's highly likely that you won't

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,360
be able to have children.

47
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,199
By the way,

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,840
a direct relative needs to sign

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,039
to schedule the surgery.

50
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,639
Are your parents around?

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,719
There's no problem.

52
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,800
That's outrageous.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,280
I can't even make decisions
about my own body.

54
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,800
Such a big event.

55
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,000
Why didn't you tell me?

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,840
I saw you were restless that day.

57
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,599
Then such a big thing happened.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,199
I didn't want you to worry.

59
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,319
Did you tell Chen Xiaofa?

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,599
Yali,

61
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,280
before meeting Chen Xiaofa,

62
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,639
I firmly believed

63
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,599
the meeting of people

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,759
was the pinnacle of love.

65
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,360
After that, it's all downhill.

66
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,680
So I was unwilling

67
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,360
to settle any relationship.

68
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,039
I can't stand the kind

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
of torment where every second is a loss.

70
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,879
But he seems different
from anyone I've ever met.

71
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,439
He is six years younger than me.

72
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,120
He has a long and beautiful life ahead.

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,879
He can do a PhD.

74
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,759
He can

75
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,719
study a lot. He

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,560
can

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,280
date the girls he likes,

78
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,240
get married, and have children.

79
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,120
But if we do this,

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,240
we are erasing the possibilities
of his life.

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
He is so good.

82
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,719
He shouldn't bear
such heavy responsibilities.

83
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,520
I have already told him

84
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,120
that we should break up.

85
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,280
Ning Shuang.

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,560
Ning Shuang.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,120
Ning Shuang.

88
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,160
See, you have to face what's coming.

89
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,240
Ning Shuang,

90
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,959
what do you mean?

91
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,759
Literally,

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,680
let's break up.

93
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,480
You've always been like this,
haven't you?

94
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,240
You want to break up
when you're tired of it.

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,120
Didn't I tell you long ago?

96
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,879
I only like fishing.

97
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,560
I don't like dating.

98
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,120
You are my fish.

99
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,040
But I have always been serious
about you.

100
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Xiaofa,

101
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,680
people can't be in a relationship
just by being serious.

102
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Yes.

103
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,959
I've received my acceptance letter.

104
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,800
I can postpone going for one year.

105
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,360
If you don't like it, I...

106
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
I can choose not to go.

107
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,399
I...

108
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,199
I did post some random stuff online.

109
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:22,959
But

110
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,160
my academic

111
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
performance is good.

112
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,079
I can find a very good job.

113
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,199
I can give you everything.

114
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,800
Everything you want.

115
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,879
I can make money.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,759
- Chen Xiaofa.
- Whatever you want to do,

117
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,680
I can take you.

118
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,600
Xiaofa,

119
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,279
can you marry me right now?

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,199
Can you marry me now?

121
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,560
I have a tumor in my belly.

122
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,040
I have to have my uterus removed.

123
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,839
In this case,

124
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,319
can you still marry me?

125
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,560
I

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
can consider it.

127
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,560
You can't consider it.

128
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,240
Even if you impulsively

129
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,319
agree,

130
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
in another

131
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,279
five, ten, twenty years,

132
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,360
are you sure you won't regret it?

133
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,120
You are still young.

134
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,720
Xiaofa,

135
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,319
you would consider it.

136
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,519
I'm already very touched.

137
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,920
Let's pretend

138
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,879
we never dated.

139
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,439
Ning Shuang,

140
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,879
we can face everything together.

141
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Can we not break up?

142
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
Don't break up with me.

143
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,759
You'd better leave now.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm annoyed with you.

145
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,959
You better go now.

146
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,160
You are not

147
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,519
in my future plans.

148
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,040
Okay.

149
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,720
I see.

150
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,680
Take care.

151
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,399
(Last time,)

152
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,039
(we did that.)

153
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,919
(I should be responsible for you.)

154
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
(Ning Shuang,)

155
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,039
(I love you.)

156
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,919
I want the whole world to know

157
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
Ning Shuang is my girlfriend.

158
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,600
(Ning Shuang,)

159
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,639
(can we not break up?)

160
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,360
You really are quite cruel.

161
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,960
Being cruel now is for his own good.

162
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,440
Yali, you go back first.

163
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,399
I'm quite tired.
I want to be alone for a while.

164
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,080
Accompany me to do

165
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,039
another checkup in a couple of days.

166
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,840
Bye-bye.

167
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,639
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

168
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,279
I'm leaving.

169
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,080
Take care.

170
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,440
It's you.

171
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,840
Ms. Ada handled
this PR crisis beautifully.

172
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,559
I'm impressed. That's why I'm here.

173
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,639
With you two working together,
Jiang's Group

174
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,960
will make great progress.

175
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,039
From now on, we'll be colleagues,
Mr. Jiang.

176
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,759
You framed Liu Yali.

177
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,799
How would I frame Yali?

178
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,720
You know well

179
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,559
I have a crush on her.

180
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,879
Jiang Lu, are you crazy?

181
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
- Mr. Jiang
- Jiang Lu,

182
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,799
let me tell you,

183
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,559
Liu Yali told me
what to mix with Luna Bianco

184
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,159
to create a problem.

185
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:18,960
That's not true.

186
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,320
Don't go crazy, Jiang Lu.

187
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,559
What he said is all true.

188
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,159
Liu Yali asked me for a sum of money.

189
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,360
Believe it or not.

190
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:30,440
If you don't,

191
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,720
you can go ask her yourself.

192
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,120
You pulled the strings.

193
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,320
Yes.

194
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,600
You were claiming
it was for Jiang Lu's sake,

195
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,720
yet you pushed him into the fire pit.

196
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:56,600
The stock price rose.

197
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,240
Lin Siqiao joined in.

198
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,240
Jiang's Group
has been revived overnight.

199
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,399
In this drama,

200
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,679
you are the only one who is out.

201
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,519
You don't truly love Jiang Lu.

202
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,600
It's more than just love.

203
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:15,960
For his sake,

204
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,039
for the Jiang's Group,

205
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,679
I can risk my life.

206
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,320
Love is the most fragile
and easily lost thing.

207
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,120
As long as Jiang's Group needs me,

208
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,799
Jiang Lu cannot do without me.

209
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,120
It lasts longer than love

210
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,279
and is more reliable.

211
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,519
Having been the backup for 20 years,

212
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,960
are you content?

213
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,559
Liu Yali,

214
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,919
what do you think you are?

215
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,639
I don't care what you think of me.

216
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,200
I can bankrupt Jiang's Group
anytime, anywhere

217
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,320
and can bring it back to life overnight.

218
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Can you?

219
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,480
When Jiang Lu is in danger,

220
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,559
I can solve all problems for him.

221
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,200
What about you?

222
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,399
Resignation

223
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,080
was the only thing you can do.

224
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,639
Although it's cliche,

225
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,120
take the money and go.

226
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,080
It's good for all.

227
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,320
For the person responsible
for the project,

228
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,519
what actions will be taken?

229
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,159
The person in charge

230
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,360
has been suspended.

231
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,480
We will do an internal review

232
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,559
to avoid such incidents

233
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,559
from happening again.

234
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,799
Is the person in charge of the project

235
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,679
your current girlfriend?

236
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:39,840
Sorry.

237
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
Personal issue.

238
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,759
I won't answer.

239
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,399
Miss Liu is just Mr. Jiang's assistant,

240
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,480
not his girlfriend.

241
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,919
The follow-up supervision issue
you just mentioned

242
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,960
is also what we are concerned about.
