=Episode 17=

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,679
Here.

4
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,560
Morning.

5
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,439
Shuang.

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,799
You two...

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,759
Good morning.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,640
Liu Yali.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,439
Come here, what's going on?

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,679
Go ahead.

11
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,719
What's with the creepy smile?

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,200
What's up with you two?

13
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,200
Now, I'm

14
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,519
no longer like you.

15
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,719
Show some respect.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,400
What are you now?

17
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,560
I am now

18
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,319
Liu Yali's boyfriend.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,439
You've learned quickly
from a low starting point

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,959
I am now officially in love.

21
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,920
Jiang Lu has finally come to his senses.

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,200
Still not as good as your Xiaofa.

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,000
Chen Xiaofa.

24
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,400
What, my dear?

25
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,640
I am thinking that tonight is

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,040
the debut of Flower Moon Night.

27
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,879
We have got to do it right.

28
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,439
And after the event,

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,719
take me to the hospital.

30
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,040
I haven't had my period for two months.

31
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,280
I might be pregnant.

32
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,280
What in the world are you doing?

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,920
You didn't tell him about this?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,200
It would cause too big a fuss.

35
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,319
Yali.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
Please at least don't tell him now.

37
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,800
Okay then.

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,680
Alright.

39
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,520
If you are pregnant,

40
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,960
you must come clean with him.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,960
Do you hear me?

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,879
Let's get the party started.

43
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,272
(Flower Moon Night)
Okay. Coming.

44
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,199
Xiaofa.

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,000
Put it there.

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,280
Be careful.

47
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,240
Put the flowers there.

48
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,106
(Flower Moon Night)

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,400
Shuang.

50
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,800
What do you think?

51
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,400
Why is this one deflated?

52
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,680
Which one?

53
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,560
Xiaofa.

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,840
Finally I found you.

55
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,039
You are...

56
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,240
XiaofaMeow from the group.

57
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,560
So this is the Shuang
you talk about all the time.

58
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,639
She looks

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,319
even older than the photo.

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,919
What did I say?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,360
No one is allowed to disrespect Shuang.

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
Or what?

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,840
Unfollow and leave the group.

64
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,199
It's okay, sweetheart.

65
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
Sit down, let me buy you a drink.

66
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
Shuang,

68
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,599
I'm not old enough to drink.

69
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,439
But

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,759
I've got admitted into Xiaofa's college.

71
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,439
QS Top 50.

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,000
It's just that I'll be an undergraduate,

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,919
while Xiaofa is studying for his PhD.

74
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,319
I came here today

75
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,560
to tell Xiaofa the good news.

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,599
Later this year,

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,680
we'll be studying at the same school.

78
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,319
Stop talking.

79
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,680
This is where I work.

80
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,560
You should go now.

81
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm not leaving.

82
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,439
Xiaofa, you said

83
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
as long as I study hard,

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,120
and get into your college,

85
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
you'd take my confession seriously.

86
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,919
Sweetheart.

87
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,680
You're so cute.

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,479
Come, I'll buy you a glass of milk.

89
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,919
Don't worry.

90
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,839
I'm not Xiaofa's girlfriend.

91
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,279
Xiaofa is in trouble.

92
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,399
You are in big trouble.

93
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:35,519
(Welcome to the Flower Moon Night)

94
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,399
Shuang.

95
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,399
Welcome.

96
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,160
Party of five.

97
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,199
Get us a big table.

98
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,560
Come, follow me in.

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,160
Over here.

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,519
Come inside please.

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,040
- Okay, thanks.
- Come in.

102
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,104
(Welcome)

103
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,120
Shuang.

104
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,040
Come.

105
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,480
Are you Lu?

106
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,720
It's been years. You've grown up.

107
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,160
This is my girlfriend,

108
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,639
Yali.

109
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:19,959
Nice to meet you.

110
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,000
Lu, we lived right across
from your mother's bar.

111
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,240
After we got off work,

112
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,800
it always made us feel better
to drink at your mom's bar.

113
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,199
Your uncle and I

114
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,720
met each other in that bar.

115
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,079
What a pity.

116
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,920
If your mother knew

117
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
that you're dating this beauty,

118
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,439
she would be so happy.

119
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,040
So, you see,

120
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,319
we've been trying all along

121
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,920
to recreate the Flower Moon Night.

122
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,879
And we hope the legacy of Lu's mom

123
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,439
will be known to more people.

124
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,759
This is our latest sample.

125
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,079
- Here.
- Give it a try.

126
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,439
See if there's any difference
from before.

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,800
Okay.

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,240
Taste, fragrance and texture.

129
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,560
All similar to what your mom

130
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,199
used to make.

131
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,439
It's true.

132
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,839
Almost identical.

133
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,480
But your mother's Flower Moon Night

134
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,879
possessed a peculiar trait.

135
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,680
What?

136
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,920
The drink Qingqing made

137
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,839
tasted a little stinging
for some reason.

138
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,160
Stinging?

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,959
A little stinging?

140
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,399
That's what makes it special.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,079
Once it reached the stomach,

142
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,240
you'd feel a mild burning sensation

143
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,079
from inside your mouth

144
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,759
to the throat.

145
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,560
But nothing to do with its ABV.

146
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
So it

147
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,240
was not caused by the alcohol.

148
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,199
Right.

149
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,240
It seems then

150
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,879
we have still yet to find

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,839
the key element.

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,079
It's already quite good.

153
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,079
Your mother's bar

154
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,920
brought us so many wonderful memories.

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,160
Everyone said that

156
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,680
drinking Flower Moon Night

157
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,079
would bring destined lovers together.

158
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,759
Your aunt and I are the best example.

159
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,480
What about my mom and dad?

160
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,279
Were they happy back then?

161
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,560
Incredibly happy.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,480
Just like you two.

163
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
Old man,

164
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,399
we should leave after this drink.

165
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,759
Can't stay up late at our age.

166
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,639
We're out of here.

167
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,839
Thank you so much.

168
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,560
You've been a great inspiration.

169
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,720
You're welcome.

170
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,759
Good luck.

171
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,399
Okay.

172
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,199
Bye.

173
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,000
Take care.

174
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,920
Take care.

175
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,040
What are you thinking about?

176
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,639
I'm thinking

177
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,120
if my mom knew

178
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,160
that my dad went to such great lengths,

179
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,040
just for the recipe of her drink,

180
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,160
how sad she would be.

181
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,439
At least the feelings
at that time were real.

182
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,160
You said

183
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,639
Liu Yali would definitely
fall in love with you again.

184
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,039
What did you say, Ms. Ada?

185
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,639
You said

186
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,759
Liu Yali would definitely
fall for you again.

187
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,360
I really thought so at the time.

188
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,159
Unexpectedly,

189
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,440
she has grown up.

190
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,039
So you mean,

191
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,639
not only did you not
disprove their fake relationship,

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
but they are actually together now?

193
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,919
Yes.

194
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,679
Since you didn't finish your task,

195
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,559
I don't think I can

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
keep my promise, too. Mr. Lin.

197
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,559
If my family

198
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,320
loses this order,

199
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,080
we might have to declare bankruptcy.

200
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
Ms. Ada, you must give me
another chance.

201
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,639
I hope your proposal this time
will interest me.

202
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,120
Listen, they made Luna Bianco before...

203
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,480
Shuang.

204
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,519
What's up?

205
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,399
I...

206
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,120
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,480
Why are you apologizing to me?

208
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,159
I didn't tell you about
going abroad because

209
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,799
I hadn't decided.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,879
You don't have to
tell me about your future.

211
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,240
It's not like we're dating.

212
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,440
Don't get the wrong idea.

213
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,519
But I've included you in my future.

214
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,279
Isn't XiaofaMeow too?

215
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,159
No.

216
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,120
That was just for promoting
Flower Moon Night.

217
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,399
I posted it in the group.

218
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,039
But

219
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,240
- I didn't...
- Stop it.

220
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,799
Everything you say sounds childish.

221
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,639
Do you really think so?

222
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,759
Yes.

223
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,039
Fine.

224
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm childish.

225
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,919
Go get him, go.

226
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,679
It's okay, Yali.

227
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't forget our plan tomorrow.

228
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,000
Right, I haven't asked you yet.

229
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,519
What's up with you and Jiang Lu?

230
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,240
Will you be my girlfriend?

231
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,639
I...

232
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
I'll think about it.

233
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,320
