=Drunk to Love You=

2
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,704
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,719
Do you always

4
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,119
talk nonsense after getting drunk?

5
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,159
You know well

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,439
what happens when I drink.

7
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
I've already told you.

8
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,359
You must protect me.

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,840
How can you blame me?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,240
Who else should I blame?

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,960
Why did you tell

12
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,399
your dad that I'm your girlfriend?

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,719
Now we're in big trouble.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,159
Why did add liquor to the flowers?

15
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,799
What a great idea.

16
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,039
I don't care.

17
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,159
Today, you have to get out of here.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,840
And then,

19
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,359
go explain it to your dad yourself.

20
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,000
No.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,359
My dad has picked you.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,439
If we get exposed now,

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,560
I'll be kicked out.

24
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,159
I have important things to do.

25
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,840
Who is it?

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,959
It's me, Ada.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ada?

28
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,200
Do you need something?

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,400
I was assigned
to come check on you guys.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,280
The apartment Lu rented before

31
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,760
has already been vacated.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,560
So I'm on my way to your place.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,599
(She came so quickly.)

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,760
You have to help me.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,319
Why should I?

36
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,000
Then give me back my money.

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,719
Ms. Ada.

38
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you.

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,959
Hi.

40
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,120
Come here, baby.

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,919
I haven't had the chance to ask

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,840
how the two of you got together.

43
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,120
Back in the States,

44
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,479
I saw the proposal submitted by Yali.

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,159
I was impressed then.

46
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,879
When I saw her in the company,

47
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,240
it was love at first sight.

48
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,439
She made me work for it.

49
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,400
Right, Yali?

50
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,719
I just came to confirm
on behalf of Uncle.

51
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,280
If the two of you are together,

52
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
everyone will be happy.

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,159
But if you're fooling me around,

54
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,000
I won't have it.

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,992
(Co-rental Agreement)

56
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,280
(So obvious.)

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,599
Does Miss Liu drink at home?

58
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Yes.

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,520
After all, I work for Jiang's Group.

60
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,719
Can Lu drink now?

61
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,840
Of course.

62
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,080
The two of us now just spend our days

63
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,520
in a drunken stupor.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,639
Yali, don't mind him.

65
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,080
Lu has been allergic

66
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,360
to alcohol since he was young.

67
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,199
Now that you are his girlfriend,

68
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,719
you should keep an eye on him.

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400
I'll be leaving now.

70
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,639
Go ahead.

71
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,199
We're getting ready to go to bed.

72
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,960
Going to bed so early?

73
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,479
We start sleeping in the afternoon.

74
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,479
We even share the same pillow.

75
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,680
It's more intimate.

76
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,360
It's just that this bed is a bit narrow.

77
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,280
Come back anytime if you want.

78
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,479
Oh, right.

79
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,599
That cake I brought.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,039
Don't forget to eat it.

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
- Okay.
- Okay.

82
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,919
Good night.

83
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,920
What are you doing?

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,240
We didn't give anything away today.

85
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
Are you so sure about that?

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,279
I think our good days
are coming to an end.

87
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,000
What do you mean?

88
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,639
Does Ada know you can't drink?

89
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,319
Then why did she

90
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,680
bring you a Tiramisu?

91
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,279
Oh, right.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When did Ada find out

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,279
that you can't drink?

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,279
We grew up together.

95
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,639
She was the one

96
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,920
who found out about this.

97
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,720
It's all over.

98
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,439
We've been exposed, totally.

99
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
On the family gathering day,

100
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,959
if it's over for you,

101
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm done for, too.

102
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,680
I'll surely be fired by the company.

103
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,600
I was even moved
by the love story I made up.

104
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,240
How can we be busted?

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,639
Okay.

106
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Here's my question.

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,480
You said you were
impressed by my proposal.

108
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,560
So may I ask,

109
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,879
how many pages were there

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,360
in my proposal?

111
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,439
You said it was love at first sight.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,639
So may I ask,

113
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,319
what was I wearing

114
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,920
on the day you met me?

115
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,680
You said

116
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,079
I made you work for it.

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,600
So may I ask,

118
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,920
how many dates did we go on?

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
What did we do?

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,319
And on which of those dates

121
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,480
did I say yes?

122
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,600
Well…

123
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,959
It's all about detail.

124
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,399
Our story has no details.

125
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,759
So we have to make up

126
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,199
a perfect love story.

127
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,600
Something you can tell fluently

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,959
even when you're drunk.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,120
It must be deeply etched in your genes.

130
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,839
Who could pull off such a lie?

131
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,199
Especially after drinking.

132
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,279
Shuang.

133
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,160
Come on.

134
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,279
- Let's start.
- Okay.

135
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,879
Start what?

136
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,120
Truth game.

137
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,879
Xiaofa.

138
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,399
Among all the girls you know,

139
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,040
who do you like the most?

140
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,000
The one I like the most should be

141
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,759
- Wrong.
- Shuang.

142
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,680
He hesitated.

143
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,759
What's the problem?

144
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,639
Yeah.

145
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,639
Well, Shuang.

146
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,360
Of all the guys you've dated, who's

147
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,199
your favorite?

148
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,399
Babe, are you kidding?

149
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,680
Of course, I love you the most.

150
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,040
To convince others,
you need to believe it first.

151
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,079
When necessary,

152
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,360
use rhetorical questions

153
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
to make the other person

154
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,879
feel guilty for suspecting otherwise.

155
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,399
What if they don't buy it?

156
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,480
Wait, if so,

157
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,240
why would you avoid me?

158
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:47,839
Ignore me?

159
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,079
Because I love you too much.

160
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,439
Every time I text you,

161
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,079
I delete and revise, revise and delete.

162
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,439
I am afraid of saying too much

163
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,160
and you'd think

164
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,160
I'm a cheap woman.

165
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,199
If I speak too lightly,

166
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,439
it might drive you away.

167
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,879
So I never know

168
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
what to reply to you.

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,199
In fact, when I don't reply,

170
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,240
I miss you the most.

171
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,600
Add details to your lies.

172
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,079
It must contain some truth

173
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,399
to look authentic.

174
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,720
What if

175
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,199
there's a question you hate?

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
Who was that guy last time?

177
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
What do you think?

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,920
I think he's pursuing you.

179
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,319
You said it, not me.

180
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,920
I can't help it if you feel that way.

181
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,680
Toss the question back.

182
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,519
Use some set phrases to change the topic

183
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,680
so that they can't dig further.

184
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,680
Then how can you prove you like me?

185
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,919
You don't need to learn that.

186
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,919
But…

187
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,960
Isn't this just cheesy?

188
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,639
You guys do it all the time.

189
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,279
Are women not allowed to be cheesy?

190
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,399
This is love.

191
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,600
When slightly tipsy,
any act will make you shed tears.

192
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,399
Every guy knows

193
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,759
how to do that.

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Why can't you do it?

195
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
Men

196
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,559
can never say they can't.

197
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,399
Right.

198
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,039
You learn this rather quickly,
don't you?

199
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,759
Alright.

200
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,360
Let's move on to practice.

201
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,120
Of course, it must be paired

202
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,279
with drinking.

203
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,399
Okay.

204
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,399
And now,

205
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,120
just repeat

206
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,360
after me.

207
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,759
Liu Yali.

208
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,360
After meeting you,

209
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,240
I never needed candy again.

210
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,000
Because you are

211
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,919
so sweet.

212
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,440
Didn't you have a cake this afternoon?

213
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,759
It roughly contains

214
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,080
half a pound of sugar.

215
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,240
We are practicing.

216
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,519
Can you pay more attention?

217
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,679
Let's do it again.

218
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,320
The strongest liquor in the world

219
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,759
is our

220
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,759
everlasting love.

221
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,159
No, it's not.

222
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,000
The strongest liquor would be

223
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,799
vodka.

224
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,559
It's 96%...

225
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,639
Fine.

226
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,600
Let's do an easy one.

227
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,320
Just repeat.

228
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,600
You are a parrot, okay?

229
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
Liu Yali is the sexiest,

230
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,519
cutest, and prettiest girl in the world.

231
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,720
You…

232
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,480
Liu Yali

233
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,960
is not the sexiest, cutest,
or prettiest girl in the world.

234
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,759
The words sexy and pretty

235
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,519
have nothing

236
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,759
to do with you in your lifetime.

237
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,799
But…

238
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,720
You can try your best

239
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,279
to work on the cute part.

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,399
The Liu Yali I know

241
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,279
prefers fluffy

242
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,879
cartoon slippers

243
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,519
over high heels.

244
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,000
Normally, she would laugh

245
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,519
at some super boring stuff,

246
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
appearing somewhat silly.

247
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,519
Though she seems a bit carefree,

248
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,879
in fact,

249
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,279
she's quite sensitive.

250
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,399
She is always very stubborn.

251
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,600
And when it comes to unfair matters,

252
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,759
she always tries her best to resist.

253
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,240
Many people

254
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,919
want to stand out as special.

255
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,480
But she's the only one

256
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,080
being clearly special,

257
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,120
yet desperately trying to conceal

258
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,840
her own shine.

259
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,960
But I can always spot her

260
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,840
at a glance in the crowd.

261
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,480
You've learned quite well.

262
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,799
You've applied those tricks
flexibly just now.

263
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,519
Good job.

264
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,039
Come on.

265
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,360
Keep drinking.

266
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,080
What I just said

267
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,559
basically covers all of your strengths.

268
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,039
But the fact that you're not smart

269
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,080
is quite fatal.

270
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,679
Ning Shuang, use his card.

271
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,679
Here's my question.

272
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,039
You said you were
impressed by my proposal.

273
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,000
So may I ask,

274
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,240
how many pages were there

275
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,000
in my proposal?

276
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,672
(Hello, Liu Yali.)

277
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,679
(Marketing Plan)
(Your proposal)

278
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,039
(had 42 pages.)

279
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,639
You said

280
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,519
it was love at first sight.

281
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,559
So may I ask,

282
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,200
what was I wearing

283
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,720
on the day you met me?

284
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,919
(Today is our first encounter.)

285
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,320
(You were wearing a black dress.)

286
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,519
You said

287
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,799
I made you work for it.

288
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,120
So may I ask,

289
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,519
how many dates did we go on?

290
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,600
What did we do?

291
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,440
(However, some questions)

292
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,120
(have no answers yet.)

293
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,639
And on which of those dates

294
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,600
did I say yes?

295
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,200
(We haven't gone on dates yet.)

296
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,399
(You haven't agreed
to be my girlfriend yet.)

297
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,440
(But,)

298
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,200
(I hope all of this will happen.)
