00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,850
=Drunk to Love You=

2
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:40,736
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,600
So the thing you've always
said you needed to do

4
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,520
was for your mom.

5
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,240
Qing.

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,600
I have a proposal.

7
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,600
Why not stay home
and take care of the kids?

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,359
Leave the company matters to me.

9
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,799
Our son is at an age

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,200
when he needs companionship.

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,120
But...

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,079
Trust me.

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,200
Give me the recipe
for Flower Moon Night,

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,359
and I will surely
make a good life for us.

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,920
Trust me, will you?

16
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,719
You registered the patent
in your own name.

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
Why are you so agitated?

18
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,519
You're scaring our son.

19
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,439
Don't cry.

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,400
I need this investment
from Ada's family.

21
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,439
So I had to do it, honey.

22
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,439
Jiang Qifan.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,040
You lied to me.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,159
(I thought I made my family unhappy.)

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,040
(But then I found out)

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,480
that my dad stole my mom's recipe.

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,920
I didn't expect that to happen to you.

28
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,599
But if it were me,

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,040
I probably wouldn't know how to face it.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
Regardless of what adversity we're in,

31
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,879
every day, we wake up to a new day.

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,680
So we should treat each day

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,680
as if it were our last

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,560
and live it vigorously.

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,240
Where did you learn all this crap?

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,080
From you.

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,800
Regardless of what adversity we're in,

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,159
every day, we wake up to a new day.

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,159
So we should treat each day...

40
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,840
I forgot you saw that.

41
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,479
How embarrassing.

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
So you saw my talent
from the very beginning.

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,719
That's why you chose me for R&D.

44
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,599
Otherwise, why do you think I chose you,

45
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
moved into your house,

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,680
and live with you?

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
(So that's why.)

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,560
Okay.

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,840
Then, I'll go through
fire and water for my boss.

50
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,240
(Your boss.)

51
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,479
Once the R&D is successful,

52
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,680
we'll be even.

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,319
By then,

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,759
I'll be free again.

55
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,240
Perhaps by that time,

56
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,520
I might even realize my dream

57
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,599
of opening my own little tavern.

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,120
And it would be called

59
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,080
Drunk Pub.

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
You're so eager to be free again.

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,400
I have a life.

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,439
Right now, every single moment,

63
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,680
I'm working for you.

64
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,199
Only when the debt is paid off,

65
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,639
will I not need to fake a marriage

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,719
or a relationship.

67
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,280
And I can pursue a real romance.

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
Sounds like we have the same goal.

69
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,280
Liu Yali.

70
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Let's work hard together

71
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,599
for Flower Moon Night

72
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,919
and your freedom.

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,720
Legend has it that Flower Moon Night
has a magical effect.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,120
When people truly in love
drink Flower Moon Night,

75
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,439
they will eventually
live happily ever after.

76
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,519
This barrel has aged a bit long,

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,680
and the taste is wrong.

78
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,120
But how?

79
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,560
My dad stole my mom's recipe,

80
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,600
but he didn't master all of it.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,759
However, in that less competitive era,

82
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,800
it was enough for him to make a fortune.

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,839
I see.

84
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,879
(We can definitely do it.)

85
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,879
Spill the beans.

86
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,079
What's going on?

87
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,040
Nothing's going on.

88
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,360
Liu Yali.

89
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,439
Haven't you realized it yourself?

90
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,000
Ever since you met Jiang Lu,

91
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,120
you blush when you drink.

92
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,480
How could that be?

93
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,519
I can hold my liquor very well, okay?

94
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,759
Unless you've fallen for some guy again.

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,240
Impossible.

96
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,680
Have you ever considered

97
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,399
why you care so much
about Jiang Lu's affairs?

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,600
After all, he's just your creditor

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,759
and your boss, that's all.

100
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,519
Yeah.

101
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,920
And now I finally understand

102
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,639
why he approached me.

103
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,639
And he also agreed

104
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,480
that once this matter is over,

105
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,279
my debts will be canceled

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
and I'll be free.

107
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,279
Shouldn't that make you happy?

108
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,680
I am happy.

109
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,160
You'd better be.

110
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
He sees you as an employee.

111
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,519
Don't see him as your boyfriend.

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
After opening hours,

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,920
the equipment is at your disposal.

114
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,600
Are you sure, Shuang?

115
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,319
I love you.

116
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,399
I'm helping you,

117
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,519
not him.

118
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,240
You have to find the answers yourself.

119
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,240
I will.

120
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,279
Alright.

121
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
Stop making faces there.

122
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,600
I agree.

123
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,800
But, Shuang,

124
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,759
there's a small issue.

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,839
We both work at the company
during the day,

126
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,040
and we need someone

127
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,800
to run errands for us.
Buy some materials and such.

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,759
Running errands?

129
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,920
Shuang.

130
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
Look what I brought for you.

131
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,040
What are you doing now?

132
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,360
You said before that you liked fishing.

133
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,079
I'll take you to Jiuyan Bridge to fish.

134
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,959
Chen Xiaofa.

135
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,040
I'm begging you.

136
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,439
I like fishing.

137
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,319
I like fishing.

138
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,360
I like fishing?

139
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,839
Why are you mad?

140
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
Shuang.

141
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,680
Do you not like Jiuyan Bridge?

142
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,399
Then next time I can take you

143
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,199
to the Tonghui River, okay?

144
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,199
Chen Xiaofa.

145
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,839
You seem intelligent

146
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,079
with extraordinary talent.

147
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,040
Now, I'm offering you a part-time job.

148
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,959
Will you take it?

149
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,519
It won't pay much.

150
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,240
So, no.

151
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,120
Let's take a look.

152
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,039
"Baby, slay me."

153
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,360
What?

154
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,159
D-Don't get me wrong.

155
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,080
I only like Shuang.

156
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,279
In that case,

157
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,960
take our part-time job,

158
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
and we'll go fishing.

159
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,279
Deal?

160
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,159
Deal.

161
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,399
I'll take it.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,679
Come on.

163
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
Starting today,

164
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,799
our team of Flower Moon Night

165
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,480
- is officially established.
- Established.

166
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,559
Look.

167
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,519
This is the bait

168
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,720
that needs to be cast.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,919
You've become more tolerant of alcohol.

170
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,279
I really have.

171
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,039
Thanks to your lessons.

172
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,639
(He sees you as an employee.)

173
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,799
(Don't see him as your boyfriend.)

174
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,120
(You have to find the answers yourself.)

175
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,840
Jiang Lu,

176
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,919
So, you came to me

177
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,559
because of my skills.

178
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,440
So, maybe

179
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,559
you don't have

180
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,639
any affection

181
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,679
toward me.

182
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,840
Of course, I do.

183
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,799
(Okay.)

184
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,919
Then, I'll go through
fire and water for my boss.

185
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,799
In a way as a boss to an employee.

186
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,720
(I've actually learned to lie.)

187
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
So,

188
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,159
have you fallen for me?

189
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,159
Of course not.

190
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,600
(Liu Yali.)
