00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,850
=Drunk to Love You=

2
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:40,608
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,320
Mr. Huang should have
captured everything, right?

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,719
I guess so.

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,759
I think you were

6
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:58,759
quite cute when you were

7
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,280
acting crazy today.

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,719
On the contrary, I think

9
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,159
you were more like the drunk one.

10
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,719
No way.

11
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,480
Well done today.

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,599
Of course.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,920
I delivered an
award-winning performance.

14
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,719
Have you fallen for me?

15
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,280
No.

16
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,000
Then...

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
Why are you blushing?

18
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,359
I'm not.

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,879
I...

20
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,039
I...

21
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Where are you going?

22
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,240
To bed.

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,199
Go ahead.

24
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,639
(Have you fallen for me?)

25
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,360
Jiang Lu.

26
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,719
Mr. Jiang.

27
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
What's up?

28
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
I want to brush my teeth.

29
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,160
Come in then.

30
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,720
Did you sleep well?

31
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,040
Continue to play along with me today.

32
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,079
I'm counting on you.

33
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,399
Of course. I'm getting paid.

34
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,600
But there's one
last lesson this afternoon.

35
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,199
What do you need to learn?

36
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,240
As you're well aware,

37
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,759
I've never been in a relationship.

38
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,199
If someone finds out,

39
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,279
I'm done for.

40
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,360
You can't fake something like that.

41
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,079
When two people have that spark of love,

42
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,759
a wonderful vibe naturally emerges.

43
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,360
Do you like every one

44
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,360
of your crushes?

45
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,319
It requires some technique, right?

46
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,279
Fine. You win.

47
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
Watch closely.

48
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,040
First of all,

49
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,839
break the normal social distance.

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,040
Real couples don't walk like you two,

51
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,680
keeping a meter or two apart.

52
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,480
Watch and learn.

53
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,600
Lock it up firm.

54
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,839
(Their acting seems so fake.)

55
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,319
I didn't get to last time,

56
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,439
but I'll give you a proper tour.

57
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,680
Uncle.

58
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,040
You put this photo here.

59
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,920
Yes.

60
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,399
I really like this
early photo of you two.

61
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,480
Yali, look.

62
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,879
Isn't Lu cute when he's young?

63
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,800
(I sense hostility from Ada.)

64
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,560
(By the way,)

65
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,839
what do you usually call him?

66
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Mr. Jiang.

67
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,120
Jiang Lu.

68
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,879
And you?

69
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,439
Just Liu Yali.

70
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,959
I call her baby when we're faking it.

71
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,360
Too fake.

72
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,800
You need to have a set of
exclusive names for yourselves.

73
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,120
This is also a way
of declaring sovereignty.

74
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,879
Letting others know that you have
your own set of secret codes.

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,079
Right, Fafa?

76
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,439
Lulu.

77
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,720
Is this you?

78
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,319
Your Yaya thinks

79
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,879
you're so cute.

80
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,519
(Seriously?)

81
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
People who just got together

82
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,920
inevitably want to kiss and hug.

83
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,639
If you find the act difficult,

84
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,839
this move is a surefire way
to relieve the tension.

85
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,160
Jiang Lu.

86
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,319
You must be proactive.

87
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,680
When necessary, go for a kiss.

88
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,199
Like this.

89
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,240
If you don't dare to do it here,

90
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
wouldn't it be more
difficult at his house?

91
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,680
Use a secret code if necessary.

92
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,800
For example,

93
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,079
Xiaofa, you look so handsome today.

94
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,079
Shuang, you look so pretty today.

95
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:18,800
- Your turn.
- Your turn.

96
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,320
Sorry about that.

97
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,000
You know, I like Yali.

98
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,559
She's really making me nervous.

99
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,080
Are we using that move now?

100
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,840
Yaya, you are so beautiful.

101
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,759
(What are they doing now?)

102
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,039
Come and look.

103
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,320
This is a photo of Lu when he was 18.

104
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you like it?

105
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,440
He's cute, right?

106
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,519
Lulu.

107
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,279
You're so handsome.

108
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,320
Let me see.

109
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,840
Yali.

110
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,840
Don't be nervous.

111
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,360
Just act like you're home.

112
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,919
Relax.

113
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,000
You really got into character.

114
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,840
Lu, try this.

115
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,639
I'd like to hear your comments.

116
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,840
Lulu's uric acid is high.

117
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,639
Sir, may I

118
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,200
try this instead?

119
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,639
Sure, please.

120
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,240
Indeed, it's a renowned Italian wine.

121
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,879
One sip and you can tell it's top-notch.

122
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,799
You're right.

123
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,759
It's all thanks to Ada.

124
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,799
I believe this wine will enhance
the reputation of Jiang's Group

125
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,159
and take it up a notch.

126
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,399
Don't tell me

127
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,480
this is why you got engaged

128
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,799
to the Qin Family.

129
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,480
What do you mean?

130
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,879
What Jiang's Group needs

131
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
is not the high-end,

132
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
but the down-market.

133
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,759
So these are not in my plans.

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,799
Jiang Lu.

135
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
What are you saying?

136
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,399
I want to replicate the original wine
created by my mother.

137
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Flower Moon Night.

138
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
You can't replicate the old antiques.

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,240
This is not an old antique.

140
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,919
It's the life's work of my mother.

141
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,279
It's been so many years,

142
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,639
but you still hate me, don't you?

143
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,519
Great.

144
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,279
I finally understand.

145
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,679
This is why you came back.

146
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,799
Uncle.

147
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,559
You...

148
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,440
You will not succeed.

149
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,320
Qing

150
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,399
was the only genius I have ever seen.

151
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,159
That's why I need to prove it

152
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,240
and return what rightfully
belonged to her.

153
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,039
And the one who inspired me

154
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,120
is Liu Yali.

155
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,799
I couldn't do it alone,

156
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,159
but now with her,

157
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,480
I am certain I can.

158
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,360
Okay.

159
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,240
Prove it with your own strengths.

160
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,919
I would like to see

161
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,120
how far you can go.

162
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,759
Sir.

163
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,399
I believe in Jiang Lu.

164
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,159
What are you doing?

165
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,200
You two need to practice on this.

166
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Get used to it.

167
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,759
And most importantly,

168
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,120
you must make Mr. Jiang believe

169
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,399
that you two are truly dating.

170
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,799
You have a common goal
to accomplish together.

171
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,840
And you are
in each other's future plans.

172
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,799
No practice needed for that.

173
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,440
I've been ready for a long time.
