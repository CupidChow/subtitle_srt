00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,850
=Drunk to Love You=

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,439
(They say half-drunk is
the best time to fall in love.)

3
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,280
(Being just a bit tipsy,)

4
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,439
(one is still sober,)

5
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,320
(whereas being wasted,)

6
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,039
(one feels ambiguous,)

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,039
(unable to distinguish
the true boundary of love.)

8
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,759
(But who would mind?)

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,560
(Happily drinking together)

10
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,400
(is by all means)

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,760
(a passionate romance.)

12
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:54,560
=Episode 1=

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,642
(Drinking Service Charge)

14
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,080
Liu.

15
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,439
Hurry up, we have a dinner party soon.

16
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,400
Mr. Huang,

17
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,439
You know I'm allergic to alcohol.

18
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,840
You're allergic to me,

19
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,240
or to our team?

20
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,159
If I get drunk,

21
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,000
no one will be glad.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,080
Stay and work overtime.

23
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,656
Tomorrow is the new boss's first day.

24
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,704
(Welcome back, Mr. Jiang)
Despite working overtime,

25
00:02:28,704 --> 00:02:29,920
you must be on time tomorrow.

26
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,560
I'll send the photo.

27
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,400
Add it to the PPT.

28
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,120
Okay.

29
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,039
Overtime and drinking.

30
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,560
You'll have to pay me double.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,639
This old man.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,840
Always bullying me.

33
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,479
Liu.

34
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
Big order in room 1999, hurry up.

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
Order accepted.

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,319
(My name is Liu Yali, turning 28.)

37
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,759
(I've been in Jiang's Group
for three years now.)

38
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,879
(I'm always the first to come
and the last to leave.)

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,800
(I have no car, money, or boyfriend.)

40
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,919
(And my boss treats me like a dog.)

41
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,199
(But in my script, I have)

42
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,919
(a secret identity.)

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
(I can say)

44
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,719
(I never get drunk.)

45
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,159
(A cheerful wild horse.)

46
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,560
(Being invisible at work)

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,560
(is my)

48
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,840
(way to survive.)

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,680
What are the plans? Brief me.

50
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,919
You've seen the client.

51
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,240
From the French vineyard.

52
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,080
China distributor.

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,400
I was about to seal the deal

54
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,680
when some rookie dropped in.

55
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,159
A rookie?

56
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,280
He came back to China.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,599
He is quite the smooth talker,

58
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,080
and generous too.

59
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,319
And he never gets drunk.

60
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,360
Never gets drunk?

61
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,520
As long as I'm here,

62
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,319
nobody dares to say that.

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,319
In business, it's better to deal with
acquaintances than strangers, right?

64
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,080
Mr. Chen, long time no see.

65
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,719
Long time no see, indeed.

66
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,439
Why didn't you tell me
he is so handsome?

67
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,240
But don't worry,

68
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,959
I'll knock him out within 3 rounds.

69
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,600
This gentleman here.

70
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,399
You can call him

71
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,160
- what?
- Jackie.

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,959
- Jackie?
- Jackie.

73
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,639
Liu.

74
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,439
Sales rep from Mr. Zhou's company.

75
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
Sorry, I'm late.

76
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,720
I'll take three shots as a punishment.

77
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,920
Great.

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,120
(One, may everything go smoothly.)

79
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,120
(Two, may good things come in pairs.)

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
(Three, may prosperity comes tripled.)

81
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,000
All ceremonies are threefold.

82
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,199
Cheers.

83
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,720
That's Liu.

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
I like her.

85
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,959
Consider the limerick free.

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,439
But if you want more later,
I'll have to charge

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,480
- Sure.
- Mr. Chen.

88
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,439
As we said,

89
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,279
we should

90
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,839
focus on the product itself,

91
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,439
and build a closed loop.

92
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,439
Jackie.

93
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,439
Instead of discussing business
over dinner,

94
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,519
I prefer making friends.

95
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,800
Today's the 18th.

96
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,439
Here are 18 glasses of liquor.

97
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,040
Whoever finishes first

98
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,519
will be my new friend.

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,199
Mr. Chen.

100
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,360
Isn't this a bit too...

101
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,040
Pure grain solid-state fermented liquor.

102
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
It stimulates appetite
and blood circulation,

103
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,600
providing energy.

104
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,199
As it is a stabilizer,

105
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,480
we should drink it first.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,480
(Mr. Chen.)

107
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
(An old hand.)

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,319
(Not a big drinker himself,)

109
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,600
(but quite the expert
in urging others to drink.)

110
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,000
(Jackie.)

111
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,279
(Although there is still
a lack of comparative data,)

112
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,160
(but obviously)

113
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,120
(he's a newbie to such occasions.)

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
(Judging by the stance, however,)

115
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,959
(he seems to know his game.)

116
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,519
(Let's see how long you'll last.)

117
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
(Consider this a free lesson.)

118
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,040
Ms. Liu is a great drinker.

119
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,079
Looks like the competition is still on.

120
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,959
Then,

121
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,160
let's try a new drink.

122
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,680
How about tequila?

123
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,839
Whatever you like.

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,879
However,

125
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,639
I'd like to add some fizz.

126
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,519
(Tequila contains
less alcohol than baijiu)

127
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,920
(but it has a stronger kick.)

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,240
(And this soda contains)

129
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,879
(plenty of carbon dioxide.)

130
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,199
(So adding sparkling water)

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,480
(will speed up
the absorption of alcohol.)

132
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,000
(In simple terms,)

133
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,680
(you get drunk easier.)

134
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,079
(This guy has got something.)

135
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,199
(Though he should feel it
in his kidneys by now.)

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,399
Mr. Jackie.

137
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,680
I'll raise another glass.

138
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,240
Excuse me, everyone.

139
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,000
Excuse me. I'll go move the car.

140
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,800
You can't. You drank wine.

141
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,759
You two go ahead.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,560
I'll get a waiter to accompany him.

143
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,480
Be right back.

144
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,920
Trying to escape?

145
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,759
Mr. Jackie.

146
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,560
I don't think the parking lot
is in this direction.

147
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,120
You're going to the bathroom, right?

148
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,720
If you are, just say so. No Shame.

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,160
Ms. Liu, after you.

150
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,399
Mr. Jackie, after you.

151
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,279
After you.

152
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,079
You.

153
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:28,920
We'll continue.

154
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,480
Haven't taken him out in 3 rounds.

155
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,079
And I'm feeling a bit dizzy?

156
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,120
Mr. Jackie.

157
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,480
Shall we go on?

158
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,680
Enough, no more.

159
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,680
Jackie.

160
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,480
If you failed to make friends today,

161
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,040
your boss wouldn't be very happy.

162
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,399
Does this pill work or not?

163
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,319
Put more in just to be sure.

164
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,800
No problem.

165
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,920
Let's spice things up.

166
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,839
Don't be a slacker later.

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,079
Come on, continue.

168
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,439
Alright.

169
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,879
How about I give up and let her win?

170
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,560
Waiter. Check, please.

171
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,399
Put it on my tab.

172
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,360
Mr. Jackie.

173
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,360
A wise man knows when to retreat.

174
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,360
Now, consider this

175
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,120
a toast of respect.

176
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,879
For us.

177
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
Friendship first.

178
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,919
Competition second.

179
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,559
I'll drink up.

180
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,480
Don't.

181
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,559
Let's go.

182
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,399
Are you alright?

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,080
Why is there

184
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,720
no smell of alcohol on him?

185
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,879
He wasn't drinking wine.

186
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,240
So sneaky.

187
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,679
Water.

188
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,639
Water.

189
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,759
Liu.

190
