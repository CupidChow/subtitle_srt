=Drunk to Love You=

2
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:40,736
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,240
(Where are you?)

4
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,719
You're drinking.

5
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,760
A lot is going on recently.

6
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,760
Take care of yourself.

7
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,920
Missing your girlfriend, huh?

8
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,560
Must be some misunderstanding.

9
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,920
Maybe she has her own difficulties.

10
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,239
But after all,

11
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,640
children who grew up
in that kind of family

12
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,079
are not from the same world as us.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,920
Don't say that.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
I'm stating the facts.

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,159
Hearts are fickle.

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,680
Can't pass the test of interests.

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,840
Lu,

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,480
I am the only one in this world

19
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,959
who can be unconditionally good to you.

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,599
But now I have nothing.

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm sorry about the broken

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,319
engagement.

23
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
No need to apologize.

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,319
As long as you're fine,

25
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,000
whatever I do is worth it.

26
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,719
Thank you.

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,439
You're back.

28
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,879
Such a strong smell of alcohol.

29
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm too tired lately.

30
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,439
I just had a drink casually.

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,680
It's raining outside.

32
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,479
Where did you drink?

33
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,360
After the press conference,

34
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,039
I felt down.

35
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,039
I just had a bit to drink outside.

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,159
When did you start it?

37
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,599
From when did you start

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,120
to lie to me?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,960
It's not what you think.

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,439
You answer me first.

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,159
Since when did you start lying?

42
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,199
From when you asked me

43
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,400
if I had any feelings for you.

44
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,039
So you

45
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,039
don't like me even a bit.

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
Of course, I like you.

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,159
Like a boss would like an employee.

48
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,879
For so long, huh?

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,039
Of the words you said,

50
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,479
which part is true?

51
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,639
Which part is fake?

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
Which words you said are true?

53
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,079
Jiang Lu,

54
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
let me tell you,

55
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,519
Liu Yali told me
what to mix with Luna Bianco

56
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,120
to create a problem.

57
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,000
That's true.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
What he said is all true.

59
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,079
Liu Yali asked me for a sum of money.

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,839
Let me ask you,

61
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,480
Liu Yali,

62
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,839
are you short of money?

63
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,160
I forgot to tell you.

64
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,480
I told Jiang Lu

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,600
you told Lin Siqiao
about the formula defect.

66
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,800
I also said you took my money.

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,920
Do you think he will believe you?

68
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,959
Let's make a bet.

69
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,399
If Jiang Lu asks you about it,

70
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
you can get your money back
from me at any time.

71
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,279
If you are,

72
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,480
please tell me.

73
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,439
I am short of money.

74
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,399
I need a lot of money.

75
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm dating you.

76
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,839
Isn't it because I'm short of money?

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,439
There is a contract between us.

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,879
You wouldn't

79
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,959
really have fallen for me, would you?

80
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,680
Never.

81
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,720
It's all a lie to you.

82
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,800
I just wanted to verify

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,120
whether my illness was cured.

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Look,

85
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,759
I'm fine now.

86
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
I have never liked you.

87
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,439
I love you.

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,600
Which words do you think are true?

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,839
Mr. Jiang,

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,920
let's stop here.

91
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,000
Please get out.

92
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,160
Just throw away the things

93
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,959
I've left here.

94
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm leaving.

95
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,399
(People say things will
remind you of a man.)

96
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,759
(When two people break up,)

97
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,959
(the objects we once shared
become awkward,)

98
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,879
(reminding us of our incompatibility.)

99
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,959
(We've had so many kinds of wine.)

100
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,360
(The strong ones.)

101
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,920
(The mild ones.)

102
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,879
(The sweet ones.)

103
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,600
(The bitter ones.)

104
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,519
(The sour ones.)

105
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,279
(The salty ones.)

106
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,040
(But only those who have cried
and been drunk know)

107
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,600
(love, essentially,)

108
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,639
(is a form of pain.)

109
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,898
(Closed)

110
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,480
You've thought it through?

111
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,559
You are right.

112
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,919
Love is the most fragile
and easily lost thing.

113
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,399
It's far less tangible than money.

114
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,159
Since he suspects
that I took your money,

115
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,639
I might as well really take
some money from you.

116
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,360
After taking the money...

117
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,759
I'll never see him again.

118
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,559
I understand.

119
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,480
Consider this money as a loan from you.

120
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,679
It doesn't matter.

121
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,279
Maybe in a few days,

122
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,759
I'll forget the amount.

123
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,816
(You're finally online.
I've booked the beer game first.)

124
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,159
No way, the store could sell
for so much money?

125
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,759
Not short of money now.

126
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,080
Did you find someone to sign for you?

127
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,559
My parents have been remarried
for so long.

128
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,080
I don't know their phone numbers.

129
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,480
So you really don't plan
on telling Chen Xiaofa?

130
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,279
Hold up.

131
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,360
No matter how down and out I am,

132
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,960
I would never bow down
to an ex-boyfriend.

133
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,600
Besides,

134
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,759
aren't you my family?

135
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,919
You even have the nerve to say that.

136
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,159
After I have the surgery,

137
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,759
no one will want me.

138
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
What are you thinking?

139
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,360
If a man loves you,

140
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,799
he should accept all of you.

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,480
If he hesitates because of this,

142
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,799
it's better off without that man.

143
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,679
You might as well be with me.

144
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,127
(Li, emergency order.)

145
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:36,041
(Usual place tonight.)

146
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,879
Qing.

147
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,759
Uncle Jiang.

148
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,559
Qing,

149
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,919
you're back.

150
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,840
Hurry, I'll take you to see something.

151
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,559
Come with me.

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,440
No, I...

153
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,840
This way, Qing.

154
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,159
Follow me.

155
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,720
Right here.

156
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,159
Come, come take a look.

157
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,679
Uncle, you...

158
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,480
Eat this.

159
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll eat it.

160
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,440
This is the taste.

161
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,440
How nostalgic.

162
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,480
When you drink that wine,

163
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,399
from the mouth
all the way to the throat,

164
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,639
it has a mild

165
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,240
burning sensation.

166
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
This is the taste.

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,399
Add it to the wine.

168
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,679
Drink this.

169
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,720
This...

170
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,320
This is the taste.

171
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,360
This is wine.

172
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,840
Uncle,

173
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,679
why do you clearly know
how Flower Moon Night is made

174
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,440
but have never launched it

175
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,159
and have never told Lu?

176
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,840
You didn't steal Auntie Qing's recipe.

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
This...

178
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,960
This is our shared memory.

179
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,440
No one should even think

180
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,200
of making it.

181
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,440
Our taste.

182
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,200
This is the taste.

183
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,879
Without tasting this flavor,

184
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,720
I wouldn't think of her.

185
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,159
Not thinking of her,

186
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,559
I can pretend she's still here.

187
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,000
Dad.

188
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,039
Dad.

189
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,960
No matter how poor the furniture,

190
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,480
there must be

191
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,960
a bright and warm lamp.
