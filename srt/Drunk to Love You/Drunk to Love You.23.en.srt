2
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,640
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,840
Yali gave me a special task.

4
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,280
She asked me to water
those plants every day.

5
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,280
Stop it.

6
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,320
Dad.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,560
Did you plant these?

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,359
Who told you that?

9
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,600
Was it Qing?

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,039
Where have you hidden my Qing?

11
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,680
She's not coming back.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,200
She wouldn't leave me.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,840
For all these years,

14
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,719
there hasn't been a day
I haven't regretted it.

15
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,760
Not a day has gone by
without missing her.

16
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,879
My Qing.

17
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,159
Qing.

18
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,719
Qing.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,879
This taste

20
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,439
is so nostalgic.

21
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,280
It's the unique fragrance
of Qing's Flower Moon Night.

22
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,319
Excuse me.

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,120
Can you help me

24
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,000
find my Qing?

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,200
Think about it.

26
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,040
She told you about this place.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,640
She must trust you a lot.

28
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,680
Can you?

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,799
Dad.

30
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,359
I will definitely bring her back.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,920
(I've returned your money.)

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,400
(Thank you.)

33
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,000
I am here to resign.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
You said the same thing as her.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,360
What?

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,319
You were the one

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,919
who didn't trust her.

38
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,639
I was only confirming it for her.

39
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,840
You're right.

40
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,759
I am the one to blame.

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,080
So no matter what,

42
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,439
I must make things right.

43
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,639
Jiang Lu.

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,159
If you walk out of that door today,

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,199
you will leave the Jiang's Group.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,319
Are you sure?

47
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,639
I didn't come back to fight with you
for the company.

48
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,479
I came to find out if Jiang Qifan
ever truly loved my mother.

49
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,199
Thanks to her,

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,199
I found the answer.

51
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,319
If she doesn't come,

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,680
I'll go look for her.

53
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,400
If she won't see me,

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,960
I'll wait

55
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,280
for her to change her mind.

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
You can ask me many times,

57
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,080
but my answer will be the same

58
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,240
as that year.

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,599
Because I like you.

60
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,479
I've liked you for a long time.

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
Then listen carefully,

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
I don't love you.

63
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Not before, not now,

64
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,120
and not in the future.

65
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,280
Was that clear?

66
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,560
Ms. Ada, I…

67
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,800
What do you need?

68
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,280
I…

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,240
Be careful.

70
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,639
Boss.

71
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,000
Is this pub up for rent?

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,560
No, no way.

73
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,240
Please.

74
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,000
- No.
- Please.

75
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,800
I mean it. No.

76
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,800
Next week, I can pay you

77
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,000
in double, okay?

78
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,120
Double?

79
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,399
- I need time.
- Thanks.

80
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,519
Come on, have a drink.

81
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,279
Come on in.

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,000
You are…

83
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,600
Where is Liu Yali?

84
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,399
Who is Liu Yali?

85
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,360
Who are you?

86
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,399
We are the new owners here.

87
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,759
This is yours.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,279
Look.

89
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,319
Mine.

90
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
Ning Shuang.

91
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,360
Is your family here?

92
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Me.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
What's your relationship?

94
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,120
I'm her husband.

95
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,439
Are you aware of the risks?

96
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,040
Sign here.

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,759
Okay.

98
00:06:58,304 --> 00:07:00,602
(Chen Xiaofa)

99
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,920
Alright, rest well.

100
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,800
Get ready.

101
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Thank you, Doctor.

102
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,480
Look at you, so smug.

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,199
How can I not be?

104
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,439
I am your husband now, you know.

105
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,839
You are my wife.

106
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm not used

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,680
to the word "wife".

108
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,319
You'll get used to it.

109
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,720
Wife, wife, wife.

110
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,519
However,

111
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm worried about Lu.

112
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,639
It's pointless.

113
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Yali just won't let me tell him.

114
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,240
She threatened to cut ties.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
But it won't help
even if you did tell him.

116
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,439
You don't know
where she is, either, right?

117
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,959
I wonder how she's doing out there.

118
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,000
Alright.

119
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,279
Just rest now. Come on.

120
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,680
Yali is resourceful.

121
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
She can make it anywhere.

122
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,360
Liu Yali.

123
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,199
Where is she?

124
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,639
Yali.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You don't drink anyway.

126
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,279
What's the use of remembering
all these details?

127
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,279
Where are we partying today?

128
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,040
Yali, are you coming?

129
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,240
You go ahead.

130
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,600
I won't disturb your fun.

131
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,639
I'll clean up and close the place.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Okay,

133
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,679
Then we're off.

134
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,000
Bye.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,799
(Shuang,)

136
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,759
(Xiaofa,)

137
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,120
(hope this finds you well.)

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,559
(I am glad to hear
that the surgery went smoothly.)

139
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,919
(I have been in this city
for half a month already.)

140
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,360
(There are many good pubs here.)

141
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,399
(So I don't know)

142
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
(how long I will stay here.)

143
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,559
(The colleagues here
are all very friendly to me.)

144
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,320
(And I've learned new brewing techniques
that I had never heard of before.)

145
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,279
(Every day is very fulfilling.)

146
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,840
(After coming out, I found)

147
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,399
(that the world outside
is so vast and interesting.)

148
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,759
(I feel like I have
missed out on so much.)

149
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,759
(I plan to visit the top pubs
across the country,)

150
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,519
(so I really don't know
when I will be able to return.)

151
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,840
(I wish you all the best.)

152
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,120
(Don't worry.)

153
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,360
Did she not ask about me?

154
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,440
So where exactly is she now?

155
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
Every place she goes,

156
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,080
she sends me a postcard,

157
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,159
but she never leaves
her contact information.

158
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,840
I've also sent her text messages,

159
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,840
but either her phone goes unanswered,

160
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,799
or there's no signal.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,440
Sometimes it's just out of credit.

162
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,080
So I'm out of options.

163
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,559
She says she's safe.

164
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,159
It seems she doesn't want you…

165
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,200
It seems that Yali
doesn't want us to find her.

166
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,240
You rascal.

167
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,840
How dare you pick my chilis?

168
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,679
You're here too.

169
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,240
What's wrong?

170
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,559
You seem restless.

171
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,120
Is it news about Yali?

172
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm kindly offering you advice.

173
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,960
She's touring the motherland,

174
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,480
not contacting anyone.

175
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,399
She says she's looking for
the best craft beer.

176
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,720
It's her style to disappear
after breaking up.

177
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,320
What world's best craft beer?

178
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,200
Whose wine

179
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,399
can compete

180
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,240
with what Qing and I have?

181
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,840
That's right.

182
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,399
How did I miss that?

183
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,799
She wants the best wine

184
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,080
and the top-notch tavern.

185
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,679
I'll just open one for her.

186
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,360
Received.

187
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,600
Thank you for giving me the house.

188
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,919
The extra is a wedding gift for you.

189
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,799
Thank you.

190
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,120
We'll leave now.

191
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,559
Bye-bye.

192
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,399
(I will restore the places with)

193
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,039
(our memories one by one.)

194
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,720
(Waiting for you among the ruins)

195
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,559
(seems to be the only thing
I can do for you.)

196
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,440
(I can wait)

197
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,279
(for those moments
that I made you happy)

198
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,960
(to return.)

199
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,919
Hello.

200
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,360
I'd like to order
a warm lamp for my home.
