=Drunk to Love You=

2
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,586
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,600
(See you at school.)

4
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,239
I'm out.

5
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
(Why going to school so early?)

6
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,280
Chen Xiaofa, aren't you tired?

7
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,319
Not tired at all.

8
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,840
I want to review my lessons
some more, is that okay?

9
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Chen Xiaofa,

10
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,599
combine work and rest.

11
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,240
Don't need to work so hard.

12
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,919
A man over 25

13
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,120
is like a leaf beaten
by the autumn wind.

14
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,520
That's what you said.

15
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,159
I feel that I want to study more.

16
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,520
But don't worry.

17
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,360
I have strong learning abilities.

18
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
There's a phone call.

19
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:24,479
Who is it?

20
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,599
Jiang Lu.

21
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,240
(You haven't arrived yet.)

22
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,599
(I'm waiting for you.)

23
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,759
Xiaofa, hurry up and get dressed.

24
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,199
(Lu,)

25
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,719
(wait for another two hours.)

26
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,759
We're here.

27
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,519
Lu.

28
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,519
It's been 2.5 hours.

29
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,199
Where is Yali?

30
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Gone on a date.

31
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,519
A date?

32
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,680
With whom?

33
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,480
That guy from yesterday?

34
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,360
What's wrong with you?

35
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,360
You didn't stop her.

36
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,759
How dare I stop her?

37
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:06,759
Ning Shuang,

38
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
does Liu Yali like him?

39
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,040
Who is he?

40
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
How did they meet?

41
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,040
(- Drink.
- Drink.)

42
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,199
(Back in school,)

43
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,399
(Liu Yali was famous
for low alcohol tolerance.)

44
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,519
(At the club recruiting dinner,)

45
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,839
(she drank for the first time.)

46
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
Truth or dare, she lost.

47
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,800
Tell the first person you meet
that you like him.

48
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,319
Are you okay?

49
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,199
Senior.

50
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,000
I like you.

51
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,120
Let's go.

52
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
Who's next?

53
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,800
Come, sit.

54
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,399
Told freshmen to drink.

55
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,639
You really are too much.

56
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,120
Apologize to her.

57
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,040
Sorry, Yali.

58
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,920
Sorry.

59
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,480
Sorry, Yali.

60
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,800
What is your name?

61
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:10,040
Which dorm do you live in?

62
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,560
I'll have someone take you back.

63
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,000
No need.

64
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,959
Her name is Liu Yali.

65
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,399
My roommate. I'll take her back.

66
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

67
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,519
Let's eat, everyone.

68
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,639
Lin Siqiao is quite nice.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
You've had a drink?

70
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,360
This was their first meeting.

71
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,279
How were you like that?

72
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,120
You didn't stop her from drinking.

73
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,399
We became friends after that.

74
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,319
Come on, throw.

75
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,000
Nice.

76
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,279
One more.

77
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,680
Nice.

78
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,120
- So accurate.
- Good shot!

79
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,432
So amazing.

80
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:07,584
Please sign for me.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,199
You play really well.

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,439
Yes, senior.

83
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,439
Senior.

84
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
Okay.

85
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,056
Good shot!

86
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:25,800
- Thanks.
- Nice.

87
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:27,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

88
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,120
Haven't exercised in a long time.

89
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
My physical strength is much weaker.

90
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,920
I see you still got it.

91
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,480
When we were in school,

92
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,784
I drank countless bottles of the water
you brought.

93
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,519
I must return the favor today.

94
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,120
You must be mistaken.

95
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,839
I only brought you once

96
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,399
and it was a water bottle.

97
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,720
I've been using it.

98
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,279
I was too ordinary back then.

99
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,160
I thought you wouldn't notice me.

100
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,079
I ask you out today

101
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,000
to clear the air between us.

102
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,879
I've had a tough time over the years.

103
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,360
Yali,

104
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,800
I want to tell you

105
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,480
it wasn't just you
wooing me unilaterally.

106
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,439
On the contrary,

107
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,159
you gave me a lot of strength.

108
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,440
Lin Siqiao was so outstanding,

109
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,480
Has Liu Yali never thought
of confessing to him?

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,720
She didn't do it

111
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,399
just because he was too outstanding.

112
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,440
Can he be as good at studying as I am?

113
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,799
Why weren't the two of them
in a relationship?

114
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,679
Now it still

115
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,440
remains a mystery.

116
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,759
I toast to you once more.

117
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,159
I'll drink for her.

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,440
(Lin Siqiao was blocking the drink
for Yali. We thought)

119
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,759
(he was good at drinking.)

120
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,279
(However, he drank too much himself)

121
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,639
(and talked nonsense to Yali.)

122
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,279
Thank you.

123
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,320
You don't have to thank me.

124
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,759
I did that because

125
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,320
I like you too.

126
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,240
(Oh no.)

127
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,240
(Yali, the silly girl,)

128
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,679
(was into it at once.)

129
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,480
Here.

130
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,519
President.

131
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:38,200
He's using the water bottle I gave him.

132
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,120
Lin Siqiao has announced it.
Check this out.

133
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,679
Just now.

134
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,720
He...

135
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,360
Take a look.

136
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,480
He didn't discuss it with me.

137
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,399
(As a result,)

138
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,799
(the girlfriend Lin Siqiao announced
was Bai Lan.)

139
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,159
- Senior.
- Delicious.

140
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,159
You are dating?

141
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,399
Yes.

142
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,039
Are you here to congratulate us?

143
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,399
Pay attention to the way
you do it next time.

144
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
My girlfriend would be unhappy.

145
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,240
But you told me...

146
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,279
Sorry.

147
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,200
I drank too much last night.

148
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,799
I don't remember anything.

149
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,159
Whatever I said,

150
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,440
please don't take it to heart.

151
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,000
If I have caused you any harm,

152
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
I apologize to you.

153
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,480
Have I not told you before

154
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,440
Lin Siqiao is a scoundrel in disguise?

155
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,639
Only you would
treat him like a treasure.

156
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,159
You...

157
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,799
Do you know what others say about you?

158
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,919
A simp.

159
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,440
Drink, simp.

160
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,320
Don't you love to drink?

161
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,639
The pub is for sale.

162
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,639
Drink your fill.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,440
I'll take over this pub.

164
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,759
Boss,

165
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
can I pay with a credit card?

166
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,440
It has since

167
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,320
become a Rashomon situation.

168
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,759
Eventually, even Liu Yali herself
couldn't be sure

169
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,879
whether Lin Siqiao ever said
he liked her or not.

170
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,440
This became a lingering worry for Yali.

171
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,200
From that day on, she suddenly changed.

172
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,639
A heavy drinker.

173
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,799
I will go find her.

174
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm serious.

175
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,080
Every word I say is serious.

176
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,639
So on the day of the gathering,

177
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,679
I didn't remember it wrong.

178
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,840
No.

179
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,080
Some unexpected things happened later.

180
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,519
Lin Siqiao.

181
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,360
Bai Lan.

182
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,679
I've liked you for a long time.

183
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,279
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,600
I have someone I like.

185
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,799
If you don't agree to me today,

186
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,840
you will definitely pay the price.

187
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,720
(I was in a critical period
for postgraduate application.)

188
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,279
(I was worried that she would
do something radical.)

189
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,360
So you chose to sacrifice me.

190
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,200
Pretending that you never
said that to me.

191
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,720
I'm sorry, Yali.

192
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,279
I have regretted it over the years.

193
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,759
When I got enrolled,

194
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,159
I broke up with Bai Lan.

195
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,960
But you had already left school.

196
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,799
I asked everyone,

197
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,919
but no one could find you.

198
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,759
I heard you were coming
to the club gathering that day.

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,759
I thought

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,720
this might be my only chance
to explain to you.

201
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,320
There's no point in saying this now.

202
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,879
You told me, and now I know.

203
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,240
Thank you.

204
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,360
There is.

205
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,919
Have you thought about why you came?

206
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,639
Yali,

207
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,000
can we start over again?

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,879
No.

209
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,360
This is...

210
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,600
I am her...

211
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,320
Boss.

212
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,919
Mr. Jiang,

213
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,879
are you free today?

214
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,039
Can you accompany me...?

215
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,960
Jiang Lu,

216
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,120
are you free today?

217
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,200
Accompany me to...

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,039
Lulu,

219
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,279
are you free today?

220
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,639
Today you...

221
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,919
(For your silent response,)

222
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,919
(I practiced hundreds of times.)

223
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,039
(To suppress the urge to stop you,)

224
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,840
(I haven't slept all night.)
