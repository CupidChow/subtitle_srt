00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,602
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,439
Mr. Jiang.

4
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,920
This is Tiramisu, right?

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,520
Not for me.

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,479
I'm not on a diet.

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,359
I'll eat it.

8
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,879
I knew it. You were

9
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,000
indeed drinking water.

10
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not drinking this.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,159
I don't like ginger.

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
I added my most expensive liquor

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
to warm you up.

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
Could it be

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,879
he can't drink alcohol?

16
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,519
Due to your good performance,

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,040
I'll give you two days off.

18
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,280
Here.

19
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,719
Cheers.

20
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,639
I'm done for.

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,199
Hurry, hide me.

22
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,000
You're in trouble?

23
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,360
Don't mention it.

24
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,800
That guy is like my nemesis.

25
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,159
I was almost hammered the other day

26
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,120
when I took him to the hotel.

27
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,159
You...

28
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,319
Are you okay?

29
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,960
And then?

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,879
I exhausted every measure.

31
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,520
Let me

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,000
wash my clothes first.

33
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,560
(He was steady as a rock.)

34
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,919
(I got so mad.)

35
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,120
(Just a kiss after
a whole night's effort.)

36
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,199
(The next day,
he even tried to get me committed.)

37
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,639
Well, looks like

38
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,319
you have met your match.

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,840
He rides a broken bicycle every day,

40
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,879
trying to take me home.

41
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,439
I can't even get dates.

42
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,879
Shuang.

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm here to take you home.

44
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,120
Dear Xiaofa, I'm very busy.

45
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,480
Please go back now.

46
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,240
I can wait for you then.

47
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,439
Look.

48
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,319
How can I make you understand?

49
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm into playing games,

50
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,079
not relationships.

51
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you understand?

52
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
Playing games?

53
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,199
He's sitting there again.

54
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,519
What?

55
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,800
Whose box is this?

56
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,399
Yours.

57
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,399
Mine?

58
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,079
What do you want from me?

59
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,519
I want to rent your apartment.

60
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,839
It's closer to work.

61
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
Rent my apartment?

62
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,879
Are you crazy?

63
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,639
Besides, didn't you agree to
give me two days off?

64
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,040
This is spare time for us.

65
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,959
Open the door now.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,079
Move the stuff inside.

67
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Us?

68
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,600
Yes.

69
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,600
I want to order

70
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,160
a lamp with a cozy vibe.

71
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,759
Thank you.

72
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,680
No matter how broken the furniture,

73
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,480
there must be a lamp

74
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,040
that is bright and warm.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,759
Look,

76
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,680
is the room

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,240
cozy this way?

78
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,600
Don't you have a house?

79
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,240
I just came back,

80
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,160
haven't had time to rent a place.

81
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,040
Due to various reasons,

82
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,639
I'm not staying with my dad.

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,439
What does that have to do with me?

84
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,800
Ms. Liu.

85
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,560
Can I eat something first?

86
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,079
Then we'll talk, okay?

87
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,240
Fine.

88
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,399
Then, Mr. Jiang.

89
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,160
You take a rest now.

90
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,639
I'll go out to buy some stuff.

91
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,879
Alright.

92
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,519
Then I'll take a rest first.

93
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
Ms. Liu.

94
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,199
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,720
I was wrong.

96
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,879
I will move out tomorrow.

97
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,560
Can you forgive me?

98
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,519
What do you want?

99
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,319
Mr. Jiang.

100
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,639
- Yali.
- You're home.

101
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,000
- Finally.
- Yeah.

102
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,120
Look, we came by today
to collect interest.

103
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,480
You room was lit.

104
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,399
I knocked and saw

105
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,839
- this drunkard.
- Yeah.

106
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,160
He was mumbling something,

107
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,120
calling here his place.

108
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,600
Tell me.

109
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,279
- But...
- Yeah.

110
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,120
But this is my home.

111
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,199
- What?
- Please.

112
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,120
Can you let go of him first?

113
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,839
He is my boss.

114
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,959
Your boss?

115
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Your boss?

116
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,240
Let go.

117
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,600
I don't get it.

118
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,199
How can you not tell me

119
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,040
that you have a boyfriend now?

120
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,560
Yeah.

121
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,319
No.

122
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,720
You can give me the money later.

123
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,759
This is about your happiness in life.

124
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,439
I must look out for you.

125
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,519
That's right.

126
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,360
We thought

127
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,279
you sold this house and left.

128
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,959
You were worried for your money.

129
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,519
That's right.

130
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,759
She is very poor.

131
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,759
But I have money.

132
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,320
He has money.

133
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,320
The password is six eights.

134
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,279
Thanks for your blessing.

135
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Give it to me.

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,919
Mr. Jiang.

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,440
Hurry up.

138
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,240
Wait for me.

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,120
All this money your dad owed us
has finally been paid off today.

140
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,120
As for interest,
we don't want it anymore.

141
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,480
You don't need to sell the house.

142
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,879
Such a good boyfriend.

143
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,159
- Definitely.
- No.

144
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,799
Yali, good for you.

145
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,840
Finding yourself such a good husband.

146
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,000
So great.

147
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,352
- Great.
- Hurry. Take a look.

148
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:01,960
- Come on.
- Are you alright?

149
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,200
There it is.

150
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,519
No, don't take his money.

151
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll pay off the debt for her.

152
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,159
Just don't come bother us again.

153
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,879
Call me if there's problem.

154
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,360
I am from Jiang's Group...

155
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,720
Come on.

156
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,759
Hurry up.

157
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,240
We need a proof for clearing debts.

158
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,200
Stop filming.

159
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,679
- Get closer, you two.
- Don't move.

160
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,360
A little closer.

161
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,399
Don't.

162
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,759
Be more intimate.

163
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,120
No.

164
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,360
Why isn't it there? Where's the photo?

165
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,360
Take another one.

166
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,559
One more.

167
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,720
So what exactly is
this strange illness you have?

168
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,639
To summarize,

169
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,279
as soon as I consume alcohol,

170
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,679
no matter what others ask me,

171
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,039
I will answer truthfully.

172
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,360
That's why I'm always careful,

173
00:09:47,392 --> 00:09:49,320
and never drink alcohol
when staying outside.

174
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,559
Liu Yali.

175
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,080
From now on,

176
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
you have to keep my secret

177
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,360
as well as protect me.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,320
My family's in the wine industry.

179
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,919
If others find out...

180
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,039
Is this how you treat your new creditor?

181
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,200
I didn't ask you to save me.

182
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,039
I was gonna pay my own debt.

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
I paid your debt,

184
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,080
so you can be fully involved in work,

185
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,000
generating greater value for me
and the company.

186
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,679
To put it bluntly,

187
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,840
from now on, you completely belong to

188
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,519
the Jiang's Group.

189
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,559
Fine.

190
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,240
One who takes favors becomes obligated.

191
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,639
From now on,

192
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,240
I will

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,399
contribute

194
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,960
to Jiang's Group.

195
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,200
But Mr. Jiang, it's getting late now.

196
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,399
You should go back.

197
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,480
Go where?

198
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,200
Isn't this my home?

199
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,600
I paid off your debt.

200
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,799
Let's say you

201
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,919
will not retire until 65.

202
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,679
Still not enough for the debt.

203
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,919
Consider taking my rent.

204
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,960
You're welcome.

205
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,840
You heard it.

206
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,120
My father has been gone
for several years.

207
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,279
Besides the debt,

208
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,360
the only thing he left me

209
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,360
is this apartment.

210
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,519
If you move in here,

211
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,960
then I have to move out.

212
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,279
But I don't have any money now.

213
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,480
Can't you just...

214
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,879
First,

215
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,679
in the spirit
of embracing our differences,

216
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,039
we must respect each other's

217
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,240
habits and privacy.

218
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,240
Acceptable.

219
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,200
Second,

220
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,200
we must not bring dates back home
for the night.

221
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,360
Of course.

222
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,240
Third,

223
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,720
we must not have feelings
for each other.

224
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,360
Any violation will breach the contract.

225
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,600
You're overthinking it.

226
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,720
Fourth,

227
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,879
we mustn't let co-workers

228
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,360
know that we live together.

229
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,360
So, we can't go to work
at the same time.

230
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,519
Liu Yali.

231
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,840
Let's work together happily today.

232
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,120
Sir, Ma'am.

233
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,080
I'm a bit short on cash.

234
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,720
But I've never paid less than

235
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,799
I should each month.

236
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,080
Never a day late.

237
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,919
Even when I didn't have much money,

238
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,360
I still paid you.

239
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,639
(This is our first photo together,)

240
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,600
(symbolizing my audaciously)

241
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,240
(barging into your life.)

242
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,840
(I want you to know me gradually.)

243
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
(Only then)

244
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,879
(can I stay by your side.)
