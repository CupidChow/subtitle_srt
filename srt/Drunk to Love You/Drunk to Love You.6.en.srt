00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,698
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,319
It hurts so much.

4
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,920
This knife is a bit sharp.

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,959
Don't move.

6
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,200
I have no men here.

7
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,480
There's just this knife.

8
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,159
I'm not getting engaged today.

9
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,879
Why all the formality?

10
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,680
What do you know?

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,359
Scenes like engagements

12
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,400
are the easiest for girls
to project themselves into.

13
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,000
The couple on stage

14
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,879
vowing eternal love

15
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,480
and recounting their love story.

16
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,280
That's the only thing
that can make a girl feel included

17
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,599
and make her feel head over heels.

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,560
Alright.

19
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,239
Then let's go.

20
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,360
Didn't we agree not to show up together?

21
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,240
You go ahead. I'll follow soon.

22
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,560
There's no rush.

23
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,479
I'll wait for you.

24
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,240
You received flowers, huh?

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,879
Alright then.

26
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,960
I'll head over first.

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I texted you the address.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,840
Don't forget about it.

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,800
So old-fashioned.

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Still sending big red roses in this age.

31
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,840
This woman is so gullible.

32
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,120
She will be taken advantage of by men.

33
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,479
(Let me see.)

34
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,039
(Who sent her the flowers?)

35
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,800
(Today is another day full of vigor.)

36
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,759
So, your plus one today

37
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,120
is Ms. Liu.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,919
Congratulations to you.

39
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,280
My engagement is
for the winery's resources.

40
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,039
It's for the Jiang's Group.

41
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,719
And it's also for you.

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,280
Jiang Qifan

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,879
may not be grateful to you for this.

44
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,360
You don't have to do anything for me.

45
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,439
Lu,

46
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
today,

47
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,479
as long as you say you don't agree,

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,479
I can cancel the engagement.

49
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,960
To me, you

50
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,800
will always just be family.

51
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,079
(So silly.)

52
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,199
(Still not daring to confess even now.)

53
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,839
(You still have to rely on me.)

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,759
It doesn't matter.

55
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,279
I'll wait for you.

56
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
Today is a big part-time job.

57
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,480
Have a drink.

58
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,519
That shouldn't be too much, right?

59
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,720
This wine is sweet and easy to drink.

60
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,399
With a hint of green grape
and pineapple fruitiness.

61
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,959
It's suitable as an appetizer.

62
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,560
You are indeed
a capable assistant to Lu.

63
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,079
You're good at drinking.

64
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,240
Oh, it's you.

65
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
Where is Jiang Lu?

66
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,399
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,040
I might have an occupational habit.

68
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,800
Though I'm getting engaged,

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,759
I couldn't help

70
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,199
coming forward and checking

71
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,439
the wine provided to the guests.

72
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,519
Not bad.

73
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,120
This wine has a very good taste.

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,279
And...

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,839
You said you were...

76
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,800
Today I'm getting engaged.

77
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,120
No.

78
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,560
Jiang Lu said it was

79
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,040
his sister's engagement.

80
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,600
I am not related by blood to Jiang Lu.

81
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,079
Strictly speaking,

82
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,319
we are not siblings.

83
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,800
My relationship with him

84
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,160
is much more complicated than you think.

85
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
Ms. Ada, long time no see.

86
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,560
Long time no see.

87
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
You look really beautiful today.

88
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,120
I'll show you around.

89
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,120
Okay.

90
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,120
Wine.

91
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,759
Like.

92
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,199
Dislike.

93
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,639
(Liu Yali,)

94
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,759
(from now on...)

95
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,519
Like.

96
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,199
(You have to keep secrets for me)

97
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,279
(and you have to protect me.)

98
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,439
Jiang Lu.

99
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,399
Everyone,

100
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,160
first of all,

101
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,759
I want to thank you for coming.

102
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,639
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

103
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,480
Today,

104
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm very happy to act as a witness

105
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,920
for my daughter, Ada.

106
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,399
The engagement ceremony starts now.

107
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

108
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,600
Hold on.

109
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,519
The first time I saw you,
I didn't really like you.

110
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,800
But I later found

111
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,560
you are quite interesting.

112
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,720
I even developed

113
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,240
an interest in wine because of you.

114
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,800
What Jiang's, what wedding?

115
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,759
They are all utterly boring.

116
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,279
When I met you,

117
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,720
I felt the meaning
of traversing the ocean.

118
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,919
I like...

119
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,504
(You finally said it.)

120
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,240
You...

121
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,279
Sir,

122
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm truly sorry.

123
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,679
This is completely a misunderstanding.

124
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,840
It's okay.

125
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,759
No wonder last time at the company,

126
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,440
he was especially protective of you.

127
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,320
He's just been back for a few days.

128
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
All the matchmaking candidates
were rejected.

129
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,600
It turns out

130
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,960
it was because of you.

131
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,679
You really are his girlfriend?

132
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,320
She is.

133
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,120
You nuts?

134
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,799
Everything with her is for the best.

135
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,799
Be it love or career,

136
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,279
I just want to go at my own pace.

137
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,159
Well, that's good.

138
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,080
In a couple of days,

139
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,440
we will have a meal at home.

140
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,399
I just so happen
to have something to announce.

141
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,080
Uncle.

142
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,240
Ada,

143
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,840
take me back, please.

144
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,320
