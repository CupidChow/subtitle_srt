00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:40,555
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,240
You asleep?

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,799
You really fell asleep?

5
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,200
Then sleep tight.

6
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,479
I'm going to take a shower.

7
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,719
What are you doing?

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,040
You, why are you sweating so much?

9
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,560
I can't sleep here.

10
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,239
Come on.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,879
Let's go home.

12
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,519
Yali.

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,480
Sorry, Siqiao.

14
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,000
I had a family emergency.

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,159
So, I took a taxi.

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,000
You just washed your car, right?

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,479
Yes, that's right.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,560
It's okay.

19
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,319
Just go home.

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,080
I'll take a rain check.

21
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,039
Okay.

22
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,479
Let's go.

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,639
Wait.

24
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,840
Awake?

25
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,520
You were awesome yesterday.

26
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,479
Can we start over?

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,479
No.

28
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
Who is he?

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,360
I'm her...

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,080
Boss.

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Yesterday.

32
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,639
I didn't cause you trouble, did I?

33
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,479
Yes, you did.

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,199
I carried you, a man over 50kg,
home alone.

35
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,680
Does that count as trouble?

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,240
I only did it because of

37
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,280
that annoying schoolmate of yours.

38
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,240
What's the situation with you two?

39
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,120
What did he say to you at school?

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,479
Nothing in particular.

41
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,039
He just said he likes me.

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,000
What?

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,439
No wonder Ning Shuang calls you a simp.

44
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,439
What do you think he sees in you?

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,479
He is just making a fool of you.

46
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,280
Do you even know him?

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,680
And how well do you know me?

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,680
He gives off a pretentious vibe,

49
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,759
all flashy.

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,080
Guy's definitely unreliable.

51
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,520
As for you,

52
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,759
I know you well enough.

53
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,312
Your biggest problem is

54
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,800
you're too gullible.

55
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Whenever you meet a man,

56
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,719
you get played around.

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
So in your opinion,

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,360
no one would truly like me.

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,240
If someone expresses that feeling,

60
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,520
they must be after something.

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,000
That I don't deserve to be loved.

62
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
Is that so?

63
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,319
Where did you get that from?

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,839
I meant you can't trust Lin Siqiao.

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,959
I can't trust him?

66
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,959
Can I trust you then?

67
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,879
Shuang.

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,920
You are so beautiful today.

69
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sleepy.

70
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,680
It's too early for this.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,560
Once a man turns 25,

72
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,360
certain needs start to go berserk.

73
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,120
Yali, you came just in time.

74
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,279
We have this prototype for a new beer.

75
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,000
Go get it now.

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,560
Right.

77
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,720
Shuang and I plan to throw
a Flower Moon Night party,

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,319
inviting all our regulars
for wine-tasting,

79
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,639
gathering clues.

80
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,959
Come on, try it.

81
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:17,959
Okay.

82
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,720
How is it?

83
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,360
Not bad.

84
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,800
This is an upgraded version
of the last one.

85
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,800
But the taste is still a little bland.

86
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,399
Maybe we are missing a certain

87
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,079
special ingredient.

88
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,800
Then

89
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,680
I'll call Lu over to discuss it.

90
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,920
Don't call him.

91
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm leaving soon.

92
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,399
What's wrong?

93
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,240
You had a fight?

94
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,920
Then I'll go pick up Lu at his place.

95
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,160
Go, go, go.

96
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:57,839
I'm going.

97
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,480
Tell me.

98
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,959
Did he upset you again?

99
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,639
I just don't understand.

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,240
He was the one who said
he had no feelings for me.

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,480
I thought my relapse
was because of Lin Siqiao.

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,319
But after he confessed to me,

103
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,839
I felt a sense of relief.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,639
Instead, seeing Jiang Lu, I...

105
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,399
I told you a long time ago

106
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,839
that you need to
look inside for answers.

107
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,639
I didn't want to bring in any help,

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,040
but there's something you should know.

109
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,879
It was probably after the class reunion.

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Bai Lan must have
stumbled upon this channel.

111
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
So, she started sending you
WeChat messages.

112
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
What did she do that?

113
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,560
You see.

114
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,079
She said she was getting married

115
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,600
and wanted you to be her bridesmaid
to drink on her behalf.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,279
I didn't think you'd respond.

117
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,439
So I didn't either.

118
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,839
But,

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,839
how come Lin Siqiao had no
interaction with her?

120
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,680
Exactly.

121
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,839
So,

122
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,319
the story Lin Siqiao told you

123
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,920
does have many loopholes.

124
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,560
Why don't you take this opportunity
to meet Bai Lan?

125
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,920
It might be a way to solve the puzzle.

126
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,560
If you guys really had
a misunderstanding back then,

127
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,120
it's still not too late to make amends.

128
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,959
Where are you?

129
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,920
Yali is here.

130
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,279
How do I look?

131
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,480
Beautiful.

132
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,680
Liu Yali.

133
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,079
Do you know

134
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,560
you were the person
I hated the most in college?

135
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,879
You hated me?

136
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,800
Then why did you ask me to come today?

137
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,959
Yali, you must have someone
you like now, right?

138
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,879
The reason why
I broke up with Lin Siqiao

139
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,040
was he lied to me about
going to the reunion.

140
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,519
But I know

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,279
he was there to see you.

142
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,639
It was when I saw him with you

143
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
that I finally understood.

144
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,440
The way he looked at you

145
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,960
was always different.

146
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,240
You misunderstood.

147
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,320
Do you remember in college

148
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,639
the announcement he made on Moments?

149
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,399
I made him do it.

150
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,399
Bai Lan.

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,799
I really want to be with you.

152
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,240
Don't you like that junior girl?

153
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,240
You misunderstood.

154
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,799
It has always been you.

155
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,879
Always.

156
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,080
Then why is it that
despite my hints and implications,

157
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,200
you never confessed?

158
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,519
I feel that there's
too great a gap between us.

159
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,519
I'm afraid it's not going anywhere.

160
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,200
It's because of my overthinking

161
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,240
that I've missed out on so much.

162
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,960
But that's not what he told me.

163
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,240
He only chose to be with me

164
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,919
to keep me out of the
postgraduate recommendation.

165
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,919
But the one he loved the most

166
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,960
was you.

167
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,440
Perhaps that's still true.

168
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,000
But not as much as he loves himself.

169
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,600
Why are you telling me all this?

170
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,759
Because I really hated you back then.

171
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,159
But now,

172
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,639
you're the one
I should be most grateful to.

173
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,879
Because you made me see him clearly.

174
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,639
So I didn't sink deeper.

175
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,080
We were supposed to
take wedding photos today.

176
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,440
Lin Siqiao is coming soon.

177
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,879
I feel that he should be
taking those photos

178
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,159
with you.

179
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
It's indeed much better.

180
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,200
Right?

181
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,639
Thanks to Yali's suggestion.

182
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,240
You couldn't taste wine.

183
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,279
It was Yali who drank it over and over,

184
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,720
trying to come up with a formula.

185
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,840
Where is Liu Yali?

186
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,840
Trying wedding dress.

187
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Try what?

188
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,600
Wedding dress. Why are you so surprised?

189
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,399
Has she been charmed
by that refined scoundrel?

190
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,320
He forced so much beer on me yesterday.

191
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,679
You're one to talk.

192
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,679
The way you drank last night.

193
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,960
You were like this,

194
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,840
clutching Yali's hand.

195
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,759
Be careful, careful.

196
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,679
No, no.

197
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,279
Xiao Qi, give me a hand.

198
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm coming.

199
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,360
Pull me.

200
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,279
I couldn't pull you away.

201
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,960
Where is she now?

202
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,080
He's here.

203
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,159
I should go now.

204
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,159
I wish you happy.

205
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:01,960
Hello.

206
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,200
Excuse me, is Liu Yali
trying on a wedding dress here?

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,799
Yali.

208
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:06,559
I...

209
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,360
Yali.

210
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,360
(No, no)

211
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:08,919
Yali.

212
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,399
(I can't let Lin Siqiao see me.)

213
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,399
(What should I do?)

214
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,879
(How can I take wedding photos
with Lin Siqiao?)

215
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,519
No need to try it now.

216
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,679
It's alright, Miss.

217
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,399
Ms. Bai Lan has arranged it for you.

218
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,200
Yali.

219
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,720
Which room are you in?

220
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,200
Bai Lan said you're here.

221
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,519
I came to explain.

222
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,679
Yali.

223
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,720
Hello.

224
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,399
Hello.

225
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,519
Excuse me, is Ms. Liu Yali in there?

226
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,120
Liu Yali.

227
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,240
(Why is Jiang Lu here?)

228
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,240
(Yali, you must have
someone you like now.)

229
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,000
Cherish him.

230
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,840
I was just saying
you can't trust Lin Siqiao.

231
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,679
I can't trust him?

232
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,600
Can I trust you then?

233
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,159
Why are you here?

234
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,480
I could ask you the same thing.

235
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,399
You look absolutely stunning, Miss.

236
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,200
The photos will definitely look great.

237
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,639
Maybe the gentleman
should go change, too.

238
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,000
Which one is it?

239
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,360
- Me.
- Me.

240
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,519
(Did I say too much?)

241
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,600
Actually, I wanted to say out loud

242
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,600
that you can trust me.

243
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,559
But every time I'm sober,

244
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,840
I just can't say it.

245
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,480
And I make you angry.

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,440
I know you like someone else.

247
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,679
So once my task is completed,

248
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,320
you'll be free

249
