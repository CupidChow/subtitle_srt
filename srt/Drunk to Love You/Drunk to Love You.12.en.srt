=Episode 12=

3
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,799
Have you arrived?

4
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,000
Are you okay?

5
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm fine.

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,799
I just ran into an old friend.

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,759
I'll be there shortly.

8
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:02,799
What friend?

9
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,599
Do you need me to accompany you?

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,079
Where are you?

11
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,480
Why is it so windy?

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,560
I'm on the balcony.

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,120
I said it was very windy today.

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,599
Come on, give it a try.

15
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,760
It's fine.

16
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,200
Well...

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,840
I have to go now.

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,159
How much for those shoes?

19
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,120
I'll transfer to you.

20
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,400
Hurry up and go.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,920
Our classmates will be anxious.

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,439
If they don't fit, I can support you.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,519
It's okay.

24
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,560
Shuang,

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
who is this handsome guy?

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
Let me guess.

27
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,120
He's your brother, right?

28
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,840
I'm Shuang's boyfriend.

29
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,919
Has Liu Yali arrived?

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,400
President, why are you late?

31
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,560
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
Yali's heel broke.

33
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,919
I bought her a pair of shoes.

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,759
So we're late.

35
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,759
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

36
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,039
President Lin,

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
you still care so much about Yali.

38
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,280
You can't stop thinking about her?

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,719
Both of you have to
drink a penalty today.

40
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,520
Penalty drink.

41
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,759
Yali couldn't drink
when she was in school.

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
So I'll take the penalty for her.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,719
Please go easy on me, everyone.

44
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,919
Liu Yali, stay alert.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,879
Don't get fooled
by his sugar-coated bullets.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,960
I'm aware.

47
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,240
He is...

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,360
He is my...

49
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,680
He is Chen Xiaofa.

50
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,120
He's Shuang's brother.

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,159
Haven't asked yet.

52
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,039
(Lin Siqiao drank the penalty for Yali.)

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,800
Me?

54
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,439
I resigned from my dad's factory.

55
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,919
Having nothing to do,

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,919
I got a certificate

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,360
and wanted to become a sommelier.

58
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,719
Sommelier.

59
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,120
How about you, Yali?

60
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,840
No news from you in many years.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
What are you doing now?

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,719
I'm just a regular clerk
at a small company.

63
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,080
Nothing special.

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,840
Liu Yali,

65
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,599
you call that a regular clerk?

66
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,240
You're an assistant to the general manager
of a listed company.

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,080
Your future is shining bright.

68
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,599
Confidence, okay?

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,840
Didn't Bai Lan come with you?

70
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,319
- You broke up?
- Right.

71
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,400
What about Bai Lan?

72
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,240
I've been broken up with Bai Lan
for a long time.

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
I haven't dated anyone for a long time.

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,560
I've finished my penalty drinks,
you drink.

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,719
Whose turn?

76
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,439
Quick, drink.

77
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,360
Right, it's your turn.

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,120
Baozi, your turn.

79
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,439
Quick, circle.

80
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,680
Drink.

81
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,879
Okay, come on.

82
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,479
Slow down.

83
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Hold me steady.

84
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,879
Xiaofa.

85
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,879
Let me help you take Shuang back.

86
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:12,120
Okay.

87
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,919
Why should I have the two of you
to escort me?

88
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,160
You have someone
waiting for you at home, okay?

89
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,600
You have to find the answer
in your heart by yourself.

90
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,600
Yali.

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,759
Alright, take her home.

92
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,040
- We'll go first.
- Head home.

93
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
- Bye.
- See you.

94
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,639
- Bye.
- Let's get together again.

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,480
- Bye.
- Bye.

96
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,240
- Bye.
- See you.

97
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,959
Take it easy.

98
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
What about you?

99
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm fine.

100
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,120
Let's walk.

101
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, let's go.

102
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,279
What's wrong?

103
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,480
Unhappy?

104
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,680
It's okay.

105
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,160
It's okay?

106
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,920
You're making it too obvious, honey.

107
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,800
What's wrong?

108
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,680
Why didn't you tell them
I was your boyfriend?

109
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,000
Aren't we two dating?

110
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,759
Tell me what's being in a relationship.

111
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,079
I think at least just now you...

112
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,519
Does this count?

113
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,959
Does this count?

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,079
Anyway, you...

115
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
You didn't tell them just now.

116
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,040
- You didn't...
- Xiaofa,

117
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,399
you are so handsome today.

118
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,959
Ning Shuang.

119
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Xiaofa.

120
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,439
I love you.

121
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,160
I want the whole world to know...

122
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,040
Get down.

123
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,199
Ning Shuang is my girlfriend!

124
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,120
There are people, look.

125
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,560
I want the whole world to know

126
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,519
Ning Shuang is my...

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,720
In the future,

128
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,519
whenever you meet anyone,

129
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,959
you must tell them I am your boyfriend.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
If you don't say it, I will...

131
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,639
- I want the whole world to know
- Stop it.

132
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,879
- Ning Shuang...
- Xiaofa.

133
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,920
Yali,

134
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,480
how have you been these past few years?

135
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,480
What's there to be said?

136
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,800
Just so-so.

137
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,360
I miss you a lot.

138
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
But I haven't seen any updates
from you in these years.

139
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,879
It's what I deserve.

140
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,199
Let's not bring up the past.

141
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:39,673
(Unblock this contact)

142
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,160
After I graduated,

143
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,519
I changed jobs many times.

144
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,199
But I've kept this rabbit

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,399
by my side.

146
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,480
I think every time you drink,
your eyes turn red.

147
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,600
Very much like it.

148
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,959
It's actually quite funny.

149
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,959
Back when we were at school,

150
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,240
I gave you so many gifts.

151
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,360
They were carefully prepared by me.

152
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,920
But it seems like you

153
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,879
had never given me anything.

154
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
Yali, I...

155
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,519
Today is the first time
you gave me a gift.

156
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,720
Thank you.

157
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,399
I really liked you.

158
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
- Ya...
- But that was before.

159
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,600
If possible,

160
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,960
please return that rabbit to me.

161
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,080
I'm joking.

162
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,120
Let's go.

163
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
You bought new shoes?

164
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,080
What's wrong with that?

165
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,080
Shoes can be fixed.

166
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,759
Why buy new ones?

167
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,440
How did you know my shoes were broken?

168
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,080
Chen Xiaofa told me.

169
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,840
He said your senior was there too.

170
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,279
The shoes were bought by him.

171
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
They fit quite well.

172
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,960
No wonder the taste is so poor.

173
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,360
You have good taste

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
with such a lamp.

175
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,039
What's wrong with this lamp?

176
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,360
What are you trying to say?

177
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,200
He doesn't have good intentions.

178
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,679
Just wait.

179
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,879
Senior.

180
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
Tomorrow?

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,399
I should be free
tomorrow during the day.

182
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,799
There is something on in the evening.

183
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, let's meet at school tomorrow.

184
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,879
Good night.

185
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
(Even though surrounded
by so many people,)

186
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,080
(I still can't help but think of you.)

187
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,080
♪You feel like home to me♪

188
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,240
Between us,

189
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,128
