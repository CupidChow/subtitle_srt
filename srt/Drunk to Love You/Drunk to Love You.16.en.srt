3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
To my knowledge,

4
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,920
Yali is single, right?

5
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,840
What do you mean?

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,799
We are living together.

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,399
A perfect match.

8
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,799
Now that you've all changed,
let's start.

9
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,200
May I ask who...?

10
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,120
Yali.

11
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,959
No matter what Bai Lan said.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,959
I can explain.

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,319
I like you.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,519
I'll care for you.

15
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,439
That's my job.

16
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,239
Back off.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,840
Sir, please step aside.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,879
Come.

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,040
I really thought

20
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,359
you were gonna marry that phony.

21
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,519
That can't happen.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,359
As expected, you were drinking.

23
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,640
Without alcohol,
you'd not tell the truth.

24
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,040
Anyway, you can't marry Lin Siqiao.

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,519
On what grounds,

26
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,159
and from what position are you asking?

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
Even if I want to date now,

28
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,079
it's none of your business.

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,719
As per the contract,

30
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,760
I am your boyfriend.

31
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,280
You can't date anyone else now.

32
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,159
Is that right?

33
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,959
Jiang Lu.

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,840
I've had enough of these childish games.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,760
I'm just playing along.

36
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,759
Show your dad the wedding photos.

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,199
He will be very happy.

38
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,439
With me, it's all an act.

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,280
But with him, it's not?

40
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,360
You dare not even tell him your job.

41
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,199
Wearing a wrong dress,

42
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,560
daring not to speak up.

43
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,919
Aren't you sick of this?

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,280
I have no right to intervene.

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,719
If you want to date,

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,800
you have my blessing.

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
I won't disturb you anymore.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
Yali.

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Wanna grab a drink?

50
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,599
Yali.

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,360
I'll leave now.

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

53
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,400
This is Depth Charge with beer.

54
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,520
Mixed like this,

55
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,479
each cup has an alcohol content
of around 50% to 60%.

56
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,039
Yali.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't think I can drink that much.

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,879
It's not for you.

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,439
It's for me.

60
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,639
(The day you were with Bai Lan,)

61
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,960
(I was here,)

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
(drinking with Ning Shuang.)

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,159
(How strange.)

64
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,879
(Since that day,)

65
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,719
(I can never get drunk again.)

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,479
(It's a kind of disease, I think.)

67
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,280
(Whenever I think about it,)

68
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,319
(there's a faint pain in my heart.)

69
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,960
(No matter how much I drink,)

70
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,479
(I can't drown out that pain.)

71
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,319
I...

72
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,319
I thought I started to get drunk again
because of you.

73
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,719
After you came back,

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,919
sometimes I could feel drunk again.

75
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,280
But you see,

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,319
no matter how much I drink,

77
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't get drunk or dizzy.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,879
I know now.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,439
The first time you two were together,

80
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,759
I sensed a different atmosphere.

81
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,680
You've grown up, Yali.

82
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,240
Here's to you.

83
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,920
I hope you can be this brave with him.

84
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,920
At this hour,

85
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,240
she's still not home.

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
What is she doing?

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,560
What's wrong with Lin Siqiao?

88
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,040
Not even walking you home?

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
Are you waiting for me?

90
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,920
Yes.

91
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,160
I've figured it out.

92
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,680
I kept asking you to be

93
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,199
my girlfriend any time I wanted.

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,360
Whenever I saw you with Lin Siqiao,

95
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,360
I was pissed off.

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,399
When you said you never get drunk,

97
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,360
I was also pissed off.

98
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,600

100
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,399
it pissed me off, too.
