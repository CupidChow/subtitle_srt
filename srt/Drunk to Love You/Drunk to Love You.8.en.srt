=Drunk to Love You=

2
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:40,704
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,399
I must be the only candidate
to inherit Jiang's Group.

4
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,560
A person causing trouble after drinking
can't be the heir.

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,039
Ms. Ada.

6
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,719
What do you mean?

7
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,159
Congratulations.

8
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,479
You have a new job.

9
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,439
From today onwards,
you will follow them.

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,159
What they do and what they eat.

11
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,200
Report back to me in detail.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,359
I think they are true love.

13
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,840
Are you saying

14
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,680
that they are really together?

15
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,680
Yes.

16
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,400
They don't seem to be faking it.

17
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,079
(We are true love.)

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,120
(The Liu Yali I know)

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,680
(prefers fluffy)

20
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,599
(cartoon slippers)

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,239
(over high heels.)

22
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,319
(But she's the only one)

23
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,760
(being clearly special)

24
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,439
yet desperately trying
to conceal her own shine.

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
But I can always spot her

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,560
at a glance in the crowd.

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,159
Ms. Liu.

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,759
Do you have plans after work today?

29
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,319
Cheers.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,560
What did you say?

31
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,520
They are drinking?

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,560
Yep.

33
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,080
Quite merrily now.

34
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,919
No way.

35
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,759
What are they drinking?

36
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,919
Whiskey.

37
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,039
Thinking back to the first time we met,

38
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,879
you were actually drinking fake alcohol.

39
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,400
Can we not mention that?

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,360
I thought about it afterward.

41
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,159
There's a good chance
you bribed the waiter

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,479
to switch all the drinks.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,039
But to be honest,

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,479
you were quite convincing that time.

45
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,080
At your dad's home,

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,919
even though you didn't
get drunk just by taking a sip,

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,759
if you can drink less,
try to drink less.

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,719
So I want to teach you
some techniques to avoid drinking.

49
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,199
The first trick.

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
Dump it.

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,599
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,199
The key to this technique lies in

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
dumping it quickly.

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,240
And also, you can make
some mouth-wiping actions

56
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,199
to confuse others.

57
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,400
The second trick.

58
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,719
Spit.

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,719
The color of vodka is like white wine.

60
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,919
I'll use this as a substitute.

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,560
You think I drank it,

62
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,520
but actually, I spat the liquor

63
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,039
all into the cup and onto the towel.

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,919
The key to this technique is

65
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,240
you must use an opaque cup

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,560
so that you can spit the drink inside

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,479
and not be noticed
that the water is increasing.

68
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,000
You can find a suitable opportunity

69
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,919
to empty all the liquid in the cup.

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,800
The third trick,

71
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,599
using defense as the offense.

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,680
After burning the alcohol,

73
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,959
the alcohol concentration
of this drink is greatly reduced.

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,199
But with your tolerance for alcohol,

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,319
you still shouldn't drink too much.

76
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:48,160
Lu.

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,399
(When my mom was gone,)

78
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
(it was also because of rain.)

79
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,279
(She was like you when she was young,)

80
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,720
(a very cheerful person.)

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,600
(But during that time, it seemed like
she became a different person.)

82
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,759
(I think, after all, it was)

83
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,000
(because she loved my father too much.)

84
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
I'm so sorry.

85
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,079
Mom.

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,399
Mom.

87
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,959
(I kept thinking,)

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,360
(if I had stopped her that day)

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,439
(from driving,)

90
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,319
(perhaps)

91
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,839
(she would have stayed for my sake)

92
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,959
(and then the rest
wouldn't have happened.)

93
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,639
Mom.

94
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,800
Mom.

95
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Mom.

96
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,120
Mom, I want my mom.

97
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,399
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,279
Mom.

99
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,759
So in this life,

100
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,279
I may never be able to learn to drive.

101
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,199
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,560
Liu Yali.

103
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,959
It's okay.

104
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,079
If you can't learn to drive,

105
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,319
learning to walk in the rain
is not bad either.
