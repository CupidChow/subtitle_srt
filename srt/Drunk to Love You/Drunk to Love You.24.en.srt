3
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,039
(It is said that the heir to the famous
liquor conglomerate Jiang's Group)

4
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,560
(has fully completed the handover
of the group's affairs)

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,640
(and will hold
engagement banquet today.)

6
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,159
These have less alcohol content.

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,600
Take a look.

8
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,640
I'll take this one.

9
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,719
Okay.

10
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,479
What's wrong?

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,960
- Apologies.
- I'm sorry.

12
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,000
This one.

13
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,159
Alright.

14
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,359
The heir to the Jiang's Group

15
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,159
turns out to be a woman.

16
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,760
No way.

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,000
Why isn't Jiang Lu
in the board of directors?

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,719
Could you please make
two of these for us?

19
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,439
Jiang Lu.

20
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,920
Drunk Pub?

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,719
It's so popular.

22
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,040
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

23
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,519
See what you want.

24
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:58,048
(Booming Business)

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,599
Shuang.

26
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,159
Lu, this drink you've made tastes

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,560
exactly like the Flower Moon Night
your mother made back then.

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,759
Where's that pretty girl from last time?

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
I am waiting for her too.

30
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,919
For this drink,

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,159
she made a special version of it.

32
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,599
Okay then.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,960
We'll come again to taste

34
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,939
the other version.

35
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:22,688
Okay.

36
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,439
- We'll leave now.
- See you.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,439
Good night.

38
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,080
Here are your drinks.

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,919
Thank you.

40
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,960
Do you need anything else?

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,759
No, thank you.

42
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,120
(Liu Yali.)

43
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,000
(Are you seeing this?)

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
(Come back to me.)

45
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,639
Excuse me, how much longer?

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
We're in the city now.

47
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,479
About one more hour.

48
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,960
You just had a ten-hour ride,

49
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,199
yet you're going for a drink?

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,599
Yes, a big drink.

51
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,400
Leaving now, bye.

52
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:14,960
Bye-bye.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Goodbye, Mr. Jiang.

54
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,520
Bye.

55
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,680
Take care, goodbye.

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,400
Another day has passed.

57
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,039
And Yali still hasn't come back.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
It doesn't make sense.

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
She couldn't have missed it, right?

60
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,280
That darn girl, she's making me furious.

61
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,080
Calm down.

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,319
Do you really think she didn't see it?

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,919
Ning Shuang, Xiaofa.

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,319
You should go home.

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
I'll close the store.

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,439
Rest assured.

67
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,280
Jiang Lu.

68
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,120
Yali might really have missed it.

69
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,159
Go home.

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,319
I'll keep you posted.

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,159
Let's go.

72
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,639
Okay, we'll leave then.

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,639
Grab your bag.

74
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,879
(To restore the lamp you shattered,)

75
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,600
(I've worked desperately hard.)

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,720
(But to see you come back,)

77
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,560
(it seems I still need a little luck.)

78
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,759
(Liu Yali.)

79
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,160
(Can the lamp between us)

80
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,879
(be lit again?)

81
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,839
(For the first time, I lack confidence.)

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,360
Jiang Lu.

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,519
Jiang Lu.

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
Jiang Lu, you bad man.

85
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,079
Why didn't you wait for me?

86
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,839
Why would you close the tavern so early?

87
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,720
I knew you would come back.

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,399
Are you out of you mind?

89
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,519
Running a tavern,
what about your family business?

90
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,519
I'm giving it up.

91
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,000
What about the imminent engagement?

92
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,240
That's why I was kicked
out of the house.

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,879
So where are you staying now?

94
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,839
I was cheated by a ruthless landlord

95
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
who took my rent and ran away.

96
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,879
So I opened a tavern,

97
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,040
waiting for her to come back for me.

98
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,720
She is indeed ruthless.

99
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,519
Can you ask her a question for me?

100
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,639
What question?

101
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,040
Ask her,

102
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,160
can she not leave anymore?

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
It's been really hard for me,
trying to find her.

when I got to the tavern,

189
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,039
there was a glass of wine.

190
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,200
Did you put it there?

191
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,279
That's strange.

192
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,320
Why does it taste different
from the Flower Moon Night

193
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,879
I made afterward?

194
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
Probably because

195
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,240
I added

196
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,559
tears.

197
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,559
I see.

198
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,320
Then I swear

199
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,759
this version

200
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,559
won't happen again.

201
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
Can I really trust you?

202
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,240
I am your landlord now.

203
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,320
Let's set three rules.

204
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,200
Firstly,

205
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,519
no sleeping on the couch for me.

206
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,759
Approved.

207
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,840
Sorry.

208
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,480
Secondly,

209
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,440
no male brought home for you.

210
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,039
It depends on your behavior.

211
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,679
Thirdly,

212
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,279
starting from today,

213
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,159
we'll quit drinking.

214
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,879
How do I know

215
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,360
if you are

216
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,840
telling the truth

217
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,000
or not?

218
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,200
I assure you

219
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,000
that from now on,
every word I say to you

220
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,000
will be true.

221
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,840
In that case,

222
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,919
I'll promise

223
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,639
to always

224
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,679
like you.

225
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:39,258
