3
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,840
He's killing me.

4
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,280
The scum who took you to the hotel

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,640
turns out to be your new boss?

6
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,560
And you two almost...

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,960
I don't understand

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,560
how I ended up getting drunk.

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Now I really want to get wasted,

10
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,239
so I can forget this whole mess.

11
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,359
You can't get drunk.

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,760
Just drink my soda pop.

13
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,319
Tell me.

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,640
Could Jiang Lu slip something

15
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,000
in your drink?

16
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,239
A drunken date

17
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,840
only gets hotter.

18
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,359
Cut it out.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,599
I'm allergic to romance.

20
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,280
Besides,

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,120
someone promised
she'd take care of me for life.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,760
Honey,

23
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,640
I do want to take care of you for life,

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,480
but I am a bit busy right now.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,319
The athletic handsome guy there

26
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,200
is absolutely my type.

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,439
I've been staring at him.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't stare. It's too obvious.

29
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,519
He's not underage, is he?

30
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,920
Don't commit a crime.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,920
Rest assured.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,640
I'll definitely check his ID.

33
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,159
I must have him today.

34
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,120
Fake a phone call

35
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,280
and leave me here alone.

36
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,280
Hurry up.

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,760
Hurry up.

38
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,599
Beg me.

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,000
Please, please.

40
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,039
Yes,

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,919
Shuang drank too much.

42
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,360
Get over here now, will you?

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,719
Right, I can't do this alone.

44
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,680
Hurry up.

45
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,960
Hurry up.

46
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,599
Miss, let's get acquainted.

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,639
Back off!

48
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
I'll cripple your other arm as well.

49
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,719
Are you all right?

50
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,199
What's your name?

51
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,080
I...

52
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,560
Ms. Liu, where are you?

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,280
I demand that you
submit the plan within an hour.

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,639
Bad guy. Take this.

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Liu Yali.

56
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,520
What's your problem?

57
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,400
Mr. Jiang.

58
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,960
Why didn't you tell me you're coming?

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,520
Following me like a thief.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,879
Didn't I tell you

61
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,479
to give me the plan before you leave?

62
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,639
I couldn't reach you by phone.

63
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,479
Who knows if you're working
part-time again.

64
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,479
Too hot.

65
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,039
The water pressure is a bit weak.

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,599
It takes a while before it comes out.

67
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,639
Are you alright?

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,639
I'm fine.

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,319
I'll leave your clothes by the door.

70
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,759
Okay.

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,519
This pajama of yours

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,759
certainly suits me well.

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,040
Here,

74
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,519
I've made you some ginger tea.

75
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,720
Drink it.

76
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,040
I'll give you the plan later.

77
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,399
Finish the tea before you leave.

78
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,199
How come it tastes like alcohol?

79
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,720
I'm not drinking this.

80
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,079
I don't like ginger.

81
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,560
So picky.

82
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,639
I added my most expensive liquor

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,759
to warm you up,

84
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,639
only to have my kindness stomped on.

85
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,319
I didn't do it.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,759
My furniture is all shabby.

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,639
Don't worry.

88
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,959
Isn't it too dark here?

89
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,439
I'll turn on the light.

90
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,959
No.

91
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,959
Ms. Liu, how can you

92
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,240
live like this?

93
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,600
Mere commuters like me are

94
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,160
ready to move any time.

95
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,160
When something is broken,

96
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,959
if it can be fixed, never buy a new one.

97
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,279
This is my living condition.

98
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,759
If you can't stand it,

99
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,439
then you can leave.

100
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,399
No, I can't leave today.

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,920
I must

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,560
stay here and watch you finish it.

103
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,399
So bossy.

104
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,279
Are you awake?

105
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,879
The restaurant downstairs is great.

106
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,319
I brought you some.

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,800
I...

108
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,360
Sorry, I...

109
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,959
I fell asleep last night.

110
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll finish the plan now.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,079
I've looked at the plan.

112
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,360
It's not bad.

113
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,480
Come on, eat your breakfast.

114
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,720
(Project Background)

115
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:27,360
(Target Market)

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,839
Isn't this my plan from last year?

117
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,199
We have a meeting later.

118
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,759
Eat fast.

119
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,959
Everyone, please take a sip

120
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,360
and tell me what you think.

121
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,279
Mr. Huang.

122
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,240
Last time you said

123
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,720
this liquor is a mild Baijiu

124
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,600
developed as a by-product.

125
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,839
Not good for drinking on its own.

126
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,519
However, as a base liquor,

127
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,279
it will work differently.

128
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,480
This plan was approved by Ms. Ada.

129
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,480
(Oh no.)

130
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,000
(What is he up to?)

131
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,959
Make the Luna Bianco in small packages,

132
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,256
then collaborate with milk tea
and consumer products,

133
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,759
as a base liquor.

134
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,000
It was proposed by Liu Yali a year ago.

135
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,480
Did you do any follow-up research?

136
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,399
Not only did you not do it,

137
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,120
but you threw it away.

138
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,600
Never mind.

139
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,879
I spent half a year

140
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,279
verifying its feasibility.

141
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,480
Six months ago?

142
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,799
(Marketing Plan of Luna Bianco)
Based on this proposal,

143
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,440
(by Liu Yali)
a small batch was produced

144
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,960
and they sold very well.

145
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,159
Yet strangely,

146
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,000
it was later suspended.

147
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,000
Mr. Huang.

148
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,960
Why do you think that is?

149
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,320
Jiang's Group does not keep freeloaders.

150
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,320
Hand over your work later today.

151
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,639
Go seek another job.

152
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,759
Why?

153
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,600
But this is...

154
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
Mr. Jiang.

155
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,879
Yali.

156
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,600
Speak for me.

157
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,720
No one begs me on his behalf.

158
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,480
You'll get a full compensation.

159
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,960
