00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,850
=Drunk to Love You=

2
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,800
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,759
-Drink.
-Drink.

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,759
I like you.

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,439
I like you too.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,560
You are together now?

7
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,439
Yes.

8
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,280
Yali, are you here to congratulate us?

9
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,520
(Haven't I told you before?)

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,719
(Lin Siqiao is nothing
but a refined rascal.)

11
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,840
(Only you would cherish him.)

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,439
Liu Yali.

13
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,799
You have been cursed
by the god of alcohol.

14
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,680
Because you believed lies
of drunken men.

15
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,719
That is why you ended up like this.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,640
You can never get drunk again.

17
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,719
Unless you meet...

18
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,760
What time is it? Come to work.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,480
Help.

20
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,079
Hi, check out.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,239
Okay, miss.

22
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,719
The total charge is

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,920
2,999 yuan.

24
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,319
Scan QR code or use credit card?

25
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,599
Right.

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,799
The man who brought you here

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,560
left a coat for dry cleaning.

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,920
The fee is 98 yuan.

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,480
That makes the total 3,097 yuan.

30
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,879
Please confirm the bill.

31
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,359
Hello, miss.

32
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,519
Your laundry.

33
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,879
Thank you.

34
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:02,624
(My money, 2,020 yuan.)

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
Shuang.

36
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,560
Help me.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,319
Take care, miss.

38
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,400
What kind of man does that?

39
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:18,039
Drinking fake alcohol,
taking an unconscious girl to hotel.

40
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,080
Not paying for the room

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,199
at a five-star hotel.

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,560
Shuang, I will pay you back
when I get my salary.

43
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,120
But I'm running late now. Have to go.

44
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,080
Wait.

45
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,639
Don't worry. I won't let him

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,599
harm any other girl.

47
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,879
You go to work first.

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,840
I must track down this scum.

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,680
Miss.

50
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,840
Can you do me a favor?

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
(Jiang Lu.)

52
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,360
(You're coming back to get married)

53
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,800
(and to take over the company.)

54
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,719
(I've reached the age of retirement.)

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,360
(I hate to see the company neglected)

56
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,000
(and my son unmarried.)

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
You are late.

58
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,520
Congratulations, Liu.

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,759
Congratulations.

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,919
Congrats on your promotion.

61
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,280
I am nice to you all this time.

62
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,840
Don't forget me when you're rich.

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,080
Applause.

64
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,599
Although I do not know why,

65
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,719
I feel

66
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,840
this is not a good sign.

67
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,800
Liu.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,879
Liu.

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,840
Don't stand here.

70
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,360
Go report to the new boss.

71
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,400
Off you go.

72
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,159
Let's see her off with applause.

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,120
Get going, this way.

74
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,000
Come on.

75
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,719
The new CEO is Jiang Lu,

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
the president's son.

77
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,439
He just returned to the country.

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,120
On his first day as CEO,

79
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,280
he made you his assistant.

80
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,400
I heard that Mr. Jiang
highly appreciated your plan.

81
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,520
I vouched for you strongly.

82
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,480
(Oh my goodness.)

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
The new CEO is Jiang Lu.

84
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,720
On his first day as CEO,

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,360
he made you his assistant.

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,720
Your coffee, sir.

87
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,000
Liu Yali.

88
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,399
(Liu Yali's Resume)
You are allergic to alcohol?

89
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,560
I haven't asked you yet.

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
After I passed out,

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,959
what happened exactly?

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,759
Did you take advantage of me?

93
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,000
Which time?

94
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,040
Is it

95
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,360
the time you came on to me

96
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,600
or the last time?

97
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,680
I...

98
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,000
Between the two of us...

99
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,079
Nothing happened.

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,480
(CEO Jackie)

101
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,560
Liu.

102
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,199
Liu.

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,720
Liu.

104
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,759
Liu...

105
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,879
What...

106
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:34,759
- What are you doing?
- Mr. Zhou.

107
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,000
Stop staring, let's go.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
Mr. Zhou.

109
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,160
I'd like to make a toast.

110
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,720
- Sit down.
- Are you crazy?

111
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,639
If my partner

112
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,959
is a low-life like you,

113
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,720
I'd rather not seal the deal.

114
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,519
Either turn yourselves in

115
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,720
or I will call the police.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,959
Jackie.

117
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,160
You must have too much to drink.

118
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,800
I don't understand.

119
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,519
The liquor on his face is the evidence.

120
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,439
Explain it to the police yourselves.

121
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,240
Then what about my clothes?

122
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,040
What really happened?

123
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,720
Who changed it for me?

124
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,399
Excuse me.

125
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,279
You started undressing
as soon as we were in the room.

126
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,279
Had I not run fast, I...

127
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,120
Let's start over.

128
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,439
My name is Jiang Lu.

129
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,199
Now the CEO of Jiang's Group.

130
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,439
Starting today,

131
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,879
you are officially reassigned
as my assistant.

132
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,199
Your desk is over there.

133
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,439
Also,

134
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,800
starting today,

135
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,160
no more part-time jobs.

136
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,680
I believe your workload
doesn't allow it either.

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,759
Go make another copy of this document.

138
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
And hand it out at the meeting.

139
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,399
Get the cleaning lady here.

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,199
Make me another cup of coffee.

141
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,959
You may leave now.

142
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,319
The fee is 98 yuan.

143
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,839
That makes the total 3,097 yuan.

144
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,439
Please confirm the bill.

145
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,399
Mr. Jiang.

146
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,399
Can I get reimbursed for
room charges last time?

147
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,000
Close the door.

148
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,120
Hi everyone, this is Drunk Pub.

149
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,879
Today I'll teach you

150
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,600
how to mix a Luna Bianco.

151
00:07:58,528 --> 00:07:59,839
(One year ago, overseas)

152
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,040
I don't have many viewers now,

153
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,800
but there are some loyal friends.

154
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,079
I'm very grateful to you.

155
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,079
Currently, I am working
at a big company.

156
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,439
(Before we meet,)

157
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,160
(you've already cured my insomnia.)

158
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,480
(So,)

159
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,839
(are you the one who will heal me?)

160
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,399
We're all here.
No need for introduction.

161
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,519
Let's get started.

162
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,439
Good.

163
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,040
For last quarter,

164
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,439
our market share

165
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,920
reached 75 percent.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
Net profit also increased by 5 percent.

167
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,919
Let's skip the good news.

168
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,879
Which product is holding us back?

169
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,159
Mr. Jiang.

170
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,360
You've just returned.
There's a minor situation

171
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,840
that you might not be aware of.

172
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,600
Our team used to support other teams

173
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,240
in marketing operations.

174
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,759
So the products assigned to us

175
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,320
were not intended for profit.

176
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,039
Whether they're intended for profit

177
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,639
is up to you to decide

178
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,120
or up to me?

179
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,720
Of course, Mr. Jiang has the final say.

180
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,639
Think carefully before you talk.

181
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
I don't have time for nonsense.

182
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,080
This plan was made by Liu.

183
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
We'll have Liu

184
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
give everyone a detailed presentation.

185
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,639
Liu, go ahead.

186
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,159
Come on, introduce it.

187
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,200
After a discussion within the team,

188
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,519
we decided to use

189
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,240
our existing production lines...

190
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,000
Who are they?

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,639
Combing with...

192
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,679
The image is too blurry.

193
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,639
Yes, indeed.

194
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,919
Dear.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,519
How could you get so drunk?

196
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,519
Judging by how the guy is holding you,

197
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,120
you're really unconscious.

198
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,320
As despicable as the guy is,

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,799
he was quite considerate.

200
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
More importantly,

201
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,799
he's really good-looking.

202
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,240
Tall, broad-shouldered,

203
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,879
attractive and well-proportioned.

204
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,399
Let's zoom in on his face.

205
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,399
Expose him.

206
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:58,799
Liu Yali.

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You'll not regret it.

208
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Ms. Liu.

209
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,720
It seems you're still not busy enough.

210
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,440
In that case,

211
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,679
compile the product data

212
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,679
for the past year,

213
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,080
and then, propose a new plan.

214
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,039
Hand it to me tonight.

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,360
Okay.

216
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,200
Meeting adjourned.

217
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

218
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,559
Reimbursement

219
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,639
is impossible.

220
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,159
Mr. Jiang, at 10:10 AM this morning,

221
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,720
you will meet the company's executives.

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,840
Each department will

223
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,159
make their quarterly report.

224
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,200
At 2 PM, you'll meet with suppliers.

225
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,919
Time for Drunk Pub again.

226
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,320
I am your Xiao Li.

227
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,039
Move her desk up here.

228
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,399
Starting today,

229
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,559
she will be my assistant.
