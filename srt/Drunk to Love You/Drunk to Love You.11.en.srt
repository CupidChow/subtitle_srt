=Episode 11=

3
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,680
(She firmly said that she
didn't fall for me.)

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,680
(Yet she's upset now.)

5
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,680
(Fine, so be it.)

6
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,760
(This infuriating honesty of Jiang Lu.)

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,159
(I can no longer be
bewitched by his charms.)

8
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,239
What?

9
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,439
Sober now?

10
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,120
What were you going to say?

11
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,840
Actually...

12
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,400
I like you.

13
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,239
I didn't say anything.

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
If you're sober, let's go home.

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,120
We have to work tomorrow.

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
My legs are weak.

17
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
I can't walk anymore.

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,599
Well, just sleep here.

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm leaving.

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
Why did you

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,479
leave me there alone?

22
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,960
What were you doing?

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,800
I saw the god of alcohol.

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,159
I wanted to ask her

25
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,360
why I'm becoming vulnerable to alcohol.

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,639
I didn't catch up with her.

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,280
Crazy.

28
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,599
Get up.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,120
(You said people who drank
Flower Moon Night together)

30
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,639
(would live happily ever after.)

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,919
(Why is that?)

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,080
(I don't know either.)

33
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,240
(I've never drunk it.)

34
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,800
(Maybe, the process of brewing)

35
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,599
(is the same as love.)

36
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,400
(First,)

37
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,759
(it needs to blend,)

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,039
(just like two different people)

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,560
(getting attracted to each other.)

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,039
(Then there's the boiling.)

41
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,039
(The temperature slowly rises,)

42
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,560
(just like people in love)

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,199
(getting hot-headed.)

44
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,360
Get up!

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,319
(Without realizing it,)

46
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,319
(the heart is already full of bubbles.)

47
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,120
(Then there's filtering
and purification,)

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,280
(leaving the purest and removing)

49
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,759
(the off-flavors.)

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,479
(And finally, flavor enhancement.)

51
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,080
(One ounce more,)

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,520
(and it loses the balance,)

53
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,439
(lacking the depth of aftertaste.)

54
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,639
(Brewing wine is indeed complex.)

55
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,680
(Exactly.)

56
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,960
(Naturally, brewing wine takes time)

57
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,319
(to verify.)

58
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,639
(I didn't expect you to know so much.)

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,360
(There is still much to learn.)

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
(Let's share the current results)

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,599
(with everyone, shall we?)

62
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,000
(Okay.)

63
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:57,312
♪Baby, can you hear me♪

64
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:01,568
♪Radio waves from the fridge
behind my ears♪

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,568
♪Midnight hours
under splendid ceiling lights♪

66
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:08,192
♪Only you and me are here♪

67
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:10,944
♪You and me♪

68
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
This doesn't taste right.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,079
We've never tried it before.

70
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,680
We didn't use the hops right.

71
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,600
We need someone
who has tasted it before.

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
But how do we find them?

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,639
It's so hard to forget

74
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,079
the taste of Flower Moon Night
from 20 years ago.

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,279
Does anyone understand?

76
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,040
Our boss lady said,

77
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,319
old friends can drink for free.

78
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,240
Done.

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,720
Here it comes.

80
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,480
(Secretly taking matching photos.)

81
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,639
What does this TLA mean?

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,839
I've never heard of it.

83
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,839
It means dating someone.

84
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,360
That is to say,

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,439
she wants to date him.

86
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,519
Interesting.

87
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,199
What's wrong with you?

88
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,040
Are you jealous?

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,399
No, I'm not.

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,879
Knock it off.

91
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,759
Don't hit me.

92
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,600
If someone can describe
the taste of Flower Moon Night,

93
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,079
we'll have a clue.

94
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,560
You've worked hard these days.

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,439
The affection I expressed that day

96
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,120
was in a way as a boss to an employee.

97
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,120
Actually,

98
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,759
I didn't mean that either.

99
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,199
Actually...

100
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Is that you?

101
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Alright now.

102
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,439
Don't be dramatic.

103
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,079
It's just a class reunion.

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,199
I think I saw Lin Siqiao yesterday.

105
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,079
Who?

106
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,240
I said I think I saw
Lin Siqiao yesterday.

107
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,560
So you saw him, so what?

108
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,040
I wanted him to be there.

109
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't know

110
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,040
if I really saw him
or if I was hallucinating.

111
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
I get dizzy at the sight of him,

112
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,959
just like now.

113
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,959
Liu Yali.

114
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,240
Don't fall back into your old habits.

115
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,639
I always feel like now
is not a good time to see him.

116
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,399
In my imagination,

117
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,519
when we meet again,

118
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,959
I should be as pretty as Bai Lan,

119
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,519
riding on the crest of my success.

120
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,759
Unlike now,

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
I have no achievements,

122
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,959
only debts.

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,199
Who wouldn't want to see
their ex at their peak?

124
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,560
But let me tell you.

125
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,040
Once a man is over 25,

126
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
he is like a leaf beaten by the wind.

127
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,560
They will get fat, greasy,

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
and bald.

129
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,839
He should be ashamed.

130
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,000
I think I'd better not go.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Go.

132
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
You have to go.

133
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:03,079
I'll go, too.

134
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,839
Go.

135
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:05,519
I'll go too.

136
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
Why are you going?

137
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
I'm your boyfriend.

138
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,480
Of course, I have to go.

139
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
What if you go to the party

140
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,959
and see your...

141
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,959
Right?

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,959
You definitely dated in college.

143
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,399
Chen Xiaofa,

144
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,720
are you getting cocky?

145
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,560
I'm not.

146
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,560
But I'm going.

147
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,199
You...

148
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,240
I will go.

149
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,720
What are you going for?

150
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,959
- I must go.
- No, you're not.

151
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,720
What if you...

152
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,120
What about your...

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,480
You won't let me go.

154
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,639
You want to go alone, right?

155
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,519
(Today is the day. Dress up nicely)

156
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,600
(and slay everyone.)

157
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,799
You're up early.

158
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,519
Are you going out today?

159
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,000
I suddenly had
a bit of inspiration today.

160
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,279
Work overtime.

161
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,200
Boss.

162
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,639
It's the weekend.

163
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,519
Ms. Liu.

164
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,279
It's a critical moment now.

165
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,879
There's no weekend.

166
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,000
Really?

167
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,960
Then I'll take a day off.

168
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Deduct it from my salary.

169
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,080
Do you want me to go?

170
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
I mean,

171
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,399
if you need me.

172
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,759
Nope.

173
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,320
(Latest news.)

174
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,840
(Lin Siqiao will be there.)

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,080
(Liu Yali, go!)

176
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,200
Are you sure?

177
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,039
I'm free today.

178
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,639
If you beg me,

179
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,759
I might think about it.

180
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,879
Didn't you have inspiration?

181
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,519
Just stay at home.

182
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,679
Boss.

183
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,679
Do you still remember that black dress?

184
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,360
What do you think?

185
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,000
It's terribly ugly.

186
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,240
I checked the forecast,

187
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,960
and it would be windy.

188
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,000
You'd better stay inside.

189
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,039
There might even be a sandstorm.

190
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,159
How will you get a taxi?

191
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,600
Really?

192
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,600
How do you walk

193
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,480
without making a sound?

194
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,679
You're quite swift.

195
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,440
How do you like

196
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,720
this outfit?

197
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,399
Not bad.

198
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,279
It's just not very you.

199
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,080
Okay.

200
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,159
This one it is.

201
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,559
I'm off.

202
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
Bye.

203
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,720
Don't wear high heels.

204
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,440
Liu Yali.

205
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,480
(Lin Siqiao: Will you appear suddenly?)

206
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,480
Liu Yali?

207
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,080
Boss.

208
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,000
Do you still remember that black dress?

209
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,879
With my beige high heels?

210
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,440
It's terribly ugly.

211
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,159
(If these shoes would
lead you to someone else,)

212
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,080
(I want to hide them away.)

213
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,279
Then I'll try a new one.

214
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,519
Help me take a look, please.

215
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,399
What are you doing?

216
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm looking at the forecast.

217
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,720
I checked the forecast,

218
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,240
and it would be windy.

219
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,679
Don't wear high heels.

220
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,639
Liu Yali.

221
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,639
(So, maybe)

222
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
you don't have

223
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,200
any affection

224
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,559
toward me.

225
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,440
(I said not a little bit.)

226
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,360
(But it means I like you)

227
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,840
(more than a little.)
