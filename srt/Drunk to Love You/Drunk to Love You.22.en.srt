Is that so?

5
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,280
I'll just leave you here.

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,519
Good night.

7
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,079
I'll leave now.

8
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,680
You can't go.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,359
You still haven't answered my question.

Check out.

31
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,960
That girl who came with me yesterday,

32
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,199
when did she leave?

33
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,719
Did the lady leave something behind?

34
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,120
I'll make a note of it for you.

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,759
She left me behind.

36
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
You two talk it out.

37
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,719
I'll go settle the payment.

38
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,079
Chen Xiaofa, what's wrong with you?

39
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,319
What are you doing here?

40
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,079
Say whatever you want.

41
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:52,959
I'm not leaving,

42
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,399
whatever you say.

43
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,279
Besides,

44
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,240
I have already applied
for a one-year deferral of admission.

45
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
I've canceled the flight.

46
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,759
What are you doing? You should study.

47
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I want

48
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,439
to be your family member.

49
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,839
Are you out of your mind?

50
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,480
Just think I'm.

51
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,560
Anyway, I've figured it out.

52
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,920
If

53
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,480
you're not there,

54
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,759
going anywhere would be meaningless.

55
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,839
I mean it.

56
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,240
You will regret it.

57
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,040
I'll deal with it when I do.

58
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,319
I have told you

59
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,160
my grades are very good.

60
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,160
I've made the calculation.

61
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,759
The probability of my regretting

62
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,600
is 0.1%.

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,959
Shall we bet on
the remaining probability?

64
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,800
Chen Xiaofa.

65
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Okay, Ning Shuang.

66
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't push me away.

67
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,279
You've mentioned before

68
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,959
that you don't like dating.

69
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,759
Right?

70
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
Then let's get married.

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Put it on me.

72
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,519
Alright.

73
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,040
I'll get an apple for you.

74
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:26,048
(House for Sale)

75
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,240
Ning Shuang.

76
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
You're late. She just left.

77
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,839
Why did she sell the house?

78
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:56,800
Look.

79
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,736
(House for Sale)

80
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,360
No wonder Yali sounded like she was
putting her affairs in order just now.

81
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,279
I'm relieved that Xiaofa
can take care of you.

82
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,920
Finally, someone can sign
the operation form.

83
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,519
Him?

84
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,680
I still can't quite trust men now.

85
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,639
You should still
accompany me to surgery.

86
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,120
I…

87
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,399
What's on your mind?

88
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Sure.

89
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,159
That house was the only thing
her father left for her.

90
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,879
She wouldn't sell it for the world.

91
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,960
Silly girl, I'm going to find her.

92
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,039
I'll go right now.

93
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,759
I promise you.

94
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,240
I will find her.

95
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,240
(It's truly a wine that hurts.)

96
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,360
What took you so long?

97
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,279
I was drunk.

98
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Really?

99
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,960
I've taught you for so long.

100
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,159
How could you get drunk?

101
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,919
Whether I'm drunk,

102
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,639
or sober,

103
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,879
I like you,

104
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,919
a lot.

105
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,600
So I'm begging you,

106
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,440
please don't leave, okay?

107
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,279
I like you a lot too,

108
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,159
to the extent that scares me.

109
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,480
But if I stay,

110
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,679
how much longer will we entangle?

111
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,039
We might hurt others.

112
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,200
This isn't right.

113
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,519
I love you.

114
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,399
But I am tired.

115
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,039
I want to live my own life.

116
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,960
(There were so many times)

117
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,480
(we met as if arranged by fate.)

118
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,799
(I was so sure about you.)

119
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,879
(I thought that if I opened the door,)

120
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,799
(you would sit there waiting for me.)

121
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,600

122
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,759
(I see.)

123
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,000
(This is the wine that hurts.)

124
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,919
(Liking you)

125
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,240
(is the taste of Flower Moon Night.)

126
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,559
(Cooling and parting make no sound.)

127
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,799
(Not even a word is said.)

128
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,000
(Goodbye.)

129
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,360
(Liu Yali.)

130
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,840
(Wait for me.)

131
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,960
(When in love,)

132
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,240
(people always meet unexpectedly.)

133

(When hearts gradually drift apart,)
