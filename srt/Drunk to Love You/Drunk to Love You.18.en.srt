=Episode 18=

3
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,759
What's the result?

4
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,399
Not pregnant.

5
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
That's good.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,079
Why the long face then?

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm not pregnant

8
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,679
but the doctor said I...

9
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,200
What are those two doing here?

10
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,079
Jiang Lu's dad came to see the doctor.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,439
Why isn't Jiang Lu with him?

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,120
Sorry, Shuang.

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,719
You were saying?

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,640
Nothing.

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,519
I'm not pregnant.

16
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,879
And thank you for coming with me.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
That's good.

18
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,840
Stop fighting with Xiaofa then.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,560
I feel so bad for him now.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,920
What's the matter with you?

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,920
You're blinded by love.

22
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:34,920
All right.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,079
Come, I'll take you home.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,840
Let's go.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
Jiang Lu.

26
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,799
What are you doing?

27
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,040
Cooking you something yum.

28
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,239
It'll be ready soon.

29
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,879
Okay.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,840
It smells so good.

31
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,840
Here, taste it.

32
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,200
Come on.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,960
This is so awful.

34
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,960
I think it's not bad.

35
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,080
Really?

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,319
I wanted to give you a surprise.

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh right.

38
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,599
I just saw in the hospital...

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,888
(Ada)

40
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,240
You better tell me something important.

41
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,919
What?

42
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:57,594
(Jiang's Group faces
serious food safety issues)

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,439
Sir, please calm down.

44
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,639
This time the problem

45
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,879
isn't with the product, Luna Bianco,

46
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,039
but the mixing method.

47
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,719
The mixing was proposed by Liu Yali.

48
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,199
She needs to
take responsibility for this.

49
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,439
The plan for Luna Bianco
was determined by me.

50
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,080
I should bear the consequences
when there's a problem.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,439
How are you gonna do that?

52
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,319
Bad press travels fast.

53
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,960
Now our stock price is plummeting.

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,919
The profit brought
by the recent marriage

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,199
between Ada and Qin

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,479
have all turned into losses.

57
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,159
As soon as the news broke out,

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,680
the Qins immediately
called off the engagement.

59
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,919
The board's resolution is

60
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,759
to have Liu Yali step forward
to take responsibility.

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,000
I need some time to investigate.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,599
It's not right
to let someone take the fall.

63
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,520
Even with the company at stake,

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,840
you still want to protect Liu Yali.

65
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,039
Yes.

66
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,719
Even at the risk of our entire business?

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,599
Yes.

68
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,599
Fool.

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm a fool, what about you?

70
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,400
Even just once,

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,719
did you ever stand with mom?

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,240
You...

73
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,319
Okay.

74
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,159
Ada.

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,039
Prepare the press conference.

76
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,000
Let Jiang Lu explain to the media.

77
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,199
Uncle.

78
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,560
Sir.

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,279
Sir.

80
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,079
Dad.

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,879
Sir.

82
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,040
Uncle.

83
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,240
Dad.

84
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,519
Call an ambulance.

85
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,792
(Quiet)

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
How long has he been ill?

87
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,920
It was discovered before you came back.

88
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,800
He forbade me to tell you.

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,240
The day my mom passed away,

90
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,680
the hospital was also cold.

91
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,040
He always felt that you blamed him.

92
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,920
Knowing that you'd come back
and take over,

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,959
he couldn't be happier.

94
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,639
I came back to anger him.

95
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,199
I wanted to prove that

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,439
without my mother,

97
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,079
and the Flower Moon Night,

98
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,240
he was nothing.

99
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,639
Lu.

100
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,759
With growing up comes responsibility.

101
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,360
If something really happened
to uncle today,

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,480
the company would be yours.

103
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,199
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,240
Your marriage

105
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,920
was ruined by me, too.

106
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,120
There's something I must remind you of.

107
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,439
Go ahead.

108
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,439
The reason why this thing
has blown up this big

109
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,920
is because someone leaked
the formula of Luna Bianco online.

110
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,519
It started as a secondary product.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,439
We didn't use the best materials.

112
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,959
So, mixing is only an excuse.

113
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
So what?

114
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,439
The leaker's name

115
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,639
is Lin Siqiao.

116
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,199
Do you know him?

117
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,720
I checked it out.

118
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,839
This person seems to be
an acquaintance of Ms. Liu.

119
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,959
Given your current relationship,

120
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,879
whatever happens,

121
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,160
you should keep your distance
with Liu Yali.

122
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,279
I understand.

123
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,920
But I will find out the truth.

124
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,480
Doctor.

125
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,800
How is he?

126
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,439
How is he now?

127
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,079
The patient's not in danger.

128
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,240
But the Alzheimer's Disease
has deteriorated.

129
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,800
He may not even recognize any of you.

130
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,839
Why did you sleep here?

131
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,240
You're back.

132
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,839
Are you hungry?

133
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,120
I'll go heat up some food.

134
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,000
I am not hungry.

135
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,879
How did it go?

136
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,279
My dad is fine.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,120
But starting today,

138
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,279
I have to take over the whole company.

139
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,720
Flower Moon Night

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,879
must be put on hold.

141
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,919
Okay.

142
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,879
And you'll be suspended for a while.

143
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
But believe me,

144
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,399
I will get to the bottom of this.

145
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,720
I won't let you be mistreated.

146
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,679
I believe you.

147
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,639
Today, after my dad woke up,

148
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,799
he asked me who I was.

149
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,960
He didn't recognize me.

150
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,600
I will always be with you.

151
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,279
And everything will get better.

152
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,960
(The Jiangs must apologize.)

153
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,879
(Jiang Qifan and Jiang Lu should quit.)

154
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
(Like father, like son.)

155
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,519
(For capitalists,
consumers' lives don't matter.)

156
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,799
(I heard Luna Bianco was
made by Jiang Lu's girlfriend.)

157
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
(Unbelievable.)

158
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,840
(They sure are a toxic pair.)

159
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,360
No matter how broken the furniture,

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,720
there must be a lamp
that's bright and warm.

161
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,399
Look,

162
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,000
doesn't our place seem

163
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,120
more like a home this way?

164
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,480
Yes, indeed.

165
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,480
This is our home.
