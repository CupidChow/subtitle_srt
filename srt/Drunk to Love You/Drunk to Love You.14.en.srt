=Drunk to Love You=

2
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:40,672
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,600
Yali,

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,679
aren't you going to tell me
what Mr. Lin does?

5
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,320
I'm a sommelier.

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,719
You are Yali's boss, right?

7
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,000
A sommelier, huh?

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,359
Our Jiang's...

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,760
Our company is
in the foreign trade business.

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,880
Nothing special.

11
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,520
Mr. Jiang, you know,

12
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,759
Yali usually doesn't drink
a drop of alcohol.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,200
She gets drunk with a sip.

14
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,560
So, back in college, I always

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,920
took a bit of her share.

16
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,879
Since you enjoy drinking,

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,799
let's have a drink at Shuang's place.

18
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,079
I wonder what you usually like to drink.

19
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,120
I know all the drinks here.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,079
I usually drink beer.

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,239
Are you all right?

22
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,359
I'm fine.

23
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,959
You have taken good care of yourself.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,159
What do you mean?

25
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,680
The calories in a 500ml bottle of beer

26
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,239
are equivalent to half a bowl of rice.

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,280
That's how one gets a beer belly.

28
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,280
So what do you drink?

29
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,719
If we're not talking about work,

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,920
to maintain my figure,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,879
I drink whiskey more often
in my personal time.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,560
Let's go with that.

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,439
Alright.

34
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,879
What an exciting showdown between men.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't know why,

36
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,400
whenever I see Lin Siqiao,

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,519
I just feel uncomfortable all over.

38
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,599
He exudes a pretentious air
from the inside out.

39
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,000
Exactly.

40
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,439
What are you doing?

41
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,560
Bottoms up.

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,319
Sorry, occupational habit.

43
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,639
Yali, you take a whiff.

44
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,360
This one comes from Islay.

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,599
The heavy peat mixes
with damp, salty sea breeze

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,240
to create the wildest style of whisky.

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,759
It has quite a Scottish character.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,840
It's also a representation
of masculinity.

49
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,039
A real man ought to drink strong liquor.

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,159
He has lost.

51
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,719
Completely lost.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This guy has taken showing off
to a whole new level.

53
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,560
Shuang,

54
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,879
give me a stronger one.

55
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,840
Mr. Jiang, are you alright?

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,039
It's your first time.

57
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,879
You might find it has a gasoline taste.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,039
You're right.

59
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,360
Real men should drink strong alcohol.

60
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,879
I normally drink this too.

61
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,280
If you can't drink, just don't.

62
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,080
Don't worry about it.

63
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,759
After you sipped it gently,

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,800
drink it in large gulps.

65
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,360
Let the mouth and the liquor mingle for
about five seconds before swallowing.

66
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,240
Experience the rich aroma.

67
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,719
Mr. Jiang.

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
Are you okay?

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,560
He's fine.

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,296
No problem.

71
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,039
Seeing Jiang Lu like this
really breaks my heart.

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,520
I think he has brought
trouble on himself.

73
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,280
Still being stubborn at this point.

74
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,520
Making Yali sad.

75
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Try harder,

76
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,479
or Yali will be someone else's.

77
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,879
Jiang Lu.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,120
I think he can't take it anymore.

79
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,199
Let's just call it a day.

80
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,600
What do you mean?

81
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,079
Continue.

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,040
Lin Siqiao, is it you who can't keep up?

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,279
Since you are still in the mood,

84
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,519
we can go for another round.

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,199
According to your taste,

86
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,120
let's have some beer
to moisten the throat.

87
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,279
Come on.

88
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,480
You see, Mr. Jiang has
indeed drunk too much.

89
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,399
How about I take this drink for him?

90
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,279
As long as I'm here,

91
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,000
you can't drink.

92
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,000
Impressive.

93
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,959
Please do me a favor.

94
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,959
Let's just stop here for today, okay?

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,800
Okay.

96
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,439
I'll take you back.

97
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,720
Just call a designated driver.

98
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,560
Wait for me a moment.
I'll come out right away.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Alright.

100
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,160
I'll wait for you outside.

101
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,319
Come on.

102
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,399
Give me a lift.

103
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,040
Sorry to trouble you.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Let's go.

105
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,600
Okay.

106
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,199
Are you okay?

107
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,959
I'm fine.

108
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm really sorry.

109
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Thank you.

110
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,360
He just threw up.

111
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,839
I will pay you back for the car wash.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,920
It's okay.

113
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,959
Now he's been dropped off.

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,560
Let's go, I'll take you home now.

115
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,759
Is he alright?

116
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,800
Well, there's a morning meeting
tomorrow.

117
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,480
I have to take care of my boss.

118
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
After all, it's work.

119
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,839
Alright.

120
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,199
I'll go wash the car nearby.

121
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
It'll take about 15 minutes.

122
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,680
I'll pick you up later, okay?

123
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,720
- Alright.
- Sure.

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,720
I'll be going first.

125
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,680
I don't care whether you're faking it.

126
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,879
Anyway, I've put the water beside you.

127
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,040
Remember to go to work on time tomorrow.

128
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,920
You heard it.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,399
Lin Siqiao is waiting for me.

130
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm going back first.

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,560
Where are you going?

132
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,000
Going home.

133
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,639
You're bringing another man
back to our place?

134
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,959
I'll ask him to drop me off downstairs.

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,199
I'll go upstairs myself.
Is there a problem?

136
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,199
Yes, there's a problem.

137
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,639
What problem?

138
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,039
I-I don't allow it.

139
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,639
I don't want you to go.

140
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,919
Can you

141
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,840
not go with him?

142
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,159
Let go of me!

143
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,759
It hurts.

144
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,440
I want to go home.

145
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,960
We can't let Lin Siqiao know
that we live together.

146
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,960
The boss and the assistant cohabiting.

147
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,639
They will misunderstand.

148
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,960
I don't care.

149
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,320
Jiang Lu, we had an agreement.

150
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,399
You go to the hotel for today.

151
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,519
I'll pay for you.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,759
What about you?

153
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,799
Lin Siqiao will take me back.

154
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,639
You can come back tomorrow.

155
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,840
I want someone to take me.

156
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,519
He'll take you.

157
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,639
You take me.

158
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,000
It's settled then.

159
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,919
Please.

160
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,639
I'm only being unreasonable this once.
