00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,109
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,250
(Doctor Detective)

3
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,159
Who is it?

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,730
Mr. Huh?

5
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,640
Don't you want to know...

6
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,710
about the site in Namil?

7
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,979
Your house is a mess.

8
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,019
Cut to the chase.
Abut the site in Namil.

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,680
Are you going to keep digging
into this case?

10
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,149
Why did you come that day?

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,690
Are you following me?

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,930
What a rude way of thanking me.

13
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,759
This is the cellphone of the man
who tried to kill you.

14
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:01,769
Why are you giving me this?

15
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,939
The man who tried to kill you...

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,870
is trying to kill me too.

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,810
It's Executive Director Moh Sung Kuk
of TL Oshem.

18
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:12,339
This is all his scheme.

19
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,509
From fabricating the site,
controlling the media,

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,180
and even attempting to kill you.

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,550
I need to turn the tables
in order to live.

22
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:22,889
That goes for you too.

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,460
Are you saying my life
depends on you?

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,929
UDC should reveal that the
dormitory was fabricated.

25
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:31,729
I'll make the person involved
confess that he was responsible.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,200
I'm checking the
surveillance cameras...

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,700
to find TL Oshem cars
going to the dormitory in Namil.

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,770
I'll find something soon.

29
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:41,939
How pitiful of TL.

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,140
You're revealing the group's
critical secrets...

31
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,279
just to win
an internal power struggle?

32
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:50,849
All I have to do is to announce
that it isn't the group's policy.

33
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,020
That Oshem was solely responsible
for it.

34
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,589
Choi Tae Young.
Is that what the chairman wants?

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,390
I know it isn't.

36
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,629
This is your own doing.

37
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:05,499
The chairman trusts
Executive Director Moh,

38
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,530
and you're just trying to
come between them.

39
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:11,869
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

40
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,270
We'll continue
with the investigation.

41
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,109
Don't even think about
using UDC.

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,480
Joong Eun, if you survived once,

43
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,380
you should be thankful.

44
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,349
I thought I'd died already
three years ago.

45
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,889
Consider it as paying back a debt
and do as I say.

46
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,699
And after that?

47
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,400
Open it to the media.
And bring down Mr. Moh.

48
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,329
You'll get the justice
that you want so much.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,070
And I'll...

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,210
regain the chairman's trust.

51
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,069
And also,

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,010
leave UDC and live quietly.

53
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,550
Seo Rin should...

54
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,289
grow up with her mom.

55
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:08,389
Are you...

56
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,699
taking good care of Seo Rin?

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,930
Why?

58
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,599
She called me earlier.

59
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,669
But we got disconnected right away.

60
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,169
She's doing well.

61
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,740
Since she's a kid,
of course, she'll miss her mom.

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,480
I'll take that as a yes and go now.
I'll be in touch.

63
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,589
Take care of yourself. I beg of you.

64
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,160
Seo Rin needs you.

65
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,240
(Doctor Detective)

66
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,749
- Ms. Gong.
- You startled me.

67
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,389
(Chief Gong Il Sun)

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,160
So... In exchange for information,
he wants you to make an issue?

69
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,229
Choi Tae Young wants to take down
Moh Sung Kuk.

70
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,669
We should thank him if
he wants to be a whistle-blower.

71
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,269
He may be using us.

72
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:28,009
Darn it. We've come too far anyway.

73
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,369
The higher-ups refused
everything today.

74
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,080
Let's do it.

75
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,180
You can't go to the site anymore,
okay?

76
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,820
Okay.

77
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,489
How much did she drink?

78
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,730
Four bottles.

79
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I guess it didn't go well with
her superiors.

80
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,239
She stinks!

81
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:00,399
She shouldn't have drunk
on an empty stomach.

82
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,110
It's not good for her stomach.

83
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:05,879
We should get hangover soup
for lunch.

84
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Should I have it delivered?

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,980
Let's eat out.

86
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,950
Ms. Doh is taking the morning off.

87
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,150
Is she sick?

88
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,290
Have you heard from Mr. Huh?

89
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,019
It's not normal for him
to come on time.

90
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,960
No. Something's going on.

91
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,030
A fling.

92
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,260
A what?

93
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,699
A fling and not a fight?

94
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,430
Sure, it's a fling.

95
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,170
They left the office together,
yesterday.

96
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:30,839
In Mr. Huh's car.

97
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,970
It feels like you're mine.
It feels like you're not...

98
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,480
Whatever. Let's just get coffee.

99
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,979
(Namil Police Station)

100
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,210
(Medical Certificate)

101
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,680
It's Kim Do Hyeong's
medical certificate.

102
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,479
He has diabetes
and needs insulin treatment.

103
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,889
I'd like to request
an official visit as a doctor.

104
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,260
Sir, could you come here a moment?

105
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,830
What is it?

106
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:05,469
Visits aren't allowed to the UDC.

107
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,140
- Why not?
- You know why.

108
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:11,709
That means other doctors
are allowed, right?

109
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:16,709
Are you going to take responsibility
if he faints from low blood sugar?

110
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,720
Stop making a fuss!

111
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,990
I'll allow any other
qualified doctor.

112
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,119
Now leave.

113
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,759
We're busy, so please leave.

114
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,129
Get going, already!

115
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,330
You have to leave clear proof...

116
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,730
that you left.

117
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,469
We need a recording of you leaving
on the surveillance camera,

118
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,640
and I'll show up right then.

119
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,990
Sir!

120
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,089
I'm the other qualified doctor,

121
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,430
Huh Min Ki.

122
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:07,059
This is my medical license.

123
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,370
Are you kidding me?

124
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,000
You're both from UDC, aren't you?

125
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,769
Yes. We're from UDC.

126
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,680
First, I'm not kidding.

127
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,279
DKA.

128
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,850
There's a thing called
diabetic ketoacidosis.

129
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:24,379
It's an acute complication that can
occur when a type 1 diabetic...

130
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,750
fails to regulate sugar levels.

131
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,889
The patient could die
within 48 hours.

132
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,490
Kim Do Hyeong is a type 1 diabetic.

133
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:32,559
He's under
an emergency interrogation.

134
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,559
We need some information
before we move him.

135
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,759
- Come another time.
- I'm sure...

136
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,400
they're going to start lying
about some internal affairs.

137
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,500
Then...

138
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:44,999
we have to bring up
the Human Rights Commission.

139
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,570
Is this Mr. Park of
the Human Rights Commission?

140
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Yes, sir. Are you on your way?

141
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,150
Yes.
Reporter Byun is accompanying you?

142
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,910
That's all right.

143
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,349
These people are civil servants,
so they don't have portrait rights.

144
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:01,749
I believe people have
the right to know.

145
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,259
They should know that the police
are completely inconsiderate...

146
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,560
- of human rights...
- All right, all right!

147
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,759
Quit it with the act
and just leave the medicine.

148
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,130
Type 1 diabetics need
insulin injections, not medicine.

149
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,200
You need to be trained
to use the syringe.

150
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,670
Would you like to be trained?

151
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,429
However, it will be
a violation of medical law.

152
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,739
Do you even know what insulin is?

153
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,469
Hey, doctor!

154
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,510
Go ahead.

155
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,509
Yes, all right.

156
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,880
Good job.

157
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,749
Make sure to reassure Do Hyeong
as soon as you get in.

158
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:32,419
If he has mercury poisoning,
he could suffer from anxiety,

159
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,189
paranoia, or show aggressiveness.

160
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,750
If he shows hypersensitivity,

161
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,819
be sure to put me on the phone.

162
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,730
You can tell them
I'm his usual doctor.

163
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:44,899
Go away.

164
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,299
Go away!

165
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,999
I need to persuade the patient,

166
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,499
so let him talk to his usual doctor.

167
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,069
When he calms down,
drag it as long as you can.

168
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,840
Remember that it's our only chance.

169
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,449
It's all right.

170
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,559
- Do Hyeong.
- Who is this?

171
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,690
It's me, Doh Joong Eun.
Calm down, Do Hyeong.

172
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,469
Ms. Doh!

173
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,199
I didn't do it.

174
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
I didn't do it, Ms. Doh.

175
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,170
I know.

176
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,140
You didn't do anything wrong.

177
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,650
You went to save Ha Rang,
but your hand shook.

178
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,749
That's right, Ms. Doh.

179
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:42,719
Now, don't talk and just listen.

180
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,960
It's because you're sick.
You were poisoned.

181
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,630
We're going to prove that.

182
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,160
You can trust the doctor
in front of you.

183
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,870
Hang in there, just a bit.

184
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,439
I brought long-acting insulin.

185
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,470
You've never tried this before,
so I'll teach you.

186
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,470
Okay.

187
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,479
- Here. Hold this in your hand...
- Okay.

188
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,279
and then...

189
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:13,919
you hold your belly...

190
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,820
What are you doing? Don't touch him.

191
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,590
He needs to be trained
for the new prescription.

192
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,690
How am I supposed to treat him
without touching him?

193
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,430
Just finish it up and stand back.

194
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,860
You have to change the syringe...

195
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:29,099
with every use.

196
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:30,199
Okay.

197
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,540
For the dosage,

198
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,410
you can adjust it
with the dial on the end.

199
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,680
- I didn't do it.
- I know.

200
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,210
I'll do a final check-up.

201
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,950
Just a second...

202
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,820
Do Hyeong, push me back hard. Hurry!

203
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,019
What are you doing?

204
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,190
Hey! Stop that!

205
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,599
- All right, kid!
- I didn't do it!

206
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,039
Could you run a blood test
for the mercury, one last time?

207
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,540
It's Kim Do Hyeong's.

208
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:11,539
What?

209
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,550
Mr. Huh! You're amazing!

210
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,250
How did you do it?

211
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,950
It's a secret.

212
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:22,489
Let's keep it a secret
until the results come out.

213
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,529
- Good job.
- You, too.

214
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Let's get Do Hyeong out of there.

215
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,940
Ms. Gong. Ms. Gong!

216
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,179
Look what I found.

217
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,209
"Under the conditions
set by the president,"

218
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,420
"the head of the
Undiagnosed Disease Center..."

219
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,080
"can open an evaluation committee
for the epidemiological survey..."

220
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,220
"on any substance or disease..."

221
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,090
"that is considered to be of harm
to the citizens."

222
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,290
The Epidemiological Survey
Evaluation Committee.

223
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,190
It means there's a way.

224
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,930
- Do we have any kimchi?
- Why...

225
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,430
would you mention kimchi now?

226
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,869
I know you enjoy having cup noodles,

227
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:14,239
so I bought some, just in case.

228
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:16,139
What a smart guy!

229
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,479
Ms. Byun,

230
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,810
don't you think I already brought up
the evaluation committee?

231
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:24,849
The conditions...

232
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,950
set by the president...

233
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,250
needs consent from
the head of the corporation.

234
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,289
And the head says
he'll give permission...

235
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,430
only if we find proof
that it's poisoning.

236
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,860
It's just nonsense.

237
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:38,329
How are we supposed to find it?

238
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,130
They got Kim Do Hyeong locked up
and won't even allow visits.

239
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,000
Joong Eun.

240
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,300
Did you hear anything?

241
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,210
Darn it, of course not.

242
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,779
It hasn't even been a few days.

243
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,409
Ms. Gong, ma'am. Cheer up!

244
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,980
I should cheer up, but darn it!

245
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,489
Everyone's so afraid of TL!

246
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,789
What if...

247
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,419
we have the evidence?

248
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,890
Come on!

249
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,759
I'm sure Ms. Suk is almost done
with the analysis.

250
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,759
What analysis?

251
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,769
5, 4,

252
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:19,539
3,

253
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,839
2, 1!

254
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,110
Kim Do Hyeong's blood test results
are out!

255
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,750
The mercury is 60 times
the average level.

256
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,950
Do Hyeong didn't commit murder.

257
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,720
His hand was shaking
because of mercury poisoning.

258
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,850
But how did you collect his blood?

259
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,859
We were able to visit him
using his medical condition...

260
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,059
and collected his blood in secret.

261
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,430
I did it.

262
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,660
And you? This will be useless
if you got involved.

263
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,030
I've taken care of that.

264
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,229
It's fine now.

265
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:51,469
Good job. 60 times?

266
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,270
Great! Gather around.

267
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,410
We got the evidence
for the mercury,

268
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,480
and we proved
that it wasn't murder.

269
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,509
Now, we're taking this
to the evaluation committee.

270
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,420
It's 60 times the amount of mercury
in his blood.

271
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:09,319
We have to find out...

272
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,360
how in the world
the mercury got in his system.

273
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:14,389
Did he breathe it in
while working...

274
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,589
or did the heavy metal
leak into the dorm?

275
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,930
Let's find that out.
How he was exposed.

276
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,629
All right.

277
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:26,399
They're going to begin a meeting
with the evaluation committee.

278
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,309
The Occupational Safety Authority
gave their consent.

279
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,210
UDC will come to reinvestigate.

280
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,340
Should we place more guards
at the site?

281
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,039
Call in a guard company.

282
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,280
Make sure to keep UDC
from getting in.

283
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,249
The reason will be trespassing.

284
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:41,149
Call a company
that's not part of TL Metro.

285
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,460
"Temporary restraining order
against the epidemiological survey"?

286
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,690
What is this? Are you kidding me?

287
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,530
We're here by the law
and have the right to...

288
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,099
In position, everyone.

289
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,240
Guys, there are no legal grounds
for them to stop us.

290
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,710
Let's go.

291
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,580
You guys.

292
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,480
If you lay even just a finger on us,
we'll sue you all.

293
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,550
Is that clear?

294
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,579
Il Sun,
are we really going in though?

295
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,819
- Hey!
- Stop her.

296
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,860
- Who do you think you are?
- Get out of our way!

297
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:20,319
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hey!

298
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,730
- Gosh!
- Let go!

299
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,839
Gosh, Moh Sung Kuk
is going all out to stop us.

300
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,210
He sent a bunch of guys
to keep us out.

301
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,250
Hello? Hey, are you listening?

302
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:42,549
Yes.

303
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,849
It is clearly against the law.

304
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,020
Well, the thing is...

305
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,690
Hey, hasn't Choi Tae Young
made a move yet?

306
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,790
You said you two struck a deal.

307
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,690
For now, let's try
to find a solution on our own.

308
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,529
Contact Hanil SD's labor union
and tell them to cause a stir.

309
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:02,699
Got it, okay.

310
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:05,439
Darn it.

311
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,670
We're humans too,
and we want to be respected as such!

312
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,980
- We want to be respected!
- We want to be respected!

313
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,380
The company is responsible
for occupational accidents!

314
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,579
- The company is responsible!
- The company is responsible!

315
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,019
Launch
an epidemiological investigation!

316
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:22,119
- Launch an investigation!
- Launch an investigation!

317
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:24,449
The company is responsible
for occupational accidents!

318
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,720
- The company is responsible!
- The company is responsible!

319
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,360
Launch
an epidemiological investigation!

320
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,699
- Launch an investigation!
- Launch an investigation!

321
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,030
We're humans too!

322
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,029
- We're humans too!
- We're humans too!

323
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,599
The company must right the wrongs!

324
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,539
- Right the wrongs!
- Right the wrongs!

325
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,010
The company
must take responsibility!

326
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,169
- Take responsibility!
- Take responsibility!

327
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,210
Launch an investigation.

328
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,580
- Launch an investigation!
- Launch an investigation!

329
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,009
We're humans too!

330
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,019
(Who Should Take Responsibility
for the Bui Station Accident?)

331
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,389
(Labor Union Blames the Company)

332
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,649
- Right the wrongs!
- Right the wrongs!

333
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,560
- Take responsibility!
- The drum and the drumsticks.

334
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,990
They look familiar.

335
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,000
Where did I see them?

336
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,999
- Launch an investigation!
- Launch an investigation!

337
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,429
We're...

338
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:12,999
- We're humans too.
- The screen door worker's death.

339
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,399
- We want to be respected!
- Was it really murder?

340
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,810
- We want to be respected!
- Or was it death by negligence...

341
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,179
caused by heavy metal poisoning?

342
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,939
Now, many are mentioning
the role of...

343
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,150
the Epidemiological Survey
Evaluation Committee,

344
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,550
which consists of occupational
health and safety experts.

345
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,150
I heard TL is refusing
to acknowledge the committee's role.

346
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:34,419
Correct. In fact, what TL
is insisting lacks legal grounds.

347
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,029
When it comes to
epidemiological investigations,

348
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,099
the committee has the most
decision-making authority...

349
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,130
like the Supreme Court does
for legal matters.

350
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,300
The Epidemiological Survey
Evaluation Committee's role...

351
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,799
is to investigate and determine...

352
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,009
whether the company or employer
is responsible in any way...

353
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:50,269
for the specific disease or accident
in question.

354
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,609

majority decisions...

Joong Eun.

357
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,920
Ms. Doh isn't at her desk.

358
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,489
She stepped out saying
she has to check something.

359
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:07,659
I think she's on the second floor.

360
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,229
Was the labor union's protest
your idea?

361
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,730
That was clever.

362
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,830
Keep up the good work.

363
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,529
I'll correspond
and take Moh Sung Kuk down.

364
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,939
But we need more concrete evidence
to take it to the next step.

365
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,670
The Namil site will be empty today
because of the labor union.

366
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,440
Just keep it in mind.

367
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,150
(TL Oshem Personnel Restructuring,
Including new executive director)

368
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:45,999
Come to the second floor
by yourself.

369
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:53,269
(Doh Joong Eun)

370
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,110
I'm here. What's going on?

371
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,149
Come with me
to the site in Namil tonight.

372
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,120
You want to go
to that abandoned building at night?

373
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,530
There will be fewer people
standing guard at night.

374
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,700
I found a few entrances we can use.

375
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,730
Well, it's...

376
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,899
You said you'd help me.

377
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,170
The thing is,

378
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,340
we'll be doomed if we're caught.

379
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,779
"An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth."

380
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,539
Isn't that your motto?

381
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,849
You wouldn't dig without knowing
whether we'll find something.

382
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:37,349
Is there something?

383
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,580
Yes, there is.

384
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:44,789
My gosh.

385
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,020
Where have you been?

386
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,359
I went upstairs to get this.

387
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,370
Let me warn you once again.
Don't go anywhere.

388
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,799
Whether it's the site in Namil
or TL Metro,

389
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,839
don't go anywhere near TL.
Do you understand?

390
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,539
- Yes.
- Tell me that you won't go.

391
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,979
I won't go anywhere near TL.

392
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,229
How did you know there'd be
fewer security guards tonight?

393
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,640
We just need to distract
those two somehow.

394
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,369
How can we distract them?

395
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,710
Freeze.

396
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,140
Both of you, crawl out
through the hole. Right now.

397
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:43,779
Out, now!

398
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,850
Gosh, Jin Hak!

399
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,220
Mr. Ha.

400
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,960
Ms. Doh, you need to leave at once.

401
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,770
If you get caught, all of us
will have to leave UDC.

402
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:05,869
We won't get caught.

403
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,970
Right. What?

404
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,710
Gosh. Hey, Min Ki.

405
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,309
I'll tell Chief Gong on you.

406
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,009
You, traitor. You're human trash.

407
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,909
What's your problem now?

408
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,550
If you persuade her
and get her out of there,

409
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:21,989
I won't tell Chief Gong anything.

410
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,189
Stop fooling around
and get out of there, please.

411

Get lost.

00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:28,729
Goodness, what's with you two?

413
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,499
What are you going to do
if you get caught?

414
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,359
We won't. We'll sneak in
through the back.

415
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,140
Wait, Min Ki. What about me?

416
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,999
Since you came all the way here,
we're now in the same boat.

417
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,169
Stand guard here.
If anything happens,

418
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,410
call me right away. Got it?

419
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,009
I'm sorry, Chief Gong.

420
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:53,949
Darn it. There's a mosquito here.

421
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,520
Be careful.

422
00:21:58,289 --> 00:21:59,489
Be careful. This is heavy.

423
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,959
I served as a medical officer
in the Marine Corps.

424
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,369
I had to run tests in the dark,

425
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,540
so this is...

426
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:16,909
I'm so used to this.
Even in pitch-black darkness...

427
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,509
What? What are you doing?

428
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,120
Couldn't you open it quietly?
I mean, we snuck in here.

429
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,020
What's this? This thing.

430
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
It's a chair.

431
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:38,929
Let me tell you something though.
No one can catch ghosts.

432
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:42,199
I have a lot of experience
working in places...

433
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,440
- like cemeteries.
- Over there.

434
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:49,709
Why? What is it? What's over there?

435
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,249
Hold on.

436
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:59,049
It must be empty inside.

437
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,550
I think these doors
are welded together though.

438
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,490
We should break them.

439
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,430
Didn't you hear me?
I think they're welded together.

440
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:11,059
- Right, exactly.
- What are you going to do?

441
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,329
- Step back.
- What? Why?

442
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,430
I didn't know you were so...
My gosh!

443
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,429
Wait, hold on. Just a second.

444
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,639
I'll do it. Let me do this, okay?

445
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,040
So this is where
the mercury spills happened, right?

446
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,679
I got this.

447
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,820
Have a look.

448
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:42,659
Hurry!
We need to open this darn door!

449
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:45,499
Someone's here. Be quick.
You have to hurry!

450
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,059
Darn it.
All right, let's decide what to do.

451
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:51,599
We should have enough time
to run to the hole if we leave now,

452
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,969
but we'll be stuck here if
we lock the doors. It's do or die.

453
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:56,439
Are you sure we can find
evidence in this room?

454
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:00,039
Okay.

455
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,579
Then we should...

456
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,580
- They're over there.
- Get them!

457
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,319
Let me do it. I can do it quickly.
I got it.

458
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,389
- Hurry!
- Stop them.

459
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,030
Move. Step aside.

460
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,859
- Open this!
- Hurry!

461
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,169
Hurry up!

462
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,040

- Hey, open this door!
- Hang on.

connected?

the exposure?

at every light.

- Found what?

I found a pair of drumsticks.

502
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:02,929
It means he played the drums
until recently.

503
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:06,929
Then they must've had a place
where they practiced.

504

more than 100dB.

517
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,640
the mercury rate was 20 times higher
than the standard rate.

at this place.

to go in there?

It's his fault for going inside

Yes, it's his fault.

529
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,400
Do you think we're some
volunteer group?

530
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,970
Please quiet down.
Let's have some order.

531
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,310
The analysis result...

532
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,780
for cross-checking is the same.

533
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,380
Then let's begin the vote.

534
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,690
(Chairman of Committee,
Park Hyun Sung)

535
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,830
I'll announce the result
of the votes.

536
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:50,069
Those who agree, five votes.

537
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,369
Those who disagree, four votes.

538
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,270
It has been voted as work-related.

539
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:57,209
The decision's been made that
TL Metro is responsible.

540
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,179
What is this? This is nothing but
unfair treatment of companies.

541
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,049
Will you let everyone apply for
industrial accidents now?

542
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:06,749
- This is ridiculous.
- All right, then.

543
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:09,289
Great job, everyone. Thank you.

544
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,489
Chairman Park, thank you.

545
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:13,089
Let's wrap it up now.
