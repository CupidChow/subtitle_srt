2
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:07,856
I wasn't even in there for 10 minutes.

3
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:12,326
So take this vitamin C shot for 10 minutes.

4
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:15,197
You need to remove any mercury residue.

5
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:22,166
It'll be over in a second.

6
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:27,076

You're all done.

10
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:43,926
I have a secret to tell you.

11
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:47,896
I'll apply for an industrial accident for this.

12
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,526
You'll testify as a colleague, right?

13
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,206
Before that, I'll take a vitamin C shot too.

14
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,107
Come on.

15
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:08,517

17

TL Metro will go to trial now.

18
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:19,426
We'll see if they're charged as the main contractors.

19
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:21,627
The prosecution has to crack down on the biotech complex.

20
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:24,396
I doubt it. Everyone's making a fuss that it's the new future.

21
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:26,596
You didn't find them?

22
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:30,167
They're giving each other vitamin shots. So intimately.

23
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:33,577
Hey. Don't they seem awfully close lately?

24
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:36,006
Yes, those two are creating some great synergy.

25
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,717
Even when someone fell down and almost died,

26
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:41,777
- they didn't even blink an eye... - What who?

27
00:01:41,777 --> 00:01:44,146
- Well... - That looks delicious.

28
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,487

- Ladies first. Take a seat. - Thank you.

34
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:03,137
Since we're all here, let's toast officially.

35

- Let me get some food first. - Let's toast first.

No, it's all right.

be fine permanently?

70
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:23,027
We checked the soil at the site in Namil,

71
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:24,797
and there aren't any leaks or exposures.

72
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:27,167
If it's fine after 50 years,

00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,066
you can say it's permanent.

00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:30,467

I spoke with the Arizona branch,

00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:43,047
and they're very pleased with the automobile plant.

There won't be any more pressure regarding waste from the US army.

handed himself into the hands of the prosecutors this morning.

Mr. Park admitted to all charges...

86

and said he would cooperate with the investigation.

87
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:30,866

Now, if you can't even do that,

184
00:15:58,237 --> 00:15:59,607
it's time for you to be let go.

185
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,607
Listen up.

186
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:08,847
I called this meeting, not Mr. Moh.

187
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,246
So all you have to do is listen to me...

188
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:14,916
and do as I say.

189
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:24,526
To compete with Maomi, we're going to drop our prices...

190
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,396
starting with the SL-5 series.

191
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,136
Let's make sure our prices are lower than Maomi's.

192
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:33,136
Well, people are already criticizing the major corporations...

193
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:35,006
for underpaying their outsourcing service providers.

194
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:37,207
If we go this route,

195
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:39,207
we'll be criticized severely given the current situation.

196
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,217
Mr. Choi.

197
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:44,416
Is this the Ministry of Labor or the Human Rights Committee?

198
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:46,317
Replace the vendors that can't lower their prices.

199
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:47,886
And Oshem will handle the media.

200
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:52,026
Do I need to tell you how?

201
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,166
How could he decide to lower our prices...

202
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,897
without even seeking the lab's confirmation?

203
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,296
He's lost his mind.

204
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,506
He obviously feels cornered.

205
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:04,967
How dare he call me a minion?

206
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:09,237
As for the price reduction strategy,

207
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:11,106
there's an 80-percent chance that it'll fail.

208
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,617
He should clearly give up, but he kept on pushing for it.

209
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:16,586
Don't be so upset.

210
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:21,516
You got half of the job done by mentioning UDC.

211
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:27,627
Good work today.

212
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:06,566
(Doh Joong Eun)

213
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,516
Oh, dear.

214
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:36,326
Please leave a message after the tone.

215
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:39,096
Ms. Doh, we must seize your property for not complying with the order...

216
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:40,996
to compensate the other party for the damages.

217
00:18:43,437 --> 00:18:46,167
Oh, my. Look at you, Seo Rin.

218
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:49,237
You can draw so well.

219
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:52,246
Seo Rin.

220
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,316
Can you write your name?

221
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,947
Write, "Choi Seo Rin".

222
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:59,387
Here, right here.

223
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:04,457
(Choi Seo Rin)

224
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:07,727
Choi...

225
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,467
Seo Rin.

226
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:14,667
(Choi Seo Rin)

227
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,197
And a heart.

228
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:20,737
Seo Rin.

229
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:24,147
You wrote this, right?

230
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:28,516
Who is it for?

231
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:31,417
I don't know.

"That's right. I'm a yellow butterfly."

237
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,957
- "The yellow butterfly..." - How did it go?

238
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:13,086
Don't worry, sir. I made sure it'll remain strictly confidential.

239
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:16,596
Good. No one can find out about it, okay?

240
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,026
Yes, sir. Well understood.

241
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:22,437
As for Seo Rin's daycare, I told the teacher she'll take a week off.

242
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:25,006
- The hotel's been booked too, sir. - Okay, great.

243
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:27,637
Also...

244
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:29,977
(Choi Seo Rin)

245
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,516
What did you say Joong Eun is up to these days?

246
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:45,157
Ms. Doh, hurry.

247
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:46,996
There are so many patients in the waiting room now.

248
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,457
Okay, I'll be right there.

249
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:53,496
UDC?

250
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:55,437
Is that so?

251
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:56,667
(Choi Seo Rin)

252
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,606
- Dig more into it. - I will, sir.

253
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:03,477
And call Mr. Moh for me.

254
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:04,806
Yes, sir.

255
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,657
- What's happening? - Due to the mercury poisoning case,

256
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:16,217
we're now known for correctly diagnosing occupational diseases.

257
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,727
When can we be seen by the doctor?

258
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,127
I'm sorry. Please wait just a little longer.

259
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:27,596
(One dollar)

260
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:55,957
I'd like to settle up.

261
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,197
Hye Mi.

262
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:05,836
Aren't you Park Hye Mi?

263
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:07,677
Ma'am.

264
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,707
I live in this neighborhood.

265
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:15,117
It's so nice to run into you.

266
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:18,487
How have you been?

267
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:21,356
I've been doing all right.

268
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:26,127
You still paint, right?

269
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:43,846
- Thank you, sir. - Thanks for your hard work.

270
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:44,977
I'll be off, then.

271
00:22:58,187 --> 00:22:59,756
I don't want to see you wasting your talent.

272
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,996
I asked to see you because I wanted to have a talk with you.

273
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:05,026
I see.

274
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:08,397
I know you haven't been preparing to apply for art schools,

275
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:09,836
but you're in 11th grade now,

276
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:12,766
so I think you'll get in with just a little bit of effort.

277
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:15,877
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

278
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:19,776
Hye Mi, I'll help you.

279
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:22,177
You should tell your parents.

280
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:25,086
Shall I speak with your parents in person?

281
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,157
Sure.

282
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:46,506
Eat up.

283
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:48,836
Thanks for the food.

284
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:13,066
Is there something you want to say to me?

285
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:17,836
No.

286
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,006
- Here you go. - Thanks.

287
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:03,947
Hey, I told you to come quickly. You little...

288
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:05,977
Get in.

289
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:09,917
Why are you so late?

290
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:11,546
Darn it.

(Funeral Arrangements and Data on the Late Mun Song Myeon)

294
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:18,917
We all remember the vigorous speech of this man...

295
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,556
from 30 years ago.

296
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,856
The ideal society I have in mind is people living in unity,

297
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:26,356
and where everyone doesn't worry about food, clothing,

298
00:27:26,356 --> 00:27:27,996
and other things like that.

299
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,996
Where people don't commit dirty acts,

300
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:33,566
and a world where everyone can live their daily lives happily.

301
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:37,237
To him, there was a heartbreaking death of one man.

302
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,737
Last July 2, at Yeoeuido St. Mary's Hospital,

303
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:43,336
a 15-year-old laborer died of mercury poisoning.

304
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:47,177
The name of the boy who died at 15 from mercury poisoning...

305
00:27:47,177 --> 00:27:48,816
was Mun Song Myeon.

306
00:27:48,816 --> 00:27:52,286
He always said he wanted to visit his home in the countryside.

307
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:55,117
That's what lingers in my head the most.

308
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:56,816
He said he couldn't wait to go home.

309
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,326
Born from parents who farmed in the countryside,

310
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:01,296
he was the third son out of six siblings,

311
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:03,996
and he was a sincere and kind child.

312
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:08,137
The reason he started working at a factory when he was 15...

313
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:10,197
was because of his high school tuition.

314
00:28:10,197 --> 00:28:12,867
It was a company that made mercury thermometers.

315
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,707
When he was working,

316
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:18,147
he didn't have any idea that something was wrong.

317
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:19,947
He was the tallest one.

318
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:22,746
He was taller and healthier than friends his age,

319
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:24,987
and about a month after he started working at the factory,

320
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:27,786
he started to suffer from an unknown pain.

321
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:29,457
What's wrong? Are you sick?

322
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,187
- My back hurts, and I can't sleep. - Your back?

323
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:34,996
The university hospital couldn't identify his disease,

324
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:37,566
and his body felt numb and sore.

325
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:40,397
He couldn't even eat properly. The pain was so severe...

326
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:43,637
that even his teeth started shaking and falling out.

327
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:46,167
After being hospitalized for two months,

328
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,377
his disease was identified as mercury poisoning.

329
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:51,846
The company ordered him to inject mercury inside a closed space...

330
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:53,647
without any safety equipment.

331
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:57,016
As a result, he suffered from acute mercury poisoning.

332
00:28:57,746 --> 00:28:58,987
But his company...

333
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,586
refused to accept it as an industrial accident,

334
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:04,026
claiming it was due to pesticides from the countryside.

335
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:06,157
After this case was covered by the media,

336
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:08,526
it was finally accepted as an industrial accident...

he passed away without even leaving a will.

It's already been more than 30 years.

344
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:26,346
But nothing has changed.

345
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:29,576

00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:07,556
What am I missing?

363
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,756
Is it an industrial accident or not?

364
00:30:09,756 --> 00:30:11,026
Is it, or is it not?

365
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,026
Mr. Huh.

366
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:13,996
Let's try that again.

367
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,556
I'll carry it with me...

368
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:17,397
and take care of it.

369
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:18,526
Peace.

370
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,127
I was thoughtless.

371
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:22,737
I won't cause trouble for TL ever again.

372
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,036
Like you asked, I made some changes to UDC.

373
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,177
What have you done to UDC?

374
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:30,546
Do you know how many innocent people got hurt or died?

375
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:31,977
One day,

376
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,276
you'll be brought to justice.
