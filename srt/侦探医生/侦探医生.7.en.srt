1
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,130
Who are you?

2
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:51,230
- Who are you? - Darn.

3
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,340
Keep your voice down.

4
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,201
I have something for you, so come here.

5
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,711
Come over here.

6
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:05,811
Darn it!

00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:33,440
(Doctor Detective)

8
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,910
(Episode 4)

9
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,130
Look at that. There you go!

10
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,570
- Are you going to work? - Yes.

11
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:06,141
Mommy! Mommy!

12
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,680
Mommy...

13
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,421
Seo Rin!

14
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,071
- Give her to me. - It's okay, I'll carry her.

15
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:40,011
Mr. Choi, if you take Seo Rin out like this without telling me,

16
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:41,780
Chairman Choi will be very upset with me.

17
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,310
Ms. Kim, it's all right.

18
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,221
I'm her dad.

19
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:06,631
Mommy.

20
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,441
I'm so relieved you're okay.

21
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:18,011
What if that car alarm didn't go off?

22
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:21,321
But I don't understand.

23
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,321
You heard the car screeching, right?

24
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,120
Then does it mean that pervert ran away?

25
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,261
It's probably not just a pervert.

26
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:31,430
Were there two people?

27
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,530
- Really? - No, it was just one guy.

28
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:37,671
Ms. Byun, install security cameras and streetlamps within this month.

29
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,131
- Okay. - Let's go talk.

30
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,740
Were there two people?

31
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,881
Who are you suspecting right now?

32
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,511
Don't tell me it's TL.

33
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,951
I'm not sure about one side, but the other side seems like them.

34
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,750
I had a bad argument with Choi Tae Young yesterday afternoon.

35
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:05,231
Come on, no way. He has a social status to maintain.

36
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:10,131
Excuse me.

37
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,671
- Min. - Hi, Joong Eun. It's me.

38
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:20,141
- Did you see my text? - I did.

39
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,981
Please look into it for me.

40
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,041
I'm sorry for asking this type of favor.

41
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:27,750
It's okay. I don't have a shift this afternoon. Let's meet.

42
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,421
Let's meet and talk. I'll go see you.

43
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,250
Min, wait...

44
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,661
Does it taste good?

45
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:44,161
Of course. It's civilian food.

46
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:48,271
So am I fired from UDC now?

47
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:50,541
Of course.

48
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,440
You assaulted someone during an epidemiological survey.

49
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,411
Min Ki, it's time for you to go.

50
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,180
- Did you think I'd say that? - "Did you think I'd say that?"

51
00:04:58,711 --> 00:05:00,981
Personal jinx. You're quite sharp.

52
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,750
Here's the deal. A salary cut plus...

53
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,151
taking full civil and criminal responsibility.

54
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,060
- You better accept that. - Yes, whatever.

55
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,291
Did the results of the analysis for that sack I brought come out?

56
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,461
It's not the time for me to be like this. I should get going.

57
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,200
My goodness.

58
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:20,500
He came to his senses after spending a night in jail.

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,240
(A global inspection agency that leads innovation)

(Undiagnosed Disease Center)

61
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,581
Jin Hak. Jin Yi is in the lab, right?

62
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,250
Wait, Min Ki. I have good news.

63
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,361
The dashcam on that jerk's car wasn't working.

64
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:45,260
- Really? - I guess the card wasn't fully in.

65
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,060
So you'll only be charged with...

66
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,461
assaulting that piece of trash. That's it.

67
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:50,861
What a relief.

68
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:53,101
I must've lost my mind.

69
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:55,140
Do you know how much it costs to repair that car?

70
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:58,111
You don't have to worry anymore since luck is on our side.

71
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,490
Come on, Joong Eun.

72
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,331
My family wouldn't do something so lowly like that.

73
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:23,430
Last night,

74
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,901
a car that had its plate covered tried to hit me.

75
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:31,870
To be precise, I think it was meant to scare me.

76
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,240
I had a bad argument with Tae Young yesterday.

77
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:39,911
Why did you argue with him?

78
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,620
It's obvious.

79
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,390
He just wants me to lay low and stop working.

80
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:49,461
My brother wouldn't go that far.

81
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:51,490
You're the mother of his child.

82
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:53,831
It's because he loves you so much.

83
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:58,200
If he keeps loving me like this, maybe he'll kill me next.

84
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,300
Perhaps.

85
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,101
Perhaps.

86
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,740
Can't I even crack a joke?

87
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,341
He can never hurt you.

88
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,351
He hasn't gotten over you.

89
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:14,620
He's just an innocent fool in love.

90
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:23,260
Oh, right.

91
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,760
Joong Eun, try some of this.

92
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,361
I bought it thinking of you.

93
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:31,971
These were on sale. They were displayed outside.

94
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:34,200
I'll eat these. You can eat the expensive ones.

95
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,070
It's true. My family is unusual, so I'll look into it for you.

96
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:44,550
But my brother is normal.

97
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,781
And he really hasn't gotten over you.

98
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,351
I hope you're not mistaken.

99
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,791
So you mean that everyone is on my side except for the manager?

100
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,060
I'm glad you brought that up.

101
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,971
Don't you worry. I'll take care of everything.

102
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,440
Mr. Kim's locker is in here.

103
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,240
He also gave his consent for you to look inside.

104
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:13,711
He went home after today's morning shift.

105
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,310
You can trust me.

106
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,721
(Kim Young Han)

107
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,271
His peak expiratory flow rate isn't much different,

108
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:49,180
and I don't think his asthma is due to the flour either.

109
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:50,841
This case is a bust.

110
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:53,010
Look carefully, Min Ki.

111
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,380
Why don't we just sue the owner of this place...

112
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,920
on charges of assault and blackmail?

113
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,221
Are you kidding me? Do you think we're lawyers?

114
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:02,120
Why are you getting angry?

115
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,931
I'm just saying we should be open to every possibility.

116
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:17,801
What is that?

117
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:19,640
Goodness.

118
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,240
- Really? - Yes.

119
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:25,211
Have some bread.

120
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:29,321
You went to the bakery again?

121
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:31,990
You should get some rest. You must be exhausted.

122
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,120
Did you find anything?

123
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:37,920
This is what Mr. Huh asked for. We found nothing.

(Analysis Result)

125
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:40,790
Did you see Mr. Huh?

126
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,561
He got all angry because we didn't find anything.

127
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,971
"Other organic matters".

128
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,101
That's not harmful to the body, and we only found a tiny speck.

129
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,471
Let's run a detailed analysis.

130
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,380
It may not be harmful on its own,

131
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,240
but it may not be the case when it is heated.

132
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,681
Let's just make sure.

133
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,611
Sounds good. Okay.

134
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:03,750
Doh Joong Eun!

135
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,091
Why aren't you taking care of Huh Min Ki?

136
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:09,390
How many times did I tell you to take him with you to the site?

137
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,831
Look after him, will you?

138
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:13,331
He keeps throwing fits,

139
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:15,760
saying he's always left out and lashes out at me.

140
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,201
And by the way...

141
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,201
Hey.

142
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:21,231
Did she just ignore me?

143
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,770
Gosh.

144
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,711
What are you doing on our property without a warrant?

145
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,481
Well, I found a lot of bread lying around...

146
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:32,811
since this is a bakery...

147
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:34,280
for crying out loud.

148
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:35,750
Forget it.

149
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,091
Why did you scrap all that bread piled over there?

150
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,990
Do you expect me to tell you everything regarding our business?

151
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,530
It's shady. Why would you throw away food?

152
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,931
Well, that's confidential information.

153
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:49,701
Why, you little...

154
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:52,770
Who taught you to act like that?

155
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,071
Please leave.

156
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:55,301
Fine.

157
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,811
Just let me have one bite.

158
00:10:58,811 --> 00:10:59,811
Let me have one bite.

159
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:02,481
One bite, my foot. I'll give you a whole bundle.

160
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:04,981
Excuse me, give him some bread. Help him out!

161
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,681
Hey, stop right there!

162
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,951
- Don't you dare touch me! - Come with us, sir.

163
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,451
I'm practically a public official, you jerks!

164
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:11,851
- All right, sir. - You know what?

165
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,390
- Goodbye, sir! - I have the right to investigate!

166
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,071
Were you kicked out?

167
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:26,170
Did you see that?

168
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,441
Good job.

169
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,140
I know things can get tough.

170
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,040
Why?

171
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:36,640
I can't stand it when you get all soft!

172
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,551
Just be yourself.

173
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,920
Take a look at this.

174
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,620
Something doesn't seem right.

175
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,961
I thought the bakers were all on your side?

176
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,061
Why didn't you ask them to bring one over?

177
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:55,361
They've got them piled up in the warehouse,

178
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,431
all locked up.

179
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,170
Those jerks.

180
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,740
These were on sale.

181
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,040

Okay.

187
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,000
There.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,130
I'm sure the same substance will show up.

189

197
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,351
It could only mean they messed around with it. Don't you agree?

That's what UDC is in charge of.

234
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,140
We have to look into the circumstances, too.

It's good to hear that he has gotten your approval.

241
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,120
I wouldn't call it "approval".

242
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,160
Sure.

not call for me.

Please, help her out and tend her wounds.

252

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,440
Just help me out, Ms. Gong.

257
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,910
She's better than me.

258
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,081
Please...

259
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:49,680
Be careful. She's a bit sensitive.

260
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,420
- Okay. - Here. Be careful.

261
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:58,791

262
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,730
you can't keep causing trouble like this.

263
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,771
You're the one who's supposed to be here to help me out,

264
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:07,700
but if I have to keep helping you...

265
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:11,841

266
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,910
Ms. Gong...

267
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,690
You missed this side.

268
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:34,861
Why is your hand so chapped?

269
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,101
What perfume are you wearing?

270
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:43,440
I just...

271
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,170

272
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,170

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,370
Come to my room.

274
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:54,210
I baked it this morning, sir.

275
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,200
I've had...

276
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:15,670
too much to handle these days that my body feels so weary.

277
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:19,041
Did you drug me?

278
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:30,021
How long have you been working here, Mr. Kim?

279
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:33,491
About... four years.

280
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:39,031
So you've been working here for four years...

281
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,430
and were you trying to be considerate...

282
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:43,061

My body feels so weary. I should play some golf.

286
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:56,811
Yes, sir.

287
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,311
- Go bring my clubs. - Sure.

288
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,450
Wait, hang on.

289
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,390
I have the balls right here so just bring the clubs.

290
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:07,991
- Yes, sir. I'll go bring them. - Okay.

291
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,741
- What's the par on this? - It's par three, sir.

292
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,081
Okay, I'll start with the seven iron.

293
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,011
I'll grab the seven iron for you, sir.

294
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:42,021
Mr. Kim.

295

299
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:54,831

310
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,170
- Bring another ball. - Yes, sir.

- What did you find? - I need to verify it first.

363
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,031
- What about you? - I need to verify it first too.

364
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:47,370
Hello. Good day, guys.

365
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:53,640
- My apologies. - Gosh, you scared us.

366
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
(Locker Number)

367
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:11,061
Ms. Doh, the manager is outside now.

368
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,660
You have to be careful, okay?

369
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,870
(General Waste)

370
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,811
(Women's Change Room)

371
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,081
The women's change room.

372
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:21,960
(Locker Number)

373
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,480
You're hiding something, aren't you?

374
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,720
What do you mean?

375
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,051
I know...

376
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,950
that you're lying to me now.

377
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,491
You can't sleep because you have to earn money for your son's tuition.

378
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,061
There were dozens of instant coffee sachets in your locker.

379
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,301
(Kim Young Han)

380
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,571
Even the day we first met, you had already drank...

381
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:09,210
at least 3 or 4 of them.

382
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:12,751
You work two jobs at night, which must be exhausting,

383
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:14,180
so I'm sure you rely on coffee.

384
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:17,021
And that's why you've lost at least 10kg since the time...

385
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:19,821
you took the photo with your son before he went abroad a year ago.

386
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:22,561
How did I know your son is studying abroad?

387
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,061
Here.

388
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:28,230
All the streetlights in this photo have incandescent light bulbs.

389
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:30,831
Surprisingly, the Ivy League schools are slow to adopt new technology,

390
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:34,130
whereas most of the streetlights in Korea now use LED bulbs.

391
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,001
And these gloves. You probably brought them...

392
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:41,710
because you were in a rush to get to work after your night shift.

393
00:27:41,841 --> 00:27:43,710
The various types of paint and adhesives including...

394
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,910
isocyanates on these gloves.

395
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:49,751
They can certainly cause asthma.

396
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:50,880
No, that's not true.

397
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,420
I'm certain that I developed the symptoms while working here.

398
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,660
That's why I filed a claim for occupational disease benefits.

399
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,561
It may take a while to show symptoms in case of occupational asthma.

400
00:28:01,061 --> 00:28:02,261
That's why it can be confusing.

401
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,930
Well, I didn't intend to hide this from you.

402
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:10,640
My son is finishing up his last semester.

403
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:13,741
I couldn't tell him about working two jobs...

404
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:16,680
because he hates it when I take on part-time jobs.

405
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,781
You live alone, right?

406
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:27,821
You're making all these sacrifices for your son,

407
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,291
but he may not want that.

408
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,960
My son has no idea.

409
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:35,591
He can't know about any of this.

410
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,831
Well, sir.

411
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,870
Then what will happen to my claim?

412
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:47,470
Will I not get the benefits?

413
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,480
I'm not sure.

414
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,650
Nothing's easy. Life is so hard.

415
00:28:58,821 --> 00:28:59,851
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,420
Don't...

417
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:05,291
apologize like that, please.

418
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,970
Mr. Kim, what is the matter with you?

419
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:20,210
You're never on time.

420
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,370
Just quit if you can't be punctual!

421
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,680
Dad.

422
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:09,390
Min Ki.

423
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,291
I'm okay, so you should go.

424
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,531
Go and study.

425
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:17,331
You hurt your back. You should take a day off.

426
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,571
I'm fine. You can go now.

427
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,170
Okay, I'll go.

428
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:25,741
Min Ki.

429
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:30,811
Buy yourself a treat.
