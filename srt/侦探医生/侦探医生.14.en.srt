1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,080
The factory has stopped running
because of you people!

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,110
I told you,
it wasn't an industrial accident.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,590
Joon Sung had his back
against the wind that day.

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,089
It's because of that wind.

5
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,569
(Industrial Accident)

6
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,670
On the day of the accident,
the wind was blowing northwest.

7
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,809
Normally, the corrosive gas
would have blown the other way,

8
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,810
but at a place that is full
of random structures like this,

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,880
the flow would swirl
the other way around...

10
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,180
and create a vortex.

11
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:17,419
(Vortex is a phenomenon...)

12
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,650
(where part of a flow
whirls the other way.)

13
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,789
(Industrial Accident)

14
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:28,529
(Industrial Accident)

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
Kim Joon Sung may have
had his back against the wind,

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,500
but he inhaled the poisonous gas.

17
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,600
(Industrial Accident)

18
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,909
(Eastern Police Station)

19
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,369
Fortunately, Joon Sung woke up
at the intensive care unit.

20
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,970
Yes. It's a good thing.

21
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,740
It really is.

22
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,379
About the Gramoxone.

23
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,249
Don't ever think
about doing that again.

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,190
Thank you for solving the case.

25
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:32,819
But...

26
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,359
I've hit rock bottom.

27
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,030
That was the last exam.

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,840
Now, it's really over.
It's all over.

29
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,740
When you think it's over,

30
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:49,639
you realize that it actually isn't.

31
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,009
Things will get better.

32
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,510
And you have a wonderful person
by your side.

33
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,299
I'm impressed by you.

34
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,399
I couldn't have done what you did.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,740
If it weren't for you,

36
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,610
this case would've been concluded
as murder.

37
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:25,079
No, everyone at the UDC
did it together.

38
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,449
If it weren't for you,

39
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,449
we would've never even imagined
the possibility of a vortex.

40
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,350
Gosh, well...

41
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,750
I'm quite good, aren't I?

42
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,990
I mean, I have good instincts.

43
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,630
Oh, why don't we do this?

44
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,289
We'll call you "Doctor Detective".

45
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,159
I'll be "Doctor Investigator".

46
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,329
And Il Sun will be
"Doctor Prosecutor",

47
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,530
the head honcho of the UDC.

48
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,269
Let's go.

49
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,019
Jin Yi.

50
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,719
Jin Hak.

51
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,520
- Did you have a lot to analyze?
- Yes.

52
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,390
I was conducting an analysis...

53
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,289
to see if our wedding date
will be a lucky day.

54
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,370
- Jin Yi.
- Yes.

55
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:24,039
I should go see an eye doctor.

56
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,169
Why? What's wrong?

57
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,840
Except for you,

58
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,680
everything else in the world
appears colorless and dull.

59
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,580
Stop it.

60
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,010
My gosh.

61
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,619
Mr. Ha.

62
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,329
Why are you sleeping here?

63
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,130
Oh, Ms. Suk. Gosh.

64
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,170
I guess you're exhausted.

65
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,640
Nothing energizes you
like chocolate does.

66
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,950
Gosh, it looks like there was
a torrential downpour here.

67
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
Hang on.

68
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:19,089
Don't women give chocolate
to men they like?

69
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,000
I knew it. I wondered why
she kept giving me chocolate.

70
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,699
This was her signal.

71
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,010
How am I going to manage things
in life...

72
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,040
when I'm this bad
at picking up on hints?

73
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,809
My goodness.

74
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:43,149
She should just be
straightforward with me.

75
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,120
We really shouldn't trust anyone.

76
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,550
How could just one phone call
cancel the parliamentary inspection?

77
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:52,959
My naivety got the better of me,
once again.

78
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,190
Tae Young.

79
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,729
Are you really going to
leave for China?

80
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,600
Let's work together
to figure out a way...

81
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,329
to corner Mr. Moh.

82
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,030
No.

83
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,339
We can't keep doing
what we've been doing.

84
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,070
We should change our ways.

85
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,610
How?

86
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,180
We should compromise a little.

87
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,110
Compromise and bow down
for the time being.

88
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,350
Then the right time will come.

89
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,660
Just wait and see.

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,020
I have a plan.

91
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,660
This is the chemical
pneumonitis patient...

92
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:31,359
that exhibited symptoms of fibrosis.

93
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,759
Overall, the patient exhibited
emphysematous changes,

94
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,470
and necrotic tissue began to form
in the areas...

95
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,130
where the pulmonary architecture
was damaged,

96
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,240
accompanied by pulmonary fibrosis.

97
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:42,209
I heard it wasn't actually caused
by pesticide poisoning.

98
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,280
Correct. It was
an occupational lung disease.

99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,050
Pathology doesn't always provide us
with the final answer, right?

100
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:50,979
We see the traces
left on the body...

101
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,919
but can't always
figure out the cause.

102
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,289
I heard the UDC managed
to prove that it wasn't murder.

103
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,189
- Yes.
- All right.

104
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:01,489
Let's stop focusing so much
on the cells...

105
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:05,299
and take the environment
and situation into consideration.

106
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,629
Thank you, everyone.
We'll wrap up here.

107
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,239
When Tae Young is back from China,

108
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:18,779
the whole family should gather
at your place. Hwan Hee's dad too.

109
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:26,449
Dad, is something bothering you?

110
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,820
Is it because of the suspicious man
breaking into the VIP ward?

111
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,430
Are you still worried about it?

112
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:35,929
No.

113
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,759
It's all been sorted out.

114
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,199
Min.

115
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,070
Do you know...

116
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,039
what Joong Eun is up to these days?

117
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:52,279
Well...

118
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,850
No, not really.

119
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,850
Don't let her see Seo Rin, okay?

120
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,560
I only did it because Seo Rin
was having such a hard time.

121
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,129
Min, listen.

122
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,300
Your immediate family members
are the only people you can trust.

123
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,240
Don't ever forget that.

124
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,510
Okay.

125
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,310
Yes, I think so.

126
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,009
Oh, there he is.

127
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:08,119
Has everything
been well with you, Mr. Moh?

128
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,219
You must be very busy.

129
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,960
No, it's not that bad.
Please have a seat.

130
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,120
- Yes.
- Thank you.

131
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,459
Ms. Gong, please come in.

132
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:59,339
(Government Complex)

133
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,279
Ms. Gong Il Sun.

134
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,350
Yes, ma'am.

135
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,789
As for the UDC,

136
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,119
I took care of them
as per your instructions, sir.

137
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:21,559
Great, well done.

138
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:25,259
I knew that it had to be done,

139
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,230
but is there a reason why
you suddenly changed your mind?

140
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:31,839
Well, there's no specific reason.

141
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,709
I see.

142
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,510
(TL Seoul Medical Center)

143
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,279
I thought you were in China.

144
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,420
I'm leaving soon.

145
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,990
Thanks to you, I have a lot
to take care of before my departure.

146
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,029
Gosh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

147
00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:00,659
Oh, I came to see the chairman
because he summoned me.

148
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,270
He wanted an update...

149
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,270
on what we're doing
to put a stop on the UDC.

150
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,670
Is that going well?

151
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,640
Well, there has been
some achievements.

152
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,679
Oh, really? That's great news.
Well done.

153
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:20,619
Keep up the great work.

154
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,449
You're probably busy.

155
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,859
You should get going.

156
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,190
All right.

157
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,310
That's good. Thanks.

158
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,880
What brings you here?
You didn't even call.

159
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,949
I just wanted to see you today
for some reason.

160
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,089
What's gotten into you?

161
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,590
Well, about
the parliamentary inspection...

162
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,760
I should've been more thoughtful.

163
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,070
From now on, I'll never do anything
that may harm TL's reputation.

164
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,140
I should do my part.

165
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,169
Is that so?

166
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:14,839
Oh, right.

167
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,380
Didn't you see Mr. Moh?

168
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,339
He left a few minutes ago.

169
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,480
Really?

170
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,480
No, I didn't see him.

171
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,089
All right.

172
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:33,389
Right, I hope everything goes well
in China.

173
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,490
Yes, I'll take care of everything.

174
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:49,069
Well, about the waste materials...

175
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,740
Won't there be any problem
in the future?

176
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
We checked the soil
at the site in Namil,

177
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,450
and there were no spills or leaks.

178
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,849
It's been 50 years,
and nothing's being detected,

179
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,080
so you can consider it
permanent, sir.

180
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,220
I see.

181
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,329
I spoke to Governor Murker
in Arizona on the phone earlier.

182
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,760
He's very happy
with the automobile factory.

183
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,799
I see.

184
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:18,039
The US Armed Forces
won't pressure us anymore.

185
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,499
You just need to look after
what your father had agreed to, sir.

186
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,339
It's a win-win for everyone.

187
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
Now, we just need...

188
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:27,539
to get the biotech complex off
to a good start.

189
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,550
Exactly.

190
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,180
(TL Seoul Medical Center)

191
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,750
Joong Eun.

192
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:06,079
Did anything happen
between you and my dad?

193
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,340
Aren't you calling it a day?

194
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:34,309
You startled me. What's up?
You didn't even call.

195
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,450
What was that about?
Who were you texting?

196
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,820
Are you dating someone secretly?

197
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:42,489
I wish.

198
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,320
Let's go.

199
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,390
We should get some rest.

200
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,189
Okay, let's go.

201
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,139
We'd like a bottle of soju.

202
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,310
- One bottle of soju, please.
- Sure.

203
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,549
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

204
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,490
- You ordered this, right? Enjoy.
- Yes, thank you.

205
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:22,529
- Great.
- Thanks.

206
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,829
Joong Eun,
congratulations on solving the case.

207
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,469
- Yes.
- Joong Eun.

208
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,870
Doh Joong Eun.

209
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,180
- Why did you drink so much?
- You weren't asleep, right?

210
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,309
Let's get some sleep.

211
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,950
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

212
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,819
You drink every other day.

213
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,520
Darn it. Those TL jerks...

214
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,330
Gosh, they're driving me bonkers.

215
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,729
Darn it, those punks...

216
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:01,929
Joong Eun.

217
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,269
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,110
I have no power.

219
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,640
Gosh, there's nothing I can do.

220
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,140
No, I'm sorry.

221
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,680

and from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.)

(Tuesdays and Thursdays)

224
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,819
Ms. Byun, you're early today.

225
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

226
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,790
- You came in so early.
- Yes, I had to get something done.

227
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,340
Yes. So you have some time today?

228
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,709
Then I'll stop by around lunchtime.

229
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:50,049
Yes. No, nothing's going on.

230
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,679
Right, okay.

231
00:16:58,619 --> 00:16:59,689
Where are you going?

232
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:01,659
Don't you have work to do?

233
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:03,989
I'll be right back.

234
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,060
If you take a while, you'll be
reprimanded for being late.

235
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:09,429
I was just kidding.

236
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,699
- For lunch, how about...
- Sorry, I've got to run.

237
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:16,039
What's with her today?

238
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,609
Ramyeon tastes the best when
the noodles aren't fully cooked.

239
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,850
But the noodles look barely cooked.

240
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,280
Gosh, I can't even eat.

241
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,989
Thank you for calling the UDC.

242
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,349
Hello?

243
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,819
Hye Mi?

244
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,789
Hey, I'll take it.

245
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,560
Hello? Hey, it's me.

246
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,130
Didn't you say you'd stop by
in the afternoon?

247
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,350
Excuse me. Hello.

248
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,590
Where is
Yonghyun Industrial Complex?

249
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,890
This whole area is part
of Yonghyun Industrial Complex.

250
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:07,089
Really?

251
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,230
Thank you.

252
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,950
Thanks for meeting me.

253
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,520
The UDC...

254
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,090
What did you do?

255
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,760
You want to get right to the point?
Come on. Don't be so cold.

256
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,559
Let's catch up first.

257
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,699
How are you doing?

258
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,400
Joong Eun.

259
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,109
When you encounter your enemy,

260
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,679
you must hide your claws first.

261
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,910
Smile a little.

262
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,380
Only then will your enemy
let his guard down.

263
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,089
And he'll reveal
more weaknesses as well.

264
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,660
I'm only here
because I have something to say.

265
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,660
Leave the UDC alone.

266
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:27,299
It's ridiculous.

267
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,540
Why did the small research center
with less than 10 staffers...

268
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,880
become TL's target?

269
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,379
What are you so afraid of?

270
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,420
Do you think I obstructed them
because I'm afraid of them?

271
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,790
Then what's your reason?

272
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,890
It was because of you.

273
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:48,429
I need you now.

274
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,109
The green light is on.
You may cross.

275
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,319
Hye Mi!

276
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:51,889
Park Hye Mi!

277
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,190
Hye Mi!

278
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,299
Mr. Huh?

279
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:11,509
Hey!

280
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,519
I'll never go back to TL.

281
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,159
Do you see that?

282
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,759
When I was young,

283
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:10,599
this was all farmland.

284
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,899
At night, it got so dark
that you couldn't even see anything.

285
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,410
Do you know
how this country came this far?

286
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,410
Are you going to say...

287
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:24,749
it's because of your contributions?

288
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,950
My contributions?

289
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:27,979
No, not my contributions.

290
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,520
It was because of my will.

291
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,090
There's nothing in this country
that I can't get my way, Joong Eun.

292
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,799
It's not that way with people.

293
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,100
Do you know how many innocent people
were hurt and killed...

294
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,000
just to make those buildings?

295
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,470
One day,
you will be brought to justice.

296
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,550
I'm...

297
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,889
not one who gets brought to justice.

298
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:06,459
I'm the one who judges.

299
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,689
You still don't know that?

300
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:11,059
I'm on top of those people.

301
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,730
You are still so arrogant.

302
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:15,029
Joong Eun.

303
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:17,799
Do you think
you can defeat the world?

304
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,839
No. But...

305
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:23,539
I won't ever be using
my abilities for your sake.

306
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:24,539
No.

307
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,739
You won't have a choice but to.

308
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,049
You have too many weaknesses.

309
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,560
Seo Rin and the UDC, as well.

310
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,529
A determined and competent person
isn't a powerful person.

311
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,000
One who eliminates their weaknesses
is powerful.

312
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,900
I'll get going.

313
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,340
You won't ever see me again.

314
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,450
Hello?

315
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,680
Why weren't you picking up?

316
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,350
Why? What's going on, Mr. Huh?

317
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,549
What? Hye Mi?

318
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,449
Her vitals are still stable.

319
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:14,589
But I think something was wrong
with her even before the accident.

320
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,290
I saw her from afar.

321
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,429
Her sense of direction was off
and she was about to collapse.

322
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,200
Her sense of direction was off?

323
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,400
Mr. Huh,
do you know where she worked?

324
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,670
No, I don't.

325
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,200
Which hospital is she headed to?

326
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,610
TL Seoul Medical Center.

327
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:34,879
Ms. Doh,
you're going to come, right?

328
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:36,679
We have to save Hye Mi.

329
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,350
This isn't just any car accident.

330
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,820
I have a feeling.

331
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:51,959
(An eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth. You'll suffer the same!)

332
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,969
Sir!

333
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,480
Joong Eun!

334
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,050
Sir!

335
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,319
Joong Eun!

336
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,290
Sir...

337
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,829
Sir!

338
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,990
She's having V-tach.

339
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,930
How's her blood pressure?

340
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,970
It's 80 over 50, and it's dropping.

341
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,670
Prepare the cardioversion.

342
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,240
It's ready, sir.

343
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,210
Hye Mi, I'm going to save you.

344
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:41,779
Charge.

345
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,050
It's charged, sir.

346
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,119
Move aside.

347
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,450
Shot!

348
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,520
One more time.

349
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,989
(Emergency Medical Center)

350
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,359
Is she the patient
you talked about on the phone?

351
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
Prepare the incubation
and epinephrine.

352
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,100
Incubation and epinephrine!

353
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,339
- What's going on?
- Please wait.

354
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:08,639
What are you talking about?

355
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,240
- What do you think you're doing?
- Move over!

356
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,569
Please wait.
It will only take two minutes.

357
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,539
- Two minutes, my foot! Move!
- Hurry!

358
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,879
- Move over!
- Stop that!

359
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,050
Move it!

360
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,950
Doctor, her blood pressure
is dropping again!

361
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,050
Darn it. Move over.

362
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,319
Prepare the cardioversion.

363
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,230
Charge.

364
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,660
It's charged, sir.

365
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,500
Move over! Shoot!

366
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:36,599
- Change hands!
- What?

367
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,670
I said, change hands!

368
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,740
Yes, sir!

369
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,700
- Hey. We have to save her, okay?
- Yes, sir!

370
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,540
- I'll make way, so come after me.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:47,539
Move it, you jerks! Move!

372
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,079
Move it!

373
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,149
Let go of me!

374
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,950
Move!

375
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,320
- Move!
- Get out!

376
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,319
(Emergency Medical Center)

377
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,019
- Let go!
- Hurry up.

378
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,530
Wake up, sir!

379
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,770
Doh Joong Eun!

380
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:44,369
(Doctor Detective)

381
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,840
So many people died bloody deaths.
Why did you try to save him?

382
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,239
You should have left him to die.

383
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:51,039
Is that what you have to say
as a doctor?

384
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:55,249
Hye Mi!
She's going to die, you jerks!

385
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,680
Hye Mi!

386
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,750
- Grandpa!
- Hey!

387
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,190
It's all over because of you!

388
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,320
Did he go anywhere new
or meet a stranger?

389
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,789
Are you really suspecting me?

390
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:08,389
Watch your tongue.

391
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,260
We've decided not
to investigate this case.

392
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:14,059
Why would we back off
all of a sudden?

393
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,629
A suspected case of poisoning...

394
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,200
from organic solvents
has occurred here.

395
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,070
We will be running measurements...

396
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,969
with the CNC machines
operating normally.
