187
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:22,325
Hence, many are speculating that the accident might have been...

188
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:24,124
caused by the victim's negligence.

189
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:25,695
This is from the security footage.

190
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:28,364
As you can see, the victim, Mr. Jung, is drinking something.

191
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:31,634
He puts it back into his backpack and starts walking.

192
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:34,035
The police stated that they found...

193
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:37,535
a plastic soju bottle among the victim's belongings.

194
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:46,945
Where are his belongings?

195
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:50,354
Where are Ha Rang's belongings?

196
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:56,354
Don't waste your time.

197
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:57,655
I just need to check something.

198
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:03,065
We've already checked and confirmed everything.

199
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:06,264
Please don't act emotionally like this.

200
00:14:06,264 --> 00:14:07,905
You went through his belongings?

201
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:14,545
Ms. Doh, you cannot enter Chairman Choi's room.

202
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:21,384
Don't do anything rash, please.

203
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,624

Did you tell them to fabricate evidence?

210
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:26,775
Don't react so emotionally.

211
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:30,315
Sir, how could you plant a soju bottle that he didn't have?

212
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:32,514
I won't let this slide...

214
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:54,234
Hello?

215
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:56,175
Ms. Doh.

216
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,004
Hello?

217
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,805
- Ms. Doh is okay. - Who are you?

218
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,974
Let me talk to her.

219
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:06,585
Put her on the phone if she's really okay.

220
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:21,464
Just because she was kicked out of the family...

221
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:24,495
doesn't mean a mere gatekeeping dog can bite her.

222
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:28,035
If you're this disrespectful to her,

223
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:30,305
people will assume you're on the same level as me...

224
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,374
when I'm the CEO of the company.

225
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:35,674
Mr. Kwon.

226
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:39,944
You'll ruin everything if you handle things emotionally.

227
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:54,795
Wait outside. I need to talk to her alone.

228
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:58,664
Get out.

229
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,184
Let me...

230
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,124
apologize to you on his behalf.

231
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:27,894
I'm sorry.

232
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,565
Did you ask if I ordered my guys to fabricate evidence?

233
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:36,174
Yes.

234
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:38,134

It's not like you don't know us.

236
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:44,914
Why are you asking such a question?

237
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:49,414
Because I know...

what you're capable of.

239
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:56,424
I know what you can do, based on my own experience.

240
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:00,825
Turn on the TV.

241
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,434
After drinking,

242
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:07,465
he walks through the turnstile...

243
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:08,904
without calling the station office.

244
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,934
In the security footage,

245
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:13,444
it looks like he just had 2 to 3 sips.

246
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,674
But judging from the amount of soju left in his backpack,

247
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:20,444
we think that he drank about half a bottle that day.

248
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:22,585
- The safety of... - Turn it off.

249
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:29,654

251
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:40,465

254
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:56,715

Why must you go so far as to use Seo Rin...

258
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:10,795
just to stop me?

259
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:12,965
What are you trying to hide?

260
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:14,805

Breaking news.

267
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,644
According to the police, it seems highly likely that the victim...

268
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:57,545
- of the screen door accident... - Ma'am.

269
00:20:57,545 --> 00:20:58,815
was drunk at the time of the accident.

270
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:00,085
That is fake news.

271
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:02,285
- The accident might have been... - It's not true.

272
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:04,085
caused by the victim's negligence.

273
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,424
- After drinking, - I know it's not true.

274
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:08,525
he walks through the turnstile...

275
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:09,894
without calling the station office.

276
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,995
Then he walks into the station office...

277
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:14,525
and grabs the keys without asking for permission first.

278
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:17,364

May I see that for a second? I'm sorry.

282
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:25,075
Many are pointing out that the company...

283
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,904

- Here you go. - Thank you.

287
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:40,624
if it was an accident caused by a safety issue,

288
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:42,154
or if it happened because of an illness.

289
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:45,094
Forget it. Just put him on the phone.

290
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:46,624

Oh, my. Sorry.

He didn't drink alcohol.

307
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:50,654
I'm certain there was a water bottle inside his backpack too.

308
00:22:50,654 --> 00:22:53,825
They're just thinking he drank soju because of the circumstances.

You brat. You never give me a chance to talk.

310
00:22:57,495 --> 00:22:58,694
You'll start work here, right?

311
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:01,434
Your salary goes up annually, and you're a 2nd level official.

312

Let me warn you beforehand.

313
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:04,535
I can't guarantee you'll work less than 40 hours a week.

314
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:07,005
But instead, I'll make sure you get paid for overtime.

315
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,275
Your position will be a team leader...

316
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:10,545
It's an addiction.

317
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:13,914
What? Addicted to work? Me?

318
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:16,055
Ha Rang. I have a hunch.

319
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:17,614
Not only was there a lack of a safety system,

320
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:20,085
but he probably had a disease due to toxic substances.

321
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:21,124
Okay.

322
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,594
Then what's on your mind?

323
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:26,795
An organic solvent. There was a detergent he used often.

324
00:23:26,894 --> 00:23:29,194
It's isopropyl alcohol. Ruled out.

325
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:30,335
That was an assumption.

326
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:32,265
It might be another type of detergent.

327
00:23:32,265 --> 00:23:34,634
Okay. We need to rule out the fact that he drank first.

328
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:36,335
But how? The whole nation...

329
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:38,535
thinks he drank soju during work and got in an accident.

330
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:45,174
You can't even drink much. What did you drink for?

331
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:47,785
What? Are you saying you're a grown-up now?

332
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:52,755
He can't drink.

333
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:55,025
He was born with a lack of enzymes that can break down alcohol.

334
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:57,525
There's no way he would drink soju before going to work.

335
00:23:57,795 --> 00:23:59,525
There's no way to prove that.

336
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:00,795
Ruled out.

337
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:03,094
TL Medical Center is probably keeping Ha Rang's blood.

338
00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:05,134

Of course, it's real.

Just like the prosecution's seize and search,

349
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:29,454
one day, I'll make it an important matter.

350
00:24:29,624 --> 00:24:31,725
Well, I need to make a few amendments.

351
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,694
Bit by bit. Darn it, when will I get it done?

352
00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:38,434
You need to find his belongings that the police took.

353
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:40,664
I'm certain there will be a water bottle among them.

354
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,434
For us to take action, we need proof that he had a disease.

355
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:47,904
Until two years ago, he received a medical checkup...

356
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,844
to check for the nephrotoxic substance, n-Hexane.

357
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:53,315
But this year, he didn't receive it. You take care of the rest.

362
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:03,225

Yes, Chief.

00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:33,525
We'll investigate the cause thoroughly, sir.

365
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:35,184
Okay, thank you.

366
00:25:36,654 --> 00:25:38,894
What about Huh Min Ki? Why isn't he coming?

367
00:25:38,894 --> 00:25:40,065
Is he running late again?

368
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,094
- Yes? - Mr. Huh. Where are you?

369
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:46,035
I'm staking out in front of the police station.

370
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:47,634
You're just making an excuse for being late...

371
00:25:47,634 --> 00:25:50,174
Look for the water bottle. You won't find it.

372
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,434
- I'll see you later. - Hey!

373
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:54,144
(List of Police Agency Teams)

374
00:25:59,114 --> 00:26:00,715
This is Seo Jae Yeong of Crime Team 2.

375
00:26:00,715 --> 00:26:02,344
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,614
I must've called the wrong number.

377
00:26:04,614 --> 00:26:06,124
I'm sorry.

378
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:09,654
Seo Jae Yeong. Okay.

(Emergency Room Record, Jung Ha Rang)

380
00:26:11,094 --> 00:26:12,725
This is Ha Rang's ER record.

381
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:15,424
Multiple skin lesions all over his body.

382
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:18,094
This isn't enough to determine what it is.

383
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:20,335
We must carry out an autopsy.

384
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:21,864
Ms. Doh.

385
00:26:22,604 --> 00:26:24,535
I have the results.

386
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:27,204
We found a tiny bit of organic solvent.

387
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:31,174
Goodness, this isn't enough to prove he was poisoned.

388
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:32,575
It's going to be tough.

389
00:26:32,844 --> 00:26:34,215
Of course.

390
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,255
He can't be poisoned just by being exposed at the warehouse.

391
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:39,085
There must be another way he got exposed.

392
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:40,825
I'm just checking whether it was there or not.

393
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:43,094
Okay, fine.

394
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:46,394
By the way, you can talk to me comfortably.

395
00:26:46,394 --> 00:26:47,594
I'm younger than you.

396
00:26:48,825 --> 00:26:50,934
Oh, I'll take my time.

397

398

(Evidence number 10, 11, 12, 13)

(Evidence number 14)

401
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,275
There's no water bottle.

402
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:08,444
They probably took it out. I'm certain.

403
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:10,555
Hey, do you know how difficult it was to take this case?

404
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:11,555
We don't even have proof.

405
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:12,755
How can we say they hid the evidence?

406
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:14,354
They really did hide it.

407
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:18,654
Hey, are you okay?

408
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:21,065
Yesterday, I was really...

409
00:27:21,065 --> 00:27:22,495
Goodness.

410
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,735
You worried me sick.

411
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:25,995
I'm all right.

412
00:27:26,094 --> 00:27:28,704
But what's your issue with that TL bodyguard?

413
00:27:28,704 --> 00:27:30,575
It seemed like he knew you.

414
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:33,805
Is it a secret?

415
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,444
Wait. Let's talk about that next time.

416
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:37,874
What do you mean, they hid it?

417
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:40,545
I saw it with my own two eyes.

418
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:42,344
There was a water bottle inside his backpack.

419
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:44,755
My goodness.

420
00:27:47,154 --> 00:27:48,725
Really? Did you take a picture?

421
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:52,055
If I did, it would already be on the news by now.

422
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:53,795
Are you sure? You really saw it?

423
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:55,825
I'm sure, I'm telling you. Wait.

424
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:58,594
Are you working with us now or is this a temporary thing?

425
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:02,735
What do you think? Of course, she's working with us.

426
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:05,934
Goodness. The police have fabricated evidence.

427
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:07,775
What can we do now?

428
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:11,444
Why...

429
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,684
do you think I was staking out?

430
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:18,414
I mean, there was a rookie officer at the police station...

431
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:19,924
named Seo Jae Yeong.

432
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:21,654
These type of guys are really determined...

433
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:23,694
and if we just make up an excuse and give him a slight nudge,

434
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:25,795
he'll talk about the water bottle.

435
00:28:26,265 --> 00:28:28,364
But will he meet with us?

436
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:30,194
He won't.

437
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:34,065
That's why you have to go to the Police Hospital by 9am tomorrow...

438
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:36,305
and provide orthopedic treatment for outpatients.

439
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,275
It turns out he hurt his arm.

440
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,775
Since he's a cop, he'll go to the Police Hospital.

441
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:45,414
Finding out the schedule for outpatients...

442
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:46,914
is a piece of cake.

443
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:50,055
Hey, don't stare at him. He's showing off again.

444
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:51,454
That's because I'm really good.

445
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:56,325
They copied the medical records on the day of the accident.

446
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:57,555
The corpse is stored safely.

447
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:59,495
Did you get rid of all his blood and urine?

448
00:28:59,495 --> 00:29:01,864
- Yes. - Then let's stick to the plan.

449
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:03,394
Call Hanil SD.

450
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:04,765
Yes, sir.

451
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:22,815
Yes, Chairman Choi.

452
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,454
Yes, don't worry.

453
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:28,124
If the public opinion keeps turning against us,

454
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:30,424
I will get rid of the metro.

455
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:33,424
We should cut off any risks.
