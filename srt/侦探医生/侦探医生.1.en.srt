00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,350
(Sungrak Industry)

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,570
These labor union jerks.

4
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,249
I feel so sorry for myself.

5
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,620
Always worrying about
the labor union.

6
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,320
I heard there's a new patient,
but they didn't even tell me.

7
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:52,289
I guess they don't trust me.

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,590
Those jerks.

9
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,530
I'm worried they'll all argue
it's an industrial accident.

10
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,530
(Sungrak Restaurant)

11
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,230
It won't take long, right?

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,700
We have to finish it before
the labor union arrives.

13
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,410
What?

14
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,749
What's the matter with this?
My goodness.

15
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:15,879
Considering their age,

16
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,519
it might be flushing
due to menopause,

17
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,419
but they stated they were in pain,
so that's ruled out.

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,050
The most probable cause is UV rays.

19
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,989
But jumping to conclusions is risky.

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,290
What's up with this?

21
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,300
Ms. Doh, what are you doing?

22
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,699
Give me 10 minutes.

23
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,100
Is it a simple case of dermatitis
due to the steam...

24
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,439
and kitchen detergents?

25
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,009
But that doesn't explain the scar
on the back of their neck.

26
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,110
Ruled out.

27
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:47,209
Old cooking utensils?

28
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,779
They would have produced friction
while frying at high temperature.

29
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,550
Then heavy metal and fine dust
could have been produced.

30
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:56,019
Out of these, arsenic and chrome
can lead to a skin rash.

31
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,959
Were they exposed?
It's actually possible.

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,730
But a male worker was also
in charge of the dishes,

33
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,330
and he didn't show any symptoms.
Ruled out.

34
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,830
The UV ray sterilizer
was recently changed.

35
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,229
It was made in 2017. Ruled out.

36
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:11,399
What are you doing, Ms. Doh?

37
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,709
When did you change the water pipes?

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,110
Quite long ago.

39
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,550
My boss threw a fit...

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,110
because we spent too much money.

41
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,459
What used to be up there?

42
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,689
Probably something
like an air conditioner.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,000
Considering the space,

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,930
an air conditioner won't fit
in there.

45
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,470
It had to be heavy enough
to require three nails.

46
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,339
An air purifier,

47
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:49,439
TV, or humidifier.

48
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,910
What could it be?

49
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,679
Ms. Doh, we need to hurry.

50
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:06,919
Where is the company warehouse?

51
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,700
Here.

52
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,330
This uses UV rays to kill insects.

53
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:17,569
When the insects are
attracted to the bright UV rays,

54
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,039
they're zapped and killed
by electricity.

55
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,339
But there is something wrong
with the lamp like my expectation.

56
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,280
It's a UV ray C-lamp used
for sterilization.

57
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,079
This is what caused
the redness in their eyes and skin.

58
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,150
It was installed right next to
their table where they rested.

59
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,820
They must have been exposed to it
for quite long.

60
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,450
The men went outside
to smoke during their break...

61
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,189
and ate separately,
so they were okay.

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,520
Get rid of this before they do
an epidemiological survey tomorrow.

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,760
And change the lamp too.

64
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,329
Thank you so much.

65
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,499
You are indeed the best.

66
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,999
If they carry out
an epidemiological survey,

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,670
they'll all insist
it's an industrial accident.

68
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,040
Let's get rid of the evidence,
so that won't happen.

69
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,339
Since I'm done here,

70
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,170
why don't you pay me first?

71
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,650
Yes, sure. That slipped my mind.

72
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,219
Here you go.

73
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,820
Don't ever mention my name.

74
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,589
Of course. Don't worry.

75
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,090
I'm the only one who knows
you came here.

76
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:20,099
But who would put this
in the warehouse?

77
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,299
I know.

78
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:23,269
It can't have been those
labor union jerks.

79
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,700
I... I'm the one who did it.

80
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,900
One second.

81
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,139
Who are you?

82
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,070
That's a good pose.

83
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,410
Let's take one more shot of you
in that pose.

84
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,549
Hey, who are you?

85
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:36,509
Who are you with?

86
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,580
The epidemiological survey
is scheduled for tomorrow.

87
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,419
Well, I...

88
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,290
I'm not part of that team.

89
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:46,089
- The labor union called for...
- Gosh, look at you.

90
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,230
The company is supposed to
take care of...

91
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,789
I know they're supposed to,

92
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,259
but that "supposed to" always makes
the epidemiological survey...

93
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,400
Man...

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,430
"Man"?

95
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:58,099
It's always a mess!

96
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,169
Besides,

97
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,370
what is this?

98
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,439
There are always these jerks...

99
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,640
who try to hide away the evidence.

100
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,580
That's why we set up
a new institution.

101
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,720
It's called the UDC.

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,750
"UDC"?

103
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:12,849
It's a new institution, collaborated
by the Ministry of Labor,

104
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:13,889
the Ministry of Environment,

105
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,189
and the Ministry of Science
and Technology.

106
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,720
We're granted
independent investigation too.

107
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,820
Here.

108
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,920
(UDC, Huh Min Ki)

109
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,130
Mind your own business.

110
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,300
Article 68 of the Industrial Safety
and Health Act.

111
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,799
Anyone who deliberately conceals...

112
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,099
an industrial accident
will be fined...

113
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,270
50 thousand dollars!

114
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,109
15 thousand dollars.

115
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:40,549
And you shouldn't be
so confident yourself.

116
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,449
Isn't it illegal to search
and confiscate evidence...

117
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,550
without a warrant?

118
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,940
Min Ki.

119
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,870
I told you to watch your mouth.

120
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,409
We're public officials.

121
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Yes, ma'am!

122
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,979
- I'm the UDC.
- "UDC"?

123
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,680
Long time no see.

124
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:26,219
Ms. Doh! Where are you going?

125
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,530
Il Sun,
are you really going to let them go?

126
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,669
- That's how we get them back.
- What?

127
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,639
I'm going to recruit her to the UDC.

128
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,100
You're going to bring
someone like that?

129
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,569
Someone who hides evidence
of an industrial accident...

130
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,470
and gets kickbacks from the company?

131
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,440
She's a total thug!

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,380
Hey, Min Ki. How long did it
take you to find the evidence?

133
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,119
You were out here for a month,

134
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,880
and she found it in 10 minutes.

135
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,920
She's not just any doctor.

136
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,090
She's Doctor Detective.

(Doctor Detective)

138
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,039
You have a package.

139
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
Come and sit down.

140
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,099
Just keep talking.

(Bubble Bubble Daycare Center)

143
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,980
Are you seeing your kid?

144
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,379
Sometimes.

145
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,119
Life is so...

146
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,519
How is the medical lawsuit going?

147
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:08,629
Gosh... It wasn't even your fault.

148
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,930
How could they file a lawsuit
and even suspend your license?

149
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,329
Those jerks.

150
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,929
Let me ask you one thing.

151
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,400
Did you really get fired...

152
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,200
for working on that case?

153
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,970
You didn't even get started on it.

154
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,379
I guess they needed an excuse
if they wanted to do it properly.

155
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,910
Man...

156
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,279
Just forget about those jerks
at TL Gifted Education Foundation...

157
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,820
and come to UDC. Work with me.

158
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,959
- I'm not going.
- Aren't you going to work?

159
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,220
Did you give up on your life?

160
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,620
I'm doing fine.

161
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:44,059
Hey, how long are you going to
keep this up?

162
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,900
You're a professional
with a Ph.D. from Harvard...

163
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,469
and you're working at factories
late at night...

164
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,430
and concealing industrial accidents.

165
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,899
What are you going say to Seo Rin?

166
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,269
Seo Rin has nothing to do with this.

167
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,410
Go on and leave.

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,750
You have to promise to keep
ignoring me.

Don't tell my mom that I got drunk.

178
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,300

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,510
You got so many!

183
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,249
Are you having proper meals?

184
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,949
I saw that Ha Rang is back.

185
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,520
Yes, he's back.

186
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,730
Let's have dinner together.

187
00:10:54,729 --> 00:10:58,159
I bought tofu for
some great cheonggukjang.

188
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,530
I'm good.

189
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,870
No, you're not.

190
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,769
- Come with me.
- I...

191
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:06,099

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,260
Our house is quite a mess, isn't it?

195
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,089
Gosh, why did you drink so much
when you can't even handle it?

196
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,530
Are you trying to prove
that you're an adult now?

197
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,599
It happens now that I'm working.

198
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,000
Haven't you prepared any meat?

199
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:41,239
Meat? It's right here!

200
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,409
There's the meat.

201
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,610
There...

202
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:47,079
Here's the meat.

203
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,020
Besides,
you should take it easy at work...

204
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,449
and learn to slack off a bit.

205
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,690
Gosh, stop nagging me.

206
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,690
Dig in, Ms. Doh.

207
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,720
Okay.

208
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,399
Everything is good
about your company,

209
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,509
but they tire you out too much.

210
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,069

00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,709
Sure.
You have a great son, don't you?

215
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,180
I'll be your baby.

359
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,120
My gosh, Ha Rang. You work so hard.

360
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,190
My gosh, good to see you.
Okay.

361
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,089
Let's go.

362
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,670
He's working alone. I thought
you said they work in pairs.

363
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,540
Oh, well... His partner is
probably nearby somewhere.

364
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,470
Do you like sushi?

365
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,740
Sushi sounds yummy.

366
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:32,209
But I don't see his partner.

367
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,710
I don't see him anywhere.

368
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,350
When I come next time,

369
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,279
make sure they're working in
a team of two.

370
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:38,619
Okay?

371
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,450
Yes, sir.

372
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:44,149
Promise me.

373
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,890
I promise.

374
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,130
Stamp.

375
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:50,529
Stamp.

376
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,300
Darn it.

377
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,969
Sir, if you don't like sushi,
how about beef?

378
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,000
Sir?

379
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,059
Oh my goodness.

380
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:29,099
Ha Rang!

381
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,569
(The train is now arriving.)

382
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,510
Help!

383
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,109
Help me!

384
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,880
No!

385
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,640
Wait, you didn't give me
a vitamin shot?

386
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,880
Vitamin?

387
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,650
Look at my hand.
It's trembling like mad.

388
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,550
How could you not
give me any vitamins?

389
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,649
Don't you have a lot of
nice stuff here?

390
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,520
Why don't you give me some of
those vitamin shots? Seriously.

391
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,459
Look at my hand. Goodness.

392
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,120
Do you see it trembling?

393
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,629
Ms. Doh Joong Eun.

394
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,159
Come here.

395
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,470
Let's receive an IV injection
together. Since we met and all.

396
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,100
She totally ignored me.

397
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,969
Did I say that too quietly?

398
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,570
Why do you always insult me?

399
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,209
Ignoring my texts and calls
all the time.

400
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,980
Do you know how much
Il Sun breathes down my neck?

401
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:51,919
"Hey, Huh Min Ki.
Where's Doh Joong Eun?"

402
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,450
Huh Min Ki, Huh Min Ki!

403
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,820
- Huh Min Ki!
- Oh, gosh.

404
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,920
You scared me.

405
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,590
What is the matter with you?
Follow me.

406
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,060
I'm sorry for the trouble
every time. I'll take him.

407
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,459
Trouble? Who?

408
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,570
Goodness. Just listen to me and
don't whine that you're sick later.

409
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:10,699
Hey, Ms. Byun.

410
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,670
How could you say that to someone
who saved two people today?

411
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,870
Can you be a little more polite?

412
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,970
Come on.

413
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,379
You demanded a bribe?

414
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,380
Are you insane?

415
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,810
I'll sue you for violation
of the Anti-bribery and graft act.

416
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,879
Bribe? Who said that?

417
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:25,649
Am I wrong?

418
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,980
The guy from the metro company
said that.

419
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,449
That jerk, Mr. Goh.
How could he say that?

420
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,620
Ms. Byun, can't you trust me?

421
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,860
I practically threw myself
on those tracks...

422
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,200
and saved two citizens
who were about to die.

423
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:43,099
Goodness.

424
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,739
What on earth are you doing?

425
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,179
Getting ready for my shot.

426
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,779
Put your pants on.
This is a shot for your veins.

427
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,750
Oh, on my arm?

428
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,720
You should have told me so
in the first place.

429
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,620
Here.

430
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,960
Why did you even study...

431
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,760
Occupational and
Environmental Medicine?

432
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:18,939
To get revenge.

433
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,799
Revenge? What revenge? On who?

434
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,869
I was joking.
How could you believe that?

435
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,940
There's no night duty...

436
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,210
and I'm paid quite well.

437
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,580
But this is still
a public institution.

438
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,379
What are you doing here
with that pitiful salary?

439
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,350
You should go out and examine
patients and make serious money.

440
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,120
That's true.

441
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,460
There's a job opening at
Gangnam AMC currently.

442
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,790
I saw it on the Medijob site.

443
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,759
The salary is 250,000 dollars.

444
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,460
Right. I should leave this company.

445
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,870
You're right. It's faster for me
to just leave now.

446
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,860
Repeated hand trembling.

447
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,660
A dry cough that caused pain.

448
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,860
It wasn't a cold.

449
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,339
It's a chronic cough.

450
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:32,309
It could be tuberculosis that
was found in the dorm lately.

451
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:36,149
If it's some sort of poisoning,
what could it be?

452
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,419
Organic solvents used
before cleaning.

453
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,959
Heavy metal, dust, and chemicals.
