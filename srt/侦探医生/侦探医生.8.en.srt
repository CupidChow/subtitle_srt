1
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:32,016
Thank you.

2
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:33,886
- Goodnight, Ms. Suk. - Bye.

3
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:35,785
- Thank you. - Goodnight.

4
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:41,066
- Here you go. - Is this for me?

5
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,136
- Of course. - Thank you.

6
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:46,133
What is this?

7
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:50,063
Thank you.

8
00:00:55,843 --> 00:00:59,313
Ms. Doh, listen to me carefully from now on.

9
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:02,483
If it's because of the paint from the factory he works at night,

10
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,813
in principle, he should request for an industrial accident.

11
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:07,813
Mr. Kim was fired from that factory too.

12
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:15,793
Still, he can request that it's an industrial accident.

13
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:16,992
Anyhow, we need to prove...

14
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:19,433
it's a furniture factory instead of a bakery.

15
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,132
If he requests again, it will take another three months, right?

16
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:24,632
We don't even know when this small business will close down.

17
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:26,933
Mr. Huh.

18
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:30,002
There's a limit to how much I can put up with this.

19
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:31,942
- As long as it's under my name... - Then...

20
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:34,173
let's do it under my name.

21
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:39,653
Do you think it's because I'm afraid of being responsible?

22
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:41,013
Calm down.

23
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:43,153
First of all, go to the factory where he works at night...

24
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,752
and check for substances that can cause asthma.

25
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:45,823
I already did.

26
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:56,063
The MDI rate that causes asthma was three times higher.

27
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:58,603
I went secretly and checked.

28
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:01,132
If I didn't, we'd be wasting time with the equipment. You know that.

29
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:02,433
Here.

30
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:04,842
If Mr. Kim reapplies from the furniture factory,

31
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:06,543
I'm certain it will be proved that this was work-related.

32
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,983
So just make sure these papers get passed.

33
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:11,242
It's going to be accepted anyway,

34
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:13,212
so let's not make him suffer for another three months.

35
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:15,953
If we found a substance, he should reapply according to the procedure.

36
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:17,823
He should wait for three months.

37
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:19,122
I knew it.

38
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:22,022
We need to look at cases involving occupational asthma...

39
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:24,793
that have been reported since 2010.

40
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:26,793
Among those cases, three of them have been confirmed...

41
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,362
that mental stress was the cause instead of a substance.

42
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:32,203
It's not a high probability, but there are actual precedents.

43
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:35,402
Are you claiming this is an asthma attack due to job stress?

44
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,173
It's too ambiguous. This won't be passed.

45
00:02:38,342 --> 00:02:39,513
Seriously.

46
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:41,772
It will pass.

47
00:02:41,772 --> 00:02:43,913
If you look at the medical reports,

48
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,112
Mr. Kim visited the hospital due to asthma mostly last January.

49
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:49,182
To be exact, he went every Monday afternoon.

50
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:51,182
Why? Because every Monday morning,

51
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,853
there was a staff meeting.

52
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:55,592
And the owner hosted that meeting himself since last January.

53
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,392
The cause-and-effect checks out.

54
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:58,562
What's surprising is...

55
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:01,362
this case of an asthma attack that resulted in death last year.

56
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,062
The owner hosted his so-called meeting...

57
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:04,902
and bullied him harshly to provoke his asthma.

58
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:07,402
But unfortunately, he ended up dying.

59
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:10,973
If we don't get to the bottom of this, someone else might die.

60
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:14,473
Do you have official data of that staff meeting?

61
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:17,142
Yes. It's saved on the Webmaster calendar.

62
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:29,193
So job stress is the common cause for the two asthma patients.

63
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,862
There's a 2012 thesis on the connection between...

64
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:34,062
stress and asthma attacks. I'll give it to you, so attach it.

65
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:36,862
Also, I'm the head researcher.

66
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:38,462
I'll take responsibility.

67
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:40,703
Thank you.

68
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:44,402
They found traces of melamine from the red sack.

69
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:46,112
It's a substance that shouldn't be in food.

70
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:47,973
Do you remember the milk powder incident from 10 years ago?

71
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:49,943
That melamine?

72
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,543
Ms. Gong said it's not our business and told me to drop it,

73
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:54,082
but I reported it to the Food and Drug Administration.

74
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:56,052
Their business will be suspended for at least three months.

75
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:57,652
Nice job.

76
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:59,652
(Thank you for your support all this time.)

77
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:01,992
- Did you hear news of the owner? - No.

78
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,592
The head baker called me and said he got arrested.

79
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,163
For installing a hidden camera.

80
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:17,973
Is this the Crime Team of Namil Police Station?

81
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,343
I have something to report.

82
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:22,882
(Letter of Resignation)

83
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:27,213
What is this? Are you getting married?

84
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:31,783
No. I can't stand the sight of you, so I quit.

85
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:39,692
So Young. You know how much I care for you, right?

86
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:42,492
Don't you know?

87
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:47,033
Why don't we talk over a glass of wine?

88
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,173
Let go of me, you crazy jerk.

89
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:53,012
Hey. Do you think I didn't know what you were up to?

90
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:56,143
You brat. Come here.

91
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:57,242
Hey!

92
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,283
I was nice to you because of your looks. Are you crazy?

93
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:02,012
- Who are you? - Stop this.

94
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:03,122
- You are under arrest... - What is this?

95
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:04,983
for violation of article 14 of the Sexual Violence Law.

96
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:06,752
- Hey. - You can hire an attorney...

97
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:08,293
and have the right to remain silent.

98
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:11,362
What on earth? Let go! Do you know who I am?

99
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:18,132
Stay still!

100
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,132
Go and rot in jail, you crazy pervert.

101
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:24,143
- Hey! - Shut up, you jerk.

102
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:30,913
- Come here. - Let go. I can walk on my own.

103
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,012
I feel sick. He was a total filthy pervert.

104
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:35,182
The company's financial affairs were a mess,

105
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:36,822
and he'll be charged with embezzlement and malpractice too.

106
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:40,023
Ms. Doh, good job.

107
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:51,132
Il Sun. I took care of the asthma case.

108
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:52,702
I need to do some last-minute checking,

109
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,333
so I'll drop by the site and go home.

110
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,773
I'll submit the report tomorrow. Salute!

111
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,112
You don't have to salute me.

112
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:01,543
Unity.

113
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:03,742
We need to unite as one now. Okay?

114
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:07,653
- Depending on how nice you are. - You punk...

115
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:09,112
Goodness.

116
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:15,893
I found it during last night's patrol.

117
00:06:16,362 --> 00:06:18,492
I didn't know whose it was and checked it at home.

118
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,432
I think you should take a look at it yourself.

119
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,273
(I solemnly swear to keep all of the above strictly confidential.)

120
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:44,153
(Signature and Seal, Park Sung Joon)

121
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:59,132
They were arguing, and he was pushed.

122
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:01,072
Do you see this as murder?

123
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:03,273
This isn't murder.

124
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:05,643
I'm sure of it.

125
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:15,052
It's been leaked. UDC has it.

126
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,423
Darn it!

127
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:26,492
He had a muscle spasm. I'm sure of it.

128
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:28,432
He tried to save him at the last moment.

129
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,733
It wasn't an intended murder.

130
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:32,233
Could you zoom in?

131
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:38,973
He tried to save him and his hand...

132
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:40,343
A spasm!

133
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:42,343
You're right, he had a spasm.

134
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,353
But wait. Are you sure this video clip is credible?

135
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:50,052
Who was it? Did they drop it or just leave it?

136
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,233
Darn.

137
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,143
The hip-hop boy!

138
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:12,343
He's the one we were looking for.

139
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:14,143
He must've come to give me this video clip.

140
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,812
But he was acting weird.

141
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:18,913
He wasn't trying to harm me. He was only scared of TL.

142
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:21,552
Then he's in contact with them too?

143
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:23,322
- Probably. - Then why would he come to us?

144
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:24,452
Because of his conscience?

145
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:26,853
Ms. Gong, this video is sure evidence.

146
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:28,893
He had muscle spasms in his hands, which means it's not n-Hexane.

147
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:29,923
We were wrong.

148
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,123
Gosh...

149
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:35,133
Darn it, what do we do? We're going to be in trouble.

150
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,962
And we only opened up six months ago.

151
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:38,332
Let's start from the beginning.

152
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:42,832
How long has he been missing?

153
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:45,043
More than 10 days.

154
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:46,543
He could be dangerous.

155
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,582
If you're right, he's the living proof.

156
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:55,783
Fine. Let's open up all possibilities.

157
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:58,283
Find everything that can cause muscle spasms.

158
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:00,423
From heavy metals to any kind of crazy substances.

159
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:02,253
Gosh.

160
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:05,123
I guess you make mistakes too.

161
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:07,533
Fine.

162
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:09,393
Let's try this.

163
00:09:09,393 --> 00:09:12,802
Forget about the current epidemiological survey.

164
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:17,243
- Could it be... - How did we miss that?

165
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:21,513
Myasthenia in the leg.

166
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:24,643
Chronic cough.

167
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:27,982
Skin lesions.

168
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:30,952
This...

169
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:32,993
must be mercury poisoning!

170
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:44,033
Ha Rang's mother must have witnessed the skin lesions on his body.

171
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,732
And I'm sure she remembers it.

172
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:49,072
It was the last she saw of her dead son.

173
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:50,643
And the skin lesions...

174
00:09:50,643 --> 00:09:53,342
will tell us what caused the poisoning.

175
00:09:57,783 --> 00:10:00,452
He would have had skin lesions somewhere around his chest.

176
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,082
Some red or swollen spots.

177
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:05,852
I know it must be hard, but please try to remember. It's important.

178
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,062
It looked similar to this.

179
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:21,033
It wasn't this bad, though.

180
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,072
This one?

181
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:25,102
How about this?

182
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:26,773
Yes.

183
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:29,212
They all looked like this.

184
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,322
Is this why Ha Rang passed out?

185
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:44,092
I'll tell you when we're sure of it, ma'am.

186
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:46,432
Okay.

187
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,673
Both Do Young and Ha Rang's hands were trembling.

188
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,513
That means they were exposed to it at the same time.

189
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:07,812
Then the place they could have been exposed to it at the same time...

190
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,062
Ms. Doh!

191
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,732
Hello.

192
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,702
We met at the funeral.

193
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,302
I'm Ha Rang's colleague.

194
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:36,442
Thank you for finding out about the n-Hexane.

195
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:38,812
No problem.

196
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:44,352
If I get sick on the job, I'll go and see you.

197
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:47,322
Of course, you won't get sick. Don't say that.

198
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:48,692
Hey!

199
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:51,163
I told you to take this.

200
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:53,393
I heard you live with your grandfather.

201
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,432
I packed some kimchi and side dishes,

202
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,832
so be sure to eat them.

203
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:59,102
You shouldn't have.

204
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,202
Thank you, ma'am.

205
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:04,472
I'll get going, then.

206
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:06,712
Take care.

207
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:21,293
Ha Rang...

208
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:24,822
always skipped meals when he lived in that dorm,

209
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:29,133
and he and Do Young couldn't eat square meals, either.

210
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,173
The dorm. A place the two of them shared.

211
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:36,643
I have to get going, ma'am.

212
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:37,873
Okay.

213
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:49,413
(Exhibit 16)

214
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,232
(Details)

215
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,102
(Location, 177-13, Nameun-dong, Namil City)

216
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:07,202
Joong Eun?

217
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:09,373
Over here.

218
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:12,802
Hey.

219
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:15,243
Namil...

220
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:18,312
is the place TL was planning a bio-industrial complex.

221
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,182
Gosh... Be careful.

222
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:26,123
Yes, ma'am.

223
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:39,232
Great.

224
00:13:42,903 --> 00:13:46,572
This video is just a draft version of what we will be screening...

225
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,212
at the Bio World Convention in the U.S.

226
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:50,212
We will easily reach a preorder of 30,000 liters...

227
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:52,582
before the second factory is finished.

228
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,383
He even succeeded in landing a second client.

229
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:57,822
I was only there to make it final.

230
00:13:58,023 --> 00:14:00,722
Mr. Choi was the one who pulled all the strings.

231
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:02,753
Is that so?

232
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:08,863
Mr. Choi played a big role.

233
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:11,802
It wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for the Planning Department.

234
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:14,932
Everyone is praising him to be the next king of management...

235
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:17,102
after you, sir.

236
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:27,952
It means he wants a bonus.

237
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,513
He's only giving me the credit because he's shy.

238
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:32,082
Of course not, sir.

239
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:46,903
- I'll be outside, sir. - Okay.

240
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:52,903
Watch out for the press.

241
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:56,613
Make sure to take care of them before anything come up.

242
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:57,643
Yes, sir.

243
00:14:57,643 --> 00:15:00,452
I've made it the Planning Department's main duty.

244
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,352
Is Moh Sung Kuk helping you out?

245
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,222
I asked him to make sure not to cause us any damage.

246
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:09,793
I'm sure he'll do well.

247
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:13,732
If not, then he'll have to take responsibility.

248
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,033
I'm sure he'll do well.

249
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:20,673
I just hope he doesn't get caught trying to hide something again.

250
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:22,972
Or else it will cause great damage to the bio-industrial complex.

251
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:26,102
I won't let it slide if that happens.

252
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:29,442
It will be easier for him to deal with Joong Eun.

253
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:30,982
Since he has nothing to do with the kid.

254
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:34,452
He's an expert in that field.

255
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:36,283
Use your tools wisely.

256
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:38,482
He's a useful one.

257
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:40,092
Yes, sir.

258
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:42,692
Oh, and...

259
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:46,832
are you letting Seo Rin meet her mom behind my back?

260
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:48,692
That would never happen, sir.

261
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:50,802
Make sure it doesn't.

262
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:53,533
You better start putting her in your past, too.

263
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,143
I understand, sir.

264
00:15:58,602 --> 00:15:59,673
Right.

265
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,173
Today is the day of Joong Eun's trial.

266
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:05,013
I'm sure it will end...

267
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,082
the way you wanted.

268
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,883
All right.

269
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,052
I'll get to work, then.

270
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,403
Hello.

271
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:34,113
What? What do you mean?

272
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,712
But you said we would win.

273
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,513
I did,

274
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:42,482
but they changed judges and that means they meddled with the court.

275
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:45,883
I mean, TL did.

276
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:48,352
But... No, that can't be true.

277
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:50,863
It's true. And I won't be able to handle it.

278
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,062
I think we will have to make a compromise.

279
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:57,263
If we're not careful,

280
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:59,163
you might be prohibited from seeing your child.

281
00:16:59,163 --> 00:17:00,932
How could you say that as a lawyer?

282
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,673
Will I be likely to win if I appeal?

283
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:08,313
I'm sorry. I can't guarantee anything.

284
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,782
It seems like they've already planned everything out.

285
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:12,813
Then what if I don't do it?

286
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:14,752
If I decide not to appeal,

287
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:17,452
how much will I have to pay?

288
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:19,522
I'd say...

289
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:21,792
about 200,000 dollars in total.

290
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:27,863
(Doh Joong Eun)

291
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,702
(Choi Tae Young)

292
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,343
I heard Ms. Doh went to work again today.

293
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:45,643
So? Are you here to tell on her? I thought you were a busy man.

294
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,153
I'm getting a bad feeling.

295
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,252
You need to move one step ahead of her.

296
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:55,452
What do you mean?

297
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,833
Don't be so cryptic. I'm not following at all.

298
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:03,532
She can attack you anytime if her limbs are functioning.

299
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,063
You're letting her roam around freely.

300
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:08,373
You must've done a ton of bad deeds so far.

301
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:11,143
I did what was necessary.

302
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,613
Look, Mr. Moh.

303
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:20,113
What did you find at the site in Namil?

304
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:24,053
What are you hiding this time, you sneaky man?

305
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:26,053
About TL Oshem...

306
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,093
As you know, it's strictly confidential.

307
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:31,962
"Strictly confidential".

308
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:35,462
Are you confident that you can keep it confidential?

309
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,633
Yes, as long as you don't obstruct.

310
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,103
And if you can take care of Ms. Doh.

311
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:43,333
Why should I? You can do it yourself, can't you?

312
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:46,913
You're even giving orders to the CEO of the company now.

313
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:48,613
Is it about time you left the company?

314
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:50,212
Shall I fire you?

315
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,423
Fire me? You'll have to kill me.

316
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:04,792
From TL Mobile to Automotive, Display and Biotech,

317
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,722
I know about all the occupational diseases...

318
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:08,133
caused by hazardous substances,

319
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,333
which the company has been trying to conceal.

320
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:12,633
Just firing me won't do.

321
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:16,173
You shouldn't let me walk out of here alive.

322
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:18,073
Do you understand?

323
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:23,313
No, I don't.

324
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:30,452
Why bother reporting things to me if you have that much power?

325
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:32,153
Shall I handle things on my own?

326
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:35,423
- If that's easier for you... - It must be the chairman's order.

327
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:37,363
I know that much.

328
00:19:41,593 --> 00:19:44,732
If you keep this up, you'll be taught a serious lesson someday.

329
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:48,633
My gosh, thank you for your concern.

330
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:50,742
And you're right.

331
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,143
All of this is what he wants.

332
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:56,873
That includes you and me locking horns like this.

333
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,712
You see,

334
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,012
I am simply following his orders.

335
00:20:22,502 --> 00:20:23,502
It's me.

336
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:26,173
Look into how much UDC has found out about the site in Namil.

337
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:27,442
Thanks.

338
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:17,163
All the sacks that were left around the dormitory are gone now.

339
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:19,123
They were here a month ago.

340
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:21,262
Someone must've got rid of them since that time.

341
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:24,063
What was in the sacks?

342
00:21:24,603 --> 00:21:26,262
Waste materials from the building next to it?

343
00:21:26,762 --> 00:21:27,903
Or construction materials?

344
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:59,363
A company that makes industrial detergents...

345
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:00,803
was most recently registered under this address.

346
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:04,702
Did their industrial waste contain a toxic substance?

347
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:08,373
Then poisoning is possible.

348
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:10,782
If the toxic substance leaked into the dormitory...

349
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:15,282
I'm sure someone cleaned up the site to conceal the traces,

350
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:17,623
but it'd be difficult to keep it as a perfect crime.

351
00:22:47,853 --> 00:22:49,282
I knew it.

352
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:51,923
The silver liquid with high surface tension.

353
00:22:52,353 --> 00:22:54,722
It turns black when it comes in contact with powdered sulfur.

354
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:57,423
The toxic substance that caused...

355
00:22:57,423 --> 00:23:00,222
the severe skin problems which shocked Ha Rang.

356
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,563
It's mercury.

357
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:07,373
If this heavy metal is spread all over this building,

358
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,873
I'm sure it leaked into the dormitory.

359
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:13,903
Is Doh Joong Eun still inside that waste building?

360
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:15,573
Yes, sir.

361
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:22,843
What about the dormitory? Did she go in there too?

362
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,143
No.

363
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,542
What about the evidence? Are you sure she found it?

364
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:29,182
- Yes, sir. - Get out of there. It's too late.

365
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,222
She could easily lose her footing and die here though.

366
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,752
What do you mean?

367
00:24:34,252 --> 00:24:36,492
Let's get rid of her.

368
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:41,032
Answer quickly, sir.

369
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:51,903
If you don't answer, I'll consider it a yes.

370
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,413
Who are you? Identify yourself!

371
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:12,482
(Global Inspection Agency That Leads Innovation)

372
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,792
What kind of work do you do?

373
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:19,962
No one should be injured...

374
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:21,833
No one should get sick...

375
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,833
And no one should die on the job.

376
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:28,532
If you're ill, it is not your fault.

377
00:26:29,073 --> 00:26:30,673
It's all because of your job.

378
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,873
Hello. I'm Gong Il Sun, the Chief of UDC.

379
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:41,712
Yes. We'll be right there.

380
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:43,113
- Let's go! - Let's go!

381
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:44,482
(UDC is on the move!)

382
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:46,653
- Move! Move it! - Let's go!

383
00:26:46,653 --> 00:26:47,752
(Global Inspection Agency That Leads Innovation)

384
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:52,163
The Undiagnosed Disease Center was founded...

385
00:26:52,563 --> 00:26:55,063
through a joint effort of the Ministry of Environment,

386
00:26:55,462 --> 00:26:58,202
Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Labor.

387
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:00,063
It is the only independent...

388
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:02,403
epidemiological investigation agency in the country.

389
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:05,143
Various misdiagnosed diseases from all over the country.

390
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:06,742
Does it hurt?

391
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:09,972
From undiagnosed diseases,

392
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:11,482
mysterious deaths,

393
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:15,782
and occupational diseases that haven't been discovered,

394
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:18,883
we will find out all the diseases that you suffer from,

395
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:21,093
just like detectives.

396
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:22,123
The camera's rolling.

397
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:24,722
- We, UDC will... - UDC will...

398
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:28,932
- always be on the laborers' side! - always be on the laborers' side!

399
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:30,292
(The laborers' true friend! Come to UDC!)

400
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:33,502
(Doctor Detective)

401
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:35,603
Take care of it.

402
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:38,603
If she found the evidence that we were trying so hard to hide,

403
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:39,873
hide it again.

404
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:41,512
Why does it have to be murder?

405
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:43,613
Kim Do Hyeong has been arrested for murder.

406
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:45,212
It isn't me!

407
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:47,012
We have to find the mercury as soon as possible.

408
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:48,383
I'll go to the site in Namil.

409
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:50,823
You sent her to that place again?

410
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:55,393
You guys are doctors!

411
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:58,093
Not detectives, but doctors!

412
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,823
Mr. Huh, your hunch was right.

413
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:02,393
You're truly amazing. Great job.

414
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,063
I think she's being sarcastic.

415
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:05,762
It was a down-right compliment.
