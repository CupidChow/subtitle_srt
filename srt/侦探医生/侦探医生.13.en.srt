What kind of place is this?

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,990
Let's say someone got sick
while working.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,390
They don't feel well,
but they don't know the cause.

6
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:18,689
That's where we come in.

7
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,789
We go and look
into the working environment.

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,259
How?

9
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:26,029
Cue!

10
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,559
Gosh, it's so dark.

- This is...
- That isn't that important.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,530
Any questions?

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,140
I heard UDC doctors can seize
and search like the prosecution.

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,200
Is that true?

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,510
That's the most important part.
It's the reason why UDC exists.

16
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,679
Think about it,
if we can't seize and search,

17
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:12,809
how would the companies act?

18
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,380
"We can't make it an industrial
accident. We'll be in trouble."

19
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,279
They'll do anything they can...

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,550
to back out and hide evidence.

21
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:20,889
If we show them
the search warrant right there...

22
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:24,619
Peace.

the mercury exposure.

38
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,469
Mr. Huh. You have a patient.

39
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:43,739

- Not really.

- All right. Please wait outside.
- Okay.

Mr. Huh, your next patient...

00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,160
Gosh, I'm starving.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,800
What should I eat so that
people will get jealous of me?

47
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,170
I'm exhausted.

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,170
They're ordering lunch boxes,
Ms. Doh.

49
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,099
You should eat and get some rest.

50
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,570
I have something to finish up
before lunchtime.

51
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,979
I'll take care of lunch on my own.
What about Mr. Huh?

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,710
He's playing hooky, of course.
I'll save your lunch box, then.

that it has no legal basis,

filed for an injunction...

to suspend their rights.

share our countermeasures.

Yes, other than
the colloquium preparations.

all of a sudden?

- Is anything wrong, Dad?
- No, it's nothing.

take care of yourself.

but not me.

Aren't you curious
about how Dad is doing?

to be curious?

No.

Get back to work then. Bye.

was revealed,

like a sneaky little rat.

and hold him responsible,

were made worldwide,

183
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,870
(Summons to Witness)

184
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,340
Sir, Mr. Moh of Oshem
is here to see you.

185
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,090
Mr. Choi.

186
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,089
I heard the news.

187
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,190
You'll attend the parliamentary
inspection of TL Metro?

188
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,630
Yes.

189
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,329
There's no reason to avoid it.

190
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,400
Until when do conglomerates have
to avoid it like cowards?

191
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,099
I'll go and hear
what they have to say...

192
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:05,339
and admit to things I did wrong
and make amendments.

193
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,270
If necessary, I'll even cut out
the rotten parts of this group.

194
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:12,209
Don't you agree, Mr. Moh?

195
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,710
With all due respect,

196
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:17,249
TL is not something
you can just hand over.

197
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:19,379
TL and the politics
have always shared a principle...

198
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,249
that they never meddle
in each other's business.

199
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,719
Nothing has changed. That is...

200
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,520
the path a corporation should take.

201
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,590
The current situation
is a total mess,

202
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,700
but you still seem lost
in the wrong path.

203
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,999
The world is changing so rapidly.

204
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,899
Even if you don't like it,

205
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,039
you should at least pretend
that you keep up with it.

206
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,149
I understand.

207
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,580
You can do what you like.

208
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,630
Yes, I'm Gong Il Sun of UDC.

209
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Does the committee's position...

210
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,100
remain unchanged?

211
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,699
An injunction for suspension
of UDC's rights has been filed.

212
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,740
It will be inevitable
for UDC's rights to be reduced.

213
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:20,609
You should at least give me
a proper explanation.

214
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:23,809
How could you
just notify this unilaterally?

215
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,950
Who filed for the injunction?

216
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:30,119
It's TL, isn't it?
Is TL behind all of this?

217
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,120
You'll soon be requested
to attend a meeting soon.

218
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,759
- You should wait.
- Hey...

219
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,359
- Ms. Gong.
- Yes.

220
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,730
What was that about?
Is something wrong?

221
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,699
No. Don't worry, it's nothing.

222
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,740
Is there a problem because of TL?

223
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:49,309
I would've already asked you
if that was the case.

224
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,510
You don't have to mind.

225
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,410
Right, are you finished unpacking?

226
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,410
Yes.

227
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,809
There's nothing much to unpack.

228
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:59,149
Thank you for letting me stay here.

229
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,189
I'll work harder
on my work here now.

230
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,990
I should be thanking you.

231
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,959
You won't be able to say
you'll quit now.

232
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,330
Since this is your home.

233
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,600
About the medical malpractice case,

234
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:16,169
the truth will be revealed
in the end.

235
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,430
Don't be discouraged.

236
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,770
I'm here for you.

237
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,909
Min Ki skipped work,
but he brought a patient.

238
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:31,349
It serves him right!

239
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:34,279
He must be hungry.
He must not have eaten yet.

240
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,290
What's wrong?
You don't have an appetite?

241
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,890
No. I just had a heavy breakfast.

242
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,930
Where's Joong Eun?

243
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,600
I heard she had some urgent work
to take care of.

244
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,870
Enjoy your meal.

245
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,940
Where are you going?

246
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,469
Mr. Huh.

247
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,080
Yes, thank you.

248
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,280
Let's begin.

249
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,850
Don't worry.

250
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,050
His arm has been scraped slightly,

251
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,620
but if he takes good care of it
at home, it'll heal in no time.

252
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,689
Okay.

253
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,460
I'm really okay. Don't worry.

254
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,230
I'm not worried.

255
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:20,659
Can't you stop
collecting waste paper now?

256
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,369
I'll disinfect the wound now.
This may sting.

257
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:28,439
Okay.

258
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,709
You're very good at
standing the pain.

259
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,310
If it were me, I'd be hopping
around the place in pain.

260
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,780
It's all done.

261
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,510
(Dr. Huh Min Ki. Thank you.)

262
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,919
- Hye Mi.
- Ms. Doh.

263
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,990
What brings you here?

264
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,089
You don't remember me, do you?

265
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,600
I saw you at Ha Rang's funeral.

266
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:26,959
We went to the same college.

267
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,240
- Goodbye.
- You can come anytime

268
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,309
- if you need help.
- Thank you.

269
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,439
- Thank you.
- Wait.

270
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,949
Sir, this is a prescription.

271
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:45,749
Don't forget to take your medicine.

272
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,679
Thank you, Mr. Huh.

273
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,389
Thank you, Mr. Huh.
I'm so grateful.

274
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,560
If it weren't for you,
he could've been hurt badly.

275
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,930
No, it's...

276
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,500
I...

277
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:04,299
Hye Mi, I heard rumors
that you're amazing at drawing.

278
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:07,569
Hye Mi is number one in drawing
in her neighborhood.

279
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,540
- Way to go, Hye Mi!
- That's not true.

280
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,109
He's right. You're number one
in drawing.

281
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,180
Stop being silly.

282
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,680
- We'll get going then.
- Okay, goodbye.

283
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:20,149
Hold on.

284
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,020
Here.

285
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:28,389
(Dr. Huh Min Ki. Thank you.)

286
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,259
It looks just like me.

287
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,300
You really are number one.

288
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:37,069
What are you talking about?
This drawing looks way better.

289
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:38,699
Seriously, come on.

290
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:42,209
Hye Mi.
Take good care of your health.

291
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,009
Okay. You don't have
to worry about me, Ms. Doh.

292
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:49,979
If you get into trouble,
you can always call me.

293
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:51,749
Okay.

294
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,819
Hye Mi, let's go. Thank you.

295
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,520
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, sir. Bye!

296
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,290
Do I really look this handsome?

297
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,899
I said it looks way better.

298
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,630
I know.

299
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,440
I mean, the drawing looks better
than you in person!

300
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,099
Grandpa, give it to me.

301
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,480
This is for the palette.

302
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,889
It was my fault
for parking my car there.

303
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,390
Hye Mi, what are you doing?
Come on.

304
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,890
Okay.

305
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,870
(TL Seoul Medical Center)

306
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:54,009
- Hey, you're here.
- Yes.

307
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,810
I heard you asked for me urgently.

308
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,619
What is it about?

309
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,589
You must have a lot
on your mind lately.

310
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,819
Why? Do you want
to change the world?

311
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,630
If a businessman gets involved
with those cons in politics,

312
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,499
his life will be ruined.

313
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,040
Don't you know
how I've lived up until now?

314
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:23,539
Sir, you forgot
to check your surroundings.

315
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,779
Oh, no. How could I make
this kind of mistake?

316
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,750
I must be too old now. I couldn't
even check my surroundings.

317
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:32,749
For goodness' sake.

318
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,120
Father. But still...

319
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,190
Tae Young.

320
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,330
You should never meet politicians...

321
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,689
except when you buy them
drinks at night...

322
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,500
or bribe them.

323
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,229
Mr. Choi. Regarding the SL-5 issue,

324
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:50,999
why don't you go to China
for a while?

325
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,669
I've taken care of the politicians.

326
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,880
Mr. Choi. Why don't you go abroad
and take a few days off?

327
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,579
Our factory in the Czech Republic
is almost complete.

328
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,309
You should check the progress there.

329
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,850
Why would I go abroad?

330
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,819
Do you think I didn't know?

331
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:11,719
How can you call yourself my son?

332
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,289
That you and your wife
are conspiring...

333
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:16,229
to backstab me?

334
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,699
- Father...
- It's been 60 years.

335
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,699
No matter how much the government
and the world change,

336
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,370
this too shall pass by.

337
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,870
Don't give me trouble
and just leave.

338
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,539
I can't stand the sight of you.

339
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,749
What are you doing standing there?

340
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,119
Can't you see us playing Go?

341
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,700
So do you mean the police
want us to investigate?

342
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:53,829
(Detective Jun Joon Woo)

343
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,429
Our chief recommended it.

344
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,570
Since you're experts in this field,

345
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,500
and the chief thought it'd be hard
to take care of it on our own.

346
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,839
We look forward to your cooperation.

347
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:06,309
Of course we'll cooperate.

348
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,749
But what is this case about?

349
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,519
It's a murder case.
What does it have to do with us?

350
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:17,289
It's obvious this is a murder
because of a love affair.

351
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,289
Mr. Ha, please.

352
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,919
They were a couple
in their early 30s.

353
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,330
The girl was preparing
for a civil service exam,

354
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:23,589
and the guy worked
for a conglomerate.

355
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,930
After failing the exam,

356
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,330
they got into a big fight
that night.

357
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
Everyone at their dorm heard it.

358
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:33,539
But the guy coughed blood that night
and had trouble breathing.

359
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,740
The police think
the girl poisoned him...

360
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:37,309
with a pesticide
after having a big fight.

361
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,879
But why did the police ask
for our help?

362
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,550
This isn't just
because of love quarrel.

363
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,180
The woman stated...

364
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,520
that the guy handled
poisonous substances at work...

365
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,779
and that's how he got exposed.

366
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,890
Il Sun, where did you say
the guy worked?

367
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,090
A company that manufactures
etchants for semiconductors.

368
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,690
They handle corrosive gas.

369
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,830
Then what did the guy say?

370
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,730
That's the problem.

371
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,399
His lungs are totally damaged,

372
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,230
and he's in a coma
at the intensive care unit.

373
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:03,299
At TL...

374
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,700
Medical Center.

375
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,839
The guy's been unconscious
since the day he fainted...

376
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,139
They found...

377
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,439
a deadly pesticide
inside the cupboard of their dorm.

378
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,140
And the girl's fingerprints
were all over there.

379
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,909
This case is interesting enough...

380
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,550
to be made into a documentary.

381
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,690
First of all, we must check for
poisonous substances at his company.

382
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,550
Min Ki, go to TL Medical Center...

383
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:24,889
and talk to the pathologist.

384
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,890
Joong Eun, go to the prison
and talk to the woman.

385
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,130
Mr. Ha, let's go to investigate
the etchant factory together.

386
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,060
- Okay.
- Let's move.

387
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,730
(TL Seoul Medical Center)

388
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,099
Thank you.

389
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:40,969
It's strange
the patient coughed up blood.

390
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,910
Usually, pesticides
don't cause hemoptysis.

391
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:46,009
He keeps showing the symptoms
of pneumothorax.

392
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:48,039
Things don't add up.

393
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,649
I think it might be
another type of poison.

394
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,280
We're suspecting that too.

395
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,919
There are many poisonous substances
at his workplace.

396
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,559
This is the biopsy
from his pneumothorax procedures,

397
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,559
and it seems like fibrosis
is progressing quite rapidly.

398
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,129
You should do some cross-checking.

399
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,160
It seems like UDC
is coming out really strong lately.

400
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,229
Well, I...

401
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,440
No, it's just...

402
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,170
We have so many
talented doctors at our center.

403
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,079
Is Ms. Doh in charge of this case?

404
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,579
How did you know?

405
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,979
I guess this case will be solved
in no time.

406
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,380
You two went to the same college?

407
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,550
We were just...

408
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,949
pretty close.

409
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:35,129
Have a good day.

410
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:39,999
(Photos from Crime Scene)

411
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,799
Then what about the pesticide
found at your house?

412
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45,969
I was going to use that
to kill myself.

413
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,070
I used all the money I saved up...

414
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:51,509
and had no hope of living.
So I decided to commit suicide.

415
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,109
But I got afraid
and couldn't take it...

416
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:58,319
like a fool.

417
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,760
Now, I'm even
being called a murderer.

418
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:10,729
It's true that we fought that night.

419
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,570
But that was really just a fight.
I'm not lying.

420
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:18,539
I really didn't kill Joon Sung.

421
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,639
Please believe me.

422
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,410
Ma'am, I really didn't do it.

423
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:27,479
Ma'am, it wasn't me.

424
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,549
I really didn't do it.

425
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,519
Did you ever hear...

426
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,819
that Mr. Han handled
poisonous substances...

427
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,359
at work?

428
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,270
No way. These pipes
are all sealed shut.

429
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,140
There's no way it can be leaked.
It's impossible.

430
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:02,479
It says here there was
a pipe inspection the day before.

431
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,679
That has nothing to do
with him being sick.

432
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,720
It's not like he did it alone.

433
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,250
There were three more workers
besides Joon Sung.

434
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,519
But he's the only one who got sick.
The others are perfectly fine.

435
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,530
They're working right now,
so take a look.

436
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,870
Before the pipes are opened,

437
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,700
they use a nitrogen pump to get rid
of all the toxic substances.

438
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:28,369
Throughout the history
of our company,

439
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,510
there hasn't been a single exposure.

440
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,640
The employees
finished the inspection safely.

441
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,949
But we can't rule out
the possibility...

442
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,350
that the person
who opened the pipe first...

443
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,780
got exposed momentarily.

444
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,449
Come on.
What is the matter with you?

445
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,460
Look. These are the records
of the direction of the wind.

446
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,720
This shows the change of wind
of that day.

447
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
(Northwest)

448
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,830
On that day, the wind blew
from this side to that side.

449
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,659
That means Joon Sung
had his back against the wind.

450
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,730
Even if there was a gas leak,
it would have gone...

451
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,539
to the person in front,
not to Joon Sung.

452
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,639
And...

453
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,140
I don't want to admit this,

454
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,010
but his girlfriend...

455
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,949
fed him pesticide.

456
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,590
Hello, Ms. Gong?

457
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,759
Do you really think
she fed him Gramoxone?

458
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,259
(Gramoxone is used as a herbicide,
and it's known to be poisonous.)

459
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,669
It's too early to decide.

460
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,170
I'll be visiting the scene
before returning to the office.

461
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,810
(Gangil Student Dormitory)

462
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:02,599
(Do Not Enter)

463
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,740
No!

464
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:06,799
Come on.

465
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,070
Come on!

466
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,969
You're going to get hurt!

467
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,010
Forget it. Let's end it, then.

468
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:15,179
- Why do you care?
- Come on!

469
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:22,919
Han Joon Sung!

470
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,460
Joon Sung!

471
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,219
Are you all right?

(Photos from Crime Scene)

476
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,040
Why was he the only one
who had symptoms?

477
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,269
That is the main point.

478
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,410
The company turned in...

479
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,010
the wind direction records
of that day...

480
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:19,979
to claim that it isn't
an industrial accident.

481
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,849
Joong Eun, what do you think?

482
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:25,719
If we look at the circumstances,

483
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,080
it does seem like a murder case.

484
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,519
But I'm doubtful.

485
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:30,919
About what?

486
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,760
I can't be sure yet.

487
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,190
I feel the same way.

488
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,859
It feels like
we've missed something,

489
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,860
but I don't know what it is.

490
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,760
Any other opinions?

491
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,099
Go on.

492
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:46,799
At times like this,

493
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,639
instead of using our heads...

494
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,339
Please excuse me

495
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,150
Is it an industrial accident or not?

496
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,950
Oh, It's not!

497
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,650
We have to depend on the unknown...

498
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,150
Come on, I was talking.

499
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,090
Joong Eun, go back to the scene,

500
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:06,689
and Mr. Ha, share what we've found
at the company.

501
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,460
I have to get some work done.

502
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,530
Where are you going?

503
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:11,999
Does the director
want to see you again?

504
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:15,299
Yes. I'll go curry favor with him.

505
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,599
Will you be all right?

506
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,469
I've got used to getting scolded
by higher-ups.

507
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,810
I think that'll help me live long.

508
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,609
I could work as the chief
for at least 50 more years.

509
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,910
They say, "Being criticized
makes you live long".

510
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:29,409
Finish everything up.

511
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,280
Yes, ma'am. See you.

512
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:34,319
Don't you think
she's ignoring me on purpose?

513
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,319
How could she not see me
when I was trying this hard?

514
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,490
And what was that?

515
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:39,589
Fifty years is a dictatorship.

516
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:41,089
What is this,
the Yushin Constitution?

517
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,789
Who cares if it's 50 years?

518
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,299
Someone like her deserves 100 years.

519
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,899
You're such a kiss-up.

520
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,240
What can it be?

521
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:53,939
According to
the wind direction records,

522
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,240
there's a low chance that the victim
inhaled a toxic substance.

523
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:59,179
What have we missed?

524
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,250
No way.

525
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,420
It's better to stick
to a sure assumption.

526
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,750
But isn't this
leaving it up to luck?

527
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,420
It's called selection and focus.

528
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,719
It's important to decide...

529
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
whether it's a murder case
or an industrial accident.

530
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,630
So how are we going to do that?

531
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,600
Come on, Jin Hak.

532
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:20,559
Stand over there.

533
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:23,529
We have to go with the saying,
"Know the enemy and yourself".

534
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,299
We have to understand
the victim's position.

535
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:26,899
Isn't that "Put yourself
in another's shoe"?

536
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,470
So we have to "Win every..."

537
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,339
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

538
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,179
Just stand over there.

539
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,340
Now, look.

540
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,310
The wind is blowing. Okay?

541
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:39,519
The victim...

542
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,320
was where I am.

543
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,089
What are you doing?
Do you need help?

544
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,989
Ms. Byun, be quiet.

545
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:48,489
Jin Hak, your hands.

546
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,089
Do I have to make the sound, too?

547
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,700
Okay, good.

548
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,900
Now,

549
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,540
I'm going to scatter
the puzzle pieces to this case.

550
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,190
(Industrial Accident)

551
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,889
This is the most important part.

552
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,990
Unexpected circumstances like this.

553
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,130
(Industrial Accident)

554
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:27,999
What does it say there?

555
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,500
- "Industrial Accident".
- Okay.

556
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Now, we'll assume...

557
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,400
it's an industrial accident
and begin reasoning.

558
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,570
Then what?

559
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,540
By the way, if the settings are
on gentle, weak, and strong wind...

560
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:43,749
- That jerk.
- We can't leave anything up to you.

561
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:46,949
Stop it, already.
I feel like I'm going stupid.

562
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:48,989
Where are you going?

563
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,319
Mr. Huh?

564
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:54,389
Let's do that one more time.
