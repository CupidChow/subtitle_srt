(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:10,489
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,589
(Previously on Doctor Detective)

4
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:16,528
Are you really hiding anything about this case?

5
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:21,399
There happened to be a malfunction in the surveillance camera?

6
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:24,199
Some might suspect that we're trying to hide something.

7
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:25,939
Why are you trying to stop me?

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,838
What do you want to hide?

9
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:29,579
Just keep behaving yourself.

10
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:32,878
This isn't something you can act on your emotions.

11
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:34,478
Just because she was kicked out of the family...

12
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,418
doesn't mean a mere gatekeeping dog can bite her.

13
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:40,319
Welcome to the team.

14
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:44,488
Hello, we're from the UDC.

15
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,289
Where's the owner?

16
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,429
We'll take this.

17
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,829
My gut is telling me that we should look into this.

18
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,429
Take photos and take it to the lab.

19
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:53,829
Don't touch me!

20
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,399
You're going to regret this!

21
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,668
He's not that bad.

22
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:58,899
- Good job. - Gosh,

23
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,668
have you bonded as a team?

24
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:04,178
Yes. They all looked like this.

25
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:07,309
Is this why Ha Rang passed out?

26
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:09,749
He's an expert in that field.

27
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:12,949
It will be easier for him to deal with Joong Eun.

28
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,189
Since he has nothing to do with the kid.

29
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:16,148
She can attack you anytime...

30
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:17,389
if her limbs are functioning.

31
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:19,788
You must've done a ton of bad deeds so far.

32
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:22,158
I did what was necessary.

33
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:24,658
What did you find at the site in Namil?

34
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,029
Do you see this as murder?

35
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,398
This isn't murder. He had muscle spasms in his hands,

36
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:31,199
which means it's not n-Hexane. We were wrong.

37
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,908
How long has he been missing?

38
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:35,169
- More than 10 days. - He could be dangerous.

39
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:37,439
If you're right, he's the living proof.

40
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:42,749
A place that the two of them were both exposed to...

41
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:44,919
is the dorm.

42
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:48,348
(Episode 5)

43
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,029
The sacks that were around the dorm are all gone.

44
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:09,538
It was a month ago, so someone must have meddled with them since.

45
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,309
What could have been inside those sacks?

46
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:16,209
Construction materials? Waste from the building next door?

47
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,258
They come every night these days.

48
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,959
I guess they're really starting the construction.

49
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:27,959
Will they kick us out, then?

50
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,799
People will oppose. This is supposed to be a dorm.

51
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:33,969
Dorm, my foot. This is just a shipping container.

52
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,279
What's that in there?

53
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,519
You really got me this time!

54
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,388
- Look at that. - You must've been startled.

55
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,888
You almost got me.

56
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:07,469
It was mercury.

57
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:10,369
If the heavy metal was spread throughout the entire building,

58
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,739
it could have also gotten into the dorm.

59
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:36,858
Is Doh Joong Eun still in that building?

60
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:38,628
Yes, sir.

61
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,508
This is a perfect place to have an accidental death.

62
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:48,239
What do you mean?

63
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,839
Why don't we just nip the bud?

64
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:55,408
Please answer me quickly.

65
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,348
I'll consider it as consent if you don't answer.

66
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:30,378
Who is this? Who are you?

67
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,828
Joong Eun!

68
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:22,929
Wake up, Joong Eun!

69
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,218
Just answer me.

70
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:41,249
Get rid of that phone when you're done. Burn it.

71
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:43,289
Get rid of it and don't contact me for a while.

72
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:44,958
Do you understand?

73
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,489
Answer me.

74
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:51,929
Who is this?

75
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,729
You...

77
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:56,859
Are you the husband?

78
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,128
- No. - Then...

79
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,698
You can proceed with the test. I am her distant relative.

80
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:03,898
Yes, of course.

82
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,659
I think I peed.

83
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,328
That is fine. No need to cry.

84
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:30,429
I will clean up for you. Let's go.

93

94

95
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,439
- Hey! - What is going on?

96
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,809
- Hey, Il Sun! - Hey, hey!

97
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:56,478
I cannot sleep because of you!

98
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:57,978
You'll regret this.

99
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:02,118
Goodness, now I think I've got otolithiasis.

100
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:03,118
Darn.

101
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,519
Anyway,

102
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:08,659
give me the report.

103
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:09,689
It will be a trade.

104
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,458
- What? - You need to give me something.

105
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,728
Like I said, everything depends on you.

106
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:18,068
You brat! How dare you!

107
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:19,498
Hey! Give it to me!

108
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,608
I will either fire him or get myself fired.

109
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:24,238
This is going to kill me.

110
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:26,848
- Goodness! - Oh my!

111
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:28,478
I am sorry.

112
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:33,248
Is Mr. Huh going back to AMC?

113
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:35,189
I do not think so. I'm sure They'll find someone else soon.

114
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:38,488
He will wind up in a corner there.

115
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:40,728
What's the use of getting the title of Team Leader?

116
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,858
What is it? What?

117
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,899
I can tell you know something that I do not know.

118
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,468
What is it? Just tell me.

119
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:51,598
I heard Mr. Huh is buying another car.

120
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:54,738
More expensive imported car, a yellow car.

121
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:56,708
- With what money? - I heard you get a lot of money...

122
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,279
after becoming Team Leader.

123
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,448
It is a raise of merely 298 dollars.

124
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:02,978
He must have lost his mind.

125
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,419
I think he will come to his senses. He just received mail.

126
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:06,419
What mail?

127
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,448
A ticket to the fiery pit.

128
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,289
Apparently, when he crashed The Baker CEO's car,

129
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,529
everything was recorded on a customer's car black box.

130
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:18,458
- What? - Hey!

131
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,299
- Hey! - Stop!

132
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,598
How about this?

133
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,439
On top of the fine,

134
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,399
the cost of the car repair and the settlement of the assault...

135
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,708
will almost equal Min Ki's annual salary.

136
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,708
He will never be able to say that he quits.

137
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,838
If that's the case, he is better of quitting.

138
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:33,978
Yes.

139
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:37,019
Yes. Which emergency center?

140
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:39,578
Yes, I will be on my way.

141
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,019
"Emergency medical center"?

142
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,019
- Why? - Was someone hurt?

143
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,759
Joong Eun. She got injured at the scene.

144
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:48,858
Why? Is it serious?

145
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,998
Did you ask her to do something again?

146
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,799
It is Namil University Hospital's Emergency Medical Center!

147
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,149
Yes.

148
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,409
Please stay seated.

149
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,818
No, sir. Please stay seated.

150
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:19,179
Long time no see.

151
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,818
Long time no see.

152
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,588
Governor Murker of Arizona couldn't join us today.

153
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:25,159
He will greet you over the phone.

154
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,718
I understand.

155
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:28,328
Please sit down.

156
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:33,529
Let's get to the point.

157
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,598
Yes, sir.

158
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,338
I will ask Mr. Moh to visit you.

159
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:40,368
No need.

160
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,309
Then may I check if he is in his office first?

161
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:49,978
He is in the office.

162
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:52,218
Thank you. You may leave.

163
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:53,478
Yes, sir.

164
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,988
That is fine. Let me sit.

165
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,529
Why don't you first tell me about Director Park from Construction?

166
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:12,439
- I heard you found him. - We found him yesterday.

167
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:14,968
He was hiding in a temple in Icheon.

168
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:18,238
- Did you see him? - I did not see him.

169
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,978
I will meet him either today or tomorrow...

170
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,379
and make sure that he should take the responsibility.

171
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:27,948
I guess that is how the issue of the site in Namil...

172
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:29,988
will be handled by putting the blame on Director Park.

173
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:32,559
- Correct. - Then let me cut to the chase.

174
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:41,468
Why didn't you pick up my phone?

175
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,539
Director Moh Sung Kuk,

176
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:48,468
sir.

177
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,059
Are you okay?

178
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,498
Well...

179
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:21,809
If you have a lot of nightmares,

180
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:24,179
then you should meditate, or...

181
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,049
What happened?

182
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,248
Did you fell from the stairs?

183
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,248
Water? I will give you.

I knew you were going to ask me that.

It was an order from the chairman.

He asked me to deal with what happened in the site in Namil.

211

Kim Do Hyeong!

365
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:05,278
Stop! Wait!

366
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:11,849
- You are under arrest for murder! - I did not do it!

367
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:14,119
What you say may be used against you...

368
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,988
- in court. - Please believe me.

369
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:17,448
You have the right to remain silent.

370
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:18,488
I didn't do it.

371
00:26:21,758 --> 00:26:22,788
You are back.

372
00:26:26,228 --> 00:26:28,169
- Give it to me. - I can do this.

373
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:36,109
- You should take a few days off. - I will go to work tomorrow.

374
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:38,609
A few days of delay will not change anything.

375
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,179
Aren't you going to pick it up?

376
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,379
I will not. It is before the working hours.

377
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:48,819
I am a human too!

378
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,389
If it is from the office, do not pick it up.

379
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:55,329
I'm sure it's nothing urgent.

380
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:56,329
(Ms. Byun Jung Ho)

381
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:59,359
What is wrong with these people?

382
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:05,869
- Hello? - Ma'am, turn on the news! Hurry!

383
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:07,968
Kim Do Hyeong has been arrested for murder.

384
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:09,569
Hey.

385
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:14,008
The police announced this morning...

386
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,008
that the murder suspect had been arrested.

387
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:19,179
However, the suspect, who was the victim's colleague,

388
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,649
is currently denying all charges.

389
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:25,258
- The death case... - Hey, who released that footage?

390
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:28,589
We should hurry before they go any further.

391
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:31,159
We need to find that mercury.

392
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:32,558
I'll go to the site in Namil.

393
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:34,669
No, not you.

394
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,298
I'll send Mr. Ha. You just back him up.

395
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:38,339
Ms. Gong.

396
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:42,038
I'll go. It'll be all right if it's the two of us.

397
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:43,808
Joong Eun...

398
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:46,708
I'll go. They can't get me twice.

399
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:58,359
(Under Construction, No Entry)

400
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:06,998
May I help you?

401
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:08,069
Hello.

402
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:10,329
We're here for an official investigation from the UDC.

403
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:12,899
We sent an official document to the head office of TL Metro.

404
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,169
They have nothing to do with us.

405
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:16,339
Please turn back.

406
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:17,839
What do you mean?

407
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,508
Their dorm is right here. What nonsense are you...

408
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,008
saying, sir?

409
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:26,619
It's off-limits. Please turn back.

410
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,288
TL Metro is responsible for the dorm.

411
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:31,018
It is legally a part of TL Metro,

412
00:28:31,018 --> 00:28:33,788
and TL Metro is officially under an epidemiological survey.

413
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:36,429
Please turn back or I'll have to call the police.

414
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:37,728
Hey, mister.

415
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:40,558
Why would you call the police for something like this...

416
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:50,038
That's nonsense!

417
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:52,308
The dorm is managed by TL Metro.

418
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:55,778
Hold on. I'll take care of it.

419
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,359
What's up with the coffee?

420
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,258
I want to put everything behind...

421
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,258
and start over.

422
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:11,089
Have you come back to your senses?

423
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:14,228
Or did the opening at AMC fill up already?

424
00:29:14,228 --> 00:29:17,629
I realized it's useless to get greedy over power and money.

425
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:19,599
You don't have to go that far...

426
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,639
to try and make a deal with me again.

427
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:23,139
Where are you, Ms. Byun?

428
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:25,778
Hurry up. Yes, it's urgent.

429
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:29,778
What?

430
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,208
I think...

431
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:35,048
our country's real estate policy has gone haywire.

432
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:37,488
The rental deposits are too high. How are we supposed to get by?

433
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:39,258
What is it that you want to say?

434
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:45,829
I ran out of money because of that bakery owner.

435
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:47,629
I heard there are a lot of vacant rooms on the second floor?

436
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:51,669
Go ahead.

437
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,099
Thank you, ma'am.

438
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,439
Should I...

439
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:58,879
That's enough. Just head over to the site in Namil.

440
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:00,278
Go and help Doh Joong Eun.

441
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:02,849
Did you send her there again?

442
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,649
Are you insane?

443
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,218
Will you finally get it when someone dies?

444
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:08,748
- Hey, it was urgent! - Whatever! You're so selfish!

445
00:30:08,748 --> 00:30:09,819
- It was... - Whatever!

446
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:11,589
- Why that little... - Gosh!

447
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:16,089
- Hurry! - All right.

448
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,129
There!

449
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:39,948
Darn it.

450
00:30:40,518 --> 00:30:42,488
The security is too tight.

451
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,018
Darn it.

452
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,488
Where are you, Mr. Huh?
