1
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:25,821
Can I talk to him in private?

2
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:27,881
Sure.

3
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,891
Goodness, my dear Ha Rang.

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,391
Your team leader will be here later.

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,590
You should get some rest today.

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,160
Okay. Goodbye, sir.

7
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,760
- Get well soon. - Thank you.

8
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,271
Did you lose power in your hands?

9
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:57,010
No, I just slipped.

10
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,550
Your hands were trembling when we ate yesterday.

11
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,851
Your job is too dangerous.

12
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:02,590
If your mom finds out, she'll make you...

13
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,221
Don't tell my mom, please.

14
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:05,491
- Jung Ha Rang. - Ms. Doh.

15
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:12,661
If I work for another month,

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,631
I can become a regular employee at TL Metro.

17
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:16,431
Then my mom and I can become happier.

18
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,241
I just really want to...

19
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:24,071
treat my mom better for the first time in my life.

20
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:40,191
You're not even eating properly?

21
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,530
I do eat. They provide food at the dormitory.

22
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,461
I just bought those cup noodles in case I got busy.

23
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:50,530
I know the outsourcing companies are understaffed.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,571
You're overworking day and night.

25
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,900
They said they'll hire more employees.

26
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,140
My company promised me.

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,310
Do you really think they'll keep that promise?

28
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,640
You should receive a checkup first...

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,381
Why are you nagging me so much? What's wrong with you today?

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,111
You and I are just...

31
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,981
next-door neighbors, and I'm all grown up now.

32
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,820
Why are you nagging me like my mom?

33
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,551
You used to ignore me before. What's gotten into you?

34
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,921
You don't even know what kind of work I do.

35
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,361
Why doesn't she know?

36
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,130
My goodness.

37
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey, kid. You shouldn't be working alone.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,370
The rule is working in a team of two.

39
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,241
- That's because... - The company broke the rules.

40
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,970
No one knows who was in the tracks.

41
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:32,840
There wasn't even a communication system...

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,681
between the company, station, and the control room, right?

43
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,880
Hey, Mr. Goh.

44
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,280
That's not true. I mean it.

45
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:44,150
Ha Rang, say something, will you?

46
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:54,660
There's really nothing wrong.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's just...

48
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:59,440
I'm telling you, I'm fine. What's wrong with all of you?

49
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,741
No, you're not. You're not fine at all.

50
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,340
Mr. Huh. Let's talk.

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,840
Do you want to ignore it?

52
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,011
He's still a kid. He doesn't know anything.

53
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,780
Didn't you study Occupational and Environmental Medicine? How could...

54
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,720
Will you be responsible for his life?

55
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:19,991
What?

56
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,391
Will you be responsible for his life until the end?

57
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:26,231
It's not like you work because of your sense of justice.

58
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,861
It's just important for you to make a living, isn't it?

59
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,301
Yes. It's true I'm doing this to make a living.

60
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,470
But sometimes,

61
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,741
I want to live properly too.

62
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,280
Thanks to that scarce opportunity,

63
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:43,581
I can at least live more honorably.

64
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,120
Hey, it's not like we want to become superheroes.

65
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,491
As doctors,

66
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,220
shouldn't we at least have a conscience like others?

67
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:57,861
You're...

68
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:00,400
going to regret it.

69
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,100
One day, you're going to be too ashamed...

70
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,530
to face your daughter...

71
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,241
for living such a trashy life.

72
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,870
Do you realize that?

73
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,791
Make sure no one can approach the site,

74
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:24,991
and please collect the patients' data.

75
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,020
Yes.

76
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,241
Who is it?

77
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,810
Ma'am, it's me, Ms. Doh.

78
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:48,241
Gosh.

79
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:51,210
Gosh, Ms. Doh!

80
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,351
You came at the right time.

81
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:55,051
Come and have dinner with me.

82
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:56,151
Ma'am, I...

83
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:58,551
Hurry up and come inside.

84
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:00,260
Okay? How great!

85
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:05,260
Don't leave any and eat everything. I'm going to go and check, okay?

86
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,861
From your loving son.

87
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,801
Ms. Doh,

88
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,231
dig in!

89
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:15,000
I thought I had no luck on money or a great husband...

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,341
and that I was il-fated,

91
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:21,341
but I guess I'm getting lucky now, thanks to my son!

92
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:24,710
Ma'am...

93
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,120
Ms. Doh, take a look at this.

94
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,991
I bought Ha Rang a suit...

95
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:34,620
before his first day at work at TL.

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,760
Take a look.

97
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,291
Isn't he so handsome?

98
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,500
Gosh, wow!

99
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,010
You're so handsome, my son!

100
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,181
It's uncomfortable.

101
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,010
You did a good job with the tie.

102
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,051
He didn't have any money nor any personal connections,

103
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:04,051
but he still got a job at that big company.

104
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm so proud of him!

105
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,431
Go on and help yourself.

106
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,801
(Ms. Doh Joong Eun)

107
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:55,640
(Ms. Doh, thank you for taking care...)

108
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,981
(Ms. Doh, thank you for taking care of my mother. From Ha Rang)

109
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:02,700
Do I have to make an appointment if I want to go to the UDC?

110
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,411
My skin feels weird.

111
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,010
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

112
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:14,620
Ms. Gong, I'd like to request you to check on a patient.

113
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,591
He's a 20-year-old male, Jung Ha Rang,

114
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,250
He's been suffering from chronic cough...

115
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,491
and loss in muscle strength for many weeks.

116
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:22,661
We haven't been able to spot any exposure to toxic substance.

117
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,661
He's on a shift of 70 hours per week...

118
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,161
and has been overworking himself.

119
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:28,161
I think we'll need to run a detailed workup.

120
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,070
Hello?

121
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,600
Any patient who visits the center could be a time bomb.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,810
We don't know when it will explode, so look into it carefully.

123
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:39,110
Check his medical history, occupational history,

124
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,480
family history, and environmental exposability.

125
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:45,051
I'll be returning tonight. Make sure to complete the workup.

126
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:47,220
Yes, ma'am. I know.

127
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:51,621
What could have gone wrong overnight?

128
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:53,161
Let's run a full LAB test.

129
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:56,291
Sure, let's do that.

130
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:59,600
Okay.

131
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:02,230
(Undiagnosed Disease Center)

132
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,470
Ha Rang? Come on in.

133
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,271
Are you feeling ill? Let me check.

134
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:10,340
There is something on my skin.

135
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,381
What, like a rash?

136
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:14,641
Where? Let me see.

137
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,710
But...

138
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,381
Could you keep it a secret...

139
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:21,320
if it's something bad?

140
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,921
"A secret"?

141
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:27,560
Patient information is all confidential.

142
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,621
Take a seat.

(Mr. Goh)

144
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,171
- Could I take this? - Sure.

145
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,271
One moment, sir.

146
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,141
Hello, Mr. Goh?

147
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,781
Ha Rang.

148
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:49,950
I heard you took a sick leave.

149
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,051
How are you feeling?

150
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,820
I have some bad news, though.

151
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,151
This will be applied to the performance review.

152
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:59,590
If you take a leave today,

153
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,190
you might have a disadvantage...

154
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,031
in getting a permanent job here.

155
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,901
You know how we'll be merged with TL soon.

(Outpatient Care System)

158
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:16,541
Ms. Byun,

159
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:18,240
why isn't this working?

160
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,340
Come and look.

161
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,580
- Double click. There. - Oh, I see.

162
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,720
What's taking him so long?

163
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
I know.

164
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,990
I guess it's getting longer.

165
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,661
Hey! Where are you going?

166
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:40,100
Hey!

167
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:43,801
You need to get a checkup, Ha Rang!

168
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,730
Hey! Hey, where are you...

169
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,001
Hey!

170
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,110
What's going on?

171
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,781
Are you kidding me? You let him get away?

172
00:10:58,051 --> 00:10:59,251
What did he say?

173
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:01,681
He said he had a rash.

174
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,690
Oh, it wasn't a rash.

175
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,830
He said something came up on his skin, so I asked him to show me...

176
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,700
Did he say where he was going or leave any trace?

177
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,700
Well, he got a phone call...

178
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,310
from someone at his office. Maybe he went to work.

179
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,110
Mr. Goh, that jerk!

180
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,740
I told him not to make Ha Rang work.

181
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,580
He just won't listen, will he?

00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,010
Oh, yes.

364
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:01,621
Yes, Detective Kim.

365
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,091
Yes, I'm checking right now.

366
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,171
(Ms. Doh, thank you for taking care of my mother. From Ha Rang)

367
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,581
Oh, my.

368
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,111
Well...

369
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,871
Ms. Doh, thank you for taking care of my mom.

370
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,730
CPR code blue, CPR code blue.

371
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,571
It's a code blue!

372
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,571
Run! There's no time!

373
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:23,440
Block them.

374
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,081
Charge 200J more.

375
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:35,681
1, 2, 3.

376
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,440
Move.

377
00:26:57,611 --> 00:26:59,341
It's his mom.

378
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,050
This may be the last time she sees him!

379
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,050
Please let me see my son, Ha Rang.

380
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,450
Please let me see my son.

381
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,321
Please, sir.

382
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:16,220
Before he leaves me,

383
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,391
let me see him just once.

384
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:21,300
Please. I'm begging you...

385
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,601
- Lift her up. - Please!

386
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,500
What are you doing? Lift her up!

387
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,871
(Doctor Detective)

388
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,811
There are doubts that the accident was caused by his own negligence.

389
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:13,371
The media is blaming it on him, instead of a safety hazard.

390
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,780
People might think they're trying to cover it up.

391
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,811
The world won't change no matter how much you protest.

392
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:19,210
It'll only change after a few more people die.

393
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,750
Conglomerates, media, and the police.

394
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,621
They only pretend to care right after the accident.

395
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:23,921
In order to change this reality,

396
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,520
we need the public opinion and the support of the people.

397
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,490
If the public keeps having doubts, we should take proper measures.

398
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:31,391
Why are you trying to stop me?

399
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:32,960
What do you want to hide?

400
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,530
Just keep behaving yourself.

401
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,401
This isn't something to be emotional about.

402
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:39,470
I will be emotional about it!

403
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,171
I will...

404
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,740
fight back.
