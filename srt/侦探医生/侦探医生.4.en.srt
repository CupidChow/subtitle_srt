1
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:03,523
Yes, sir.

2
00:00:03,523 --> 00:00:06,833
Ms. Doh. I think TL has already pulled strings to stop the autopsy.

3
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:08,933
Ha Rang's mother isn't answering the phone either.

4
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:11,863
Can you please persuade her?

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,033
Okay, I will.

6
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:27,783
Ma'am.

7
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:30,423
I have something to tell you.

8
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:33,353
You can stop now.

9
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,753
You've done enough.

10
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:38,563
I should hold...

11
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:41,963
a funeral for my son now and send him off.

12
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,433
We must carry out an autopsy.

13
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:54,813
Ma'am.

14
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:56,673
Stop it.

15
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:01,182
We'll investigate a bit further.

16
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:02,882
If we can just do an autopsy...

17
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:07,293
I told you to stop!

18
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,593
I lost my child.

19
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:14,692
Just stop it already! Stop!

20
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:20,132
Do you even know how my son died?

21
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:22,272
But I'm sitting here...

22
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,203
eating when I'm hungry...

23
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:27,543
and sleeping when I get sleepy.

24
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:33,043
I've thought about dying hundreds of times.

25
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,382
Ma'am.

26
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:05,883
Just go.

27
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,212
(Soju)

28
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:11,483
Please don't say anything to my mom.

29
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:15,513
She'll just nag me more.

30
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:23,793
Ha Rang!

31
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:44,143
Ha Rang.

32
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,513
How did you die?

33
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:49,082
Do Young, why haven't I heard from you yet?

34
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:50,782
Did you have a fight?

35
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:03,492
There were a few people on the platform,

36
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:05,603
but no one saw the moment of the accident.

37
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:08,372
There is one person who might have witnessed it.

38
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:11,372
The yellow shirt. He's holding a camera.

39
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:13,642
Was the light on the camera flashing?

40
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:16,473
The light was on. It recorded something.

41
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:18,083
I have to find that young man.

42
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:37,333
Ms. Byun, please do me a favor.

43
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,833
I need you to find someone for me.

44
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:34,423
Listen to my voice.

45
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,072
(Recordings)

46
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:54,343
(Recorded Calls)

47
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:56,713
(Police Hospital)

48
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,882
Where do I get my medicine?

49
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:02,752
Go downstairs to the first floor and get it there.

50
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:06,153
Thank you.

51
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:08,892
Mr. Seo Jae Yeong?

52
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:15,992
This is just a simple survey.

53
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,463
It will be very helpful...

54
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,502
to the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Department...

55
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,072
and their research on officers with posttraumatic stress disorder.

56
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:23,502
(Where is the water bottle?)

57
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:26,142
Ta-da!

58
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,812
We're from the UDC.

59
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:34,413
I don't know what you're talking about.

60
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:37,052
You guys announced that he was drunk...

61
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:38,952
to close the case early.

62
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:42,392
I saw what was in his bag at the emergency room.

63
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:46,293
I saw he had a water bottle, and I even took pictures.

64
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:54,072
But I don't think this will end with mere criticism.

65
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,872
I know you're having issues with the prosecution.

66
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:01,742
I'll call the senior executives. You can talk with them.

67
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:05,083
Mr. Seo.

68
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,382
Put down your phone.

69
00:07:12,153 --> 00:07:13,223
Hey!

70
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:24,202
Mr. Seo.

71
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:27,473
Any patient who comes to the ER has to have their blood tested.

72
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:30,333
Ha Rang's blood didn't have a drop of alcohol in it.

73
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,072
I'm sure the senior executives would have thought...

74
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:36,673
it had been disposed since it was at TL Medical Center.

75
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:41,052
But doctors and medical science...

76
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:43,613
are true to the rules and principles.

77
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,023
All right?

78
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:46,682
Wherever you go,

79
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:49,223
there will always be that one old-fashioned jerk...

80
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:52,322
who wants to go by the rules.

81
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:55,963
(TL Pathology Department, Kim Byung Hyun)

82
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:01,103
Hello, Byung Hyun? It's me.

83
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:03,903
Do you have Ha Rang's blood sample?

84
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,002
Please have it sent to the UDC...

85
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,273
as soon as the results come out.

86
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:11,283
Jae Yeong,

87
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:15,283
we have blood samples that can prove he wasn't drinking.

88
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:18,382
Then it must have been water that Ha Rang drank, right?

89
00:08:21,322 --> 00:08:22,492
(Detective Kim In Seok)

90
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:27,093
Hey, you jerk.

91
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:29,563
Ha Rang was even younger than you.

92
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:31,502
You hid the evidence of that kid.

93
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:34,772
If this gets exposed, you'll have to take responsibility, you know.

94
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:39,703
Do you think they're going to help you out?

95
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,943
They'll ignore you.

96
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:48,853
Let's go.

97
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:51,983
You coward.

98
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:55,652
The chief's...

99
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:00,863
drawer.

100
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:15,113
(Exhibit 16)

101
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:19,343
I guess people make mistakes.

102
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:20,752
Sure.

103
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:24,453
We're all human, so we make mistakes and lie, too.

104
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:26,983
Have a good day.

105
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:31,422
I guess he's had too much fine dust in his system.

106
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:36,292
So, him being drunk has been completely ruled out...

107
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,363
and he was staggering due to exposure to an organic solvent?

108
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:41,073
It was n-Hexane. It's a neurotoxic substance...

109
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:44,103
which crippled 5 Thai workers 10 years ago.

110
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:45,573
I thought they stopped using it two years ago?

111
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:48,142
They're still using it illegally.

112
00:09:48,142 --> 00:09:49,713
Even the slightest exposure to it every day...

113
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,313
can cause nerve damage, myasthenia,

114
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:53,042
and even blisters on your skin.

115
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,483
It's the same as Ha Rang's symptoms.

116
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:56,652
Okay. Let's continue on when you get here.

117
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:57,723
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:00,892
Did you see what I did?

119
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:04,662
There are only three things you need in this country to succeed.

120
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:07,122
The money, the style, and the talk.

121
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:09,093
From what I can tell,

122
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:12,063
you've got the talk.

123
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:19,443
The cleaning solution Ha Rang had...

124
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:21,943
is a harmless IPA.

125
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,613
It doesn't include n-Hexane.

126
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:27,183
That's just too bad

127
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,752
That's just too bad

128
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:32,022
What Doh Joong Eun said...

129
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:34,922
was wrong

130
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:38,563
From now on,

131
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,593
I'm Doctor Detective.

132
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:43,933
Myasthenia in the leg.

133
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,103
Chronic cough.

134
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,372
Skin lesion.

135
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:53,242
This...

136
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:56,012
must be mercury poisoning!

137
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:57,613
Mercury...

138
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,813
But then again...

139
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:05,252
the mercury poisoning case of Mun Song Myeon...

140
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,752
that happened during the 1988 Seoul Olympics,

141
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:09,892
and now,

142
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:12,693
we have just finished the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.

143
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:14,492
- So why... - Hey!

144
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:15,933
Stop fooling around.

145
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,203
Focus on your work! Mercury, my foot!

146
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:20,632
I was working. Don't you see this?

147
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:23,672
I've been checking each pixel...

148
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:26,002
that my eyes could fall out.

149
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:27,002
Look.

150
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,242
They hid the water bottle...

151
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:31,583
and accused him of being drunk. Right?

152
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:35,083
That means it has something to do with it,

153
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:37,853
but I don't know what.

154
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:38,953
Mr. Huh.

155
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:41,292
Zoom in on this.

156
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:42,453
Where?

157
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,723
- Here? - Yes.

158
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:47,162
No, not there.

159
00:11:49,863 --> 00:11:50,902
Here!

160
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:57,032
- Hey, it's a dual label. - Gosh.

161
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,473
- Let us in! - It is a dual label.

162
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:03,713
- You can't do that! - It was covering n-Hexane.

163
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,183
- The thing is though, - What do you want?

164
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,613
it's completely empty now.

165
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,012
I think they disposed of the whole thing.

166
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:11,323
I see. Thank you for your help, sir. All right.

167
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:14,652
We just need that container, then.

168
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,053
It can serve as firm evidence.

169
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,693
No, it can't. All of this is just circumstantial evidence.

170
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:20,593
There's no concrete evidence.

171
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:25,563
If they actually used n-Hexane, we just need to find solid evidence.

172
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,973
Darn it. Hey, show me that thing again.

173
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:30,502
Let's see.

174
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:32,742
This is...

175
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,973
Who recorded this?

176
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:38,882
Gosh.

177
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:02,833
(Soju)

178
00:13:04,603 --> 00:13:06,303
(Soju)

179
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:16,553
Hello, ma'am. This is Doh Joong Eun.

180
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:20,053
The soju box... Are you the one that drank it?

181
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:22,492
What are you talking about?

182
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,093
Please answer my question. Did you drink the soju?

183
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,792
No, I can't drink.

184
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:32,203
Okay, thank you. I'll be in touch.

185
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:37,433
We have evidence.

186
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:42,872
(Soju)

187
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:55,652
(Global Inspection Agency That Leads Innovation)

188
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:56,693
(Safety First)

189
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,363
- Ms. Gong. - Yes.

190
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:03,193
- We got it. - Where is it?

191
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:05,963
- Really? Seriously? - Let me see.

192
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:09,233
This is the kind of firm evidence I was talking about.

193
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:12,542
It was found on the wooden chopsticks too.

194
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:14,772
Ms. Doh was right.

195
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,113
Seriously? n-Hexane?

196
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:19,782
- How did you know? - There was a half-empty soju box...

197
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:21,713
in the trash can at Ha Rang's place.

198
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:22,953
Once, I also saw him...

199
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:24,652
with a plastic soju bottle when I ran into him.

200
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,382
A soju box and a plastic soju bottle.

201
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,152
It's unlikely that he drank both.

202
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:29,353
He drank one,

203
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:31,823
and the other one had detergent inside.

204
00:14:32,063 --> 00:14:34,963
But why was the detergent stored in a soju bottle?

205
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,162
I'm sure he knew it's against the law to use it.

206
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:40,203
Then what if the company puts the blame on Ha Rang?

207
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,433
They won't be able to because they switched the labels.

208
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,902
They're guilty of deliberately letting the employees use it.

209
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:47,613
Right, the label. Okay.

210
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:49,642
n-Hexane cleans well, you know.

211
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,142
Since Ha Rang was the youngest on the team,

212
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:53,213
I bet they gave him the stations where things break most often.

213
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:55,353
The strong detergent must've made...

214
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,382
his job easier because wiping just once would've been enough.

215
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:58,683
It was found on his utensils as well.

216
00:14:58,683 --> 00:14:59,752
It means he ate it too.

217
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:02,022
That must've drastically increased the amount he was exposed to.

218
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:03,892
- Exactly. Mr. Ha. - Yes, ma'am.

219
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:05,762
Get the report and press release ready.

220
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:06,762
Got it.

221
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:09,593
Ms. Doh, I'd like you to join the UDC family starting today.

222
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:13,733
All right. Good job, everyone.

223
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:16,532
We can all get some rest now.

224
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,343
- Okay! - Great work.

225
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:23,872
Team Huh Leader Min Ki and a team member, Doh Joong Eun.

226
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:28,382
Exposure to n-Hexane...

227
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:31,422
can cause weakness of the limbs as well as skeletal muscle weakness.

228
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:34,053
Regarding the screen door accident which cost a worker his life,

229
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:36,252
experts are saying a comprehensive plan must be...

230
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:38,122
put in place to tackle occupational illnesses...

231
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:41,063
- and to revamp the safety system... - Well...

232
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:43,863
I have to say, things quieted down without too much trouble.

233
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:45,363
Well done.

234
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,402
This is about the site, you know.

235
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:50,402
I won't let my guard down, sir.

236
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,943
Why? Are you anxious?

237
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:58,313
Mr. Choi would probably know.

238
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:02,252
Well, about the past...

239
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,252
Oh, that.

240
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:08,323
You and I are the only ones that know about it.

241
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:11,162
I see.

242
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:24,272
You should get going now, Mr. Moh.

243
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:25,303
Yes, sir.

244
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:30,542
Bye.

245
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:43,593
There won't be any issues with the biotech complex, Father.

246
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:45,992
Make sure you wrap it up without a hitch.

247
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:47,733
I will.

248
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,632
I'll persuade Joong Eun and make sure...

249
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:52,333
she takes her hands off it.

250
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:54,603
All right.

251
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,573
Experts are saying a comprehensive plan must be...

252
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:00,573
put in place to tackle...

253
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:02,872
occupational illnesses and to revamp the safety system.

254
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:06,412
The Undiagnosed Disease Center found n-Hexane...

255
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:08,113
inside the plastic soju bottle,

256
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:12,122
n-Hexane.

257
00:17:20,922 --> 00:17:23,093
(Search UDC)

258
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:27,732
(Undiagnosed Disease Center)

259
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:30,073
(Doh Joong Eun)

260
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:32,942
About that medical malpractice case...

261
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,273
The one involving Joong Eun.

262
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,672
Has the final verdict been made?

263
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:40,442
You see,

264
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:46,023
do you actually think you can persuade her?

265
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,222
Tae Young.

266
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:54,833
You can't fix people.

267
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:58,533
Have some tea.

268
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:13,882
We just worked hard. I didn't do anything wrong.

269
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:18,952
- Ms. Gong. - Yes?

270
00:18:19,323 --> 00:18:21,692
Listen to Ha Rang's final words before he died.

271
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:23,622
His co-worker must've recorded the call.

272
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:25,722
Seriously?

273
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:33,563
That's the only thing people like us can do to survive.

274
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:35,672
We have to make this public.

275
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:39,243
Without this, no one will even be interested in this issue.

276
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,013
We must fight with science and data as our weapons.

277
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:44,372
You said we should change the system.

278
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:46,642
We can't change the system...

279
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,952
by measuring a substance and analyzing data.

280
00:18:49,113 --> 00:18:51,952
Even if those jerks went over the maximum permitted amount...

281
00:18:51,952 --> 00:18:53,152
of whatever substance they used,

282
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:57,392
do you think we can change anything by pointing that out?

283
00:18:58,922 --> 00:18:59,993
No, we can't.

284
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,263
For us to make change happen,

285
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:05,333
we need public sentiment and support on our side.

286
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:09,033
Ha Rang is the third victim.

287
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,743
The cup noodles...

288
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:15,313
and the spoon in his backpack.

289
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:20,642
He was only 19.

290
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:22,613
Darn it.

291
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:29,093
The words that the 19-year-old guy left for us.

292
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:32,192
This is the truth.

293
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:36,632
Right, I guess I was too emotional.

294
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:38,003
Then let's take a reasonable approach.

295
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:40,763
I'm on board.

296
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:44,902
Me too.

297
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:53,942
Gosh.

298
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:57,952
Are we good now?

299
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:04,722
I don't even know anymore. You can send it to the media.

300
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:06,722
Don't mention the UDC though.

301
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:12,033
Whatever.

302
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:14,573
I'm definitely mentioning it.

303
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:19,702
We received a file containing a recording...

304
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:21,243
of the last phone conversation that Mr. Jeong,

305
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:23,613
the victim of the screen door accident,

306
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:25,212
had before his death.

307
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,952
Let's hear it right away.

308
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:32,253
Do Young, don't get angry and just hear me out.

309
00:20:34,793 --> 00:20:35,793
The company...

310
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:38,023
won't change.

311
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,192
Hey, you're back.

312
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:42,662
They'll only change after a few people die.

313
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,972
If both of us...

314
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:52,172
die on the job,

315
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:54,972
will things change a little?

316
00:21:04,412 --> 00:21:06,722
So just get out of the labor union.

317
00:21:08,553 --> 00:21:10,722
The world won't change even if you keep protesting.

318
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,993
Let's just work hard.

319
00:21:13,993 --> 00:21:16,493
(My friend, it wasn't your fault.)

320
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,432
That's the only thing people like us can do to survive.

321
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:31,513
Sir!

322
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,682
Ha Rang and I joined the company together.

323
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:36,283
He wanted to work hard and live a good life, but he died.

324
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:37,682
All he did was do what he was told.

325
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:41,023
Hence, we will no longer do as we're told.

326
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:43,493
Why? Because we don't want to die!

327
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:47,763
Don't touch me! Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

328
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:51,162
I'm human too, and I want to live.

329
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:53,503
I don't want to die!

330
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:54,972
I don't...

331
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:59,172
Why are you pushing her? You should be ashamed.

332
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:02,843
You jerks! How could you let a young kid just die like that?

333
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:13,823
(USB device connected)

334
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:10,543
(When will I become happy? My poor life)

335
00:23:39,642 --> 00:23:40,803
Ma'am.

336
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:46,843
I knew about it roughly.

337
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:51,553
That my son...

338
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:54,053
wasn't working at an office.

339
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:57,323
That he was doing something tough.

340
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:02,962
He was a pretty quiet boy...

341
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:06,902
and didn't talk about himself often.

342
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:10,803
But once, he told me what was on his mind.

343
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,773
What are you doing? Why are you looking in my wallet?

344
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:16,212
Why?

345
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:18,882
Is there a picture of your girlfriend in there or something?

346
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:20,482
No, of course not.

347
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,283
- Mom. - What?

348
00:24:22,283 --> 00:24:25,122
Can I quit work?

349
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,783
Why? Is it too tough?

350
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:30,023
Come on. There's no easy job in this world.

351
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:34,192
Still, there's no reason to do something so exhausting.

352
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:38,303
Son.

353
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:42,033
No matter how hard it is, you have to endure it.

354
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,972
You'll get used to it soon.

355
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:47,773
If you quit because it's too hard, you'll eventually quit again later.

356
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:50,343
Then you won't be able to do anything.

357
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:52,712
Okay.

358
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,243
What?

359
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:56,912
- Fine, I won't quit. - What?

360
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:59,583
- What? - All right.

361
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,793
- What? - Fine, I'll keep working.

362
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,952
I'll keep working. I'll really try my best.

363
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:05,293
- I'll work hard. - Really?

364
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:07,323
All right. I won't quit. Stop it.

365
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:09,033
Stop it, Mom!

366
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:10,793
Stop tickling me!

367
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:18,942
Why did I...

368
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:23,442
think of my debt at that moment?

369
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:27,043
When my son was in so much stress.

370
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:28,613
So...

371
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:33,152
I told him to just endure it and keep working.

372
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:35,422
I told him there was no easy job in this world...

373
00:25:35,523 --> 00:25:37,922
and that he should try his best when he had the chance.

374
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:39,662
That he'd get used to it soon.

375
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:41,263
So...

376
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:45,932
I was the one who told him not to quit.

377
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:49,803
Me.

378
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:01,283
I was really crazy.

379
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:03,053
I lost my mind.

380
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:04,853
I didn't even know...

381
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:07,053
how hard his job was...

382
00:26:07,952 --> 00:26:10,093
I was crazy.

383
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:17,533
I was crazy.

384
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:19,432
I lost my mind.

385
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:27,372
Ma'am.

386
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,043
I can't agree to an autopsy.

387
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,113
After you left,

388
00:26:35,382 --> 00:26:37,813
I thought it would be the right thing to do,

389
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:40,722
but I just can't agree to it.

390
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:42,793
Ms. Doh.

391
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:44,553
I'm sorry.

392
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:47,122
This is all my fault.

393
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:50,263
All I can think of is my dead son.

394
00:26:50,263 --> 00:26:52,563
This is all my fault.

395
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:57,333
I heard they found the cause of his accident.

396
00:26:57,732 --> 00:27:00,043
Isn't that enough?

397
00:27:00,773 --> 00:27:02,273
I've never...

398
00:27:03,642 --> 00:27:05,212
made him any nice food...

399
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,212
or bought him nice clothes.

400
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:14,023
He lived such a hard life and had to leave like that.

401
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,753
Just let me send him...

402
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:19,993
Please let me send him off in peace.

403
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:24,033
I'm begging you, Ms. Doh.

404
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,632
Okay, ma'am.

405
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:30,033
I'm sorry.

406
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:33,843
I'm sorry.

407
00:27:35,813 --> 00:27:37,412
My son.

408
00:27:37,412 --> 00:27:39,783
My baby, Ha Rang.

409
00:27:39,912 --> 00:27:42,253
It's all my fault...

410
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,152
My son...

411
00:27:45,783 --> 00:27:47,783
My son, Ha Rang...

412
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:32,162
Three years ago,

413
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,833
we saw another Ha Rang.

414
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:37,533
Yesterday afternoon at Line 2 Guui Station of Seoul Subway,

415
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:41,043
20-year-old Mr. Kim, who was repairing the screen door,

416
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:44,073
got stuck between the door and the train and died.

417
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:46,982
He risked his life to repair the screen door on his own...

418
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:50,452
and this 19-year-old man met his death alone.

419
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:51,682
(The late Mr. Kim)

420
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:53,323
He lived harder than anyone,

421
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:55,692
but being branded as a temporary worker for a subcontractor...

422
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,222
crushed the bright youth of this 19-year-old man...

423
00:28:58,222 --> 00:29:01,323
and the lives of his family that he left behind.

424
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:04,533
He could barely eat a cup of noodles...

425
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:06,662
let alone a proper meal.

426
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:10,833
His last day was a few hours before his birthday.

427
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:13,773
If he was alive for seven more hours,

428
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:15,912
he would have been 20 years old.

429
00:29:15,912 --> 00:29:18,783
But instead of congratulating him, we had to send our condolences.

430
00:29:18,783 --> 00:29:22,113
We still remember that day from three years ago.

431
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:24,553
The screen door will open.

432
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:26,722
These doors were made for the safety of our citizens,

433
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:29,222
but became a door of death in reality.

434
00:29:30,152 --> 00:29:32,122
The safety we enjoyed...

435
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:34,922
was actually guaranteed by someone else's life.

436
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:37,432
If the safety of everyone isn't guaranteed,

437
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:40,003
that means that no one is safe.

438
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:44,632
We learned that through Mr. Kim's accident.

439
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:46,343
It's not your fault.

440
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:47,773
You are right!

441
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:50,672
Not only are we outsourcing dangerous work, but in reality,

442
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:53,783
there's a saying that we're actually outsourcing death.

443
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:56,283
We want to tell all the laborers that passed away...

444
00:29:56,283 --> 00:29:58,283
that it wasn't their fault.

445
00:29:58,452 --> 00:30:00,523
We hope he knew that...

446
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:04,722
his death at the job site was never his fault.

447
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:05,823
(I want to live in a safe country where I won't die at work.)

448
00:30:05,823 --> 00:30:07,263
We call him...

449
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:10,763
Mr. Kim of Guui Station.
