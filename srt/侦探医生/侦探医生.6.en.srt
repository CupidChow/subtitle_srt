(Episode 6)

(Doctor Detective)

5
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,095
Who is it?

6
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:32,665
Mr. Huh?

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,575
Don't you want to know...

8
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:40,645
about the site in Namil?

9
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:47,530
Your house is a mess.

10
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,915
Cut to the chase. Abut the site in Namil.

11
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,615
Are you going to keep digging into this case?

12
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,055
Why did you come that day?

13
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,440
Are you following me?

14
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,825
What a rude way of thanking me.

15
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,695
This is the cellphone of the man who tried to kill you.

16
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:08,665
Why are you giving me this?

17
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,835
The man who tried to kill you...

18
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:13,805
is trying to kill me too.

19
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,745
It's Executive Director Moh Sung Kuk of TL Oshem.

20
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:19,275
This is all his scheme.

21
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:21,090
From fabricating the site, controlling the media,

22
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:23,085
and even attempting to kill you.

23
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:27,455
I need to turn the tables in order to live.

24
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,470
That goes for you too.

25
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:32,070
Are you saying my life depends on you?

26
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:34,825
UDC should reveal that the dormitory was fabricated.

27
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,665
I'll make the person involved confess that he was responsible.

28
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:40,780
I'm checking the surveillance cameras...

29
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,635
to find TL Oshem cars going to the dormitory in Namil.

30
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,675
I'll find something soon.

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,720
How pitiful of TL.

32
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:51,075
You're revealing the group's critical secrets...

33
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:54,215
just to win an internal power struggle?

34
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:57,730
All I have to do is to announce that it isn't the group's policy.

35
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,915
That Oshem was solely responsible for it.

36
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:05,525
Choi Tae Young. Is that what the chairman wants?

37
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,325
I know it isn't.

38
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,565
This is your own doing.

39
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,040
The chairman trusts Executive Director Moh,

40
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,435
and you're just trying to come between them.

41
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:18,420
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

42
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,175
We'll continue with the investigation.

43
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:26,045
Don't even think about using UDC.

44
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:29,415
Joong Eun, if you survived once,

45
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,315
you should be thankful.

46
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:36,285
I thought I'd died already three years ago.

47
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:42,825
Consider it as paying back a debt and do as I say.

48
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:44,380
And after that?

49
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:47,305
Open it to the media. And bring down Mr. Moh.

50
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:50,235
You'll get the justice that you want so much.

51
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:52,005
And I'll...

52
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,145
regain the chairman's trust.

53
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,015
And also,

54
00:02:57,827 --> 00:03:00,945
leave UDC and live quietly.

55
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,455
Seo Rin should...

56
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,225
grow up with her mom.

57
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,325
Are you...

58
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,635
taking good care of Seo Rin?

59
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,835
Why?

60
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,535
She called me earlier.

61
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,605
But we got disconnected right away.

62
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,105
She's doing well.

63
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:31,645
Since she's a kid, of course, she'll miss her mom.

64
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:36,415
I'll take that as a yes and go now. I'll be in touch.

65
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:46,495
Take care of yourself. I beg of you.

66
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,095
Seo Rin needs you.

68
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:15,655

(Chief Gong Il Sun)

70
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,095
So... In exchange for information, he wants you to make an issue?

71
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,810
Choi Tae Young wants to take down Moh Sung Kuk.

72
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:30,250
We should thank him if he wants to be a whistle-blower.

73
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:31,920
He may be using us.

74
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,850
Darn it. We've come too far anyway.

75
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,275
The higher-ups refused everything today.

76
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:41,015
Let's do it.

77
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,085
You can't go to the site anymore, okay?

78
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,715
Okay.

79
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,395
How much did she drink?

80
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,665
Four bottles.

81
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:00,095
I guess it didn't go well with her superiors.

82
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:03,820
She stinks!

83
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,050
She shouldn't have drunk on an empty stomach.

84
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,690
It's not good for her stomach.

85
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:12,420
We should get hangover soup for lunch.

86
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:13,430
Should I have it delivered?

87
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,915
Let's eat out.

88
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,500
Ms. Doh is taking the morning off.

89
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:19,730
Is she sick?

90
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,870
Have you heard from Mr. Huh?

91
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:23,600
It's not normal for him to come on time.

92
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,540
No. Something's going on.

93
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:27,610
A fling.

94
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,165
A what?

95
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,240
A fling and not a fight?

96
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,335
Sure, it's a fling.

97
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,750
They left the office together, yesterday.

98
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,775
In Mr. Huh's car.

99
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,560
It feels like you're mine. It feels like you're not...

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,060
Whatever. Let's just get coffee.

(Medical Certificate)

103
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:50,230
It's Kim Do Hyeong's medical certificate.

104
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,060
He has diabetes and needs insulin treatment.

105
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,785
I'd like to request an official visit as a doctor.

106
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:01,165
Sir, could you come here a moment?

107
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:05,765
What is it?

108
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,050
Visits aren't allowed to the UDC.

109
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:15,045
- Why not? - You know why.

110
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:18,645
That means other doctors are allowed, right?

111
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:23,290
Are you going to take responsibility if he faints from low blood sugar?

112
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,655
Stop making a fuss!

113
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,540
I'll allow any other qualified doctor.

114
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,670
Now leave.

115
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,655
We're busy, so please leave.

116
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,025
Get going, already!

117
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:39,110
You have to leave clear proof...

118
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:41,310
that you left.

119
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,050
We need a recording of you leaving on the surveillance camera,

120
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:47,545
and I'll show up right then.

121
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,895
Sir!

122
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:09,670
I'm the other qualified doctor,

123
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,980
Huh Min Ki.

124
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,965
This is my medical license.

125
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,120
Are you kidding me?

126
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,550
You're both from UDC, aren't you?

127
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:22,350
Yes. We're from UDC.

128
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,220
First, I'm not kidding.

129
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,860
DKA.

130
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,430
There's a thing called diabetic ketoacidosis.

131
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,930
It's an acute complication that can occur when a type 1 diabetic...

132
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,300
fails to regulate sugar levels.

133
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:34,430
The patient could die within 48 hours.

134
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:37,040
Kim Do Hyeong is a type 1 diabetic.

135
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,100
He's under an emergency interrogation.

136
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:42,110
We need some information before we move him.

137
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,310
- Come another time. - I'm sure...

138
00:07:44,314 --> 00:07:46,980
they're going to start lying about some internal affairs.

139
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,405
Then...

140
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:51,750
we have to bring up the Human Rights Commission.

141
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:54,475
Is this Mr. Park of the Human Rights Commission?

142
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,545
Yes, sir. Are you on your way?

143
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,045
Yes. Reporter Byun is accompanying you?

144
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,690
That's all right.

145
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,930
These people are civil servants, so they don't have portrait rights.

146
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,430
I believe people have the right to know.

147
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:10,800
They should know that the police are completely inconsiderate...

148
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,100
- of human rights... - All right, all right!

149
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:14,310
Quit it with the act and just leave the medicine.

150
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,680
Type 1 diabetics need insulin injections, not medicine.

151
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,740
You need to be trained to use the syringe.

152
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,250
Would you like to be trained?

153
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,980
However, it will be a violation of medical law.

154
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,280
Do you even know what insulin is?

155
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,405
Hey, doctor!

156
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,405
Go ahead.

157
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,060
Yes, all right.

158
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,775
Good job.

159
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,290
Make sure to reassure Do Hyeong as soon as you get in.

160
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,960
If he has mercury poisoning, he could suffer from anxiety,

161
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,770
paranoia, or show aggressiveness.

162
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,300
If he shows hypersensitivity,

163
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,470
be sure to put me on the phone.

164
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:47,665
You can tell them I'm his usual doctor.

165
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:51,795
Go away.

166
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,235
Go away!

167
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,550
I need to persuade the patient,

168
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,050
so let him talk to his usual doctor.

169
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:02,005
When he calms down, drag it as long as you can.

170
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:06,775
Remember that it's our only chance.

171
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,385
It's all right.

172
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,270
- Do Hyeong. - Who is this?

173
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:22,625
It's me, Doh Joong Eun. Calm down, Do Hyeong.

174
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:28,405
Ms. Doh!

175
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,135
I didn't do it.

176
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:35,720
I didn't do it, Ms. Doh.

177
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,060
I know.

178
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,960
You didn't do anything wrong.

179
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:42,190
You went to save Ha Rang, but your hand shook.

180
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:45,655
That's right, Ms. Doh.

181
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,300
Now, don't talk and just listen.

182
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:52,540
It's because you're sick. You were poisoned.

183
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,525
We're going to prove that.

184
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,065
You can trust the doctor in front of you.

185
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,765
Hang in there, just a bit.

186
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,020
I brought long-acting insulin.

187
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,050
You've never tried this before, so I'll teach you.

188
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,405
Okay.

189
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,060
- Here. Hold this in your hand... - Okay.

190
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,185
and then...

191
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,470
you hold your belly...

192
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,400
What are you doing? Don't touch him.

193
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,170
He needs to be trained for the new prescription.

194
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:27,270
How am I supposed to treat him without touching him?

195
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:29,365
Just finish it up and stand back.

196
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,440
You have to change the syringe...

197
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:35,680
with every use.

198
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:36,780
Okay.

199
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,080
For the dosage,

200
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:41,305
you can adjust it with the dial on the end.

201
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,615
- I didn't do it. - I know.

202
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:50,130
I'll do a final check-up.

203
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,885
Just a second...

204
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:57,755
Do Hyeong, push me back hard. Hurry!

205
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,670
What are you doing?

206
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:02,940
Hey! Stop that!

207
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,535
- All right, kid! - I didn't do it!

208
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,935
Could you run a blood test for the mercury, one last time?

209
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,445
It's Kim Do Hyeong's.

210
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,445
What?

211
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,445
Mr. Huh! You're amazing!

212
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:23,145
How did you do it?

213
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,885
It's a secret.

214
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:29,385
Let's keep it a secret until the results come out.

215
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,435
- Good job. - You, too.

216
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,905
Let's get Do Hyeong out of there.

217
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,875
Ms. Gong. Ms. Gong!

218
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,115
Look what I found.

219
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:55,790
"Under the conditions set by the president,"

220
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,960
"the head of the Undiagnosed Disease Center..."

221
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,660
"can open an evaluation committee for the epidemiological survey..."

222
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,800
"on any substance or disease..."

223
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,670
"that is considered to be of harm to the citizens."

224
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:06,900
The Epidemiological Survey Evaluation Committee.

225
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:08,840
It means there's a way.

226
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:10,510
- Do we have any kimchi? - Why...

227
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:13,365
would you mention kimchi now?

228
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,420
I know you enjoy having cup noodles,

229
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,790
so I bought some, just in case.

230
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,045
What a smart guy!

231
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:26,415
Ms. Byun,

232
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:29,745
don't you think I already brought up the evaluation committee?

233
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:31,785
The conditions...

234
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,630
set by the president...

235
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,800
needs consent from the head of the corporation.

236
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,840
And the head says he'll give permission...

237
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,140
only if we find proof that it's poisoning.

238
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,440
It's just nonsense.

239
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:44,910
How are we supposed to find it?

240
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:48,035
They got Kim Do Hyeong locked up and won't even allow visits.

241
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,905
Joong Eun.

242
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:53,235
Did you hear anything?

243
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,820
Darn it, of course not.

244
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,320
It hasn't even been a few days.

245
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:01,315
Ms. Gong, ma'am. Cheer up!

246
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:05,560
I should cheer up, but darn it!

247
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:08,030
Everyone's so afraid of TL!

248
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,685
What if...

249
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,325
we have the evidence?

250
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,540
Come on!

251
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,310
I'm sure Ms. Suk is almost done with the analysis.

252
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,665
What analysis?

253
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,675
5, 4,

254
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,420
3,

255
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:28,775
2, 1!

256
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:32,045
Kim Do Hyeong's blood test results are out!

257
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:36,645
The mercury is 60 times the average level.

258
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,530
Do Hyeong didn't commit murder.

259
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,300
His hand was shaking because of mercury poisoning.

260
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:43,430
But how did you collect his blood?

261
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,440
We were able to visit him using his medical condition...

262
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:46,640
and collected his blood in secret.

263
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:49,010
I did it.

264
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:51,210
And you? This will be useless if you got involved.

265
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:53,580
I've taken care of that.

266
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,165
It's fine now.

267
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,050
Good job. 60 times?

268
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,175
Great! Gather around.

269
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,315
We got the evidence for the mercury,

270
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,415
and we proved that it wasn't murder.

271
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,415
Now, we're taking this to the evaluation committee.

272
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,315
It's 60 times the amount of mercury in his blood.

273
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,900
We have to find out...

274
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:18,940
how in the world the mercury got in his system.

275
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,940
Did he breathe it in while working...

276
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,170
or did the heavy metal leak into the dorm?

277
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,865
Let's find that out. How he was exposed.

278
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:29,535
All right.

279
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,950
They're going to begin a meeting with the evaluation committee.

280
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,890
The Occupational Safety Authority gave their consent.

281
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,790
UDC will come to reinvestigate.

282
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,190
Should we place more guards at the site?

283
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,945
Call in a guard company.

284
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,830
Make sure to keep UDC from getting in.

285
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,800
The reason will be trespassing.

286
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,055
Call a company that's not part of TL Metro.

287
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,200
"Temporary restraining order against the epidemiological survey"?

288
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,270
What is this? Are you kidding me?

289
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:56,070
We're here by the law and have the right to...

290
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,035
In position, everyone.

291
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:07,135
Guys, there are no legal grounds for them to stop us.

292
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,645
Let's go.

293
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,160
You guys.

294
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,130
If you lay even just a finger on us, we'll sue you all.

295
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,485
Is that clear?

296
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,515
Il Sun, are we really going in though?

297
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,755
- Hey! - Stop her.

298
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:25,440
- Who do you think you are? - Get out of our way!

299
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,255
- What do you think you're doing? - Hey!

300
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,665
- Gosh! - Let go!

301
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:41,775
Gosh, Moh Sung Kuk is going all out to stop us.

302
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,145
He sent a bunch of guys to keep us out.

303
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:48,060
Hello? Hey, are you listening?

304
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,485
Yes.

305
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,785
It is clearly against the law.

306
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:53,915
Well, the thing is...

307
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:58,625
Hey, hasn't Choi Tae Young made a move yet?

308
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:00,695
You said you two struck a deal.

309
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:03,540
For now, let's try to find a solution on our own.

310
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:07,435
Contact Hanil SD's labor union and tell them to cause a stir.

311
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:09,635
Got it, okay.

312
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,375
Darn it.

313
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,390
We're humans too, and we want to be respected as such!

314
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,660
- We want to be respected! - We want to be respected!

315
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,930
The company is responsible for occupational accidents!

316
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,430
- The company is responsible! - The company is responsible!

317
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,560
Launch an epidemiological investigation!

318
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,670
- Launch an investigation! - Launch an investigation!

319
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,040
The company is responsible for occupational accidents!

320
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,540
- The company is responsible! - The company is responsible!

321
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,940
Launch an epidemiological investigation!

322
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:38,280
- Launch an investigation! - Launch an investigation!

323
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,580
We're humans too!

324
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,935
- We're humans too! - We're humans too!

325
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:45,180
The company must right the wrongs!

326
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,435
- Right the wrongs! - Right the wrongs!

327
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,550
The company must take responsibility!

328
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:51,075
- Take responsibility! - Take responsibility!

329
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,790
Launch an investigation.

330
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:55,190
- Launch an investigation! - Launch an investigation!

331
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:57,560
We're humans too!

332
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,560
(Who Should Take Responsibility for the Bui Station Accident?)

333
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:01,930
(Labor Union Blames the Company)

334
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,555
- Right the wrongs! - Right the wrongs!

335
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:07,495
- Take responsibility! - The drum and the drumsticks.

336
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:09,925
They look familiar.

337
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:11,580
Where did I see them?

338
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,935
- Launch an investigation! - Launch an investigation!

339
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,335
We're...

340
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:19,580
- We're humans too. - The screen door worker's death.

341
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:20,950
- We want to be respected! - Was it really murder?

342
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,390
- We want to be respected! - Or was it death by negligence...

343
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:24,920
caused by heavy metal poisoning?

344
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:27,490
Now, many are mentioning the role of...

345
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:28,690
the Epidemiological Survey Evaluation Committee,

346
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:32,460
which consists of occupational health and safety experts.

347
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,870
I heard TL is refusing to acknowledge the committee's role.

348
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:41,325
Correct. In fact, what TL is insisting lacks legal grounds.

349
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:43,610
When it comes to epidemiological investigations,

350
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:45,680
the committee has the most decision-making authority...

351
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:47,750
like the Supreme Court does for legal matters.

352
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,880
The Epidemiological Survey Evaluation Committee's role...

353
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:52,380
is to investigate and determine...

354
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:54,590
whether the company or employer is responsible in any way...

355
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,850
for the specific disease or accident in question.

356
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,190
Led by the chairperson,

357
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:01,285
the members follow the committee's majority decisions...

358
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:07,715
Joong Eun.

359
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:10,825
Ms. Doh isn't at her desk.

360
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:13,070
She stepped out saying she has to check something.

361
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:14,565
I think she's on the second floor.

362
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:17,125
Was the labor union's protest your idea?

363
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:18,635
That was clever.

364
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,765
Keep up the good work.

365
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,280
I'll correspond and take Moh Sung Kuk down.

366
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:25,835
But we need more concrete evidence to take it to the next step.

367
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,575
The Namil site will be empty today because of the labor union.

368
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,345
Just keep it in mind.

369
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:41,055
(TL Oshem Personnel Restructuring, Including new executive director)

370
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,935
Come to the second floor by yourself.

371
00:18:57,786 --> 00:19:00,205
(Doh Joong Eun)

372
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,045
I'm here. What's going on?

373
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:17,055
Come with me to the site in Namil tonight.

374
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:19,670
You want to go to that abandoned building at night?

375
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:22,170
There will be fewer people standing guard at night.

376
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:25,595
I found a few entrances we can use.

377
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:28,635
Well, it's...

378
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,720
You said you'd help me.

379
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:34,075
The thing is,

380
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,920
we'll be doomed if we're caught.

381
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,620
"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."

382
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,120
Isn't that your motto?

383
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:42,785
You wouldn't dig without knowing whether we'll find something.

384
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,285
Is there something?

385
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,515
Yes, there is.

386
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:51,725
My gosh.

387
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,955
Where have you been?

388
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,295
I went upstairs to get this.

389
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:02,265
Let me warn you once again. Don't go anywhere.

390
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,380
Whether it's the site in Namil or TL Metro,

391
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:07,775
don't go anywhere near TL. Do you understand?

392
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:11,475
- Yes. - Tell me that you won't go.

393
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:13,875
I won't go anywhere near TL.

394
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:34,135
How did you know there'd be fewer security guards tonight?

395
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:39,535
We just need to distract those two somehow.

396
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,275
How can we distract them?

397
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:44,615
Freeze.

398
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:48,045
Both of you, crawl out through the hole. Right now.

399
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:50,715
Out, now!

400
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:54,785
Gosh, Jin Hak!

401
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,125
Mr. Ha.

402
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,865
Ms. Doh, you need to leave at once.

403
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,350
If you get caught, all of us will have to leave UDC.

404
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,420
We won't get caught.

405
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,875
Right. What?

406
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:17,605
Gosh. Hey, Min Ki.

407
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:20,245
I'll tell Chief Gong on you.

408
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,945
You, traitor. You're human trash.

409
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,460
What's your problem now?

410
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:27,130
If you persuade her and get her out of there,

411
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:28,570
I won't tell Chief Gong anything.

412
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,970
Stop fooling around and get out of there, please.

413
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,870
Get lost.

414
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,625
Goodness, what's with you two?

415
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:38,080
What are you going to do if you get caught?

416
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,295
We won't. We'll sneak in through the back.

417
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,920
Wait, Min Ki. What about me?

418
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,935
Since you came all the way here, we're now in the same boat.

419
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:49,720
Stand guard here. If anything happens,

420
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,305
call me right away. Got it?

421
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,945
I'm sorry, Chief Gong.

422
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,855
Darn it. There's a mosquito here.

423
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,455
Be careful.

424
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:06,425
Be careful. This is heavy.

425
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,865
I served as a medical officer in the Marine Corps.

426
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:17,265
I had to run tests in the dark,

427
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,475
so this is...

428
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:23,805
I'm so used to this. Even in pitch-black darkness...

429
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,445
What? What are you doing?

430
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,025
Couldn't you open it quietly? I mean, we snuck in here.

431
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:39,955
What's this? This thing.

432
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,610
It's a chair.

433
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,835
Let me tell you something though. No one can catch ghosts.

434
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:49,105
I have a lot of experience working in places...

435
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:53,335
- like cemeteries. - Over there.

436
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:56,605
Why? What is it? What's over there?

437
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:02,145
Hold on.

438
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,985
It must be empty inside.

439
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:09,485
I think these doors are welded together though.

440
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:11,425
We should break them.

441
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:15,325
Didn't you hear me? I think they're welded together.

442
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,840
- Right, exactly. - What are you going to do?

443
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,265
- Step back. - What? Why?

444
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,280
I didn't know you were so... My gosh!

445
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:24,335
Wait, hold on. Just a second.

446
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:26,535
I'll do it. Let me do this, okay?

447
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:31,975
So this is where the mercury spills happened, right?

448
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,575
I got this.

449
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:44,755
Have a look.

450
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,565
Hurry! We need to open this darn door!

451
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:52,080
Someone's here. Be quick. You have to hurry!

452
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,005
Darn it. All right, let's decide what to do.

453
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:58,380
We should have enough time to run to the hole if we leave now,

454
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:00,875
but we'll be stuck here if we lock the doors. It's do or die.

455
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:03,345
Are you sure we can find evidence in this room?

456
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:06,975
Okay.

457
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:10,515
Then we should...

458
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,160
- They're over there. - Get them!

459
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:15,900
Let me do it. I can do it quickly. I got it.

460
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:18,295
- Hurry! - Stop them.

461
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:22,965
Move. Step aside.

462
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,795
- Open this! - Hurry!

463
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:31,065
Hurry up!

464
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,975
- Open this! - Gosh, my back...

465
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,315
- Hey, open this door! - Hang on.

466
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,315

467
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,465

I'm at the basement of the abandoned building at Namil site.

The blood from a laborer showed a high mercury rate.

476

What can I do? I can't run a red light.

00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:54,045
Darn it. We're getting stopped at every light.

499

- I found it. - Found what?

00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:59,130
How they were exposed to mercury.

501

Stuck between a magazine at the dormitory,

503
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:07,025
I found a pair of drumsticks.

504
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,825
It means he played the drums until recently.

505
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:13,835
Then they must've had a place where they practiced.

506
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,080
The noise level of drums is more than 100dB.

507
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:19,535
It must be a closed space, where the sound can't be heard.

According to our analysis,

519
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:55,545
the mercury rate was 20 times higher than the standard rate.

520
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:58,160
The victim was poisoned by mercury at this place.

521

Did someone order him to go in there?

522
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,190
It's his fault for going inside an abandoned building.

523
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,930
Yes, it's his fault.

524

540

It has been voted as work-related.

541
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:04,105
The decision's been made that TL Metro is responsible.

542
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,020
What is this? This is nothing but unfair treatment of companies.

543
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:10,630
Will you let everyone apply for industrial accidents now?

544
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:13,330
- This is ridiculous. - All right, then.

545
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,870
Great job, everyone. Thank you.

546
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,070
Chairman Park, thank you.

547
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:20,270
Let's wrap it up now.

548
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,840
Come over here. What if you got poisoned?

549
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,435
I wasn't even in there for 10 minutes.

550
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:32,905
So take this vitamin C shot for 10 minutes.

551
00:29:33,622 --> 00:29:35,775
You need to remove any mercury residue.

552
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:42,745
It'll be over in a second.

You're all done.

557
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:04,505
I have a secret to tell you.

558
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,475
I'll apply for an industrial accident for this.

559
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,105
You'll testify as a colleague, right?

560
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:16,785
Before that, I'll take a vitamin C shot too.

561
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:25,695
Come on.

562
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,095
Here. Great job, everybody.

- Good job! - Good job!

564
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:36,835
TL Metro will go to trial now.

565
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,650
We'll see if they're charged as the main contractors.

566
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:41,850
The prosecution has to crack down on the biotech complex.

567
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:44,975
I doubt it. Everyone's making a fuss that it's the new future.

568

You didn't find them?

569
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:50,745
They're giving each other vitamin shots. So intimately.

570
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:53,800
Hey. Don't they seem awfully close lately?

571
00:30:53,802 --> 00:30:56,570
Yes, those two are creating some great synergy.

572
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:59,240
Even when someone fell down and almost died,

573
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:02,010
- they didn't even blink an eye... - What who?

574
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,370
- Well... - That looks delicious.

575
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:05,710

617
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,350
We checked the soil at the site in Namil,

618

you can say it's permanent.

and said he would cooperate with the investigation.

720
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:44,515
Let's decide what to do regarding the previous item.

721
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:48,100
I think we need to be tougher on UDC.

722
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,255
- Agreed. - Definitely, teach them a lesson.

723
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,355
Mr. Kang.

724
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,865
Are you Mr. Moh's minion?

725
00:44:58,145 --> 00:44:59,880
Watch what you say!

726
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,435
I wanted to be respectful to you at this meeting, but I can't.

727
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:07,075
Are we holding this meeting to carry out Mr. Moh's orders?

728
00:45:08,155 --> 00:45:10,075
Are we here to only talk about Oshem?

729
00:45:12,259 --> 00:45:15,245
You all made it this far because you knew who to curry favor with.

730
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:17,015
Now, if you can't even do that,

731
00:45:18,566 --> 00:45:20,285
it's time for you to be let go.

732
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:26,270
Listen up.

733
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:29,510
I called this meeting, not Mr. Moh.

734
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,935
So all you have to do is listen to me...

735
00:45:34,215 --> 00:45:35,595
and do as I say.

736
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:45,205
To compete with Maomi, we're going to drop our prices...

737
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,075
starting with the SL-5 series.

738
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:50,460
Let's make sure our prices are lower than Maomi's.

739
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:53,460
Well, people are already criticizing the major corporations...

740
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:55,660
for underpaying their outsourcing service providers.

741
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,530
If we go this route,

742
00:45:57,538 --> 00:45:59,540
we'll be criticized severely given the current situation.

743
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,895
Mr. Choi.

744
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:04,940
Is this the Ministry of Labor or the Human Rights Committee?

745
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:06,640
Replace the vendors that can't lower their prices.

746
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:08,565
And Oshem will handle the media.

747
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,705
Do I need to tell you how?

748
00:46:16,957 --> 00:46:18,490
How could he decide to lower our prices...

749
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:20,290
without even seeking the lab's confirmation?

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:21,890
He's lost his mind.

751
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:23,830
He obviously feels cornered.

752
00:46:23,831 --> 00:46:25,645
How dare he call me a minion?

753
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,925
As for the price reduction strategy,

754
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:31,770
there's an 80-percent chance that it'll fail.

755
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:35,295
He should clearly give up, but he kept on pushing for it.

756
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:37,265
Don't be so upset.

757
00:46:37,912 --> 00:46:42,195
You got half of the job done by mentioning UDC.

758
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:48,305
Good work today.

759
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:27,245
(Doh Joong Eun)

760
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:44,195
Oh, dear.

761
00:47:53,754 --> 00:47:56,650
Please leave a message after the tone.

762
00:47:56,657 --> 00:47:59,420
Ms. Doh, we must seize your property for not complying with the order...

763
00:47:59,426 --> 00:48:01,675
to compensate the other party for the damages.

764
00:48:03,764 --> 00:48:06,760
Oh, my. Look at you, Seo Rin.

765
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:09,925
You can draw so well.

766
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:12,925
Seo Rin.

767
00:48:13,741 --> 00:48:15,995
Can you write your name?

768
00:48:16,277 --> 00:48:18,540
Write, "Choi Seo Rin".

769
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:20,065
Here, right here.

770
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,135
(Choi Seo Rin)

771
00:48:26,854 --> 00:48:28,405
Choi...

772
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:33,145
Seo Rin.

773
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,345
(Choi Seo Rin)

774
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:36,885
And a heart.

775
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:41,415
Seo Rin.

776
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:44,825
You wrote this, right?

777
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,195
Who is it for?

778
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:52,095
I don't know.

779

(Choi Seo Rin)

783
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,835
"That's right. I'm a yellow butterfly."

784
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:30,635
- "The yellow butterfly..." - How did it go?

785
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:33,775
Don't worry, sir. I made sure it'll remain strictly confidential.

786
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:37,090
Good. No one can find out about it, okay?

787
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:38,705
Yes, sir. Well understood.

788
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:43,115
As for Seo Rin's daycare, I told the teacher she'll take a week off.

789
00:49:43,163 --> 00:49:45,685
- The hotel's been booked too, sir. - Okay, great.

790
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:48,315
Also...

791
00:49:48,836 --> 00:49:50,655
(Choi Seo Rin)

792
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:54,195
What did you say Joong Eun is up to these days?

793
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:05,480
Ms. Doh, hurry.

794
00:50:05,486 --> 00:50:07,450
There are so many patients in the waiting room now.

795
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:09,135
Okay, I'll be right there.

796
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,175
UDC?

797
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:15,760
Is that so?

798
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,345
(Choi Seo Rin)

799
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:20,285
- Dig more into it. - I will, sir.

800
00:50:21,035 --> 00:50:24,070
And call Mr. Moh for me.

801
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:25,485
Yes, sir.

802
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:33,980
- What's happening? - Due to the mercury poisoning case,

803
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:36,550
we're now known for correctly diagnosing occupational diseases.

804
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,405
When can we be seen by the doctor?

805
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:40,805
I'm sorry. Please wait just a little longer.

806
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:48,275
(One dollar)

807
00:51:15,189 --> 00:51:16,645
I'd like to settle up.

808
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,875
Hye Mi.

809
00:51:24,932 --> 00:51:26,515
Aren't you Park Hye Mi?

810
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:28,355
Ma'am.

811
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:32,385
I live in this neighborhood.

812
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:35,795
It's so nice to run into you.

813
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:39,165
How have you been?

814
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,035
I've been doing all right.

815
00:51:44,485 --> 00:51:46,805
You still paint, right?

816
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,170
- Thank you, sir. - Thanks for your hard work.

817
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:05,655
I'll be off, then.

818
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:20,435
I don't want to see you wasting your talent.

819
00:52:20,621 --> 00:52:23,675
I asked to see you because I wanted to have a talk with you.

820
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:25,350
I see.

821
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,890
I know you haven't been preparing to apply for art schools,

822
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,160
but you're in 11th grade now,

823
00:52:30,164 --> 00:52:33,455
so I think you'll get in with just a little bit of effort.

824
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:36,555
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

825
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:40,455
Hye Mi, I'll help you.

826
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,855
You should tell your parents.

827
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,765
Shall I speak with your parents in person?

828
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:50,835
Sure.

829
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,185
Eat up.

830
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:09,515
Thanks for the food.

831
00:53:30,891 --> 00:53:33,745
Is there something you want to say to me?

832
00:53:37,097 --> 00:53:38,515
No.

833
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,685
- Here you go. - Thanks.

834
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:24,625
Hey, I told you to come quickly. You little...

835
00:55:25,172 --> 00:55:26,655
Get in.

836
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:30,595
Why are you so late?

837
00:55:30,644 --> 00:55:32,225
Darn it.

838
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:17,890

(Funeral Arrangements and Data on the Late Mun Song Myeon)

841
00:56:36,443 --> 00:56:39,240
We all remember the vigorous speech of this man...

842
00:56:39,246 --> 00:56:40,880
from 30 years ago.

843
00:56:40,881 --> 00:56:44,180
The ideal society I have in mind is people living in unity,

844
00:56:44,184 --> 00:56:46,680
and where everyone doesn't worry about food, clothing,

845
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:48,320
and other things like that.

846
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,320
Where people don't commit dirty acts,

847
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:54,060
and a world where everyone can live their daily lives happily.

848
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:57,690
To him, there was a heartbreaking death of one man.

849
00:56:57,698 --> 00:57:00,060
Last July 2, at Yeoeuido St. Mary's Hospital,

850
00:57:00,067 --> 00:57:04,025
a 15-year-old laborer died of mercury poisoning.

851
00:57:04,038 --> 00:57:07,500
The name of the boy who died at 15 from mercury poisoning...

852
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,140
was Mun Song Myeon.

853
00:57:09,143 --> 00:57:12,610
He always said he wanted to visit his home in the countryside.

854
00:57:12,613 --> 00:57:15,440
That's what lingers in my head the most.

855
00:57:15,449 --> 00:57:17,410
He said he couldn't wait to go home.

856
00:57:17,418 --> 00:57:19,650
Born from parents who farmed in the countryside,

857
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:21,620
he was the third son out of six siblings,

858
00:57:21,622 --> 00:57:24,675
and he was a sincere and kind child.

859
00:57:24,892 --> 00:57:28,460
The reason he started working at a factory when he was 15...

860
00:57:28,462 --> 00:57:30,530
was because of his high school tuition.

861
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:33,200
It was a company that made mercury thermometers.

862
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,030
When he was working,

863
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,470
he didn't have any idea that something was wrong.

864
00:57:38,472 --> 00:57:40,270
He was the tallest one.

865
00:57:40,274 --> 00:57:43,070
He was taller and healthier than friends his age,

866
00:57:43,077 --> 00:57:45,310
and about a month after he started working at the factory,

867
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:48,110
he started to suffer from an unknown pain.

868
00:57:48,115 --> 00:57:49,780
What's wrong? Are you sick?

869
00:57:49,783 --> 00:57:52,510
- My back hurts, and I can't sleep. - Your back?

870
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:55,320
The university hospital couldn't identify his disease,

871
00:57:55,322 --> 00:57:57,890
and his body felt numb and sore.

872
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,720
He couldn't even eat properly. The pain was so severe...

873
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:03,960
that even his teeth started shaking and falling out.

874
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:06,500
After being hospitalized for two months,

875
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,055
his disease was identified as mercury poisoning.

876
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,170
The company ordered him to inject mercury inside a closed space...

877
00:58:12,172 --> 00:58:13,970
without any safety equipment.

878
00:58:13,974 --> 00:58:17,695
As a result, he suffered from acute mercury poisoning.

879
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,310
But his company...

880
00:58:19,313 --> 00:58:21,910
refused to accept it as an industrial accident,

881
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,705
claiming it was due to pesticides from the countryside.

882
00:58:24,885 --> 00:58:26,480
After this case was covered by the media,

883
00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:28,850
it was finally accepted as an industrial accident...

(June 30, 2019)

886
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,390
I'd like to thank everyone...

887
00:58:33,394 --> 00:58:36,330
who came here, in remembrance of Song Myeon.

888
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:38,890
But 12 days after it was accepted as an industrial accident,

889
00:58:38,899 --> 00:58:41,700
he passed away without even leaving a will.

890
00:58:41,702 --> 00:58:45,100
It's already been more than 30 years.

891
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,670
But nothing has changed.

892
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:49,910
I really hope there won't be a second Song Myeon...

893
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:52,410
and that no one gets hurt or dies.

894
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:54,340
That's my biggest wish.

895
00:58:54,348 --> 00:58:58,105

896
00:58:58,552 --> 00:59:01,220
"What has changed?"

897
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:02,380
(The late Mun Song Myeon)

898
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:05,620
(Doctor Detective)

899
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:06,820
Oh, no!

900
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:08,260
What is that?

901
00:59:08,262 --> 00:59:10,290
Stop! No, please!

902
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,060
Who are you?

903
00:59:12,066 --> 00:59:14,260
Me? A doctor.

904
00:59:14,268 --> 00:59:16,870
If it weren't for you, he could've been hurt badly.

905
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:19,640
The police want us to investigate?

906
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,740
His girlfriend secretly fed him a pesticide.

907
00:59:21,742 --> 00:59:24,410
Ma'am, I really didn't kill Jin Sung.

908
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:26,510
Please, you have to believe me!

909
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:27,880
What am I missing?

910
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:30,080
Is it an industrial accident or not?

911
00:59:30,084 --> 00:59:31,350
Is it, or is it not?

912
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:32,705
Mr. Huh.

913
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,320
Let's try that again.

914
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,880
I'll carry it with me...

915
00:59:35,889 --> 00:59:37,720
and take care of it.

916
00:59:37,724 --> 00:59:38,850
Peace.

917
00:59:38,859 --> 00:59:40,460
I was thoughtless.

918
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:43,060
I won't cause trouble for TL ever again.

919
00:59:43,063 --> 00:59:45,360
Like you asked, I made some changes to UDC.

920
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:47,500
What have you done to UDC?

921
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:50,870
Do you know how many innocent people got hurt or died?

922
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:52,655
One day,

923
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:54,955
you'll be brought to justice.
