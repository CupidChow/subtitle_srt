00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:38,550
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:57,545
Why are you here at night?

3
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:58,816
Were you waiting for me?

4
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:01,386
I've been peering out for you for so long that my neck got longer.

5
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:03,316
I heard a very nice song.

6
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:05,256
I want you to hear before I forget,

7
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:07,256
so I rushed over here.

8
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:10,426
It's sweet and lethal.

9
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:12,156
"Sweet"? That's great.

10
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:13,995
- "Lethal"? That's great too. - Yes.

11
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:15,525
Shall I have a listen?

12
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:18,365
I have a friend who visits me occasionally.

13
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:20,665
When we discuss music,

14
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:23,736
I forget if the sun is rising or setting.

15
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,575
He takes a different form each time.

16
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:28,805
You know, back in the day,

17
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:31,615
I showed them what rock music is.

18
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:34,885
- One day, he's an old rocker. - It doesn't feel the same now.

19
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:37,415
So, have you listened to my music?

20
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,256
Of course I have.

21
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:42,456
- He's an over-reactive old man. - I played the recorder today.

22
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:45,596
And another day, she's a chatty little girl.

23
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:48,025
I don't know which is the true form,

24
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:52,736
but only when I'm cornered, at a cliff's edge, out of my mind...

25
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:54,736
does that person finally appear.

26
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:49,645
The friend that any artist yearns for.

27
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:51,216
This is what I call him.

28
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:52,216
Old man.

29
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:53,515
That's awesome.

30
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,776
Not everyone can meet the old man.

31
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:23,415
He doesn't come to everyone.

32
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:26,856
In that sense, I'm a very lucky guy.

33
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:42,835
(Music chart)

34
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,476
There's no twist, it's no fun,

35
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:47,236
and he's so arrogant.

36
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:51,645
I'm the main reason why our stock is so stable.

37
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:53,476
But you say it's no fun?

38
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:55,316
Let's see what might interest you.

39
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:59,316
Hey, would you like to wear a suit?

40
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:06,356
Good job, my baby!

41
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:18,936
Composers should be able to hear their songs in their heads...

42
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:21,275
before they actually compose them.

43
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:22,575
- Playing the guitar... - "Playing the guitar..."

44
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:23,775
- for every single note... - "for every single note..."

45
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:26,116
- is something that amateurs do. - "is something that amateurs do."

46
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:29,186
That's what Ha Rip wanted me to say.

47
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:31,085
Here's the Popularity Award for the 2019 Traditional Music Awards.

48
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:33,885
"Today's Youth" by Ha Rip.

49
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,756
"Music was like..."

50
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:37,426
- "a one-sided love for me". - a one-sided love for me.

51
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:38,926
- "I was very lonely". - I was very lonely.

52
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:41,195
But I feel like my love is finally getting acknowledged.

53
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:46,066
My gosh, you totally got me.

54
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:49,606
The Soundtrack Award goes to Ha Rip. Congratulations.

55
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:51,775
Background music?

56
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:54,506
I don't like that term to begin with.

57
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:56,445
A movie soundtrack...

58
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:59,275
is an independent factor in itself that has nothing to do with...

59
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,075
You'd better go to the awards ceremony.

60
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:05,686
Don't you want to win the award?

61
00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:08,525
I like the award, but I don't like receiving it.

62
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:11,325
I need to thank them and act polite about getting it.

63
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:13,496
Why do I need to thank them? I'm getting it because I deserve it.

64
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:14,726
I never begged for the award.

65
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:19,736
The Grand Award for the 18th Children's Song Festival...

66
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:21,736
goes to Ha Rip who composed and wrote...

67
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:25,176
"With My Father", which was sung by Ko Eun Sung.

68
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:26,436
Congratulations!

69
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:32,015
"With My Father" is a song with pure and warm melodies...

70
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:34,775
and original lyrics that show how much...

71
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:36,015
a child loves his father.

72
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:37,986
Please tell us how you feel.

73
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:41,885
If my songs...

74
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:45,025
help kids have hope,

75
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:47,455
and if my songs allow kids...

76
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:49,366
to build dreams,

77
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:52,835
then that would be the main reason why...

78
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,035
I make music.

79
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:56,236
Okay, thank you. Once again, congratulations.

80
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:59,075
- The reason. - Okay.

81
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:01,676
I still don't know why I make music.

82
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:03,676
Actually, I don't even know...

83
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:05,976
if I make music so other people could...

84
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:08,785
- listen to it. - Give him a round of applause.

85
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:12,585
We will end the 18th Children's Song Festival...

86
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:14,715
by listening to "With My Father" one more time...

87
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:16,585
after we hand him the award.

88
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:19,056
We'd like to thank everyone for joining us.

(Horowitz Music Award)

91
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,455
(2014 Korean Music Festival)

92
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:24,256
Someone filed a complaint again.

93
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:26,025
They want you to stop feeding the stray cat.

94
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,496
Don't let the cat starve.

95
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:29,796
And how is it a stray cat? It has a home.

96
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:31,635
You should care for me as much as you care for that cat.

97
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:34,765
You're the one who should be as nice as the cat.

98
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,436
I saved both of you from the street, but you're so different.

99
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:39,905
Even dogs wag their tails after about three years.

100
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:42,976
Oh, okay. Should I wag my tail for you?

101
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,216
I'm sorry. I wonder where my tail went.

102
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,206
You punk.

103
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:12,076
Where have you been?

104
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:16,006
Where were you all this time? Come here.

105
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:18,746
Where were you?

106
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,045
Don't wander around at night.

107
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:25,586
It's dangerous outside.

108
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,025
There we go.

109
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,736
What should I give you?

110
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:40,565
This looks...

(Liver and Gallbladder, New Song)

112
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:01,555
Let me tell you something.

113
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:04,385
I won every single award out there.

114
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,655
But you see,

115
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:13,635
I feel like someone gave me some homework to do.

116
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:43,196
And that homework...

117
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:45,395
(Notice of Payment)

118
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,895
is from a long time ago.

119

(The 10-year contract terminates in 6 days.)

(Your soul will be taken in six days. From Ryu)

121
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:59,116
So what happens if I sell my soul?

122
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:02,545
Do I die?

123
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:11,356
What are you doing here?

124
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:14,295
- Hey, Seo Dong Cheon. - I'm Ha Rip.

125
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:15,996
I'm not Seo Dong Cheon.

126
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:21,765
Get out of my house!

127
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:35,185
Hey!

128
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:36,246
(Seoul, in 2009)

129
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,216
You darn punk!

130
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:40,785
I heard your demo.

131
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:43,726
But it won't sell.

132
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:45,456
Can you give me back my demo?

133
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,275
Where's your mom?

134
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,246
Don't you have one?

135
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,246
I don't have a mom either.

136
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:11,545
Let's go.

137
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:14,055
I'm not even halfway there

138
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:19,356
I'm already stuck

139
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:22,126
In the darkness

140
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:28,435
Where's my dream that wishes to fly?

141
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:37,076
How far do I need to go

142
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,716
To find that dream

143
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:49,756
I keep calling for it

144
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:57,996
You darn punk!

145
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:00,535
At least give me my guitar case!

146
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:03,466
That thing costs a lot! My gosh!

147
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:30,866
Seo Dong Cheon.

148
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,866
What a lousy life.

149
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,635
I guess this is how my life is going to end.

150
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,746
I don't know if he's persistent or stupid.

151
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:46,346
Who listens to that kind of music these days?

152
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:47,545
Does he think he's Cho Yong Pil or something?

153
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:50,015
Seo Dong Cheon? I guess you're still making music. I'm impressed.

154
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,015
Are you the guardian? You can't be here, sir.

155
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,685
Please leave.

156
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:04,025
- No! - Get out!

157
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,966
- It's my music. - I've had enough!

158
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:18,675
Where am I?

159
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:25,685
Am I really dead?

160
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:34,425
I see you're up.

161
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:36,326
Add a little funk next time.

162
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:38,665
The song lacks flare.

163
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:44,006
(Seo Dong Cheon's demo)

164
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:46,275
How did you get this?

165
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:47,476
Why would you throw it out?

166
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:50,576
In the distant future,

167
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:52,846
this will be considered as a masterpiece.

168
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:54,976
People will have to get in line to buy it.

169
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:57,515
Were you following me?

170
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:58,986
Have I been kidnapped?

171
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:01,285
What would I kidnap you for?

172
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:04,285
You're nothing but old singer with no career.

173
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:06,425
You wouldn't be worth a penny.

174
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:09,496
Maybe I should've just taken you to the cops?

175
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:14,996
Well, since we got together like this though,

176
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:16,836
we should get some drinks first.

177
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:22,076
Where on earth am I?

178
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:27,846
I'm sure you know "Faust" by the literary giant Goethe.

179
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,086
Let me explain then.

180
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:32,756
To put it simply,

181
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:35,885
it's about a man who sells his soul to the devil.

182
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:39,456
That's why I'm sitting in front of you right now.

183
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:42,525
- What? - That's why I brought you here.

184
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:44,726
What I want from you...

185
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:47,295
- is your soul. - What?

186
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:50,836
From this moment on, whatever you want,

187
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:53,275
whatever that may be, will come true for 10 years.

188
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:56,675
It'll be as if you've become the Almighty.

189
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:58,106
In return,

190
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:02,885
you'll give up your soul when the contract expires.

191
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:12,196
I must be dead.

192
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:15,395
Life has surely gotten great.

193
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:18,096
We get to cross the Jordan River on an airplane.

194
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,606
You there, Mr. Grip Reaper,

195
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,836
just cut to the chase.

196
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:27,376
Am I heading into the light or down the fire pit?

197
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:29,206
Some suddenly turn their lives around

198
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:31,076
as if they've won the lottery.

199
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:35,076
Some live their lives boldly as if they can never fail.

200
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:36,685
Wrap your head around it.

201
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:38,885
Haven't you met such people before?

202
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:41,815
I have. A lot, actually.

203
00:16:42,015 --> 00:16:45,596
Is what they achieved based solely on their competence?

204
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:46,655
Are you saying...

205
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,665
that they all sold their souls?

206
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,726
Here he comes!

207
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:53,866
Some are never criticized for breaking the law...

208
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:57,035
and some are never condemned for the crimes that they committed.

209
00:16:57,035 --> 00:17:00,076
What if there was no need for you...

210
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,006
to try and be recognized?

211
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:03,805
What if you lived a life...

212
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:07,015
where people flocked to you like moths to a flame?

213
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:10,586
What if you lived a life that everyone envies?

214
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:16,426
That could be your life too, you know.

215
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,886
Give it some faith.

216
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:19,525
It'll only cost your soul.

217
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:21,825
Sell my soul?

218
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,795
Selling my organs would make better sense.

219
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:26,365
Mr. Seo, in order for this to be a scam,

220
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:27,535
you need to be worth something.

221
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:34,305
Are you telling me that you're the devil then?

222
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:37,105
It is how people address me.

223
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:39,476
They say I'm a devilish human.

224
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,216
I don't know what you're trying to pull here,

225
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:44,845
but all I have are my two balls.

226
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,555
Actually, I have two kidneys too,

227
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:47,716
so that you can have.

228
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,186
Even though I had nothing, I still had my pride.

229
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:52,426
Sell my soul?

230
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,055
You're bargaining with the wrong man.

231
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:55,825
Do you hate having money?

232
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,065
Will fame make you uncomfortable?

233
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:04,636
Let's say that this is true.

234
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:07,875
Why me though?

235
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:10,345
Why do you want my soul?

236
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:12,815
This isn't because we want your soul.

237
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:16,986
This is about you having a reason to sell your soul to us.

238
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,446
Just think...

239
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:20,785
about every aspect of your current life.

240
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:25,656
Is your soul worth selling if it can give you a new life?

241
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:34,196
Why? Are you afraid that it's stolen?

242
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,636
Well, it is.

243
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:40,436
Fine, I'll consider you dead.

244
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:41,906
Responsibility...

245
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,545
means nothing to you, doesn't it?

246
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:46,615
Responsibility?

247
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:49,845
Why must I be responsible when my parents never were?

248
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:55,216
I lived my life making sure that I never had to take responsibility.

249
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:56,956
My music is all I can be responsible for.

250
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,426
Although, even that hasn't worked out.

251
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:04,696
That money... Well, it just happened.

252
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:08,065
Please know that I'm not that kind of person.

253
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,236
I do.

254
00:19:13,976 --> 00:19:15,305
Throughout the years,

255
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:17,775
I have devoted myself into music!

256
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:28,186
So what would you want us to do?

257
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:32,426
Let me rephrase that. Mr. Seo, what do you truly desire?

258
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:38,226
Okay, and?

259
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:42,065
I wouldn't have lived this way if money was never a problem.

260
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:44,136
It's a matter of pride.

261
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:45,335
The thing with money...

262
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,105
is that life is uncomfortable without it.

263
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:50,775
We should possess the very least to not have to worry.

264
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:54,015
That's too long. I advise you to keep everything...

265
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,515
under two syllables.

266
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:00,055
- Money. - Exactly.

267
00:20:00,656 --> 00:20:02,726
In other words, you want to be rich.

268
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:06,355
(2. To be rich)

269
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:09,065
- And? - "Ahead of my time"...

270
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:11,496
or "an unfortunate genius"? As if.

271
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:13,795
It's just another way of saying that my music is bad.

272
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:15,906
Why won't people listen to my music?

273
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:19,275
I can't remember the last time I heard a cheer or applause.

274
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:22,506
Both are vital to a singer.

275
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,146
I wish to be a successful...

276
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:29,716
Right, you wish to be successful.

277
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:30,886
Well...

278
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:33,156
Yes.

279
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,986
There. Your wishes have been applied for.

280
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,656
Please sign.

281
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:41,496
Just like it says in the contract, it can't ever be annulled.

282
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:42,966
Don't forget that.

283
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:46,666
This slot is still blank.

284
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:51,706
You're a meticulous one, aren't you? Would you like one more option?

285
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:54,976
There are a lot of things I'd try if I were 30 years younger.

286
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:56,146
I'd experiment with music,

287
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:59,246
communicate with fans, and gain fame.

288
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:04,216
(4. Youth)

289
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:22,295
(Seo Dong Cheon)

290
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:25,875
Now, the process is complete.

291
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,105
Paramedics!

292
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:31,746
Slow and steady. Watch his neck.

293
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:34,615
Together in 1, 2, 3.

294
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:37,146
Stay with us, young man!

295
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:38,716
Stay with us!

296
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,575
This is the ER.

297
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:09,946
For nearly 60 years,

298
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,115
I had never achieved anything substantial.

299
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:14,886
I rarely took responsibility for anything either.

300
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:18,926
My life was nothing but an absolute failure,

301
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,855
so youth, talent, and wealth...

302
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,396
were more than just a gift.

303
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:29,535
I was given a life where I could take responsibility...

304
00:22:31,865 --> 00:22:33,676
if I wanted to.

305
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:38,605
Some might say it's an opportunity.

306
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,775
Some might say it's luck...

307
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:42,746
that I was never fortunate to have before.

308
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:47,285
Whatever it was, I thought it was the deal of a lifetime.

309
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:49,325
However...

310
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,226
The 10 years he gave me.

311
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:55,656
The 10 years I was given to enjoy my life...

312
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:58,496
flew by faster than I expected it to.

313
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:04,865
I must now hand over my soul as per the contract.

314
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:08,636
I don't intend to give it up so easily though.

315
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,246
Never.

316
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,416
(Yeonsil Industries)

317
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,246
It took me 3 years to figure out who you are...

318
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:19,015
and another 5 years to find a way to beat you.

319
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:22,315
I will never give in to your demands easily.

320
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:24,825
My talent is mine,

321
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,355
so is my wealth,

322
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:27,956
and so is my soul.

323
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:30,396
Chairman Song!

324
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,295
Hold on.

325
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:42,206
Remember me?

326
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:24,785
You came prepared.

327
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:28,585
This isn't a relic from the Crusades, is it?

328
00:24:28,615 --> 00:24:30,785
I spent my life savings to get a sword of Damascus...

329
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:32,226
made by the devil.

330
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:34,226
You'd better not do anything to me.

331
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:37,166
Only this sword can pierce the armor I'm wearing.

332
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,166
Do you think that makes sense?

333
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,795
I have to do something!

334
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:44,835
10 years. Time truly flies.

335
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:46,736
Do you have five days left now?

336
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:49,775
We're done talking. Everything's in here.

337
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:52,875
Every horrid, corrupt things you've done.

338
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:55,275
I see why you're called the devil.

339
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:02,055
Resistance.

340
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:04,186
It's only natural.

341
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:07,756
Humans find it very hard to give up.

342
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,265
But you gained what you wanted.

343
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:14,196
Not you must find something to give up.

344
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:17,006
No. I can't give up anything.

345
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,206
You give up.

346
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:21,636
This will end you.

347
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:24,775
You're insane.

348
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:27,146
I'm just like you.

349
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:29,886
I took out a contract.

350
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,886
My disappearing...

351
00:25:32,315 --> 00:25:35,656
won't get you what you want.

352
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,196
Where are you going?

353
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:47,365
One day, on a passing breeze,

354
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:49,265
when you're reminded of the past,

355
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:51,636
that will be when you feel the lowest.

356
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:55,335
Even though you gave up your soul, for some strange reason,

357
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:57,746
your memories come back to you.

358
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:01,416
It's dangerous. Come back here!

359
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:13,656
After today, once again,

360
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:16,226
I will commit the heinous crimes...

361
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:18,426
you have proof of in that suitcase.

362
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,365
Papers? Prosecutors?

363
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:24,706
You can't stop him with that.

364
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:28,275
Goodbye.

365
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:33,746
No.

366
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:38,686
Annul my contract first.

367
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:40,015
Remember this.

368
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:43,986
You must see the end for it to end.

369
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:50,025
No.

370
00:26:50,295 --> 00:26:52,466
No!

371
00:26:52,765 --> 00:26:54,765
Yeonsil Industries' Chairman Song...

372
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:57,765
jumped to his death from the roof of his company's building,

373
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,335
shocking the public.

374
00:26:59,436 --> 00:27:01,875
He'd been summoned by a prosecutor for 15 charges...

375
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:05,746
including inciting murder, bribery, and embezzlement.

376
00:27:05,746 --> 00:27:09,115
According to prosecutors, a will was found at his residence.

377
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:11,486
In it, he asked for forgiveness...

378
00:27:11,486 --> 00:27:13,256
for his foolish actions.

379
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:17,025
They will focus their investigations on suicide.

380
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:19,285
It's over.

381
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:22,496
He's dead and no one knows of this contract.

382
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:30,906
This nonsensical contract never existed from the start.

383
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:37,545
That fool killed himself...

384
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:39,676
because of his guilty conscience.

385
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:43,585
I have a clear conscience.

386
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:45,386
After all I did to get here.

387
00:27:46,386 --> 00:27:48,956
I worked so hard to get here!

388
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,426
I worked so hard.

389
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,565
It's over. It'd done.

390
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,006
It's over. It's over.

391
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:18,946
Yo, bro.

392
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:21,886
You've peaked here. Move to America.

393
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:23,355
Yes, let's do a world tour!

394
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:24,986
Let's rack up some air miles!

395
00:28:39,365 --> 00:28:40,506
Cheers.

396
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:48,246
Ha Rip!

397
00:28:48,545 --> 00:28:50,416
Are you out of your mind?

398
00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:55,855
You forgot the live broadcast? The exclusive interview?

399
00:28:55,956 --> 00:28:58,456
I had something on my mind.

400
00:28:58,456 --> 00:29:01,825
You had so much on your mind that you were in a club dancing?

401
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:03,595
You wait right here.

402
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,666
You have five days left. Five days.

403
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:12,136
What?

404
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:15,236
Enjoy it while you can.

405
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:25,615
After five days,

406
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:27,956
your life is mine.

407
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:31,186
Your blood, your flesh.

408
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:34,295
Even your soul.

409
00:29:34,496 --> 00:29:36,396
I'll take it all.

410
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:40,636
No.

411
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:43,166
It's wrong.

412
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,236
It's impossible.

413
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:49,275
Here, drink this.

414
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:52,545
Stop looking around and drink.

415
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:53,946
- Hey. - Five.

416
00:29:54,315 --> 00:29:56,815
4, 3,

417
00:29:56,815 --> 00:29:59,386
2, 1, cue.

418
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:02,115
We interview people live here...

419
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:03,486
on Issue and People.

420
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:05,855
Today we'll talk to Ha Rip,

421
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:09,525
composer and producer, the Midas of pop music.

422
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:11,295
For spreading Hallyu,

423
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:13,565
you received a presidential citation.

424
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,476
Hey.

425
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,146
Hey!

426
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:28,216
I'd love to know just how wide your world of music is.

427
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:30,716
However, there are those...

428
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:32,815
who have a different opinion about...

429
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,156
the K-pop scene you're at the center of.

430
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:36,956
- No. - Are you saying...

431
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:38,956
you can't agree with that?

432
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:40,095
What?

433
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:44,265
A music critic wrote a column...

434
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:45,996
for a music magazine.

435
00:30:45,996 --> 00:30:48,295
I'll read part of it for you.

436
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:52,006
"Ha Rip's music is like a layout of..."

437
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:55,436
"average Korean side dishes."

438
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,345
"He's not a specialist with a representative dish,"

439
00:30:59,845 --> 00:31:02,615
"and he doesn't have a muse."

440
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:06,815
I didn't say that, so don't glare at me.

441
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:08,716
Did you hear about this?

442
00:31:11,025 --> 00:31:12,726
Yes, of course I did.

443
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:15,996
They call me "master of a single dish".

444
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:19,835
It was put very bluntly,

445
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:23,006
- but there are many who agree. - What?

446
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:25,865
Don't composers all have...

447
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:27,875
what you call a signature?

448
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:31,275
A song that comes right to mind,

449
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:32,746
or a singer.

450
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:38,186
I'll say this here for the first time.

451
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,686
I've been working so hard that I think I need a turning point.

452
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:44,956
I'm preparing for a new experiment.

453
00:31:44,956 --> 00:31:46,325
What experiment is that?

454
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:48,595
- Like... - What?

455
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:51,595
Releasing a new song each month?

456
00:31:52,396 --> 00:31:54,236
Like Yoon Jong Shin?

457
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:59,506
Not like anyone else. Like Ha Rip.

458
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:02,506
I'm looking for a new singer.

459
00:32:03,345 --> 00:32:06,916
I'll show you a muse that will remind you of me.

460
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:09,815
Not like a layout of side dishes but a representative dish.

461
00:32:10,746 --> 00:32:12,946
- Do you like stewed pollack? - Yes.

462
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:14,815
I'll switch categories.

463
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:17,226
I still have a lot to show you.

464
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,486
Just a moment.

465
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:22,726
So, with your muse, a single singer,

466
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:25,396
you'll release a new song every month.

467
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:28,565
You just announced that on live television, right?

468
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:39,146
I guess so?

469
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,375
Ladies and gentlemen.

470
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:44,946
It looks like we unwittingly got an exclusive.

471
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:47,815
Once a month, with his muse,

472
00:32:48,256 --> 00:32:50,156
Ha Rip will release...

473
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:53,295
a new song. That's his announcement.

474
00:32:53,295 --> 00:32:54,896
- Hello? - You all...

475
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:56,696
- heard it here. - You saw the show.

476
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:58,896
I think it's good news for everyone.

477
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,136
I look forward to it too.

478
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:03,535
- It's Ha Rip. - Hey.

479
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:05,506
You made a sudden announcement.

480
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:08,006
- Any details? - How will you release the songs?

481
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:10,746
You made a disparaging comment on Yoon Jong Shin.

482
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:12,845
Would you like to explain that?

483
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:15,216
Excuse me. I'm coming through. Excuse me.

484
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:16,486
(Who is Ha Rip's muse?)

485
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:24,486
That hurt. Who was that?

486
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:27,855
(Si Ho's a side dish?)

487
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:28,926
(He got famous on his own?)

488
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:30,496
(He needs to crash and burn.)

489
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:33,865
(Are you the only composer? Make me your muse.)

490
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:43,506
First, let's find someone within the company.

491
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:44,605
To be your muse.

492
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:47,916
Yes. I'll quit making side dishes and develop something new.

493
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:49,146
Something new?

494
00:33:49,146 --> 00:33:51,285
Won't you consider thinking...

495
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:53,815
and planning for once in your life?

496
00:33:54,585 --> 00:33:57,386
The announcer asked leading questions.

497
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,025
Fine. I showed off a bit.

498
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:01,025
No.

499
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:03,365
That's what you really want.

500
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,795
For the past 10 years, you created music,

501
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,136
but I created Ha Rip.

502
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:10,605
Do you think I don't know you?

503
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:14,375
Whatever you're determined to do,

504
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:16,136
just don't do it.

505
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:19,306
I know you're going to help me achieve everything I plan to do.

506
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:21,915
You psycho.

507
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:24,716
Cut the nonsense and get lost.

508
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:27,886
Did you call for a chauffeur service?

509
00:34:27,886 --> 00:34:29,685
- Yes, over here. - Hello.

510
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:40,196
- Are you okay? - What a relief.

511
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:42,466
I didn't get a nosebleed.

512
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,266
I'm okay.

513
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:46,506
My arm's fine too.

514
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:48,506
- Is it this car? - Yes.

515
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:50,375
Hello.

516
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,446
The address is saved in the navigation. Please drive safely.

517
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:55,645
Okay.

518
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:57,685
- See you. - Bye.

519
00:35:05,926 --> 00:35:08,196
This is a University Music Festival Special.

520
00:35:08,326 --> 00:35:12,495
This song won the Bronze Award at the first University Music Festival.

521
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:14,065
It's a song by Liver and Gallbladder.

522
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:17,306
- "Without You". - The radio rarely plays this song.

523
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:18,705
I feel so happy.

524
00:35:22,406 --> 00:35:25,406
- I'm standing out in the street - I'm standing out in the street

525
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,745
- All by myself without you - All by myself without you

526
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:33,045
- I can no longer see - I can no longer see

527
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:35,156
- Your beautiful face - Your beautiful face

528
00:35:37,355 --> 00:35:40,395
- You were like an oasis - You were like an oasis

529
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:41,596
- In the desert - In the desert

530
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:48,536
Your small voice

531
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:50,806
I wonder if I'm the only one

532
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:53,605
Who hasn't changed

533
00:35:54,676 --> 00:35:56,906
The street lamp is the only thing

534
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:01,315
That shines on me

535
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:13,355
I'm standing out in the street

536
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:15,855
Where you're no longer here

537
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:20,696
The mountain birds

538
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:21,866
That sang all night

539
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:23,236
Are all flying away

540
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:51,995
- You were like an oasis - You were like an oasis

541
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:53,395
- In the desert - In the desert

542
00:36:54,565 --> 00:36:56,736
- Your small voice - Your small voice

543
00:36:56,806 --> 00:37:00,236
- That made me smile - That made me smile

544
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:02,806
- I wonder if I'm the only one - I wonder if I'm the only one

545
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:05,275
- Who hasn't changed - Who hasn't changed

546
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:10,545
Did I wake you up? I'm sorry.

547
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:11,645
I'll be quiet.

548
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:13,685
No, just leave it on.

549
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:15,616
Okay.

550
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:22,196
Sir, I'll be quiet.

551
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:23,256
You can go back to sleep.

552
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,926
That's it. Yes.

553
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:28,736
I've been living a really rough life.

554
00:37:28,736 --> 00:37:30,935
I recently got my act together and started driving again.

555
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:33,906
So please help me live a quiet life.

556
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,176
Take your hands off me.

557
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:39,576
I'm warning you.

558
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:40,975
Please stay still.

559
00:37:49,286 --> 00:37:52,355
People normally break a bone when they get beaten up by me.

560
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:54,455
- They break a bone? - What a relief.

561
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:55,826
A relief?

562
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:59,326
Hey, that's what I should be saying.

563
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:02,795
You should be apologizing for breaking my nose.

564
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:04,406
I'm sorry.

565
00:38:06,705 --> 00:38:09,375
- But it was just self-defense. - What?

566
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:11,975
You threatened me while I was driving.

567
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:15,346
And I'm a woman, and you kept touching me like this.

568
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:18,745
You could get punished for that.

569
00:38:18,745 --> 00:38:21,986
You deserve to be criticized for doing something so disgraceful.

570
00:38:21,986 --> 00:38:23,855
I didn't touch you! I was just...

571
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,196
I'm sorry. There must be a misunderstanding.

572
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:36,236
That wasn't what I was doing. I was just enjoying the music.

573
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:38,935
I'm not that kind of person.

574
00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:41,205
I'm really famous.

575
00:38:41,205 --> 00:38:43,236
Do you know "Soul River" and Brian Punky Doll?

576
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:44,475
"The End of Today" by Kim Ok Ja.

577
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:45,645
Don't you guys watch TV?

578
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:47,216
Search "Ha Rip" on the web.

579
00:38:47,216 --> 00:38:49,475
I know who you are.

580
00:38:49,716 --> 00:38:52,145
- You know me? - Yes, I do.

581
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:55,716
I know very well that you're very famous.

582
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:04,466
Is my nose is bleeding?

583
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,065
No.

584
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:22,616
Hey, how do you know that song from earlier?

585
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,346
You seem very young.

586
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:25,745
What song?

587
00:39:25,745 --> 00:39:26,915
The song that played earlier.

588
00:39:30,355 --> 00:39:32,225
"Without You" by Liver and Gallbladder?

589
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,096
- I like them. - What?

590
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,326
I like their songs.

591
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:39,926
Not a lot of people know them.

592
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:42,165
But the bonus track in their first album is amazing.

593
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:43,736
It's really incredible.

594
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:45,705
It's the first time someone's ever said that in 40 years.

595
00:39:46,335 --> 00:39:47,736
She just said exactly...

596
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:50,576
what I wanted to hear my entire life.

597
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:58,245
Why do you like Liver and Gallbladder?

598
00:39:58,245 --> 00:39:59,846
Do I really need a reason for liking them?

599
00:40:02,415 --> 00:40:05,085
That song is track number 11 from their bonus track.

600
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:07,696
It was very different from the songs that were popular back then.

601
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:10,596
It sounds like it's played with a minor key.

602
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:12,366
But it's very addictive.

603
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:14,065
Especially the guitar solo.

604
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:26,605
Yes, that's it.

605
00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:30,245
If I had met a fan like you earlier, I would never have sold my soul.

606
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:33,915
But I really don't get the title song in their first album.

607
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:38,056
They picked some odd and trendy song for their title song...

608
00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:40,556
and put the award winning song in their bonus track.

609
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:43,326
The CEO and Lee Chung Ryul kept being so stubborn about it.

610
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:44,426
And...

611
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:47,935
Lee Chung Ryul was the main vocalist and was more popular.

612
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:51,205
But I personally think the best part of their songs...

613
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:53,935
are the parts that Seo Dong Cheon composed and played.

614
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,466
Please come to me

615
00:41:18,596 --> 00:41:23,295
Before the season changes

616
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:25,906
- Lee Chung Ryul! - Lee Chung Ryul!

617
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:32,105
Who do you like better? Seo Dong Cheon or Lee Chung Ryul?

618
00:41:33,745 --> 00:41:36,516
I prefer Seo Dong Cheon.

619
00:41:40,085 --> 00:41:42,685
- Why? - I don't like handsome guys.

620
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:49,696
Are you okay?

621
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:52,096
I'm sorry. Something was in front of the car.

622
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:01,205
I already got paid.

623
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,036
I just want to thank you.

624
00:42:03,236 --> 00:42:06,605
It's okay. I might think you're doing this with an ulterior motive.

625
00:42:06,946 --> 00:42:08,045
Goodbye.

626
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:11,315
Okay, bye.

627
00:42:13,815 --> 00:42:14,915
Gosh, it's raining.

628
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:20,596
Why does it rain every time I walk?

629
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:23,355
There aren't even any bus here.

630
00:42:25,225 --> 00:42:27,036
Maybe I should've taken what he offered.

631
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:11,176
Sir, we have a situation!

632
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:18,585
Someone put up a notice a couple of days ago...

633
00:43:18,585 --> 00:43:20,185
asking people not to feed the stray cat...

634
00:43:20,756 --> 00:43:23,216
because it keeps dirtying the neighborhood and is loud.

635
00:43:24,426 --> 00:43:25,855
Why do they keep calling it a stray cat?

636
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:28,556
Are you crying?

637
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:32,766
Are you smiling? You just smiled, didn't you?

638
00:43:33,225 --> 00:43:34,596
- No. - Look at me.

639
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:35,866
Look at me!

640
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:38,236
It was you, wasn't it? You did this!

641
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:40,536
What's wrong with you? You're scaring me.

642
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:41,775
You evil jerk.

643
00:43:42,076 --> 00:43:44,176
I did knuckle it on its head once.

644
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:45,705
But I didn't do this.

645
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:50,946
Back then, I didn't know.

646
00:43:52,745 --> 00:43:56,085
So what happens if I sell my soul? Do I die?

647
00:43:56,085 --> 00:43:58,556
Humans wash away their sins...

648
00:43:59,025 --> 00:44:01,855
by shedding tears.

649
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:03,866
Dostoevsky.

650
00:44:04,295 --> 00:44:07,295
Selling your soul isn't a big deal.

651
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,196
You can't cry and that's about it.

652
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:12,966
- "You can't cry"? - That's right.

653
00:44:13,006 --> 00:44:16,406
Those who can't cry lose their emotions too.

654
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:18,105
Emotions?

655
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:20,815
As if I need any.

656
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:26,045
I didn't know back then...

657
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:29,656
that I still had many tears to shed...

658
00:44:32,926 --> 00:44:34,855
and that being able to cry...

659
00:44:37,295 --> 00:44:39,065
is what makes you human.

660
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:41,736
Kitty...

661
00:44:41,736 --> 00:44:47,105
(Kitty)

662
00:45:10,025 --> 00:45:11,766
(Soul Contract)

663
00:45:11,766 --> 00:45:15,136
This nonsensical contract never existed from the start.

664
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:16,536
It's not over.

665
00:45:16,536 --> 00:45:17,806
Remember this.

666
00:45:18,036 --> 00:45:20,975
You must see the end for it to end.

667
00:45:20,975 --> 00:45:23,176
No!

668
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:25,705
Him dying and disappearing didn't annul the contract.

669
00:45:29,745 --> 00:45:32,986
Not the end, you say? Well, I'll see to it that it ends.

670
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:44,065
What? How did this happen?

671
00:45:49,335 --> 00:45:50,335
What...

672
00:46:10,585 --> 00:46:13,286
Not the end, you say?

673
00:46:13,455 --> 00:46:15,355
Show yourself, you jerk!

674
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,795
Show yourself!

675
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:26,306
Hello. Please come in.

676
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,331
Please come in.

677
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,170
Who is it?

678
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:45,660
What?

679
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,530
And who may you be?

680
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,329
He was in "Hyena of the City".

681
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:53,740
It's actor Mo Tae Kang!

682
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:56,740
Do you know me?

683
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,269
You missed the film festival.

684
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,309
Your seat was next to mine,

685
00:47:00,439 --> 00:47:02,380
so I was able to enjoy the armrest all to myself.

686
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,450
I see. So what brings you to my house?

687
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,950
Move over.

688
00:47:08,249 --> 00:47:10,519
Mr. Mo, may I have your autograph?

689
00:47:14,419 --> 00:47:16,320
- How about something to drink? - Sure thing.

690
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,059
Move over.

691
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,439
(Seo Dong Cheon)

692
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:39,209
(Notice of Payment, You have 3 days left.)

693
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:44,289
How do you have this?

694
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,919
You desperately longed to meet me.

695
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,889
After hearing my voice,

696
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,430
you wished to see my face.

697
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,530
No, wait. You're not him.

698
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,800
- He was... - Oh, him.

699
00:47:58,499 --> 00:48:00,070
You know very well that Chairman Song is dead.

700
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,340
Yes, he is, which means that it's over...

701
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:10,039
Are you saying that he's not the devil?

702
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:13,410
So you didn't know. He was actually my stand-in.

703
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,419
I'm busier than most people think,

704
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:17,749
so I let volunteers fill in for me at times.

705
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,889
I apologize if it was misleading you.

706
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,189
Anyway, it's good to meet you, Mr. Seo.

707
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,229
Who on earth are you?

708
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,709
Please have a seat.

709
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:47,380
We'll be meeting in three days time,

710
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,119
but still you longed to meet me.

711
00:48:49,249 --> 00:48:51,749
- Likewise. - I asked who you are.

712
00:48:51,749 --> 00:48:54,619
I already told you. I'm your ultimate boss.

713
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,900
Hey.

714
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,300
- Kang Ha... - Just one.

715
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,900
Hey.

716
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,479
Mr. Mo, please cut out the theatrics.

717
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,050
How are you the devil, you jerk?

718
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,590
Jerk of a devil. I like it.

719
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,260
It has a sexy ring to it.

720
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:32,689
Then you're the one who killed him.

721
00:49:32,689 --> 00:49:33,800
No.

722
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:37,269
You're the one who intended to kill him.

723
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,229
You prepared for it for a long time.

724
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:42,070
That wasn't my intention.

725
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,439
- I only wanted to threaten... - I know.

726
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:46,869
He made the choice himself.

727
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,039
Humans are peculiar creatures.

728
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:52,280
After voluntarily doing all the nasty in the world,

729
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,579
he suddenly had a change of heart and took his own life.

730
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,820
You people are more brutal than we are.

731
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:04,959
Where is my spoon?

732
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,570
Are you really the devil then?

733
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,639
Hand it over.

734
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,180
The devil?

735
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:27,650
I asked you to sell your soul, so I get why...

736
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,519
humans would call me that.

737
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:32,650
However, as you can see, I'm the famous actor Mo Tae Kang.

738
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,260
Who are you really?

739
00:50:34,389 --> 00:50:37,019
My true identity? Long ago,

740
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:39,760
I was named "The 49th Ryu Who Danced 3 Days..."

741
00:50:39,889 --> 00:50:41,130
"After Its Birth from a 3,000-day Fire."

742
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,099
Since it's long, just call me Ryu.

743
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:44,970
I never asked you for your name!

744
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,539
Then what about this?

745
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:51,309
I am part of a force that creates good...

746
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:53,010
even when it wants evil.

747
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,479
For the past 10 years, I have been...

748
00:50:55,479 --> 00:50:58,079
in your service night and day.

749
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:59,780
Call me your loyal servant.

750
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:13,130
This is the sword of Damascus you forged!

751
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:27,010
Watch yourself.

752
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,499
Salt? I'm not some puny spirit.

753
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,700
Nor am I a vampire.

754
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,340
What's this?

755
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,479
I am not a frozen spirit either.

756
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:09,450
I got him.

757
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:18,990
Are there any more left?

758
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:23,800
They're all quite annoying, so let me have it all at once.

759
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,059
I fully understand what you mean,

760
00:52:55,499 --> 00:52:57,229
so cut it out.

761
00:52:57,329 --> 00:52:59,599
It's over, you devil.

762
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,209
- What's this? - Holy water.

763
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:10,809
For five years, pilgrims...

764
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:23,189
My gosh. Holy water?

765
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,130
Did you have to drench me?

766
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,340
It must've cost a lot to build that room.

767
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:36,539
Sorry for the intrusion.

768
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:40,110
I have a lot to say but I wish your soul the best of health.

769
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:42,479
See you in three days. Three days.

770
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:46,280
He got me all wet.

771
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,150
Was the water in the fridge? It was cold.

772
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:52,749
How interesting.

773
00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:54,919
He retaliates more than expected.

774
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:56,720
That makes it fun.

775
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:01,499
So, are we sure Chairman Song killed himself?

776
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:04,430
Yes, I am.

777
00:54:05,499 --> 00:54:07,740
I took his soul completely.

778
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,439
Why would a soul-less man do that?

779
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:14,240
A guilty conscience? Does that make sense?

780
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,809
Could it be a side effect?

781
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:18,849
A side effect?

782
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,519
You know, how even after a vasectomy,

783
00:54:26,749 --> 00:54:28,689
a couple gets pregnant.

784
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,389
Do you think that's an appropriate analogy?

785
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:34,300
I apologize.

786
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,700
These fools are so slow.

787
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,240
Will you go faster?

788
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,639
Darn these idiots.

789
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,340
Darn it.

790
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,039
Do you drive with your feet?

791
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,010
Do you know who I am?

792
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,180
Come here. Come here!

793
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,860
It happens.

794
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,130
Sometimes, people drive with their feet.

795
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:21,740
It happens.

796
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:24,139
Your life...

797
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,340
was full of burdens, human.

798
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,579
Go on your way.

799
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:01,010
He seemed very drunk. If you let him go...

800
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,979
It's a human matter.

801
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:05,910
An accident could cause innocent lives...

802
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,680
Do I need your permission to show some mercy?

803
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:15,119
- Mr. Kang. - Yes?

804
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,760
Why are you wearing sunglasses at night?

805
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,530
I forgot.

806
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,430
No wonder.

807
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,320
(Notice of Payment, Seo Dong Cheon)

808
00:57:45,749 --> 00:57:47,419
(The 10-year contract terminates in 2 days.)

809
00:57:47,419 --> 00:57:49,059
(Your soul will be taken in two days. From Ryu)

810
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,889
- What if... - What?

811
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:26,490
What if you had just two days left?

812
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,769
- What would you do? - Now are you feeling the pressure?

813
00:58:34,439 --> 00:58:38,110
I'd have a beer with a friend.

814
00:58:52,749 --> 00:58:55,820
You worked so hard that you're exhausted in body and soul.

815
00:58:56,889 --> 00:58:58,490
Listen to new things...

816
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:01,660
and get some air to relax your mind.

817
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,840
Shall we take a look?

818
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,249
The street lamp is the only thing

819
00:59:24,249 --> 00:59:27,450
That shines on me

820
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,760
- What's this? - Let's listen over a drink.

821
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,630
Her folk songs have a unique sound.

822
00:59:40,269 --> 00:59:43,240
Please come to me

823
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,709
Before the season changes

824
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,019
Thank you.

825
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,160
I've never sung in public before.

826
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:10,999
Could I sing one of my own compositions?

827
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:13,130
- Yes. - Yes. I'd like it.

828
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:14,499
Thank you.

829
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:19,610
It's called "Talking to Myself".

830
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:44,360
Like a habit, I say this to myself

831
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:50,999
It'll work out, it's okay

832
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:58,910
One day, I'll make you laugh

833
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:02,550
It's awkward, looking into a mirror

834
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:04,849
But I did it anyway

835
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:12,130
It will all come to pass

836
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,130
I counted to 10 to hold back

837
01:01:17,059 --> 01:01:19,769
The tears of my frail heart

838
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:22,369
- What's that? - It sounds familiar.

839
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,499
Totally.

840
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:26,769
It will all come to pass

841
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:30,479
I wanted to give up

842
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,309
I was broken-hearted

843
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:36,720
- She wrote that? - I was tired

844
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,090
It's Si Ho's song.

845
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:40,249
- It's Si Ho's song. - She wrote it?

846
01:01:40,249 --> 01:01:41,360
It was number one.

847
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,059
She's crazy.

848
01:01:44,389 --> 01:01:45,689
She's a fraud.

849
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:48,829
- She's a composer? - She's a copycat.

850
01:01:48,829 --> 01:01:49,900
She won't stop?

851
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,070
Beside my head

852
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:53,570
What is she doing?

853
01:01:58,269 --> 01:01:59,709
That's her song?

854
01:02:00,269 --> 01:02:01,680
She said it's her song.

855
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,139
It's Si Ho's song.

856
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,110
It's the same. Listen.

857
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,380
Listen to the words.

858
01:02:09,249 --> 01:02:10,349
It's not a joke.

859
01:02:10,979 --> 01:02:12,019
It's plagiarism.

860
01:02:12,889 --> 01:02:14,119
Can she be sued?

861
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,320
How dare she say she wrote it?

862
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:22,430
It will all come to pass

863
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,530
This long winding road

864
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,240
The unfamiliar tomorrow

865
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:33,340
It will all

866
01:02:44,019 --> 01:02:46,590
("Trap of Love", Si Ho)

867
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:52,530
You really didn't know?

868
01:02:55,959 --> 01:02:57,559
It was released a few days ago.

869
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,639
Yi Kyung.

870
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:11,380
Just forget about it. There are a lot of people like her.

871
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:15,550
Excuse me.

872
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:17,619
Excuse me.

873
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,189
Don't we need to talk?

874
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,189
Do you know each other?

875
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:28,925
Do you know each other?

876
01:03:34,905 --> 01:03:36,965
We were involved in an accident.

877
01:03:38,005 --> 01:03:39,774
What? What more do you need to say?

878
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,845
Why do people think my song is Si Ho's song?

879
01:03:41,845 --> 01:03:43,675
Because it is Si Ho's song.

880
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:45,144
And Si Ho's song is my song.

881
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:54,155
Are you trying to say I plagiarized your song?

882
01:03:54,615 --> 01:03:56,655
I never said that. But...

883
01:03:58,224 --> 01:03:59,325
it's mine.

884
01:04:01,695 --> 01:04:02,794
It's my song.

885
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:07,095
Okay, go ahead and keep it. I'll be on my way.

886
01:04:10,005 --> 01:04:13,135
Have you ever published that song?

887
01:04:13,274 --> 01:04:14,774
Seo Young.

888
01:04:15,274 --> 01:04:17,305
Did it ever get published online or offline?

889
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,115
Well, not exactly.

890
01:04:21,885 --> 01:04:24,715
Hey, let me tell you something before you start talking nonsense.

891
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:27,115
I never listen to anyone else's songs.

892
01:04:27,115 --> 01:04:29,385
I don't even listen to the songs I write.

893
01:04:29,524 --> 01:04:31,155
So it's impossible for me...

894
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:34,425
to have plagiarized your song. Do you understand?

895
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:36,664
That's enough.

896
01:04:36,724 --> 01:04:38,365
I guess there was a misunderstanding.

897
01:04:38,365 --> 01:04:40,235
We can talk more about it at my office.

898
01:04:41,035 --> 01:04:42,434
Call me whenever you feel like it.

899
01:04:44,765 --> 01:04:45,805
No.

900
01:04:47,905 --> 01:04:49,845
I want to hear it from him.

901
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:52,575
What more do you want from me? Let's go.

902
01:04:57,314 --> 01:04:58,954
Why is it you again?

903
01:05:03,224 --> 01:05:06,255
Why me? Why does this keep happening to me?

904
01:05:11,294 --> 01:05:13,365
I once thought of it as an honor.

905
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:16,405
I thought it just meant that I was as talented as a genius composer.

906
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:20,305
Once could be considered a coincidence,

907
01:05:20,305 --> 01:05:21,974
but I don't understand how it could happen again.

908
01:05:27,744 --> 01:05:29,914
Did you install a wiretap inside my head?

909
01:05:34,354 --> 01:05:35,524
Are you crazy?

910
01:05:37,084 --> 01:05:39,095
I'll call you next time. You can talk about it with me.

911
01:05:39,655 --> 01:05:41,965
Let's go. Come on.

912
01:05:43,294 --> 01:05:44,825
What a scary world.

913
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:58,144
If he didn't copy my work, are we just meant to be?

914
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,814
Is he like...

915
01:06:05,454 --> 01:06:06,555
my soulmate or something?

916
01:06:08,785 --> 01:06:12,325
She thinks I plagiarized her song? What a joke.

917
01:06:12,524 --> 01:06:14,524
I can't believe she'd even think that.

918
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:23,104
(Ha Rip plagiarism)

919
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,034
(Ha Rip plagiarism edits)

920
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:28,404
(Ha Rip is suspected to have committed plagiarism.)

921
01:06:28,505 --> 01:06:29,675
What the...

922
01:06:30,944 --> 01:06:33,345
(Plagiarism, Ha Rip)

923
01:06:37,815 --> 01:06:39,515
(Y Channel, Ha Rip)

924
01:06:41,385 --> 01:06:43,685
(Ha Rip plagiarism edits)

925
01:06:46,324 --> 01:06:51,095
(A lot of his songs are suspected to have been plagiarized.)

926
01:06:51,895 --> 01:06:53,694
Are they serious?

927
01:06:54,494 --> 01:06:56,164
They think I copied everything.

928
01:06:56,164 --> 01:06:58,265
Do they think I copied every single song I wrote?

929
01:06:59,005 --> 01:07:01,805
They'll soon start accusing kids for drawing musical notes.

930
01:07:03,105 --> 01:07:04,845
Why is it you again?

931
01:07:05,914 --> 01:07:08,944
Why me? Why does this keep happening to me?

932
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,154
Once could be considered a coincidence,

933
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:13,815
but I don't understand how it could happen again.

934
01:07:25,364 --> 01:07:26,765
Hey, Attorney Min. It's me, Ha Rip.

935
01:07:27,034 --> 01:07:29,734
I want you to do a background check on someone for me.

936
01:07:35,444 --> 01:07:36,544
Sir.

937
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:39,815
Musical inspiration...

938
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:43,114
is like a dewdrop that floats around in midair.

939
01:07:43,385 --> 01:07:47,284
He and I just happened to get inspired the same way.

940
01:07:48,084 --> 01:07:50,784
And the dewdrop that inspired me...

941
01:07:50,784 --> 01:07:52,654
happened to inspire him as well.

942
01:07:53,324 --> 01:07:55,065
That's how I decided to think of it.

943
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:01,734
What's the matter with you? You're starting to scare me.

944
01:08:01,765 --> 01:08:04,765
She's pessimistic one second and optimistic the other.

945
01:08:04,805 --> 01:08:06,275
She's always like that.

946
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:11,044
I'm going to quit music.

947
01:08:13,074 --> 01:08:15,185
It means I'm not unique.

948
01:08:22,824 --> 01:08:26,425
But then again, I'm not even good enough to do music.

949
01:08:27,494 --> 01:08:29,095
Right, sir?

950
01:08:30,725 --> 01:08:34,065
Is it because it's wet? There's so much smoke.

951
01:08:34,164 --> 01:08:37,105
The neighbors want you to stop burning trash in your yard...

952
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:38,404
because it smells.

953
01:08:38,404 --> 01:08:41,475
I'm not burning trash. I'm burning firewood.

954
01:08:41,574 --> 01:08:43,305
Plus, they're oak trees.

955
01:08:43,305 --> 01:08:44,775
It still emits smoke.

956
01:08:45,374 --> 01:08:46,645
My gosh.

957
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:05,834
(The tiny doll by my bedside)

958
01:09:08,534 --> 01:09:11,404
(I feel sorry for myself for always fighting for my dream)

959
01:09:13,605 --> 01:09:15,704
("Talking to Myself")

960
01:09:20,315 --> 01:09:22,584
What did I do wrong?

961
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:29,255
Why do you keep giving me these hardships?

962
01:09:31,225 --> 01:09:34,355
Hey, come down here. I won't hit you. Let's just talk.

963
01:09:41,294 --> 01:09:44,664
You're so mean.

964
01:09:47,605 --> 01:09:48,744
Yi Kyung.

965
01:09:49,744 --> 01:09:52,114
You just wait.

966
01:09:56,885 --> 01:10:00,315
A man in his 30s caused a car accident last night...

967
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:03,824
at around 10pm by driving in the wrong lane at Seocho interchange.

968
01:10:03,855 --> 01:10:05,895
Due to the accident, 1 person died, and 4 people got injured.

969
01:10:05,895 --> 01:10:07,654
The world is going crazy.

970
01:10:08,194 --> 01:10:09,895
There's no more humanity in this world.

971
01:10:11,765 --> 01:10:13,765
- The drunk... - People are...

972
01:10:13,895 --> 01:10:16,734
head over heels for him these days.

973
01:10:16,805 --> 01:10:19,834
Everyone's impressed by Mo Tae Kang's acting skills.

974
01:10:20,505 --> 01:10:22,175
He plays a villain,

975
01:10:22,175 --> 01:10:24,444
and he makes it seem so real. And some people...

976
01:10:24,444 --> 01:10:26,914
are even starting to get concerned for him.

977
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:30,845
"Hyena of the City" is popular...

978
01:10:30,845 --> 01:10:33,484
among both men and women due to his luring character.

979
01:10:33,815 --> 01:10:36,284
He does an incredible job of playing a double role.

980
01:10:36,284 --> 01:10:37,824
He really needs to live a better life.

981
01:10:37,925 --> 01:10:40,694
Tae Kang came over to his house which means they're best friends.

982
01:10:40,794 --> 01:10:42,095
He knows I'm a huge fan,

983
01:10:42,095 --> 01:10:43,664
but he didn't even give me a chance to take a photo with him.

984
01:10:43,664 --> 01:10:46,095
That's just bad. He'll end up in the fiery pit.

985
01:10:46,095 --> 01:10:47,095
Goodbye.

986
01:10:50,734 --> 01:10:52,605
- Does he look human to you? - No.

987
01:10:52,834 --> 01:10:54,175
He's not human.

988
01:10:54,305 --> 01:10:56,005
It's impossible for a human being to be such a good actor.

989
01:11:07,315 --> 01:11:10,385
Is that a daily drama or something? You watch the rerun every day.

990
01:11:10,624 --> 01:11:11,784
Turn it off. It's loud.

991
01:11:16,765 --> 01:11:18,065
What are you doing? See who's here.

992
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:22,734
Hey, what...

993
01:11:23,334 --> 01:11:24,565
You...

994
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:47,855
Why won't anyone answer?

995
01:11:49,265 --> 01:11:50,694
What's this?

996
01:13:49,484 --> 01:13:50,645
Help me.

997
01:13:58,555 --> 01:13:59,725
Help me.

998
01:14:01,294 --> 01:14:03,395
Sir, please hurry. His BP is dropping.

999
01:14:03,624 --> 01:14:04,794
What's the patient's name?

1000
01:14:04,794 --> 01:14:05,794
Do you know his blood type?

1001
01:14:05,794 --> 01:14:07,595
His name is Ha Rip, but I don't know his blood type.

1002
01:14:07,595 --> 01:14:08,965
- Here. - Charge the defibrillator.

1003
01:14:08,965 --> 01:14:10,065
Charged.

1004
01:14:13,475 --> 01:14:14,574
200 joules!

1005
01:14:15,005 --> 01:14:16,845
Clear. Shock!

1006
01:14:29,824 --> 01:14:33,855
July 24, 2019, 22:25pm.

1007
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:41,765
Time of death.

1008
01:15:06,895 --> 01:15:08,824
(When the Devil Calls Your Name)

1009
01:15:09,364 --> 01:15:10,895
- Sir? - Really?

1010
01:15:10,895 --> 01:15:13,834
- Lee Chung Ryul? - Haven't we met before?

1011
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:17,135
- I didn't steal your music. - I pitied your pathetic life,

1012
01:15:17,135 --> 01:15:18,904
so I gave you a few bars.

1013
01:15:18,904 --> 01:15:21,534
Don't consider it as talent. It's really too pathetic.

1014
01:15:21,534 --> 01:15:24,005
Provoke me once again and I'll reveal this to the world.

1015
01:15:24,005 --> 01:15:25,845
- This is blackmail. - I know.

1016
01:15:25,845 --> 01:15:28,574
You dated in secret for five years and parted ways last year.

1017
01:15:28,675 --> 01:15:30,444
Well, that'll keep me entertained.

1018
01:15:30,544 --> 01:15:32,255
How dare someone hurt my Kitty!

1019
01:15:32,255 --> 01:15:33,454
Do you wish for the same fate?

1020
01:15:33,454 --> 01:15:36,584
- Want some poison too? - Keep being careless like that...

1021
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:38,925
and you'll meet the fate of your predecessor.

1022
01:15:38,925 --> 01:15:41,025
You fraud of a devil!

1023
01:15:41,025 --> 01:15:42,565
Fail to fulfill your end and you will be back...

1024
01:15:42,565 --> 01:15:44,225
- as your old self. - What?

1025
01:15:44,225 --> 01:15:45,834
I can't give up my soul like this.

1026
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:48,234
- I'll make you a top singer. - You've got yourself a deal.

1027
01:15:48,234 --> 01:15:49,404
You want me to get you another soul?

1028
01:15:49,404 --> 01:15:52,135
I only need one desperate soul.

1029
01:15:52,135 --> 01:15:54,305
You psycho. How dare you trick me.

1030
01:15:54,305 --> 01:15:56,145
Have you ever wondered what happens to those...

1031
01:15:56,145 --> 01:15:57,975
who breaches their contract with the devil?

1032
01:15:58,074 --> 01:16:00,315
I may have a benevolent smile,

1033
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:01,744
but that doesn't mean I'm a pushover.
