00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:22,889
He even threatened the UDC.

3
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,530
Our center is under a lot
of pressure recently.

4
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,670
You're under pressure?

5
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:31,569
You didn't know?

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,540
Weren't you behind it?

7
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,479
I asked you if you weren't the one
behind all of this.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,820
I'm not. Are you satisfied?

9
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:48,019
What about Father?

10
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,189
Poisoning, blackmail,
contract killing.

11
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,389
Discuss the rest with Choi Min.

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,660
Instead of wasting time with me.

(Undiagnosed Disease Center)

14
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:25,919
It's been 60 years.

00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:29,429
No matter how much the government
and the world change,

16
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:31,059
this too shall pass by.

17
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
Why?

18
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,329
Because TL has no labor union.

19
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,869
No. TL is already rotting.

20
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,470
We need to change.

21
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,109
If TL collapses,

22
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,250
we'll be humiliated not only
domestically, but even abroad.

23
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,580
Do you know why TL became
number one?

24
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,190
You probably don't know
how this empire was built.

25
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,619
This business is all about
making money.

26
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,630
Why are you worried about
unnecessary people?

27
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:06,129
This is the limit to those
who can't become number one.

28
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,199
Mr. Choi. With all due respect,
TL is family.

29
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,439
A family must follow the orders of
the breadwinner, and...

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,380
the breadwinner must protect
his family.

31
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:21,709
TL boasts its high salaries
and welfare system.

32
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,979
Forming a labor union
between family members?

33
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,849
How pathetic would it be
if others find out about it?

34
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,690
Mr. Moh. Are you kidding me?

35
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,659
How dare you bring up
such vulgar logic?

36
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,999
You're the one who's ruining TL
with the chairman on your back!

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,500
Having no labor union...

38
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,700
is TL's old tradition
and our strength as well.

39
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:48,569
As of today, I don't have a son.

40
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,480
Don't think of doing anything...

41
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,109
and leave...

42
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,450
immediately without asking.

43
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,710
I can't stand the sight of you.

make an announcement soon.

46
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,090
- Then TL will...
- About that...

47
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,160
There's no need to worry.

48
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,429
I took care of
the labor union issue.

49
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:11,299
I believe...

50
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,529
things will be wrapped up by now.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Took care of? How?

a TL Labor Union!)

It's all over because of you!

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,770
No.

65
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,009
It's not. I...

66
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,180
The documents.
Where are the documents?

67
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,920
You really don't know?

68
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,690
They took everything.

69
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,089
Now, we don't have anything left.

70
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,459
No...

71
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,859
How could...

72
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,530
Tae Young.

73
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,440
Joong Eun. This is...

74
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,270
Was this the plan
from the beginning?

75
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,080
It's a misunderstanding.
I didn't know either.

76
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,150
You didn't know?

77
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,580
The only ones who know about
this place are you and me.

78
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,450
You decided today's meeting,
time, location, and members.

79
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,850
No. You just notified us
unilaterally.

80
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,559
Saying you had someone
you wanted to introduce.

81
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,060
But it just so happened that
you couldn't make it today,

82
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,600
and this place was attacked.

83
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:53,229
I can explain everything.

84
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:55,099
The documents you gave us.

85
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,300
The data on TL group's corruption.

86
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,370
Their crackdown on the labor union.

87
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,670
They already knew where
those documents were.

88
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,380
Will you still deny it?

89
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,649
Let's talk after you've calmed down.

90
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,480
You should go to the hospital first.

91
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,220
Why didn't you just kill everyone?

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,460
Why didn't you just do what
TL is so good at?

93
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,529
Yes, Seo Rin.

94
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,900
Me too.

95
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,040
I miss you so much too, Seo Rin.

96
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,270
- But...
- Seo Rin, who are you calling?

97
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,380
Hello? Seo Rin.

98
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,379
Mr. Ha!

99
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:55,419
Hey...

100
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,199
I hope Ms. Doh and Mr. Huh...

101
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,070
get close to each other again.

102
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:21,149
She wants to get closer to me?

103
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,619
She hopes to get closer to me?

104
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,060
Gosh, I'm so sweaty...

105
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,459

the air conditioner?

00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,039
Gosh...

110
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,010
Mr. Ko?

111
00:07:58,249 --> 00:07:59,619
Hello, ma'am.

112
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:01,349
You dropped your wallet, Mr. Ko.

113
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:03,149
Oh, thank you.

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,820
- I should be more careful.
- I didn't take any money.

115
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,130
Sure, ma'am.

116
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,320
Sit down.

117
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,540
Just tell me what you want, ma'am.

118
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,139
Fine, go ahead and be formal.

119
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,910
Because I won't, ever.

120
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,450
Stop it, already!

121
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,819
Do you think we have a chance
against Oshem?

122
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,790
Pick on someone your own size.

123
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,890
Aren't you ashamed, Moh Sung Kuk?

124
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,319
A statement...

125
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,790
will also be sent from the Economic
Association and Enterprise Alliance.

126
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:19,029
And we'll begin to put pressure
before the legislation is revised.

127
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,100
At this stage, it won't be difficult
to close down the UDC.

128
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,340
You jerk... What did you just say?

129
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,979
Hey, Moh Sung Kuk!

of Occupational Safety and Health!

131
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:34,809
That's enough.

132
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,979
The police, prosecution, court,
Industrial Complex,

133
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:41,019
and Ministry of Labor
will also be in on this.

134
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,650
So just pretend to give in
and follow suit.

135
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,689
Goodness... What are you saying?

136
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,560
Gosh, do you really think
I'd let that happen?

137
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,870
Think of it as a win-win situation.

138
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:58,399
Then I'll let you carry on with the
survey without investigative power.

139
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,570
So...

140
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,410
you want me to send
an official note...

141
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,210
and give you time to clear the site?

142
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,039
Just like it's usually done.

143
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,049
I dedicated...

144
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,949
20 years of my life for this,

145
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,050
and you want me to give it all up?

146
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,690
Just go with the flow
and don't stand out.

147
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,059
Everyone's struggling to save
the nation's economy.

148
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,260
Figure out a way to survive...

149
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,830
and find justice another time.

150
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:32,499
All right.

151
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,940
It's Bukang CNC.

152
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,840
Hye Mi's last workplace.
It's in Baekseok-dong.

153
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,580
CNC means they cut things.

154
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,310
What do they cut?

155
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,710
If it's that neighborhood, I'm sure
they deal with cellphone parts.

156
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,589
I think I know
what caused her to go blind.

(Undiagnosed Disease Center)

158
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,530
It's methanol.

159
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,189
The coolant that's used to reduce
the heat produced by CNC machines.

160
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,630
I'm sure they're using it
in place of alcohol.

161
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,630
It's much cheaper.

162
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,869
If only we knew sooner.

163
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,500
We would've been able to detoxicate
the methanol with alcohol.

164
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,069
The companies nearby could still be
using it. We need to investigate.

165
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,010
We can prevent any further problems.

166
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,279
Stop the chit chat and let's go.

167
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,109
Min Ki, we should at least
report it to Ms. Gong.

168
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,949
When will she get back?

169
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,959
Right. That was your pet theory.

170
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,730
The Fatalism of Industrial Health.

171
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,559
Minimal intervention, which doesn't
go against the mainstream...

172
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,300
is the principle and fate.

173
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
Give me a call
when you've thought about it.

174
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:37,429
We're always open-minded.

175
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,639
Sit down,
we haven't finished talking.

176
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:43,739
I know you're lying.

177
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,249
Is it because of Doh Joong Eun?

178
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,849
Are you afraid of her,
for some reason?

179
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:57,119
Has she gotten ahold of
your malpractice?

180
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,659
Am I right?

181
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,530
Is that why you're following us?

182
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,630
That's funny.

183
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,929
Go on and tell me.
I'll report it to the media.

184
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:09,129
Il Sun.

185
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,840
Don't get me wrong.

186
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,870
This wasn't up to me.

187
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,109
The top executive ordered this.

188
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,010
Chairman Choi Gon.

189
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,839
We've decided not
to investigate this case.

190
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,780
What? Are you serious?

191
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,649
What do you think you're doing?

192
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,219
The Center for Industrial Accident
Prevention will work on it instead.

193
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,820
Why are we leaving it to them
when we can take the case?

194
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,990
I don't understand.

195
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,889
They don't even have
search and seizure rights.

196
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,559
Why would we back off
all of a sudden?

197
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Why are you sparing yourself?

198
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,860
Hey,
are you not going to listen to me?

199
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,829
I won't. Let's vote.

200
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,700
Put your hands up!

201
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,900
Be quiet.
You'll obey my words and not vote.

202
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,739
You rude jerks...

203
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,039
Is she out of her mind?

204
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,950
Why is she being so bossy?

205
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,610
Stop it, already. Can't you tell?

206
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,419
The top executives
are pressuring her!

207
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,790
What does that have to do
with anything?

208
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,929
It's all my fault.

209
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,629
Go back inside.

210
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,369
I'll do whatever I can.

211
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,569
Stay out of this. Spare yourself.

212
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,950
I said, spare yourself.
Are you going to go against me?

213
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:08,349
Joong Eun.

214
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,800
What is it that
you want to say to me?

215
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,579
Is it because of
President Lim of Chemical?

216
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,310
Or is it because of my brother?

217
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:35,549
No.

218
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,219
I want to get to know you better.

219
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,719
You're too talented to be
wasting it on studies.

220
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,629
I'm not interested in business.

221
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,660
Director Moh,

222
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,200
don't you trust...

223
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
my brother and my husband?

224
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:01,709
TL needs someone like Chairman Choi.

225
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,180
You need to get prepared
for your father's sake.

226
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,480
This may be presumptuous of me,

227
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:11,179
but this isn't my personal judgment,
but Chairman Choi's...

228
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,890
Your father's wishes, as well.

229
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,100
We should meet up more often
and discuss things.

230
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,629
And catch up with each other, too.

231
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
But...

232
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,490
Look.

233
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,520
Let's say it's methanol.

234
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,689
It can't be the first time
they used it.

235
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,420
So why is it causing problems now?

236
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,130
It's this. SL5.

237
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:01,569
This was a huge hit.
I heard it's popular overseas, too.

238
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,130
You're right. If they want to
keep up with the orders,

239
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,869
they'll have to keep
all the factories in full operation.

240
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:09,069
And all the
subcontractor's factories, too.

241
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,509
Oh my gosh, it's methanol!

242
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,409
It surpassed the threshold!

243
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,080
Shouldn't we go inspect right away?

244
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,380
They would've gotten rid of it.
Plus, if we act too hastily,

245
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,219
things could get riskier for us.

246
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,490
Let's just make a move, then.

247
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:25,219
We'll ask the Ministry of Labor
to go on an inspection.

248
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,490
After the inspection,

249
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,659
they're going to relax
and bring out the methanol.

250
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,290
That's when we will come in.

251
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,900
It'll take time to write an official
note, so let's just call Ms. Gong.

252
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,969
No. Let's do this in secret.

253
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:37,599
That's the only way
we can get them for sure.

254
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,460
Gosh, what are you doing?
Quick! Hurry! Hurry up.

255
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,030
You guys, what are you doing?
Hurry up and move these!

256
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,300
You guys at the back too. Move it.

257
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,440
There's no time to slack off.
We need to move these quickly.

258
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,339
Yes, move them over there.

259
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,109
My goodness.

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,880
Gosh, it's so hot.

262
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,450
Let's get this done quickly.
Come on.

263
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,989
- You received the notice, right?
- Yes, of course.

264
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:34,159
We'll take a look around.

265
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,330
Yes, by all means.
These are CNC machines.

266

We take aluminum... We enter
the data into the computer first...

267
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,830
Yes, I know.

268
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,929
Not many things here
are done by humans.

269
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,100
- It's safe because we use alcohol.
- Yes, I said I know.

270
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,970
Why is it so hot in here?
And it's so noisy too.

271
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,210
- This isn't methanol.
- Really?

272
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,210
We're done here. Let's go.

273
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,920
Wait! Let us treat you to lunch.

274
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,290
Thanks, but maybe next time.
It's just too hot.

- Have a safe journey back, sir.
- All right, thank you.

Who was in charge of
the inspection of the CNC factory?

279
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,499
It was me. How can I help you?

280
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,629
We came in person
as it's an emergency situation.

281
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,100
Please share the results with us.

282
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:23,209
We obviously know how to handle
things. Why do you need to see it?

283
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,940
- Give them the report.
- Yes, sir.

Everyone at our center
went out today.

The 3 teams visited
12 sites in total.

287
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,860
We thoroughly inspected every site,

288
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,360
and the result is... It was alcohol.

289
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,060
Are you sure?

290
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,829
If you think it's necessary,

291
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,899
we can send the entire team
to 50 more sites all week...

292
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:54,709
No, we can inspect 100 more sites.

293
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,310
No, that's okay.
Thank you for your help.

Okay, got it.

between you and Mr. Huh?

without telling Ms. Gong?

Yes. All is good at the office.

She just fell asleep, so be quick.

312
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:18,479
And ask them to cooperate first
if it's possible.

- See you later.

where the victim seems to have been
exposed to an organic solvent here.

Article 43.2 of the Occupational
Health and Safety Act.

00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,719

- If not, you can be fined...
- Get out this instant!

332
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,169
This is against the law.
You should've sent a notice first!

333
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,410
How could you pull this
in the middle of the night?

334
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:52,909
Gosh, seriously.

335
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,609
You sure love paperwork.

00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,119
All right.

338
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,360
Show me the warrant.

Mister, we're not supposed
to show this to just about anyone.

340
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:15,199
This is considered trespassing
and obstruction of business.

341

We'll show you the warrant
after our inspection.

342
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,769
How many times
must I explain this to you?

343
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:22,469
- You folks are driving me bonkers.
- Just a moment, okay?

344
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,940
Oh, the police are here.

- Me. I did.
- What's going on?

348
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,919
They lied and acted like they were
from the prosecution. Arrest them.

00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,889
Hey. My gosh, Detective.

350
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,420
- The Human Rights Commission?
- You've been well, right?

351
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,060
- You remember them, right?
- Let me see the warrant.

352
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,100
What on earth are you doing?

353
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,060
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

354
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,269
Sir, this is just
a blank piece of paper.

355
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:53,269
See? What did I say?
I totally knew it.

356
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,570
Gosh, what were you thinking?

357
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:01,209
You over there, what are you doing?

358
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,810
I'm going home.

359
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,349
Our plan failed
because we didn't have dinner.

360
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:11,349
Had we eaten something
before we went,

361
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,120
we would've had enough energy
to get it done,

362
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:18,659
and we would've been able
to secure the evidence, methanol.

363
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,800
Right, Min Ki?

364
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,499
Mr. Ha, I heard you tried
to flee the scene all by yourself.

365
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,970
Well, that wasn't my intention.

366
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,070
Isn't it odd though?

367
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,380
Whenever people heard
that we're from the UDC,

368
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:36,749
they used to get intimidated
and be on their best behavior.

369
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:40,149
All right.
After we finish eating all this,

370
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,219
- we should go back there.
- No.

371
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,420
We shouldn't.

372
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,189
At the moment,
there is nothing we can do.

373
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,800
I don't appreciate
what you just said, Ms. Doh.

374
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,169
That's our reality.

375
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:08,109
No, look. I'll tell you what
the reality of our situation is.

376
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,579
At the hospital over there,

377
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:16,089
there's a girl
who's just over 20 years old.

378
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,519
She was hit by a car,
and she's very ill at the moment.

379
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,260
She's even lost her vision,

380
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,829
so she's stuck in her bed.

381
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:25,759
You see, that's...

382
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:29,769
That is the reality
of our situation.

383
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,570
Min Ki,
you didn't need to bring it up.

384
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,770
The accident
could've been prevented.

385
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,280
Had I arrived at the scene
even just a few minutes earlier,

386
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,180
I would've been able
to prevent the accident.

387
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,419
Enough! Beating yourself up
won't change anything.

388
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,520
But I couldn't prevent it,

389
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,800
so shouldn't we at least
punish those jerks?

390
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,830
I mean, wasn't the UDC founded
just to do that?

391
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:04,929
We can do it. Am I wrong?

392
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,670
Jin Hak, let's go.

393
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,569
Let's go back there
and grab those jerks like this.

394
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,879
Let's go, Jin Hak.

395
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,910
- Okay. Let's go, Min Ki.
- Let's go!

396
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,010
- Jerks!
- We're coming for you!

397
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,409
Enough, both of you!

398
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,150
Sit down.

399
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,620
This is why I told you
to ask for their cooperation first!

400
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:28,789
Let's just wrap up here.

401
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:30,559
I'm off.

402
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,400
Fine, leave!

403
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,280
I don't need any of you,
you cowards.

404
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,340
I will...

405
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,420
take care of it on my own.

406
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,849
Darn.

407
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,920
What?

408
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,989
If you just keep your mouths shut
like that,

409
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,860
I can't understand you!

410
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,060
Even you, Il Sun.

411
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,430
All you do is worry about
the higher-ups.

412
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,640
How can they just sit there
and just say no?

413
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,040
What can we possibly solve then?

414
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,869
You too, Ms. Byun.

415
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,109
Mr. Ha, you should be ashamed too!

416
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,310
Why?

417
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:23,779
Why? Why can't we do anything?

418
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,400
(Dr. Huh Min Ki. Thank you.)

419
00:28:58,509 --> 00:28:59,509
Hye Mi.

420
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:30,169
(Doctor Detective)

421
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,209
I'm so relieved.

422
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,540
I was worried you'd gone blind.

423
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,709
Happy birthday to you

424
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,050
I'm so happy, Ms. Doh.

425
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,020
The only way is to sneak inside.

426
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,849
We'll act as a married couple today.

427
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,790
Honey. Do you understand?

428
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:48,419
- Hey.
- Honey. Shut up and let's go.

429
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,830
This is insane.

430
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,499
It's like they were working
while inhaling toxic substances.

431
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,259
You should've taught him
he was in danger.

432
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,669
We won't be able to prevent
an industrial accident!

433
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,870
The government is allowing us
to screw our own laborers...

434
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,800
and even encouraging us
by providing legal grounds.

435
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,409
We should grasp that opportunity.
Let's become number one.
