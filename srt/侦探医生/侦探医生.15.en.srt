Hey!

(An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. You'll suffer the same!)

5
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:57,811
Mr. Huh, do you know where she worked?

6
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:58,912
No, I don't.

7
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:01,152
- Which hospital is she headed to? - TL Seoul Medical Center.

8
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,952
Ms. Doh, you're going to come, right?

9
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:07,722
This isn't just any car accident. I have a feeling.

10
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:15,031
Sir!

11
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:20,202
Sir!

(An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. You'll suffer the same!)

13
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:29,612
Sir... Sir!

14
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:30,612
Ms. Doh.

15
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:34,412
If something happens to him, TL won't let it slide.

16
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:38,022
Sir.

17
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:44,961
Move it, you jerks! Move!

18
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,991
Move it! Let go of me!

19
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:52,431
Move! Let go of me!

20
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:53,701
Let go!

(Emergency Medical Center)

22
00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:59,502
We've arrived at the hospital. Wake up, sir!

23
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:01,442
- Please say something. - Get him up.

24
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:04,511
Doh Joong Eun!

25
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:09,112
- Take him away. - Let go of me!

26
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:11,422
Let go of me!

27
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:14,091
Hye Mi!

28
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,621
Please let go of me, you jerks!

29
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,091
Hye Mi!

30
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,591
Let go of me!

31
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:25,301
Stay in here, you punk.

32
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:30,372
You worthless jerks. I'm going to kill all of you.

33
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:31,902
Grab him!

34
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:35,171
No. Let go!

35
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:38,212
We're taking away your phone.

36
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:40,351
No, where are you going?

37
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:41,851
Where are you going? Hey!

38
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:53,731
Why are you doing this?

39
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,002
Get in there, you punk.

41
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,752

00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:22,921
What do you think you're doing?

43
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:26,092
What are you doing? Let go.

44
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,731
Let go. Let go of me!

45
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,932
Let go of me!

46
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:34,632
What do you think you're doing?

47
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,771
Mr. Kwon!

48
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:44,242
- Here you go, sir. - Open this door! Open it!

49
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:45,611
Mr. Kwon!

50
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,752
Open this door!

51
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:49,581
Open it!

52
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:52,252
Open this door!

Dad.

59
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:24,051
Dad.

60
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:25,821
Are you okay?

61
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:29,592
His vitals are stable now.

62
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:41,401
It seems like TL's strategy of cutting their prices has succeeded.

63
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,172
Their most recent product, SL5,

64
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:45,242
has achieved record-breaking sales...

65
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,211
in the Indian and South-East Asia markets.

66
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:49,971
Also, yesterday, a Chinese conglomerate...

67
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:52,211
signed a supply contract with TL Display.

68
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,281
Welcome back, sir.

69
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:56,011
Well done, Mr. Choi.

70
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:58,021
Our products are being praised from all over the world.

71
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:01,391
From the mobile to display sector, there's nothing to stop us now.

72
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:02,422
Congratulations.

73
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,062
Thank you. I'll see you at the meeting.

74
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,362
Yes, Min. I just arrived.

75
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:14,271
How is Father?

76
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:18,502
Really? Okay, I'll go straight to the hospital.

77
00:05:18,502 --> 00:05:19,971
I'll be there soon.

78
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:24,112
How does it feel to be successful after screwing others?

79
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:25,781
Let go!

80
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,781
Our factory closed down because of you, you jerk!

81
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,252
I'll make you regret this.

82
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,321
Let go of me!

83
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,221
Hey! I'm talking to you!

84
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:37,391
Let go of me!

85
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:47,432
Are you okay?

86
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,932
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

87
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:52,401
I said let go of me!

88
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:57,411
- Let go! - Take them outside.

89
00:05:57,742 --> 00:05:59,612
- You punks. - Get them out of here!

90
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,211
- Let's go inside! - Are you all right?

91
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:08,091
I'm really sorry, sir.

92
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:11,961
I didn't know he'd come all the way here to protest.

93
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:15,761
You should've prevented something like this in advance.

94
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:19,161
I'm sorry, sir.

95
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,771
(VIP Ward)

96
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,612
What were you doing while he got into that state?

97
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:37,182
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:40,422
Tell me what's going on lately.

99
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:42,292
The VIP Ward trespassing incident...

100
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:45,891
and my father meeting Doh Joong Eun today.

101
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,331
They're connected, aren't they?

102
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:50,461
I'm afraid I can't tell you, ma'am.

103
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:53,502
Why not? Did the chairman order you not to?

104
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,002
He's the chairman of TL.

105
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:58,571
What if he passes away?

106
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:03,211
Tell me now.

107
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:10,721
(Choi Seo Rin)

108
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:13,482
It's the same handwriting...

109
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:15,292
as the threatening letter Chairman Choi received.

110
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:17,721
(Choi Seo Rin)

111
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:20,661
So?

112
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:24,161
As of now, I have no choice but to suspect Ms. Doh,

113
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:26,161
so she's in the warehouse...

114
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,632
Did you lock her in there?

115
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:31,201
Mr. Kwon, don't cross the line.

116
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:35,571
Ms. Doh is Seo Rin's mom.

117
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:38,841
That's true,

118
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:41,081
but the chairman might have...

119
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,352
met her out of suspicion too.

120
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,221
- Can you check over here? - Okay.

121
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:03,331
Hye Mi, are you okay? Hye Mi.

122
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,641
Grandpa, get me some water.

123
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,971
Doctor! Hye Mi is awake!

124
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:10,882
Hye Mi is awake.

125
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:22,151
Hye Mi is awake.

126
00:08:23,122 --> 00:08:24,221
She's experiencing delirium.

127
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:25,622
(A brain impairment that results in excessive behavior)

128
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:26,792
- Ma'am. - Ma'am.

129
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,391
You can't drink that.

130
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,802
- Get a sedative. - Water.

131
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,102
Water!

132
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:34,302
- Ma'am, calm down. - I'm thirsty!

133
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:36,432
- Hye Mi. - Wait.

134
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,242
- Please calm down. - Water.

135
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:41,011
- Grandpa! - Get the sedative!

136
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:42,771
Grandpa!

137
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:55,651
Doh Joong Eun.

138
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:00,632
- What's wrong with you? - Mr. Huh.

139
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:04,261
Why are you in here? What about Hye Mi?

140
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:07,832
Is that...

141
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:10,771
all you can say?

142
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:14,112
Because of that...

143
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:18,641
so-called important chairman that you brought,

144
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:21,911
they refused to treat her.

145
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:26,352
Even her heart rate was failing.

146
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:32,261
I didn't expect anything like this to happen either.

147
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,161
- I'm sorry. - No.

148
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:41,972
The chairman of TL.

149
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,602
What's going on?

150
00:09:47,242 --> 00:09:49,041
How do you know each other?

151
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:52,112
Mr. Huh.

152
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,551
It's not what you think.

153
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:00,082
Then tell me.

154
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,952
Tell me...

155
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:05,691
the truth.

156
00:10:24,742 --> 00:10:27,651
Mr. Huh? You may leave.

157
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:33,992
Ms. Choi.

158
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,462
I'm sorry about what happened. My father was in critical condition,

159
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,791
so our employees must have made a mistake.

160
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,301
So that's how you know him.

161
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:48,132
Amazing.

162
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:53,102
But you made a mistake.

163
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:55,242
I'm not letting this slide.

164
00:10:56,612 --> 00:11:00,141
Park Hye Mi is in our hospital.

165
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,452
We had her sent back...

166
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,281
as soon as my father got better.

167
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:08,752
Her ECG results look fine,

168
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,622
and her CT scan says she doesn't have any hemorrhage or fractures.

169
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:14,661
However, her ribs were a bit damaged due to the hit.

170
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:16,891
We will be taking legal liability...

171
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:18,801
for refusing the patient.

172
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:21,671
We'll take you to see the patient.

173
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,102
Please escort Mr. Huh.

174
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:28,911
Let's go, sir.

175
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:40,482
Joong Eun.

176
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:42,992
Let me apologize, first.

177
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:44,322
"Apologize"?

178
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:46,362
What apology?

179
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:50,061
- It's Hye Mi, not me, you should... - Joong Eun.

180
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:55,901
Why did you meet up...

181
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:58,972
with my father alone?

182
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:00,872
Min.

183
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,712
Are you really suspecting me?

184
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:13,421
So this is what Mr. Kwon meant when he said,

185
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,622
"TL won't let it slide."

186
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:19,761
Are you afraid I'd something to him?

187
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:22,431
I would like to think not,

188
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:24,661
but he was in perfect shape,

189
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,061
and he vomited blood and passed out all of a sudden.

190
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,102
- You would've thought the same... - No.

191
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:31,041
I would say, "Thank you."

192
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,301
That he made it thanks to you, and ask if you were shocked.

193
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:35,411
Then why would he meet a daughter-in-law...

194
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:37,541
he kicked out himself?

195
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:40,181
And why would that divorced woman who was kicked out...

196
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,181
go and meet him?

197
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:45,322
He threatened me. It's what your family does best.

198
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:46,752
Watch your tongue.

199
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:49,122
And you should watch who you suspect.

200
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:56,191
I have nothing left to say.

201
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,602
- Where do you think you're going? - Let go.

202
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:00,732
You're going to stay here until my father wakes up.

203
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:02,872
If you don't have anything to hide, that is.

204
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:06,171
Why? Are you afraid I might do something?

205
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:09,441
Min... I mean, Ms. Choi.

206
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:12,112
It has nothing to do with me,

207
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:14,082
whether your father dies or not.

208
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,212
I don't care.

209
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,021
Take that back.

210
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:36,702
Hye Mi.

211
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:39,872
Are you feeling better?

212
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,382
Who are you?

213
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:49,082
I'm Mr. Huh. Come on...

214
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,982
We met at UDC last time.

215
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:55,092
I don't know who you are,

216
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:58,161
but could you turn on the lights?

217
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:03,232
So you're really going to keep messing with me?

218
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:06,031
Fine. The lights are all on, though.

219
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:08,072
They're all on?

220
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:20,582
Hye Mi.

221
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:22,952
Do you see this finger?

222
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:24,582
Do you?

223
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,622
How many do you see?

224
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:30,151
I don't see it.

225
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,161
I don't see it.

226
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:38,102
I don't see it. Please turn on the lights.

227
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:41,072
Please turn on the lights.

228
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:42,832
I don't see it.

229
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:43,972
Hye Mi.

230
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:49,712
I don't see it. Please turn on the lights.

231
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:50,941
We will.

232
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:54,181
We'll turn them on. It's all right.

233
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:57,622
I was just joking.

234
00:14:57,822 --> 00:14:59,482
It's all right. I'm sorry.

235
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:03,521
We thought his bronchiectasis...

236
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,622
was the reason for the hemoptysis, but...

237
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,632
- "But"? - May I know...

238
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,362
what kind of situation he was in before he passed out?

239
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:13,862
What are you suspecting?

240
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,931
Well, we'll have to see,

241
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:20,102
but a patient who took pesticides, I mean,

242
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:23,372
inhaled toxic gases, showed very similar symptoms.

243
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:26,281
I was wondering if he was exposed to anything.

244
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,882
Did he go anywhere new...

245
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,252
or meet a stranger?

246
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:34,521
Doctor,

247
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:37,992
could you run a toxicity test in secret?

248
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,271
We're suspecting...

249
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:58,612
temporary loss of memory and traumatic optic neuropathy.

250
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:01,112
Her memory will return soon,

251
00:16:01,112 --> 00:16:03,752
but with her optic nerve, it was extended and reduced...

252
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:06,122
with the impact on the brain.

253
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:08,151
We're planning on using a high dose of steroids...

254
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,291
and monitor her condition.

255
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:14,492
Doctor, could we run an MRI scan?

256
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,661
I need to check something. Please do me a favor.

257
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:40,781
Wait.

258
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:44,322
Could you show us the optic nerve again?

259
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:50,232
There's a decrease in diameter on both sides.

260
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:52,502
If it's traumatic optic neuritis,

261
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,472
they should be swollen.

262
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:01,271
There's a high chance that this is poisoning.

263
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:04,041
That means it can't be turned back.

264
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,441
I think it could be an organic solvent.

265
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:11,781
You said that she lost her sense of direction, right?

266
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:14,852
Mr. Huh!

267
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:18,161
I'm asking, did she get into an accident because she couldn't see?

268
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:20,561
Yes.

269
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:26,102
Mr. Huh.

270
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,741
I met Chairman Choi for business reasons.

271
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:35,671
He started coughing up blood before I could get to the point.

272
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:37,441
It was an emergency.

273
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:38,882
How much?

274
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,582
More than 200 to 300cc.

275
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,681
He could have been in danger if it didn't stop.

276
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:44,522
So many people...

277
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,882
died bloody deaths because of him.

278
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:48,421
Why did you try to save him?

279
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:49,951
You should have left him to die.

280
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:52,322
Is that what you have to say as a doctor?

281
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:53,391
Why?

282
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,532
Is it different because he's your father-in-law?

283
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,602
What a good daughter-in-law.

284
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:10,072
He has nothing to do with me anymore.

285
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:12,382
He has nothing do with you,

286
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:15,181
but you'd ignore a more urgent patient?

287
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,451
I only did what I had to do, as a doctor.

288
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:22,391
And it will always be that way.

289
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:49,911
- Tae Young. - Hey.

290
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:51,451
How is he?

291
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,352
I think he's coming around.

292
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,191
That's a relief.

293
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:59,161
I need to talk to you.

294
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:00,721
Okay.

295
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,862
Mr. Kwon locked her up? Why?

296
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,372
He must have had his reasons.

297
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:11,572
"Reasons"?

298
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:14,401
Was she holding poison or something?

299
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:18,042
We had to consider all the possibilities.

300
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,112
Hey, Choi Min.

301
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:21,812
Don't hide anything from me.

302
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:25,221
I'm sure there was something wrong if you're suspecting her, too.

303
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,292
You can't be sure of it, but something did happen,

304
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:35,431
and you won't tell me?

305
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:38,602
I'll tell you when I can be sure.

306
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:42,671
All right.

307
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:48,042
Make sure no one finds out about Dad collapsing.

308
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:49,612

you like it mild, right?

You were at the VIP ward for quite a while last night.

00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:59,701
in the enforcement regulations,

334
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:01,911
and abusing the right to search and seizure...

335
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:04,512
in cases of industrial or occupational accidents...

336
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:06,181
should rightfully be condemned.

337
00:22:06,512 --> 00:22:08,981
You may conduct your epidemiological investigations.

338

00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:13,721
just because their investigation is obstructed...

340
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:15,921
is simply unprecedented.

In the past month or so.

348

I think that's why this happened to you.

350
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,151

Park Hye Mi. She's experiencing a sudden loss of vision...

00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:51,882
accompanied by amnesia.

356
00:23:52,052 --> 00:23:53,322
Because of the car accident?

357
00:23:53,322 --> 00:23:55,251
It may seem that way, but that's not the case.

358
00:23:55,822 --> 00:23:58,721
Even before the accident, there was something wrong with her eyes.

359
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:01,221
So the vision loss wasn't caused by the accident.

360
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:02,991
She got into the accident because of her eyes.

361
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:05,401
Okay. Is there evidence to prove that it's an occupational illness?

362
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,161
I took a look at the MRI scan.

363
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:09,802
It's optic neuritis caused by poisoning.

364
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:11,102
It is an occupational illness.

365
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:13,001
What happened? Did you hurt your hand?

00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,411
All right. We need to find out where else she has worked.

368
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:21,241
The poisoning is obviously not from the call center.

369
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,012
With youngsters like her, it's hard to track down their job history.

370
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:26,352
Most of which would have been temporary, and it's highly likely...

371
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:28,421
that most of her part-time jobs didn't offer any social insurance.

372
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:30,052
Ms. Byun, any updates?

373
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:31,891
Yes, I got her health insurance statements...

374
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:34,191
and checked the details regarding her national pension plan,

375
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:37,362
but these only give us information about the past year or so.

376
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:39,931
Anything from the NTS regarding her income?

377
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:42,272
It doesn't seem like she had any income...

378
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,931
for the past three months.

379
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:47,572
- What should we do, then? - Maybe she used apps.

380
00:24:49,512 --> 00:24:51,241
Right, Part-time Zone. The app, Part-time Zone.

381
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:54,211
She probably did. I've visited employment agencies,

382
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:58,782
but all the youngsters these days use mobile apps.

383
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:05,292
Hey, didn't you guys leave the hospital together?

384
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:06,461
Why come back separately?

385
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:08,661
Ms. Gong, here.

386
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:22,842
All right, let's try to dig deeper.

387
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:36,122
Ms. Gong.

388
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:39,122
She had over 20 jobs in the past year.

389
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:40,461
All short-term part-time jobs.

390
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:43,262
Hye Mi worked at the call center up until a year ago.

391
00:25:44,832 --> 00:25:47,102
Call each of them and look them up on the Internet.

392
00:25:47,102 --> 00:25:48,161
Got it.

393
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:55,141
Ms. Byun, did you find anything on social media?

394
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:56,842
Oh, that. Mr. Ha.

395
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:59,612
Yes, I'm scouring the social media platform now.

396
00:25:59,612 --> 00:26:01,112
I think she used a fake name though.

397
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:04,012
Let's each name a substance we're suspecting. Joong Eun.

398
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:05,421
If it's gas, I'd say carbon monoxide.

399
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:08,991
If it's an organic solvent, I'd say either methanol or ethylene glycol.

400
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:11,592
Ethylene glycol is a coolant used in automobiles.

401
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:13,762
Are you saying she worked at an automobile factory?

402
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:16,632
Even the chairman of the company can't give her that job.

403
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:19,401
Right. She worked short-term part-time jobs,

404
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:22,372
so it has to be something anyone can do with a few minutes of training.

405
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,802
Certainly not automobiles. Ruled out.

406
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:29,012
I got something. I think this girl used to work with Hye Mi.

407
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:31,171
- Message her before she logs out. - Okay, just a second.

408
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:32,282
(Kim So Yi)

409
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:33,941
- What's wrong? - Gosh, she logged out.

410
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,651
(Kim So Yi)

411
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:41,082
Isn't this Hye Mi? I think it's her.

412
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:43,552
Yes, it's her. July 23. What's that place?

413
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:45,661
It looks like Yonghyun Industrial Complex.

414
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,891
Yes, it is Yonghyun Industrial Complex.

415
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:49,731
Can anyone see this?

416
00:26:50,661 --> 00:26:53,931
Hye Mi applied for five jobs in the past month.

417
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:55,032
It's got to be one of them.

418
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:57,772
Let's take a guess. What is that? "G"?

419
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:01,372
- Geonhwa Staffing. - Geonhwa Staffing.

420
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:15,552
Hello.

421
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:22,362
- Chairman Choi is inside, right? - I'm sorry.

422
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:25,532
What brings you here? You didn't even call.

423
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:28,231
I have urgent updates for Chairman Choi.

424
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:29,701
I just need a minute.

425
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:34,102
Now is not a good time.

426
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:36,542
What do you mean?

427
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:42,782
Is he upset because of the recent incidents?

428
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:45,251
Then I'll come back another time.

429
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:46,921
No.

430
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:51,622
Dad said he doesn't want to meet anyone today.

431
00:27:54,461 --> 00:27:55,592
He said...

432
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:58,092
he doesn't want to meet with me?

433
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:01,431
That's correct, Mr. Moh.

434
00:28:02,602 --> 00:28:04,671
I think Dad is quite tired.

435
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:07,372
Really?

436
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:10,141
By the way, what brought you here?

437
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:14,782
I depend solely on Chairman Choi's opinion...

438
00:28:14,782 --> 00:28:16,981
with all important decisions made for TL.

439
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:22,792
How about you consult my brother, then?

440
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:26,191
You should take this...

441
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:30,032
as an opportunity to bond with the CEO of the company.

442
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:35,272
Will do.

443
00:28:55,322 --> 00:28:58,691
(Global Inspection Agency That Leads Innovation)

444
00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:24,951
Mr. Kwon took Seo Rin's letter.

445
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:27,681
Why? Why did he take it?

446
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:33,062
I'm here. I only need a minute, so come out.

447
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:54,911
I heard you met my father.

448
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:56,911
What happened between you two?

449
00:29:58,951 --> 00:30:00,052
Did he call for you first?

450
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:01,681
Then do you think I asked to meet him?

451
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:03,691
- Why did he ask to meet? - Ask him yourself.

452
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:05,822
No, I must hear it from you.
