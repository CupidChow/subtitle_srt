00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:09,249
Raise your glass

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,320
To celebrate today

3
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:17,319
And for a better tomorrow

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,390
Raise your glass

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,970
(Sujung Inn)

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,610
(I have no money nor pride)

7
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,979
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

8
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:08,609
(Doctor Detective)

9
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,610
(Episode 3)

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,850
(Choi Min)

11
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:21,249
Yes, Min.

12
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:24,859
Tomorrow?

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,930
About 90 percent of the members...

14
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:30,499
of Blood Cancer Task Force
have agreed to our compensation.

15
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,700
Our strategy to prioritize them...

16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
based on the financial situations
of each household was effective.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,400
And there's a man
named Kim Yong Deok,

18
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,900
who was the father of a researcher
of TL Chemical.

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,710
- He died recently.
- Who was it from TL Chemical?

20
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,010
Her name was Kim Hyang Hee
who committed suicide.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,740
But her father claimed...

22
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,009
that she died from overworking.

23
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,750
How did you find that out, Mr. Jung?

24
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,919
I'm trying my best
to always remember...

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,850
the families of the deceased
who caused trouble.

26
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,489
Good job. You don't have to
report to me every time now.

27
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,760
Yes, send me the death certificate
and evidence first.

28
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,129
I need to make sure
that it's Kim Yong Deok.

29
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,029
And leak some information
to the Labor Union.

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
By the way,

31
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,369
Isn't Ms. Doh Joong Eun
making any move?

32
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,469
Okay.

33
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,479
When do you think
we'll wrap things up?

34
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,310
Since we've taken care
of urgent matters,

35
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,920
we'll be able to focus...

36
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,279
on promoting the biotech complex
from now.

37
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:29,089
- There's no need to be anxious.
- No.

38
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,420
We should stay on alert.

39
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,060
If the land in Namil
is mentioned again,

40
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,590
tell the media that we'll use
another piece of land.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,300
So it doesn't affect
the biotech complex.

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,030
How are things on your side?

43
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,300
Well, I'm doing everything I can...

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,410
to stop articles or comments
from being published...

45
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,409
Yes, what?

46
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,939
What a surprise.
You answered on the first ring.

47
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:54,379
I'm in Samseong-dong
for a conference.

48
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,379
Hwan will be at English Camp
until today.

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,150
I was thinking
about picking up Seo Rin...

50
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,490
and playing with her.

51
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:02,719
- What about Mr. Kwon?
- I sent him home.

52
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,689
Why don't we let her get
some fresh air?

53
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,789
She always moves around
in a car wherever she goes.

54
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,359
It feels so suffocating
just thinking of her.

55
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,629
I want to let Seo Rin
have some fun today.

56
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,200
- Don't be late.
- Don't worry.

57
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,739
By the way, Tae Young.
Don't get angry at me later.

58
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,339
- For what?
- For letting her have fun.

59
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,170
Let her have all the fun
she wants. Bye.

60
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,310
Did you hear that?

61
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,279
Thank you, Min.

62
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:28,979
You can buy me coffee then.

63
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,920
Now let's go see your daughter.

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,750
And about Ms. Doh Joong Eun.

65
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,789
She's causing us
quite a bit of trouble.

66
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,060
My company should be prepared,

67
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,089
but you must be concerned
about her too.

68
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,000
No, it seems to me like
you're more concerned about her.

69
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,369
Just focus
on finishing this project first.

70
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,739
Don't waste your time
on something useless.

71
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,609
You can consider it finished,
I assure you.

72
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,910
Whether I consider
it's finished or not...

73
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,950
is up to me to decide.

74
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,779
Are you doing your job properly?

75
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,880
Director Park from Construction.

76
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,150
Did you find him?

77
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,020
I'm looking into it.

78
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,689
You're looking into it.

79
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,930
You should handle the issue
regarding the land in Namil.

80
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:21,729
If things go wrong,

81
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,270
you better be prepared
to step down.

82
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,269
You better put in more effort.

83
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,240
Next time,
you should tell me the results.

84
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,250
What are you...

85
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,020
so afraid of?

86
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:52,459
What nonsense are you spewing now?

87
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,130
Once Ms. Doh goes back to work,

88
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,240
she won't be as quiet
as she used to be.

89
00:04:57,869 --> 00:04:59,939
You'd better be on your toes, but...

90
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,970
Get me some water
and papers that need to be signed.

91
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
No, that's all right.

92
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:16,589
Mr. Moh.

93
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,660
Only do what you're paid to do.

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,160
Like her.

95
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:22,559
Thank you. You may leave.

96
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,800
Don't try to get involved
in anything else.

97
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Don't try to cross the line.

98
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:46,349
Let me cross the line one last time.

99
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,090
Did you check...

100
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,060
on Ms. Doh's
medical malpractice lawsuit?

101
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,100
Stop trying to hold her back
and just cut her off.

102
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:03,999
You'd better be on your toes.

103
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,719
Ta-da!

104
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,820
It's your favorite, a stuffed bunny!

105
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,319
How is it?

106
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,460
Do you like it?

107
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,330
Seo Rin.

108
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,100
Let's not tell Daddy
you met Mommy today.

109
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,480
- Pinky promise,
- Pinky promise,

110
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:48,549
- seal,
- seal,

111
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,849
- and copy.
- and copy.

112
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,020
And from now on,

113
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,720
Mommy's going to be a bit busy.

114
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,420
So,

115
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,929
if you attend kindergarten
really well...

116
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:05,199
Will I not see you again, Mommy?

117
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,860
No!

118
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,500
Mommy's going to see you every day!

119
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,870
In my heart.

120
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,240
So,

121
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:17,579
you have to have fun
with Daddy and Grandpa, okay?

122
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,110
No.

123
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,610
(Mr. Kwon)

124
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,009
(Mr. Choi is headed upstairs.)

125
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,650
Joong Eun, he's coming up.

126
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,490
Seo Rin,

127
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:32,459
I'll see you next month, okay?

128
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,990
We'll see each other soon.

129
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:36,289
I love you, Seo Rin.

130
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,730
Mommy loves you so much.

131
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,499
No, don't go Mommy.

132
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,039
Mommy has to go.

133
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,040
I'm sorry, Seo Rin.

134
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,809
I love you.

135
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,450
I love you, my baby.

136
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,920
Don't cry.

137
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,290
I'll see you soon, okay?

138
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,159
Don't forget. I love you.

139
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,330
Joong Eun. Hurry.

140
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,659
Okay.

141
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,770
Mommy...

142
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,780
Mommy...

143
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,350
It's all right.

144
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,559
Over here! You came so fast.
The traffic must be bad.

145
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,530
Gosh, Seo Rin.
Why are you crying?

146
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,100
What is it?
You can tell Grandpa.

147
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,369
I told you, no more cake.

148
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:53,069
- What?
- She had too much cake.

149
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:02,879
That coat...

150
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,820
looks familiar.

151
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,950
Sorry?

152
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,960
I don't know.
Someone must have left it.

153
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:26,769
Oh, Seo Rin. I'm sorry.

154
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:30,469
Gosh, Seo Rin...

155
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,710
You did so well.

156
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,250
I'm sorry. Look at me.

157
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,580
Thank you for not talking
about Mommy.

158
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,560
(UDC)

159
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,430
(Safety First)

160
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,600
Hello, everybody!

161
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,939
- What's going on?
- Be quiet.

162
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,339
Why are you here?
It's our day off today.

163
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,480
Come on.

164
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,179
Well,

165
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,710
the position makes the man.

166
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:12,819
Where's Il Sun?

167
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,959
And why are you working?

168
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm here because
of Ms. Doh's employment documents.

169
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,260
I have to work on them.

170
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,459
So, Ms. Doh
will join our team, right?

171
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,630
Yes!

172
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:28,029
I should go grab a drink now.

173
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,440
To celebrate that Ms. Doh
is now part of our team.

174
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,060
Hey! I got you.

175
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,100
Get in. I'll drop you off.

176
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,030
No, thanks.
The bus will be here soon.

177
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,869
Come on, get in.

178
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:08,409
I have something to say to you.

179
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,510
Get in.

180
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,439
Giving you a ride
was just an excuse.

181
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,080
Let's go grab a drink.

182
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,710
We'll be seeing each other
every day.

184
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,050

I like how honest you are.

185
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,559
Well, from now on,

186
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:27,219
you'll be working under me,
I want to say...

187
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,859
I'm working under you?

188
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:32,899
Well, that's how it has turned out.

189
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,900
I'm going to be the team leader,

190
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,429
and you'll be a team member.

191

about things like this.

196
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,849

for now, okay?

an opening officially.

aren't you?

199
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:58,019
- Just answer, okay?
- Yes.

200
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,719
I already told you last time,

201
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,260
but you're the team leader.

202
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:03,759
But he's totally mistaken.

203
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,059
Throw him some hints
that he's just a team member.

204
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,500

205
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,070
Ms. Gong! This is Team Leader Huh!

206
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,800
I can hear him. This is bad.

207
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,470
Are you sure you can tell him?

208
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,240
I think you'd better do it.

209
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,939
I won't be fine at all.

210
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,380
We're fine.

211
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:23,949
A team leader can have a drink
with his team member, right?

212
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,520
- Oh gosh.
- Don't you think so, Ms. Gong?

213
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,219
What's wrong with him?

214
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,350
What makes him think
he's the team leader?

215
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,789
Don't worry, ma'am.

216
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,960
I'll lead the way as a team leader
and just grab a drink.

217
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,730
I'm sure she won't get drunk
and cause a fuss.

218
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:39,659
Hey! Just take care of it.

219
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,569
Yes, ma'am.

220
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,640
Should I put on some music?

221
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
Ms. Doh.

222
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,599
Wait a minute.

223
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,680
Welcome to the team.

224
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,919
I won't be just bossing around
as a team leader.

225
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,660
We'll be splitting up
the work equally.

226
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,430
I'll take 4, you take 6.

227
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,560
Don't get me wrong.

228
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,399
A team leader has so much other work
to take care of.

229
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,469
Let's grab a drink sometime.

230
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,699
We can forget about our positions
and talk casually to each other.

232
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:58,009
Right?
The work is what's important, right?

233
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,239
Being a team leader
isn't what's important, right?

234
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,449
Why? Don't you like it?

235
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,750

or just Team Leader.

251
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,570

that he shouldn't quit.

completely out of my mind.

309
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,830
he never got to eat...

was work his butt off.

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,290
It might have been done
by Hanil SD alone,

317

318
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,230
that it was probably done
as per TL's order.

319
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,830

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,000
Jerk.

361
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,170
Come on.

362
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,710
Where's your sense
of public morality?

363
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:17,679
Gosh, that's hot!

364
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,120
That little...

365
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,619
I'll make you pay for this
no matter what.

366
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,430
He's here. Hurry!

367
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,410
- Attention. Good morning.
- Hello, sir.

368
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,069
- Why are you so slow?
- I'm sorry, sir.

369
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,809
- Is everything going well?
- Yes, sir.

370
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,950
Check that.

371
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,160
You must feel stuffy.

372
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,860
Unbutton that, okay?

373
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,529
- Make sure to wash.
- Baby sharks

374
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:10,299
Baby sharks and baby puppies

375
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,899
I told you not to let kids in
because they're too noisy.

376
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,500
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

377
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,569
Get rid of them.

378
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,080
- Baby sharks
- Baby sharks

379
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,249
- Baby puppies and foxes
- Baby puppies and foxes

380
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:32,489
- They were playing together
- They were playing together

381
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,729
- Baby sharks
- Baby sharks

382
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:37,789
- Swimming in the sea
- Swimming in the sea

383
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,999
- Do your work properly, okay?
- Yes, sir.

384
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,700
Get rid of them.

385
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,500
Yes, sir. I'll be more careful.
Have a good day, sir.

386
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Hello, sir.

387
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,410
Receive reservation requests
and double the price.

388
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,450
Yes.

389
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,120
They'll go crazy over our bread.
We're raking in money.

390
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:09,159
It's nothing.

391
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,400
Yes. I saw something interesting.

392
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,110
(Restricted Area, Personnel Only)

393
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,810
You can't go in there.

394
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:27,979
(Restricted Area, Personnel Only)

395
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,380
(CEO's Office)

396
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,620
Darn it. Are you kidding me?

397
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,089
Take this and get out!

398
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,889
Get out! Go make it again.

399
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,629
Hey! Take this with you!

400
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:44,659
Take this!

401
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Darn it.

402
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,110
Don't worry about next week's trial.

403
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,940
There's a similar precedent
for a medical malpractice lawsuit,

404
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,950
and I'm 99 percent sure we'll win.

405
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,820
Thank you. Keep up the good work.

406
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,819
Ms. Byun. Write down Huh Min Ki
for being tardy.

407
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:11,819
Okay.

408
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:14,819
(Asthma)

409
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:20,059
The case of this baker's asthma
isn't that simple.

410
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,300
He had asthma, but died suddenly
due to a seizure.

411
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:26,269
This case occurred a year ago,
so it's hard to find witnesses too.

412
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:30,539
(Victim Profile)

413
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,549
I read his journals
he wrote before his death.

414
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:40,049
He wrote that he experienced
a very humiliating incident.

415
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,389
Like Mr. Ha said, it seems like
the owner bullied him badly.

416
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:45,219
What is that?

417
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,859
If you're allergic to bullets,
you should leave the battlefield.

418
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,960
- Right?
- What? Give it back.

419
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,569
No... Wait, no!

420
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:58,769
Oh, boy.

421
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,670
- Please...
- What is this?

422
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,010
Please, sir...

423
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,939
You get the picture, right?

424
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,079
But we can't find out the cause
of death just by his bullying.

425
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,279
We need to focus on the substances.

426
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,179
The substances that caused
his death and his disease.

427
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,820
We need to find the connection
between those two.

428
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:15,219
This happened a year ago.

429
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,950
And two months ago,
another incident occurred.

430
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,020
It has a similar pattern.

431
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:20,459
We need to analyze
all the substances.

432
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,459
This won't be an easy case.

433
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,329
Ms. Doh.

434
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,600
- Yes?
- You take this.

435
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,230
But you need a partner.

436
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,039
Take Huh Min Ki as your assistant.

437
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,710
"Assistant"?

438
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,740
I wonder what an assistant is.

439
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:45,079
I have no clue what
the definition of an assistant is.

440
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,779
Hey, Huh Min Ki!

441
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,520
What is wrong with your clothes?

442
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,949
My goodness.

443
00:30:50,989 --> 00:30:52,359
- Il Sun.
- Let's talk, Ms. Doh.

444
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,560
Come here. I have something
to say to you. Come here!

445
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,589
Min Ki.

446
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:57,659
They need to have a talk right now.

447
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,000
Listen.

448
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,600
Let's say we're members
of a startup company.

449
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,600
You're Team Leader Ha.

450
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,840
Jin Yi, you're Team Leader Suk.

451
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,009
Ms. Byun, you're a chief.

452
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,209
I am...

453
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,280
(Huh Min Ki)

454
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,779
I'm just...

455
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:17,049
"Huh Min Ki"!

456
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:20,649
Can't you see
something is wrong here?

457
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,890
Your medical license
will be valid again soon, right?

458
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,020
Yes, next month.

459
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,989
About the medical
malpractice lawsuit...

460
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,230
Has it been all settled?

461
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:33,999
Yes.

462
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:36,629
Why are you asking suddenly?

463
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:38,169
Darn it.

464
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,970
I requested to open up
an official position for you,

465
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,270
but I got rejected.

466
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:43,909
This place seems independent...

467
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,840
but we're still part
of a public institution.

468
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,409
We also receive funding
from the government.

469
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,880
It will be taken care of.
I'm 99 percent certain.

470
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,120
It should be 100 percent.

471
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,950
Why are they blaming you
for a disease from somewhere else?

472
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,790
It's not even
worth a lawsuit actually.

473
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,690
- Take care of it.
- Okay.
