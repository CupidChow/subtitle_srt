belongs to me.

00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:27,818
I decide whether you live

00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:31,353
or whether you die.

8

Where on earth can His Highness be…

12
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:48,187
You go check Juhamnu Pavilion and you go check Gyeongindang Pavilion.

13
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:50,153
Yes, Sir.

14
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:03,596
The doctor visits the King far too often…

15
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,435
Is there anything besides the medicine for a stomachache?

16
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:14,322
We are looking for ginseng and high-quality Poria mushrooms.

17
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:16,165
Poria mushrooms...

18
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:19,346
Still, could he really…

20

Anyhow, I'd better head back.

00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,083
Sir Preceptor.

22
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:56,732
The person who just left was that His Majesty's royal doctor?

23
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:59,746
Yes, that's right.

24
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:03,595
It would have made a fuss if he had been seen by others.

25
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:07,161
Thank goodness it is you, Sir.

26
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:18,973
What is this?

27
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:26,178
The Crown Prince ordered that the doctor should not be approached.

28
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:29,158
His orders cannot be ignored.

29
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:31,114
Please remember that.

30
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:39,288

00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,980
Sir Preceptor!

33
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,255
So let's wait and see…

34
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:50,011
whether His HIghness forgives me…

35
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:52,941
or not…

36
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,553
- I will do the rest.
- Then I will be back.

37
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:11,992

Where is Young Hee?

40
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:37,504
She went to the sewing room for an errand.

41
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,211
So I'll have to go alone…

42
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:44,044
If it's okay, I'll come with you.

43
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,870
I don't want to trouble you.

44
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,347
It'll be too difficult to go alone.

45
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,532
My lady, shall I just deliver it myself?

46
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:16,548
No… I have to personally

47
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:19,256
give it to His Highness the Crown Prince.

48
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:22,951
It is difficult for anyone other than his quarter maids to see him.

I wonder… what are you trying to deliver?

54

What is this all about?

59
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:53,085
I said the doctor was not to be approached.

60
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:56,894
Then I should be punished for disregarding your orders.

61

However, please listen to what the doctor has to say.

So it is truly the late Yeongbin's book after all.

So the business with the doctor… Did nothing come of it?

Being forgiven so easily… Is that strange to you?

167
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,692
that handmaid, Sung Deok Im, was dragged off to the Queen's palace?

168
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,982
She's being interrogated by the Queen.

169
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:25,505
- Interrogated?
- Maiden Sung?

170
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:27,195
Yes, Sir.

171
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:34,955
So you are saying everything you told me is the truth.

172
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:37,305
I swear to you, Your Highness.

173
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:39,410
Do you have any proof or someone

174
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,450
to corroborate it?

175
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,854
Do you?

176
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,542
I do not, Your Highness.

177
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,230
Your Highness,

178
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,240
the Crown Prince requests an audience.

179
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:56,317
What shall I say?

180
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,093
Send him in.

181
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:25,251
Your Highness.

182
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:28,197
Were you so worried that I would hurt a member of your staff

183
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,830
that you ran all the way here?

184
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,058
That is impossible.

185
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:33,760
I was simply sorry

186
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,050
that one of my maids had worried you.

187
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,074
Do you know what she's done?

188
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,709
I heard she had one of late Lady Yeongbin's things.

189
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:51,985
She tells me that it was His Majesty who gave it to her.

190
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,740
She says she met him

191
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,410
when she was an apprentice maid.

192
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:03,513
What shall we do?

193
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:06,640
Is it appropriate

194
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,890
to trust her tale

195
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,097
without any evidence?

196
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:16,434
His Majesty cared so much for the late Lady Yeongbin…

197
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:19,050
Would he really

198
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,167
have given her possession away to a mere apprentice maid?

199
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:26,337
It's…

200
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,634
difficult to believe.

201
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:36,780
Even your master cannot believe it.

202
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,711
As there are no witnesses nor evidence,

203
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:42,422
it's a very tricky situation.

204
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:49,924
The exalted King of this land

205
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,860
gave the late Lady Yeongbin's property to me long ago

206
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,359
when I was an apprentice maid.

207
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,620
Even to my ears, it sounds ridiculous,

208
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,367
so I understand why my master would not believe it.

209
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,264
But I proclaim it the truth a hundred times over.

210
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:09,418
I did not steal the late Lady Yeongbin's book.

211
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:11,280
I earned the book

212
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,290
so that book is mine.

213
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,800
I beg you pardon, but

214
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,530
it is inappropriate to say that there is no witness.

215
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,222
As it was His Majesty who gave me the book,

216
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,522
he is the only witness I can call.

217
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,658
I beg you, Your Highness.

218
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,380
Please…

219
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,087
please do not fault me for what I have not done, Your Highness.

220
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,257
We do not dare to ask His Majesty,

221
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:41,387
the supreme king, to offer himself as a witness for a mere maid, but...

222
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:45,086
You are a maid of the Crown Prince's Palace.

223
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:49,293
If your master begs me, then...

224
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:56,680
Your Highness, if His Majesty

225
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,421
cannot recall old memories,

226
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:01,621
what happens then?

227
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:03,070
According to the law,

228
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,398
those who steal royal possessions

229
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:06,897
are sentenced to death.

230
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,470
Then...

231
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,720
I beg you...

232
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:15,980
as Maiden Sung has contributed a lot as a maid of my court,

233
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:19,500
please treat her leniently,

234
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,313
and simply exile her from the palace.

235
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:29,041
Do you mean it?

236
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,990
How could we possibly

237
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,250
bring such lowly business to the King?

238
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,540
As it stands,

239
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,170
it's difficult to prove

240
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,560
that she stole it,

241
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,224
so executing her is too much.

242
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:46,250
Exile

243
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,480
will be sufficient.

244
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:55,080
It would be best to simply

245
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:57,577
resolve this quickly.

246
00:24:01,492 --> 00:24:03,504
Will you accept this punishment?

247
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,096
Your Highness,

248
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,480
you are the mother

249
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,380
of everyone in this land Joseon.

250
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,460
Therefore,

251
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,292
as a child would beg for her mother's mercy,

252
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:17,903
please...

253
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,640
Please allow me an audience with His Majesty,

254
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,600
so I may ask one question.

255
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:28,284
I did not steal it.

256
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:31,284
If I am exiled for a crime I did not commit,

257
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:34,795
there will be no greater shame for me as a palace maid.

258
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:37,962
Please…

259
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:41,650
give me one chance, Your Highness.

260
00:24:55,998 --> 00:24:58,665
The Crown Prince is your master.

261
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:02,358
The Crown Prince won't give you a chance to prove you innocent.

262
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:04,808
If I should give you a chance...

263
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,510
that wouldn't be a bad idea.

264
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:20,049
So bitter.

265
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:30,815
I don't remember that,

266
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:33,448
so all of you go now.

267
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:38,943
Your Majesty, her life depends on your answer.

268
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:41,311
Please, try once more to remember.

269
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:45,995
How can you ask me to remember something from so long ago?

270
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:56,950
I may very well have given the book.

271
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,970
That would have been

272
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,030
a very special day for a little child.

273
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,440
But for me,

274
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,090
it would have been nothing at all.

275
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:11,685
How do I remember something so unmemorable?

276
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:15,685
It's not like you,

277
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:17,640
asking something

278
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,860
so trivial of me.

279
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:24,175
Long ago,

280
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:28,430
this maid transcribed a book and gave it to you, Your Majesty.

281
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:33,070
I remember how happy you were that day…

282
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,224
and so I hoped to give her a chance.

283
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,540
Did that maid

284
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,960
give me a book?

285
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:46,290
What book?

286
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,992
A book, you say?

287
00:26:52,992 --> 00:26:56,426
What sort of book?

288
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:58,120
Oh, my head,

289
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,190
I have a headache.

290
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,190
Well, come on now.

291
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,560
Punish her

292
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,840
as the law requires.

293
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,521
As it seems you don't want to sentence her to death,

294
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:14,927
I'll choose her punishment.

295
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:16,880
That maid

296
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,690
will have her heels cut

297
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,149
and be exiled from the palace.

298
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:27,558
Now, all of you go.

299
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:35,112
Please wait a moment, Your Majesty.

300
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:42,096
If we maim her and send her away from the palace,

301
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,923
she's no better than dead, Your Majesty.

302
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:47,580
Therefore, someone's fate

303
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,400
is dependent on you.

304
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,430
Your Majesty, you have always

305
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,530
given me lessons.

306
00:27:56,532 --> 00:27:58,240
"As the King of Joseon,"

307
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,173
"you hold in your hands the absolute power over life and death."

308
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:04,682
"As your subjects were bestowed by heaven,"

309
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,312
"if we do not treat each life as uniquely valuable,"

310
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:11,830
"we are not qualified"

311
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,480
"to lead them."

312
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:19,115
I humbly request

313
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,090
that you allow

314
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,110
your subject

315
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:26,822
a bit more of your time, Your Majesty.

316
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:39,615
If I cannot protect my heaven-sent subject

317
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:44,442
just because I cannot recall the incident,

318
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:49,962
I'm unfit to lead the country, eh?

319
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,613
Come here.

320
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:04,150
Tell me what happened.

321
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,870
Very thoroughly.

322
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,620
Who knows?

323
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,680
I might be able to remember.

324
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:14,247
Do you suppose

325
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:15,830
you can

326
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,100
summon my forgotten memories?

327
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:37,370
First, please accept

328
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,820
my apology, Your Majesty.

329
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:42,941
Apology?

330
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:46,685
It will certainly be a painful memory.

331
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:50,112
So I ask forgiveness now

332
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:52,578
before I remind you of that, Your Majesty.

333
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:55,596
All right.

334
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,938
May we light the incense?

335
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:13,960
It was when Lady Yeongbin

336
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,300
passed away in the year of the monkey.

337
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,061
When I was a little apprentice maid,

338
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:20,500
the Head Court Lady ordered me

339
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,460
to go pay final respects to the lady Yeongbin.

340
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:25,890
In the gardens,

341
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,220
there was a line of lanterns.

342
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,944
I followed those lanterns

343
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:35,776
until I found Lady Yeongbin's funeral chamber.

344
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:50,340
If you follow the lights,

345
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,112
you can go to Lady Yeongbin.

346
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:58,740
Inside the hall

347
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,610
on that dark night,

348
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,208
yellow candles danced and flickered.

349
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,550
The room was full of incense.

350
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:11,617
Outside the hall, the air was exceedingly hot and humid,

351
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:14,971
but inside it was eerily cold.

352
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:19,168
The icy chamber where the lady lay

353
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,591
seemed to surround her in a protective embrace.

354
00:31:24,411 --> 00:31:26,230
It was there

355
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,500
I saw Your Majesty.

356
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:31,050
Your Majesty saw me there

357
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,250
and said these words.

358
00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:39,378
You look like Princess Hwa Pyeong when she was little.

359
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:42,970
Your Majesty then honored me

360
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,870
by telling me of Lady Yeongbin.

361
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,830
She used to be beautiful

362
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,300
in her younger days.

363
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,896
She was a court lady, like you.

364
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:59,156
The ends of her sleeves were very red

365
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,922
Every time I saw them,

366
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,514
my heart ached so much.

367
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:08,137
"Even ice"

368
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:09,693
"can't be colder than my heart."

369
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:12,793
Even ice

370
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:16,220
can't be colder than my heart.

371
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,965
I have really lost her.

372
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:24,370
Now…

373
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:28,489
she won't ever come back.

374
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:32,330
The image of Your Majesty crying as you uttered those words

375
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,930
is still fresh in my mind.

376
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:39,442
Afterward…

377
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:42,799
Your Majesty bestowed upon me a book of Lady Yeongbin's.

378
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,990
Here, take it.

379
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,550
It's a book
[Yeo Beom: Book on Female Norms]

380
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,810
Lady Yeongbin wrote herself.

381
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,909
You unbelievable rascal!

382
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:11,687
To save your life

383
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:14,921
you got me crying, didn't you?

384
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:17,410
I apologize, Your Majesty.

385
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:24,034
Do you perhaps remember that day, Your Majesty?

386
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,897
I don't!

387
00:33:28,247 --> 00:33:30,633
You will be maimed and sent away!

388
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,794
Do you know…

389
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,390
why I gave you

390
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,060
Lady Yeongbin's book?

391
00:33:50,805 --> 00:33:52,883
Do you not remember?

392
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:55,873
I do not, Your Majesty.

393
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,426
You said…

394
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:04,205
you wanted to become a maid with great handwriting.

395
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:08,453
That's why I gave it to you.

396
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,332
Lady Yeongbin had beautiful penmanship.

397
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:19,936
Still…

398
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:23,851
it was good giving it to you.

399
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,936
Sung Deok Im.

400
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:34,000
You…

401
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,460
have excellent handwriting.

402
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:43,260
You favor me, Your Majesty.

403
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,825
You have great handwriting.

404
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:21,280
The life of a palace maid

405
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,560
isn't easy.

406
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,980
It's not easy

407
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,300
to be a prince, either.

408
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:36,383
Take it.

409
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:40,554
It's yours.

410
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,470
[Yeo Beom: Book on Female Norms]

411
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,780
The night you went to Lady Yeongbin's funeral chamber...

412
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,588
you… weren't alone, were you?

413
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,109
Is it true?

414
00:35:58,109 --> 00:35:59,852
How does Your Highness know—

415
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:01,962
Is it true?

416
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:03,597
Yes.

417
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,523
Prince.

418
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,969
Your Highness.

419
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:28,565
You've had a rough day.

420
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:31,226
Go back to the prince's palace.

421
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:33,975
Yes, Your Highness.

422
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,784
Are you still looking at that?

423
00:37:07,784 --> 00:37:10,217
It's so pretty!

424
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:14,130
Please tell the maiden how thankful I am.

425
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,591
Is it that great?

426
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:18,513
Yes, it is.

427
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:25,400
It's not special.

428
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,920
It's really nothing.

429
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,209
It's what was left behind

430
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:33,056
after making the royal clothes.

431
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,991
The lowly palace maids might be satisfied with that kind of thing,

432
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:38,967
but you can't do the same.

433
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:49,730
Brother, why do you look at the sky like that?

434
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:52,370
Because I wonder…

435
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,670
when this tiresome night will end.

436
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:58,461
In your brother's heart…

437
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,722
there is a sun that is as bright as fire.

438
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:05,277
I wish that the sun would rise from the east,

439
00:38:05,277 --> 00:38:09,144
with all my heart, you know.

440
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:11,844
Only then will…

441
00:38:11,844 --> 00:38:14,669
the people of the world know my name.

442
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:19,201
Your dreams will come true, Brother.

443
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:24,148
I believe in you.

444
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:35,348
You said you liked the palace, right?

445
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:37,524
I did.

446
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:40,391
That's enough then.

447
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:39,804
Your Majesty.

448
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,732
So you're all here.

449
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,830
Though we might hate it,

450
00:39:55,704 --> 00:39:59,742
there are times we must follow the will of heaven.

451
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,921
Do you remember the actions

452
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,900
I was forced to take in the year of the horse?
(T/N: Crown Prince Sado was executed)

453
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:13,060
I did it all

454
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,900
for my subjects in Joseon.

455
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,981
Those who needed to disappear were made to disappear,

456
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:22,514
while those who needed to be deposed were deposed.

457
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,130
Even if that meant

458
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,540
removing me!

459
00:40:30,198 --> 00:40:35,568
When I thought of those capable of

460
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:38,260
devote their lives in protecting the Crown Prince,

461
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,178
you were the ones that came to mind.

462
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:53,551
I earnestly ask

463
00:40:54,862 --> 00:40:57,490
that in the times to come,

464
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,200
all of you will do

465
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:04,995
the difficult things needed without giving up!

466
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,533
Will the time finally draw near?

467
00:41:29,937 --> 00:41:33,422
The night you went to Lady Yeongbin's funeral chamber…

468
00:41:33,422 --> 00:41:35,856
you weren't alone were you?

469
00:41:35,856 --> 00:41:38,713
How did he know?

470
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,795
What is this?

471
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:48,353
Are you guys sleeping here tonight?

472
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:52,694
I knew it. You haven't even laid out the comforter yet.

473
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:55,377
You should get some rest.

474
00:41:56,062 --> 00:41:58,437
Did you come because you were worried about me?

475
00:41:58,437 --> 00:42:01,205
Are you laughing? You almost died today!

476
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:04,094
Yes, we were really worried.

477
00:42:05,346 --> 00:42:08,347
Sleeping together like this...

478
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:12,447
it is like we are back to the good old apprentice days, isn't it?

479
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,157
Should I tell you guys an old story?

480
00:42:17,553 --> 00:42:20,521
What's up, Young Hee? You're not one to tell stories.

481
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:25,343
A long time ago, I heard a story from Court Lady Park…

482
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:29,588
She told me to never tell anyone else, but…

483
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:33,444
I really want to tell you guys.

484
00:42:33,444 --> 00:42:36,844
A long, long, very long time ago,

485
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:40,854
there were celestial fairies who lived on the moon.

486
00:42:40,854 --> 00:42:44,253
The name of their moon palace was…

487
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:46,209
Gwanghan Palace.

488
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:50,286
The fairies, they lived there happily,

489
00:42:50,286 --> 00:42:52,683
without any worries at all.

490
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:56,106
One day, the fairies looked down from the above,

491
00:42:56,106 --> 00:43:00,666
and there they saw a magnificent king ruling a kingdom.

492
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:04,450
The fairies wanted to serve the king,

493
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:09,039
so they all came down from the moon and became palace maids.

494
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,661
The king was very happy

495
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:17,332
and promised to always treat them well.

496
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:23,419
During the great reign of peace, that promise was well kept.

497
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,245
The fairies lived happily.

498
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:32,742
But then one day, war arose out of nowhere.

499
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:36,346
The king abandoned the palace and fled.

500
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:40,270
The king threw off his royal robe,

501
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,560
abandoned his subjects,

502
00:43:43,178 --> 00:43:45,289
and abandoned the fairies, too.

503
00:43:46,015 --> 00:43:48,038
Taking only strong men,

504
00:43:48,038 --> 00:43:51,537
who could protect him, he went far away.

505
00:43:52,436 --> 00:43:56,704
And then? The king never returned?

506
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:59,104
He did return.

507
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,286
So the fairies lived happily again?

508
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:04,276
The king returned

509
00:44:04,276 --> 00:44:08,097
and berated the fairies.

510
00:44:08,097 --> 00:44:12,321
He said that they, his women, had lost their chastity,

511
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:16,564
and he chased them away.

512
00:44:16,564 --> 00:44:21,617
New fairies can always come down from the moon, he said.

513
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,715
He chased the old fairies away,

514
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:30,236
saying he'd only be satisfied with new young fairies.

515
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:32,690
That's unforgivable! That king!

516
00:44:33,191 --> 00:44:34,558
I'd rip him apart.

517
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:39,234
Hey! What if someone hears you and misunderstands?

518
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:42,282
But what happened to the moon fairies is too sad!

519
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:44,771
It's just a story.

520
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:48,753
It's just a story, right?

521
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:50,419
So?

522
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:53,214
And then what happened?

523
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:58,536
He chased all the fairies away

524
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:01,159
until he was left alone in the palace.

525
00:45:02,682 --> 00:45:05,711
It was only then that the king realized

526
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:09,088
how much he needed the fairies.

527
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:16,014
Without them, he could no longer function as a king.

528
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,981
The king's food, clothing, and even his bed…

529
00:45:20,981 --> 00:45:24,292
It all required the fairies.

530
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:30,199
Without them, no king is a king.

531
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:37,335
So the king ordered the old fairies

532
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:40,898
to return to the palace and resume their work.

533
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,915
So the old fairies worked as they always had

534
00:45:44,915 --> 00:45:48,065
and taught the young fairies about their responsibilities.

535
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:53,555
The king was satisfied, believing everything had been resolved,

536
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:59,133
but the fairies, they didn't just forget about what happened.

537
00:46:02,381 --> 00:46:06,043
They gathered the young fairies and taught them the following.

538
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:11,187
"Never believe the king."

539
00:46:12,657 --> 00:46:15,858
Never believe the king.

540
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:20,142
The only ones we can trust are ourselves.

541
00:46:20,843 --> 00:46:25,443
All we have are ourselves.

542
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,779
Don't you ever forget

543
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:32,405
this burned robe,

544
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:34,715
or the king that abandoned us.

545
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:39,682
Whatever the means,

546
00:46:39,682 --> 00:46:42,638
we must always remember

547
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:45,870
to trust ourselves.

548
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,907
Yes, my lady.

549
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:08,030
The two of you will work in the royal kitchen at His Majesty's palace from tomorrow.

550
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:12,387
We welcome you to our group.

551
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,898
There's only one person left.

552
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:43,262
Bring her here.

553
00:48:22,894 --> 00:48:24,671
Court Lady Seo.

554
00:48:28,026 --> 00:48:29,978
M-My lady.

555
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:34,973
You know where we are, yes?

556
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,396
You lived your whole life in the palace.

557
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:43,641
You have at least heard rumors, have you not?

558
00:48:43,641 --> 00:48:46,939
No, I don't know…

559
00:48:46,939 --> 00:48:50,260
Where am I?

560
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,008
Oh no, oh no…

561
00:48:55,008 --> 00:48:57,392
I must be dreaming now…

562
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:01,066
My body is weak these days so I've had terrible dreams.

563
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:05,788
Yes, I'm sure it is a nightmare.

564
00:49:05,788 --> 00:49:09,744
If we wrap you up again and beat you with rods,

565
00:49:09,744 --> 00:49:12,780
will it wake you from this dream?

566
00:49:19,591 --> 00:49:22,370
It's always the same with you.

567
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:26,897
Pretending to be silly, pretending to be useless,

568
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,519
pretending not to know, when you really do.

569
00:49:30,616 --> 00:49:33,749
You've lived a long time that way.

570
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,438
I suddenly had a thought…

571
00:49:39,298 --> 00:49:42,987
If I'd gotten you under control sooner,

572
00:49:42,987 --> 00:49:47,472
might it have been easier to take control of your student, too?

573
00:49:47,472 --> 00:49:52,528
Are you… talking about Deok Im?

574
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:54,772
Just her?

575
00:49:56,116 --> 00:49:59,966
It would have been easier to plant people I need in the Crown Prince's Palace.

576
00:50:00,754 --> 00:50:02,776
Am I wrong?

577
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,379
Bring it here.

578
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,748
Make your mark.

579
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:15,817
We welcome you to our Fairy Palace.

580
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:20,331
I look forward to seeing your students among us.

581
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,266
However dull you might truly be,

582
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:28,677
you now understand what you're to do, yes?

583
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:51,387
How unfair it is.

584
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:56,497
You were always ready to stab me in the back,

585
00:51:57,363 --> 00:52:00,396
but because you're a court lady, and for that reason alone,

586
00:52:00,396 --> 00:52:03,208
I can't take your life.

587
00:52:13,726 --> 00:52:16,831
Why are you interfering with my plan?

588
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:20,976
To protect our court ladies, I have to appoint a wise king.

589
00:52:20,976 --> 00:52:23,500
You're a court lady.

590
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,290
How can you ignore my struggles and act against me?

591
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,842
The Crown Prince is Prince Sado's son.

592
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:35,885
How dare you protect a criminal's son?

593
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:41,515
The one who drove the late Prince into lunacy…

594
00:52:41,515 --> 00:52:45,393
was it not you yourself?

595
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:50,445
You drove father and son apart.

596
00:52:50,445 --> 00:52:53,598
You made His Majesty

597
00:52:53,598 --> 00:52:57,839
loathe his own son.

598
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,493
With everyone saying he was insane,

599
00:53:00,493 --> 00:53:04,381
it drove him into madness.

600
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:07,743
What happened in the year of the horse,

601
00:53:07,743 --> 00:53:11,829
was it not all your doing?

602
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:16,293
You wretched witch, you lash out at the leader of the Fairy Palace?

603
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,215
But I know…

604
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:22,992
why you hated the late Prince so much.

605
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:29,582
Because he was the sole son of Lady Yeongbin.

606
00:53:32,361 --> 00:53:36,502
The King is the son of a lowly maid.

607
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:41,671
You chose the worthless, insignificant prince.

608
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:45,951
The King must have promised…

609
00:53:45,951 --> 00:53:50,750
to make you his wife.

610
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,718
Shut up.

611
00:53:51,718 --> 00:53:56,675
But then as soon as His Majesty succeeded to the throne,

612
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:59,652
he then chose Lady Yeongbin.

613
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:05,962
Your closest friend, Lady Yeongbin…

614
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:12,740
You are quite something!

615
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,517
And now, haven't you gotten your revenge?

616
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:20,909
You killed

617
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:23,893
the child of His Majesty

618
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:26,174
and Lady Yeongbin.

619
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:31,510
Shut up.

620
00:54:32,198 --> 00:54:34,398
I told you to shut up.

621
00:54:44,186 --> 00:54:47,276
You don't have what it takes to be one of us.

622
00:54:47,276 --> 00:54:51,529
However many times we give, however many chances, you don't change.

623
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,905
The day I became the leader of the Fairy Palace,

624
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:00,000
I vowed to protect the ladies of the court.

625
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:07,809
I don't want to break that vow just because of you.

626
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:16,860
The pride and dignity I take

627
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,645
in protecting my court ladies,

628
00:55:20,873 --> 00:55:24,173
I'd rather not lose them over you.

629
00:55:25,516 --> 00:55:28,971
And so even now, I am forced to save you.

630
00:55:38,392 --> 00:55:40,970
Save her life only.

631
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:52,078
Why did she go to the Crown Prince's Palace with those tottering legs?

632
00:55:52,078 --> 00:55:54,258
I'm talking about Court Lady Park.

633
00:55:54,258 --> 00:55:58,381
What was she so determined to give His Highness the Crown Prince?

634
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:04,250
I think there was some kind of clothing inside.

635
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,490
It must have been a winter hat.

636
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:08,944
A winter hat?

637
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:30,915
It's a small winter hat, something a baby prince would wear.

638
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:36,268
But she could just ask someone to run the errand for her.

639
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:40,202
Why did she want to give it to him directly?

640
00:56:40,202 --> 00:56:44,570
And then why did the Head Court Lady take it?

641
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,660
Your Majesty,

642
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:13,660
I speak only for our Joseon kingdom and our government.

643
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,705
The Crown Prince…

644
00:57:15,705 --> 00:57:20,574
has no need to understand the complex factionalism of the court.

645
00:57:20,574 --> 00:57:27,280
He has no need to consider the best appointees for the government.

646
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,686
He has no need to know the inner workings of the royal court.

647
00:57:33,686 --> 00:57:39,483
I beg you to revoke the order appointing him regent.

648
00:57:39,483 --> 00:57:43,790
We beg you, Your Majesty.

649
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:02,411
Will their cries change anything?

650
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:04,954
Our great undertaking has already been decided.

651
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:07,756
We'll have to be careful.

652
00:58:07,756 --> 00:58:11,550
You have rejected appeals to act as regent twice.

653
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,040
It's sufficient.

654
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,578
Now is the time to step forward, Your Highness.

655
00:58:25,478 --> 00:58:27,433
Vice Minister.

656
00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:28,890
Yes, Your Highness.

657
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:32,366
You will see that the Left State Councillor resigns his post.

658
00:58:32,366 --> 00:58:34,957
Please appeal to His Majesty.

659
00:58:34,957 --> 00:58:40,129
Ask him to punish those who tried to harm and conspire against me, the heir to the throne.

660
00:58:40,129 --> 00:58:42,651
Do not budge an inch.

661
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:46,384
There will be great resistance, Your Highness.

662
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:51,755
It's their choice to make

663
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,100
whether they will live in my Joseon

664
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,120
or die in it.

665
00:59:03,087 --> 00:59:05,990
But no forced executions by poison.

666
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,900
On the day that I ascend the throne,

667
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:12,585
I'll personally give the Left State Councillor poison.

668
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:29,533
Mother!

669
00:59:30,235 --> 00:59:33,002
Do you think your son is already king?

670
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,570
Mother.

671
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:38,099
Even if your son becomes king…

672
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,620
you'll never become Queen Dowager.

673
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,099
You'll always be simply the wife of a dead prince,

674
00:59:43,099 --> 00:59:45,473
so don't be arrogant.

675
00:59:46,703 --> 00:59:50,481
You should escort your mother away.

676
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:53,293
Let's leave now, Mother.

677
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:55,893
Who are you listening to right now?

678
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:58,323
I'm your mother.

679
01:00:05,474 --> 01:00:07,619
Hyebin.

680
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:11,408
The King is still fit to rule, but now he needs a regent?

681
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:13,879
Does that make sense?

682
01:00:13,879 --> 01:00:16,819
Go now and persuade your son.

683
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:20,438
He'll surely listen to the mother who gave birth to him.

684
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,182
Go, quickly!

685
01:00:32,523 --> 01:00:34,589
As the Princess has said,

686
01:00:36,221 --> 01:00:38,778
I cannot become the Queen Dowager,

687
01:00:38,778 --> 01:00:40,491
forever…

688
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:43,147
I'll forever be simply a consort.

689
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:47,471
But my son…

690
01:00:47,471 --> 01:00:51,891
he's been trying hard to respect the mother who bore him.

691
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:57,910
He said he would someday give me a palace name.

692
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:04,038
He's already decided on my palace name and title.

693
01:01:04,038 --> 01:01:07,038
"Her Highness of Hyegyeong Palace."

694
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,959
And so,

695
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:15,650
that's what people will soon call me.

696
01:01:20,664 --> 01:01:25,064
And you, Princess, do you know what others will call you?

697
01:01:26,873 --> 01:01:32,506
When the Crown Prince becomes king, you will lose your title.

698
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:38,033
No longer a princess, you'll be demoted to a simple commoner.

699
01:01:40,673 --> 01:01:44,084
Your dead husband was a member of the Jeong clan.

700
01:01:44,084 --> 01:01:46,839
So you'll be the Wife of Jeong,

701
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:51,171
or Mrs. Jeong, I suppose.

702
01:01:52,437 --> 01:01:54,781
You bitch, how dare you!

703
01:01:56,257 --> 01:01:57,625
Mother!

704
01:01:57,625 --> 01:01:59,781
Let go of me!

705
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:02,320
- Princess Hyebin, please leave.
- Take your hands off me.

706
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,960
Let go! Hyebin!

707
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,409
Mother…

708
01:02:07,409 --> 01:02:10,544
This is my room. Am I the one who should go?

709
01:02:10,544 --> 01:02:12,261
Princess Hyebin, please!

710
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,251
Hyebin!

711
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:17,265
Let go of me!

712
01:02:17,265 --> 01:02:20,296
I won't let this stand.

713
01:02:20,296 --> 01:02:22,700
Mother. Mother…

714
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,948
You saw it, right?

715
01:02:45,948 --> 01:02:48,952
You saw how much Hyebin hates me.

716
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:53,625
She won't let the past go.

717
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:59,537
Does she think I killed her husband?

718
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:05,594
Why does she hate me?

719
01:03:05,594 --> 01:03:11,301
Is she saying I wanted to hurt my own brother or what?

720
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:14,061
My brother had gone insane...

721
01:03:14,061 --> 01:03:18,500
What else could I have done when he killed so many people!

722
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:48,230
[Fight against them.]

723
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:21,039
That day in the King's chamber, if Your Highness hadn't stepped in,

724
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,302
I would have been maimed and exiled.

725
01:04:25,302 --> 01:04:29,357
The great favor shown to me by Your Highness…

726
01:04:29,357 --> 01:04:34,700
I'll take the gratitude to my grave… No, I'll die grateful…

727
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,125
"Eternally grateful" sounds better…

728
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:38,391
Ah, yes…

729
01:04:53,376 --> 01:04:57,906
That day… I misunderstood Your Highness.

730
01:04:57,906 --> 01:05:00,242
I hadn't stolen anything,

731
01:05:00,242 --> 01:05:06,187
but when Your Highness didn't believe me, I felt angry and disappointed.

732
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:10,947
But… now I understand why you did what you did.

733
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:16,946
At His Majesty's chamber that day, I was happy that you stood up for me, and

734
01:05:18,932 --> 01:05:21,822
protected me, Your Highness.

735
01:05:31,016 --> 01:05:33,840
On the day Lady Yeongbin passed away,

736
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:38,390
didn't you perhaps meet a little playmate of the Crown Prince?

737
01:05:39,371 --> 01:05:42,910
Your Highness, how do you know that?

738
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:50,341
Yes, that day I met a playmate of the Crown Prince around my age.

739
01:05:50,341 --> 01:05:52,061
Hey, you!

740
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:58,701
Hey, you. Do you maybe know the way to Lady Yeongbin's residence?

741
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:04,058
We went to her funeral chamber together, where the boy broke down.

742
01:06:04,058 --> 01:06:07,456
I still remember the way he cried over her.

743
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,920
And do you still remember

744
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:14,250
that boy's name?

745
01:06:16,757 --> 01:06:19,240
His name was…

746
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:23,833
Lady Yeongbin, it's me.

747
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:25,982
San is here.

748
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,710
San…

749
01:06:28,315 --> 01:06:29,721
San…

750
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,338
My name…

751
01:06:44,135 --> 01:06:45,964
is San.

752
01:07:04,044 --> 01:07:07,052
Crying too much is bad for you.

753
01:07:07,052 --> 01:07:09,511
So it was you.

754
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:11,252
The civil service exam?

755
01:07:12,169 --> 01:07:15,135
I don't take such an exam.

756
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,675
So it was you, Your Highness.

[The Red Sleeve]
~ Preview ~

761
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:04,683
Leave in a dignified outfit as a king would do.

762
01:08:04,683 --> 01:08:11,085
So the Crown Prince is planning to visit the tombs, far away, where the king cannot reach him.

763
01:08:11,085 --> 01:08:13,105
This is a gunpowder pouch from the Crown Prince's Palace.

764
01:08:13,105 --> 01:08:15,165
It's soaked. We can't use it now.

765
01:08:15,165 --> 01:08:18,333
"Our enemies have emerged, fight against them."

Everyone protect His Highness!

767
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:23,700
Please hurry, my lady. We'll have to run now.
