[but all depiction of details of their lives and motives are fictional.]

3
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:46,451
The fate of the kingdom can be

4
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:49,340
determined by my actions.

5
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,658
I can never let my guard down.

6
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:56,085
Nothing of mine is private.

7
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:11,738
Doesn't your hand just extend out to someone so hardworking like that?

8
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:16,881
So desperate to become a great king.

9
00:01:18,404 --> 00:01:24,060
Even though the Crown Prince wouldn't need help from a mere palace maid.

10
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:33,924
[The Book of Odes]

11
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:51,937
Well done.

12
00:01:56,248 --> 00:02:01,093
Your Highness, the water basin has arrived.

13
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,370
[Episode 6]

14
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:46,947
Come here for a second.

15
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:49,436
There.

16
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,433
Work with utmost care and devotion.

17
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:32,666
Sir, you left behind this fan.

18
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:38,407
Thank you, Miss Maiden.

19
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:44,543
I must attend to the Dondeok Order meeting.

20
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,248
I'll deliver the Crown Prince's instructions.

21
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:45,070
Tell them to keep an eye on Lord Jung, Princess Hwawan's adopted son.

22
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,269
He is a master of intrigue and deception.

23
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:50,376
So we must be on guard.

24
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,140
Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,859
I need someone's help to lift this confinement order.

26
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:05,486
Tell them to find someone who can speak candidly to His Majesty.

27
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:11,379
As for Lord Jung, I will keep an eye on him.

28
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,346
I will frequent the Office of Documents and Reports and monitor him.

29
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:20,695
But as far as finding someone new who will help His Highness...

30
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:25,596
Sir Preceptor, do you have possibilities in mind?

31
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:30,837
How about the Deputy Chief Royal Physician?

32
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:35,202
His Majesty calls him often these days.

33
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:40,818
His Highness instructed that the Royal Infirmary was off-limits.

34
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:43,401
The thought would have crossed my mind had it not been an order.

35
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:48,196
Who then? There is no one.

36
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:49,931
Perhaps, if...

37
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:53,122
Perhaps someone in the royal clan?

38
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:55,500
The royal clan is out of the question,

39
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,367
though someone from the Royal Relatives Fellowship Office might be a possibility.

40
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,537
In that case, I'll make the approach.

41
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:07,282
Right now, the problem is not who is going to approach or how,

42
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:10,175
but whom we will contact.

43
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:15,021
May I ask you something?

44
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,866
Pardon?

45
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:20,022
What was it you wanted to say,

46
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:22,701
but in the end couldn't?

47
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:26,294
I found it rather puzzling.

48
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:29,750
Why has no one considered her as a possibility?

49
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:42,937
Do you think that I would not have considered what

50
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:46,527
a mere rank-nine palace maid would have easily thought of?

51
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:48,762
I'm sure you did—

52
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:52,261
The only thing that I was not able to anticipate

53
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:01,400
was that a woman would join the Dongdeok Order.

54
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:07,523
Plus, a rank-nine officer of the Inner Court,

55
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:10,677
a female servant that is.

56
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:15,033
We men would never dare to think of her.

57
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:20,254
Such a thought is blasphemy. We wouldn't be able to persuade her in secret.

58
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:25,500
But

59
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,920
you are different from us.

60
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:36,242
Isn't that right?

61
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:42,282
The instructions were delivered as I was told.

62
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:44,115
Well done.

63
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,382
Did they find a way?

64
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:51,127
I may have found a way, Your Highness.

65
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,028
You?

66
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:55,528
I will go, Your Highness.

67
00:08:55,528 --> 00:09:00,063
I shall approach Her Highness the Queen, and ask her to be on your side, Your Highness.

68
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:03,775
This is something only a woman can do.

69
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:09,135
So I shall go, Your Highness.

70
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,645
I hate insects.

71
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,578
Me, too.

72
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:25,764
I hate the useless ones the most.

73
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:30,177
These ones give us silk so I don't hate them.

74
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:33,355
I don't hate them. I don't hate them.

75
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:39,345
I don't hate them. I don't hate them. I don't hate them. I don't hate them.

76
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,894
- I don't hate them.
- No.

77
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:42,638
- I don't hate them.
- Don't.

78
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:44,483
- I don't.
- Don't do it.

79
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,426
I don't hate them.

80
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:48,847
I don't hate them. I don't hate them.

81
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:51,991
I like useful things.

82
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,076
Silk, silk thread, silkworm.

83
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:58,932
Silk, silk thread, silkworm.

84
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:17,600
Thanks to you, one basket has turned into ten.

85
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,654
Who knew the Lady Supervisor would be right outside?

86
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:25,530
She was there to watch over the likes of you.

87
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,265
Young Hee, Kyung Hee is scaring me.

88
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:32,475
Come on, Kyung Hee.

89
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:37,488
I should have been an attendant handmaid like Deok Im. I wouldn't have to do chores like this then.

90
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:40,631
We are only temporarily helping prepare the annual Silk Cocoon Ceremony.

91
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,852
Preparations are for an entire month.

92
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:46,731
A chambermaid is supposed to embroider, but all I'm doing is chopping mulberry leaves!

93
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:51,336
I'd rather pick mulberry leaves than deliver chamber pots, though.

94
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:52,651
Do you think we are the same?

95
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:55,151
We're maids of the palace all the same.

96
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:59,141
Maids for sewing or washing, they are no different.

97
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:03,185
Where is Deok Im? Shouldn't she help even though she doesn't have to?

98
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:06,164
- She probably can't come.
- How come?

99
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:09,605
Lately, she comes in only to sleep.

100
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:13,228
Even when she's in the room, she doesn't say much and is lost in thought.

101
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:14,995
What thought?

102
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:20,338
I don't know, I'm worried.

103
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:24,645
Rumors have it the Crown Prince is under confinement.

104
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:26,630
Is it true?

105
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,550
Is that what's worrying her?

106
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:31,732
Not sure.

107
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:36,697
That's why the attendant handmaid is the worst job. Her fate hangs on her master's fate.

108
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,984
Sewing house maids are the best.

109
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:41,128
I thought you didn't like it.

110
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:51,052
My lady of a higher calling,

111
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:53,800
do allow me to help you.

112
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,309
Get some rest.

113
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:02,929
Don't look. Just rest. I will finish the job.

114
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,145
Are you pleased?

115
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:25,206
Expectations are building as to what Your Highness will wear to the Silk Cocoon Ceremony.

116
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:29,532
No doubt the Princess will outshine all.

117
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:34,211
My only wish is for the gentlewomen to find it without any flaws.

118
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,507
Certainly, no chance in that.

119
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:41,217
Does anyone come even close to the Princess in comparison?

120
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:45,302
You are so beautiful.

121
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:48,523
You are all beautiful as well.

122
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:56,964
You.

123
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:01,428
You wench! How dare you show your face before me?

124
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,383
Have you been well, Your Highness?

125
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:09,407
This is no place for you to be, a lowly maid of the prince's court.

126
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:12,085
I called her to be here.

127
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:29,204
Princess Hyebin assigned her to the Queen's Palace.

128
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:32,149
We might need a hand with the Silk Cocoon Ceremony preparations,

129
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,994
so she told me to keep her for the time being.

130
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:39,380
Your Highness,

131
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,970
I consented to the wishes of this gentlewoman

132
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,774
to visit the Royal Villa in Onyang.
(T/N: vacation home)

133
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:49,410
You should have consulted with me first.

134
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,897
Madam, the Royal Villa must be kept unoccupied.

135
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:56,704
His Majesty may call without an advance warning.

136
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:59,545
Yes, Your Highness.

137
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:05,098
I can secure royal permission from His Majesty myself.

138
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:09,976
I cannot imagine my father rejecting my request.

139
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:15,158
No worries. You may visit the villa, Madam.

140
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:19,477
I shall remember your kindness, Your Highness.

141
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:21,868
You need not do so. Have some tea.

142
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:23,600
Thank you.

143
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:37,143
I must have seemed pathetic in your eyes.

144
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:42,382
That is impossible.

145
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,895
It happens all the time.

146
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:49,892
Did Princess Hyebin really send you to me because there is not much to do at the prince's court?

147
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:54,516
To be honest, the reason why I am here is—

148
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:58,994
I am bored. Shall we play a game of riddles?

149
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:01,781
I shall go first.

150
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:07,226
What is the world's deepest recess?

151
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:12,175
Which of the world's summits is the hardest to scale?

152
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:16,066
And what is the world's

153
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,164
most precious flower?

154
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:28,386
So you got them all wrong?

155
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,222
You didn't even get one right?

156
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:35,506
The Queen didn't tell me the answers, so I asked Lady Seo...

157
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:38,755
and she said none of my answers were right.

158
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:42,073
Were the Queen's riddles so difficult?

159
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,067
She asked me... what was

160
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:48,211
the world's deepest recess.

161
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,098
The human heart.

162
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:52,550
Next?

163
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,529
The world's... hardest hill to climb...

164
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,316
The Boritgogae hill.
(T/N: literally "barley hill;" used to denote a time of famine.)

165
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:03,015
Last?

166
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:05,716
The world's most precious flower...

167
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,571
The cotton flower!

168
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,428
I am ashamed, Your Highness.

169
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:14,640
Don't fret. No shame to be wrong.

170
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:20,400
Why didn't you give her a riddle yourself? A hard one.

171
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,444
I did, and the Queen wasn't able to solve it.

172
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,855
Really?

173
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:30,738
Name the king who had three different kinds of bells?

174
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:37,158
- King Sejong.
- Yes.
(T/N: literally "Three Bells")

175
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:40,573
Do you call that a riddle?

176
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,509
It's not that the Queen couldn't solve it,

177
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,890
she didn't.

178
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,834
Your Highness...

179
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:56,367
The last question that the Queen posed

180
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,574
was a grave one.

181
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:02,228
One final question,

182
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:09,302
how does the Prince Crown view me?

183
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:14,239
The Queen is formidable.

184
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,998
She seats a naïve maid in front of her,

185
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:20,962
disarms her with a game of riddles

186
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:25,628
to pry out the information she is looking for.

187
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:33,485
Your shift is ending.

188
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,659
His Majesty may be calling. Be on your way.

189
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:39,126
Yes, Your Highness.

190
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:43,940
Deok Im.

191
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,891
This may be the first time you called me by my name.

192
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:55,483
You did well.

193
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,380
I need the Queen's help.

194
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:07,621
The throne will be out of reach for me without her support.

195
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:12,279
I knew it all along, but I wasn't able to find a solution.

196
00:18:15,384 --> 00:18:18,217
Thank you for helping me.

197
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:22,872
I never thought that I would see the day

198
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:25,950
you praised me for my actions.

199
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:31,902
Credit must be given when it is due,

200
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,516
because you are my person.

201
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:44,148
It's my honor, Your Highness.

202
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:47,284
I shall be on my way.

203
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:05,016
King Sejong.

204
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:12,430
I think I'm doomed.

205
00:19:37,157 --> 00:19:41,414
In my opinion, I believe that the world's deepest recess

206
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:45,628
is the universe that houses all creation,

207
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:48,988
while the hardest hill to conquer...

208
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,496
is the summit of longevity.

209
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,063
Heaven decides man's longevity,

210
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:57,124
so man cannot conquer and change his fate on his own.

211
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:00,170
The world's most precious flower

212
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,458
is whichever one needs in his or her life.

213
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,459
Rice flowers would be most precious to the hungry,

214
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:09,079
while the flower of the licorice is to the herbalist,

215
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:13,455
as the cotton flower would be for the one in need of clothing.

216
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:20,869
Did you say your name was Sung Deok Im?

217
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:23,236
Yes, Your Highness.

218
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,416
One final question.

219
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,952
How does the Crown Prince view me?

220
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:38,112
As a mirror, Your Highness.

221
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,363
A mirror?

222
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,015
A mirror always emulates what it sees.

223
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:47,994
Just like the mirror, as much as my Queen values the Crown Prince,

224
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:51,116
so does the Crown Prince in thinking of you.

225
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,327
As much as the motherly love my Queen shows the Crown Prince,

226
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:59,096
the Crown Prince, too, will assume his dutiful role as the Queen's son.

227
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:11,473
A mirror always emulates what it sees...

228
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:17,419
Will the sun rise from the east?
(T/N: "Will the Crown Prince become king?")

229
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:30,957
Sir Preceptor Hong!

230
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:39,060
Good seeing you. I need your help.

231
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:45,858
So His Highness instructed you to deliver a secret directive to the Dongdeok Order,

232
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:49,341
but you forgot those orders?

233
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:53,914
I didn't forget everything, though. I remember two out of three that were given.

234
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:58,714
For the life of me, I can't remember the last one.

235
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,196
What is it you want me to do?

236
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:06,498
You know His Highness well.

237
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:09,736
So will you help me?

238
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:13,059
Help me just this once.

239
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:14,548
Just this once...

240
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:18,022
That's what you said the last time.

241
00:22:18,776 --> 00:22:22,177
Military officials like me are dull. Yes, they are.

242
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:26,638
Civil officials are smart, and Sir Preceptor is the smartest of them all.

243
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,932
Shouldn't an educated man show some pity and compassion?

244
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,176
Fine.

245
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:35,865
I will help you but I will need your cooperation.

246
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:37,323
You have my full cooperation.

247
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,366
Now...

248
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:41,693
Take yourself back to the prince's court.

249
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,270
Me?

250
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:48,578
I'm now in the Crown Prince's Palace.

251
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,154
When His Highness contemplates his enemies, he always stares at his sword.

252
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:59,848
Find out if the Left State Councilor Hong Jeong Yeo is meeting with Yun Yu Jik and Hong Baek Mi in private.

253
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:02,439
And if so, how often.

254
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,873
Report to me as soon as you find out.

255
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:05,539
Yes, Your Highness.

256
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:17,984
The anniversary of my father's death approaches.

257
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:21,987
Someone must visit my father's shrine in my stead.

258
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:26,575
Inform Lords Gwang Eun and Heung Eun
(T/N: brothers-in-law)

259
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:29,663
that they must visit with my sisters.

260
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,309
Yes, Your Highness.

261
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:35,221
His Highness always reminisces the deceased Crown Prince
(T/N: The Crown Prince Yi San's father)

262
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:38,485
over that picture.

263
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,097
Where did His Highness fix

264
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:46,142
his gaze when giving you the last order?

265
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:50,828
Not the sword,

266
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:52,986
not the picture either.

267
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:55,262
His Highness...

268
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:58,821
His Highness...

269
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:07,442
I remember! His Highness was holding the Book of Odes!

270
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:09,240
The Book of Odes?

271
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:13,819
I hope she doesn't put herself at risk.

272
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:18,349
- Head guardsman.
- Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:21,176
I have one last command to give.

274
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,624
Order me, Your Highness.

275
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:32,328
Be sure... to protect them.

276
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,783
Yes, Your Highness.

277
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:40,748
Be sure... to protect them.

278
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:46,428
Right. Until the confinement is lifted, His Highness ordered me to protect all the servants in his palace.

279
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:49,364
He cherishes all his court servants when there are so many.

280
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:53,653
He is a good master, isn't he?

281
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:57,797
But it must be that there is

282
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,023
one person His Highness truly wants to protect.

283
00:25:00,023 --> 00:25:01,096
Pardon?

284
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:03,919
Because His Highness cannot go out to protect her himself,

285
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,433
he must be deeply concerned.

286
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:07,667
What are you talking about?

287
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,655
You don't have to know.

288
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,570
I'll be on my way then.

289
00:25:19,716 --> 00:25:23,170
Cold as a rock, he is.

290
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,270
Thanks! I hope I can count on you again!

291
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:31,328
Let me think again…

292
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:36,118
His Highness's first command was… Go to the Dongdeok Order…

293
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,005
Go to the Dongdeok Order…

294
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,506
What? What was that again?

295
00:25:43,506 --> 00:25:48,094
What? I'm in trouble. Sir Preceptor, hold on!

296
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:53,622
There is a woman I find extremely difficult.

297
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:59,786
From the first day I saw her,

298
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:03,282
her arrogance knows no bounds.

299
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:05,884
But His Majesty turns a blind eye

300
00:26:05,884 --> 00:26:08,883
no matter how insolently she behaves.

301
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:16,091
- There is something you could do for me.
- Pardon?

302
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:18,213
If you can make it happen...

303
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:22,295
I may be of help to the Crown Prince.

304
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:24,473
Truly?

305
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:28,966
Command me, Your Highness.

306
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:32,944
What would you have me do?

307
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,293
The Silk Cocoon Ceremony is the day of the Queen.

308
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:42,627
No princess can defy and override my authority.

309
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:46,338
I need a just cause

310
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:49,838
that no one, neither His Majesty,

311
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:54,883
nor the world, would admonish,

312
00:27:55,577 --> 00:28:00,644
in order to put Princess Hwawan in her place.

313
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,552
See if you can find one.

314
00:28:09,552 --> 00:28:11,874
You strike me as very bright.

315
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:18,186
The ceremony is fast approaching.

316
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:20,536
You must be hasty.

317
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,796
I need a just cause…

318
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:42,162
in order to put Princess Hwawan in her place.

319
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:57,153
Deok Im.

320
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,809
Why haven't you eaten anything?

321
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,863
Is there something wrong?

322
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:05,094
You guys!

323
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,834
I'm so useless!

324
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,878
What do you mean?

325
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,170
You have to tell us what's wrong so we can help you!

326
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,427
Deok Im is the Crown Prince's attendant handmaid.

327
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,090
She's probably forbidden from talking candidly.

328
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:27,949
Forget it if you don't want to talk! I don't care!

329
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:35,770
Now, feast your eyes on this!

330
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,292
This is silk that my father brought from Qin!

331
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:42,192
Wow!

332
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,541
Kyung Hee, I'm so jealous that your father

333
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:50,188
is this country's greatest trader! Let's swap fathers.

334
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,567
I've never seen such beautiful silk!

335
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:55,861
- It was woven by the greatest weaver of Qin!
- Of course!

336
00:29:55,861 --> 00:30:00,074
Even so, this silk is practically useless.

337
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:03,419
Princess Hwawan bought all of this silk.

338
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,720
Princess Hwawan?

339
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,040
Yes, for the upcoming ceremony.

340
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,605
She's planning to use this silk for her dress that day.

341
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:15,860
If she caught me wearing something made of this silk,

342
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,627
she would have me executed at once.

343
00:30:21,223 --> 00:30:23,413
- Kyung Hee!
- What is it?

344
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:25,732
So what you're saying is…

345
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:29,760
Princess Hwawan purchased all of this silk that was imported from Qin

346
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,006
in order to make a dress to wear at the Silk Cocoon Ceremony?

347
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:35,238
Yes.

348
00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:39,114
All right! I've got it!

349
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:46,327
Deok Im!

350
00:31:57,385 --> 00:32:01,730
This is how you may put the Princess in her place at the ceremony.

351
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:38,458
Standing here,

352
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:43,504
I feel like I've become the Queen.

353
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:49,884
Are you done here? Let's get off!

354
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,533
But Young Hee is keeping a lookout.

355
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:56,769
We deserve to have some fun after all that mulberry leaf picking for a month.

356
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:05,092
Deok Im, did you solve your problem?

357
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:09,450
I'll have to wait and see.

358
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:12,551
See what happens here tomorrow.

359
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:14,456
What's going to happen?

360
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:16,670
Hey, let's go!

361
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,813
Okay. Hold on.

362
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:24,143
It's the Princess!

363
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:25,454
Who's coming?

364
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:29,018
- Princess Hwawan!
- Princess Hwawan?

365
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:32,587
Are you all right, Your Highness?

366
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:37,923
Hurry!

367
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:45,984
Your Highness! Your Highness!

368
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,209
I can't believe this!

369
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:55,355
Why does Princess Hye Bin get a more prestigious seat than me? Does she think she's still the crown princess or what?

370
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:59,485
She's not the Crown Princess anymore.

371
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:04,402
I'm more royal than she is!

372
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:08,362
It's understandable that you're upset, Your Highness.

373
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:10,630
Such unfair treatment

374
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,128
must grieve you deeply.

375
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:18,528
Do you… truly know how I feel?

376
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:20,474
Of course, I do.

377
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:23,264
Of all the women in the kingdom,

378
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:26,205
you are the most royal.

379
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:28,806
You are the King's daughter.

380
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:33,485
The bluest blood flows through your veins.

381
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,889
Princess Hyebin

382
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:40,145
is merely a daughter of an aristocrat.

383
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:45,055
She got lucky and was chosen to marry the Crown Prince.

384
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:52,174
It is the same with the Queen.

385
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,942
It was blind luck that made her become queen.

386
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:58,844
But her blood is the blood of subjects.

387
00:34:58,844 --> 00:35:05,057
She's taking Princess Hyebin's side because they're both children of subjects.

388
00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:07,790
No matter what anyone says,

389
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:13,067
you are the most royal woman in the land.

390
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:21,660
But Father doesn't isten to me like he used to.

391
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,826
He's been completely taken with that young queen.

392
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:30,492
You must be so grieved.

393
00:35:31,511 --> 00:35:33,837
I only regret

394
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:37,515
that I am powerless to help you.

395
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:39,364
That's not true.

396
00:35:39,364 --> 00:35:43,430
You're the only one I can count on in the palace.

397
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:48,823
The fact that I'm doing this well in the palace is all thanks to you.

398
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:52,723
I'm honored, Your Highness.

399
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:00,727
Now, let us return.

400
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,227
Okay.

401
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:23,234
What did we just see? I think I just saw something really scary.

402
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:27,440
So the Head Court Lady supports Princess Hwawan.

403
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,348
I already knew.

404
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:34,153
But I didn't think she would do it so blatantly.

405
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:37,512
She isn't even afraid of the Queen.

406
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:41,131
She's quite a character.

407
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:43,332
Shall I say she's quite impressive?

408
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:02,091
Bow!

409
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,416
Arise!

410
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:15,653
Bow!

411
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:20,190
Arise!

412
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:25,036
Bow!

413
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,776
Arise!

414
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:31,464
Stand!

415
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:41,368
Finish!

416
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:56,530
Your Highness, I've never seen such pretty silk!

417
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,298
You have such taste, Your Highness!

418
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:05,164
Your beauty is truly dazzling!

419
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:14,903
I really like this silk from Qin. I was planning to purchase more.

420
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:18,437
I'll get you some as well if you want.

421
00:39:18,437 --> 00:39:21,340
- You're so lucky!
- Thank you.

422
00:39:30,512 --> 00:39:34,012
What's the matter, Your Highness?

423
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,770
What are you looking at?

424
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,791
Kneel, Princess Hwawan!

425
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:40,330
Pardon?

426
00:39:42,206 --> 00:39:46,906
Kneel and confess your wrongdoing!

427
00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:49,675
Did you not hear me?

428
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:52,350
What did you just say?

429
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,166
Make her kneel!

430
00:39:57,893 --> 00:40:02,026
How dare you! Let go of me!

431
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:05,352
My lady!

432
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:07,028
Let me go!

433
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,502
How dare you lay your hands on me!

434
00:40:10,502 --> 00:40:13,328
I said, let me go!

435
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:23,096
Why are you doing this, Your Highnes?

436
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:26,813
Do you truly not understand your wrongdoing?

437
00:40:26,813 --> 00:40:29,514
I did nothing to deserve this treatment!

438
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:32,276
How could you insult me like this?

439
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:34,410
I will tell my father!

440
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,288
When Father hears of this—

441
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,903
After becoming queen at the age of fifteen,

442
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:04,300
there have been many difficult and ambiguous situations.

443
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,825
Especially when it came to Princess Hwawan.

444
00:41:07,825 --> 00:41:11,136
Since I am seven years younger than her,

445
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:15,153
I was not sure if I should step in as a mother.

446
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:18,021
While doubting myself and hesitating,

447
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:21,738
I forgot my responsibilities as a mother.

448
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:26,030
The only reason for the Silk Cocoon Ceremony

449
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:31,358
is to encourage the women of Joseon to wear clothes woven

450
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,518
with Joseon silk.

451
00:41:33,518 --> 00:41:37,863
However, Princess Hwawan showed off Qin silk

452
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:41,308
in front of the wives of the lords and ladies of the court.

453
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:45,835
Now, those ladies will follow

454
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:50,305
the Princess in purchasing silk from Qin as well.

455
00:41:50,305 --> 00:41:52,538
The Princess's mistake

456
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,021
is my mistake as I have not taught her as a mother should.

457
00:41:57,021 --> 00:41:58,810
It is because…

458
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:03,587
I had not acted as a mother to the Princess.

459
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:08,516
I am deeply ashamed, Your Majesty.

460
00:42:09,971 --> 00:42:12,238
I am deeply ashamed.

461
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:18,623
The Princess deserved to be punished.

462
00:42:19,866 --> 00:42:23,677
You are the Princess's mother,

463
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:28,288
so it is right for you to set her straight.

464
00:42:31,163 --> 00:42:33,452
I am grateful, Your Majesty.

465
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,914
No words can describe my gratitude

466
00:42:39,914 --> 00:42:44,040
that my husband considers me the mother of his child.

467
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,072
My queen.

468
00:42:46,072 --> 00:42:50,848
If you carry any grudges,

469
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:53,993
please let go of them.

470
00:42:57,086 --> 00:42:58,878
Then…

471
00:43:00,756 --> 00:43:03,724
may I make one more request of you?

472
00:43:03,724 --> 00:43:06,136
Go ahead.

473
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:09,325
Please forgive the Crown Prince.

474
00:43:10,044 --> 00:43:14,477
Others may not know, but I do.

475
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:17,677
You commanded his confinement

476
00:43:17,677 --> 00:43:21,668
because you love the Crown Prince dearly.

477
00:43:22,074 --> 00:43:26,207
You only have the best of intentions for your grandson.

478
00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:30,142
However, if the punishment continues,

479
00:43:30,142 --> 00:43:33,323
this could harm your grandson.

480
00:43:35,373 --> 00:43:38,295
Please take my words into consideration.

481
00:43:44,975 --> 00:43:53,043
Your Majesty, you must be worried about who will host the envoy from Qin.

482
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:58,589
I have an idea, so please do not worry.

483
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:02,534
Why would I be worried?

484
00:44:02,534 --> 00:44:08,246
But since the Crown Prince is in confinement, there is no one to host the envoy—

485
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,854
What confinement?

486
00:44:12,505 --> 00:44:18,616
I have never commanded that the Crown Prince be confined.

487
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,047
Pardon?

488
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:26,135
I tell you it didn't happen.

489
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:27,926
Are you sure?

490
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:31,498
Of course, I'm sure.

491
00:44:34,577 --> 00:44:36,621
Secretary Jung.

492
00:44:36,621 --> 00:44:37,755
Yes, Your Majesty?

493
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:43,445
Have I issued any punishment to the Crown Prince?

494
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:47,712
No, Your Majesty. Not at all.

495
00:44:48,874 --> 00:44:51,106
I told you so.

496
00:44:53,169 --> 00:44:56,979
Did you hear such a rumor?

497
00:44:56,979 --> 00:45:01,335
That I confined the Crown Prince to his palace

498
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:05,192
and took away all of the books he loved?

499
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:07,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,738
This is how King Taejong must have felt

501
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:16,593
in his concern for King Sejong.

502
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:22,087
When King Sejong was still a prince,

503
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:25,498
all he did was read all day.

504
00:45:26,107 --> 00:45:28,285
King Taejong

505
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:31,723
worried for the state of his son's health

506
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:35,840
and took away all of his books.

507
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,230
Oh, well,

508
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,695
Minister Seo, you told me this story.

509
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:43,556
Do you remember?

510
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:46,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:49,443
I heard that

512
00:45:50,252 --> 00:45:56,287
the Crown Prince would stay in his palace and read all day long.

513
00:45:56,287 --> 00:46:01,343
Of course, studying is great, but I was worried that he would fall ill.

514
00:46:02,315 --> 00:46:07,527
Therefore, I cleared his palace of books

515
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:11,525
and instructed him to rest for a few days.

516
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:17,312
I never thought that would cause such a misunderstanding.

517
00:46:20,138 --> 00:46:21,927
Is...

518
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:27,067
Sir Preceptor Hong here? Come hither.

519
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:37,365
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

520
00:46:37,365 --> 00:46:41,099
Stop the afternoon classes for a while

521
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:44,623
and only give the prince his morning and evening instructions.

522
00:46:44,623 --> 00:46:46,095
Yes, Your Majesty.

523
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,424
Tell my grandson to take it easy

524
00:46:48,424 --> 00:46:53,124
and go out and shoot some arrows.

525
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:55,094
Yes, Your Majesty.

526
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,405
Your Highness!

527
00:47:37,405 --> 00:47:39,596
We congratulate you

528
00:47:39,596 --> 00:47:44,408
on your safety and health!

529
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:48,694
We congratulate you!

530
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,717
You can't return to my palace for a while?

531
00:48:27,717 --> 00:48:33,239
The Queen has commanded that I stay with her a few more days.

532
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:34,314
Why?

533
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,379
I don't know.

534
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:42,064
My apologies, Your Highness, but I must go run the Queen's errand.

535
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:47,776
Will you leave?

536
00:48:47,776 --> 00:48:53,627
Unfortunately, the Queen is of a higher rank than you.

537
00:49:06,021 --> 00:49:09,721
I hope the Queen doesn't keep her permanently.

538
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:28,116
Aren't you Maiden Jang of the Queen's Palace?

539
00:49:28,863 --> 00:49:32,442
Sir Preceptor, do you remember me?

540
00:49:32,442 --> 00:49:33,766
Of course.

541
00:49:33,766 --> 00:49:38,666
You even drew water for me at the well.

542
00:49:54,622 --> 00:49:56,922
Bulls-eye!

543
00:49:57,741 --> 00:50:00,031
So it was the Queen

544
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:03,557
who persuaded the King to lift my confinement order?

545
00:50:03,557 --> 00:50:05,391
Yes, Your Highness.

546
00:50:08,016 --> 00:50:12,238
She is not one to help without reason.

547
00:50:13,529 --> 00:50:14,897
Bulls-eye!

548
00:50:14,897 --> 00:50:19,882
Someone must have moved her to act.

549
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:26,445
I hear that Maiden Sung is serving at the Queen's Palace.

550
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:31,471
She could be the reason for the Queen's kindness.

551
00:50:31,471 --> 00:50:34,224
Why do you hold a mere palace maid in such high esteem?

552
00:50:34,224 --> 00:50:39,023
I trust her, but I do not think highly of her talent.

553
00:50:40,939 --> 00:50:43,268
Bulls-eye!

554
00:50:43,268 --> 00:50:45,312
Is that so?

555
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:48,821
I myself think highly of her talents,

556
00:50:48,821 --> 00:50:51,307
but do not trust her.

557
00:50:53,995 --> 00:50:58,662
I think that Maiden Sung had something to do with it.

558
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:04,402
If we use her, we could find out more information.

559
00:51:06,287 --> 00:51:08,187
Shall I…

560
00:51:08,854 --> 00:51:11,486
meet her alone?

561
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:16,775
Bulls-eye!

562
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:20,675
I thought you would miss.

563
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,711
You…

564
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:26,200
always miss with the final arrow.

565
00:51:26,988 --> 00:51:30,227
I hit the target thoughtlessly.

566
00:51:30,227 --> 00:51:32,772
I should have been more humble.

567
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:38,031
Forget about Maiden Sung.

568
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:40,653
There's no need to meet her alone.

569
00:51:40,653 --> 00:51:44,286
I will talk to her myself when she returns to my palace.

570
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,739
Your Highness, His Majesty calls for you.

571
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,738
I understand. I will go to his palace.

572
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:55,818
His Majesty is waiting at his official court.

573
00:52:06,612 --> 00:52:08,868
I know…

574
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:13,462
I was hard on you.

575
00:52:15,878 --> 00:52:18,823
It pained me so

576
00:52:18,823 --> 00:52:22,102
that I could not even sleep.

577
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,573
You have no idea

578
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:34,091
how much this old granddad loves you.

579
00:52:39,738 --> 00:52:46,205
Please hold no grudges.

580
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,702
I committed a wrong

581
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:52,301
and only received a just punishment.

582
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:57,403
I wouldn't dare to hold a grudge.

583
00:53:25,638 --> 00:53:27,883
San.

584
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:35,492
This old granddad has committed

585
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:39,203
many sins in his life.

586
00:53:39,203 --> 00:53:44,943
I am painfully aware of that.

587
00:53:44,943 --> 00:53:49,796
Even so,

588
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:54,039
I tried my best at every moment

589
00:53:55,087 --> 00:53:57,888
as King of Joseon

590
00:53:57,888 --> 00:54:00,731
for the good of the nation.

591
00:54:02,173 --> 00:54:04,829
Someday,

592
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:09,101
when you sit on that throne,

593
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:19,212
you will truly understand me.

594
00:54:21,454 --> 00:54:27,809
I'm sure that will happen.

595
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:29,911
Isn't that so?

596
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:36,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

597
00:54:41,184 --> 00:54:43,351
Good.

598
00:54:48,045 --> 00:54:51,090
Errand girls may not pass at this hour.

599
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,955
Go away!

600
00:54:52,955 --> 00:54:57,863
Sir, I am not an errand girl.

601
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:02,941
Then are you the scion of an aristocrat?

602
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:04,843
Scram!

603
00:55:21,227 --> 00:55:23,227
Sir!

604
00:55:23,227 --> 00:55:25,194
Yes, Maiden?

605
00:55:34,278 --> 00:55:36,256
You may pass.

606
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,491
Why are you trying to enter the palace?

607
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:01,434
You may pass.

608
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:17,619
Tell no one that you are the daughter of an aristocrat.

609
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:22,788
And pretend to be my servant girl. Understand?

610
00:56:22,788 --> 00:56:27,645
Yes. Thank you for your help, Maiden.

611
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:33,292
Thanks to you, I can give my brother this court robe.

612
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:36,270
Your brother is a lucky person

613
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:38,720
to wear such an intricately woven robe.

614
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:44,296
My brother never had a new court robe.

615
00:56:44,296 --> 00:56:49,696
We always got second-hand robes and Mother and I would mend them.

616
00:56:49,696 --> 00:56:53,847
I was elated when I came into some new silk.

617
00:56:53,847 --> 00:56:56,803
I sewed the robe all night,

618
00:56:57,721 --> 00:57:02,410
but my brother never came home.

619
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:08,217
I'm sure your brother will be overjoyed.

620
00:57:19,742 --> 00:57:21,531
Brother!

621
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:24,348
Dan!

622
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:31,704
Is she Sir Preceptor's sister?

623
00:57:57,396 --> 00:58:00,030
It's so pretty.

624
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:03,607
The palace is a beautiful place.

625
00:58:04,644 --> 00:58:07,812
Dan, do you like the palace?

626
00:58:07,812 --> 00:58:09,823
Yes, Deok Ro.

627
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:11,267
That's good.

628
00:58:11,267 --> 00:58:13,523
That's good?

629
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,222
Good for what?

630
00:58:30,932 --> 00:58:34,364
I never thought my sister would come with you, Miss Maiden.

631
00:58:34,364 --> 00:58:36,799
I was surprised.

632
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,706
I never thought she was your sister.

633
00:58:40,605 --> 00:58:42,671
Thank you.

634
00:58:43,441 --> 00:58:48,196
She is a timid girl and she would have been deeply discouraged.

635
00:58:48,196 --> 00:58:51,019
I didn't think that you would ever thank me.

636
00:58:51,019 --> 00:58:53,183
But next time…

637
00:58:53,183 --> 00:58:55,539
don't ever do this again.

638
00:58:56,757 --> 00:59:02,446
Don't ingratiate yourself to my sister.

639
00:59:02,446 --> 00:59:05,174
I didn't ask for your gratitude.

640
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:08,508
Don't even think about being friendly with my sister.

641
00:59:08,508 --> 00:59:10,854
Such a relationship is inadvisable.

642
00:59:10,854 --> 00:59:13,922
I doubt that I will ever see her again.

643
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:18,237
Don't be so sure about that.

644
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:22,982
In order to repay my sister's debt,

645
00:59:22,982 --> 00:59:28,042
I will give you a piece of news that you may find interesting.

646
00:59:37,396 --> 00:59:41,363
Her Highness the Queen secretly persuaded His Majesty

647
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:47,814
to lift the Crown Prince's confinement order.

648
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:57,927
Oh my. You were already aware of this.

649
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:02,183
Then was it you that persuaded the Queen?

650
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:06,971
I am truly impressed by your talent.

651
01:00:09,574 --> 01:00:11,396
I worry that…

652
01:00:12,177 --> 01:00:17,421
you could replace me as His Highness's closest confidante.

653
01:00:20,968 --> 01:00:24,879
See you again, Maiden Sung.

654
01:00:33,535 --> 01:00:35,940
My lady! My lady!

655
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,590
My lady!

656
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:38,770
My lady!

657
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:41,620
My lady! My lady!

658
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:44,610
My lady!

659
01:00:46,832 --> 01:00:48,367
You should be ashamed of yourselves!

660
01:00:48,367 --> 01:00:50,534
You can't please the Crown Prince without Deok Im?

661
01:00:50,534 --> 01:00:53,508
Then you try pleasing him.

662
01:00:53,508 --> 01:00:57,070
I have never seen the Crown Prince in such a state before.

663
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,534
He seems deeply displeased.

664
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:01,639
- I'm so scared.
- Me, too.

665
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:05,595
Deok Im knows how to soothe his anger.

666
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,466
Can't we bring her here?

667
01:01:07,466 --> 01:01:09,373
Stop with your excuses!

668
01:01:09,373 --> 01:01:14,725
You're all trying to pawn off your duties on the new girl!

669
01:01:14,725 --> 01:01:18,039
Don't ask for her anymore!

670
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:22,326
I have a secret weapon.

671
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:31,380
Don't follow me!

672
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:38,395
Please, my lady!

673
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:42,046
Could you please draw a bath for the Crown Prince?

674
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:45,637
And add some medicinal herbs

675
01:01:45,637 --> 01:01:47,960
that will calm and soothe his anger.

676
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,203
Add lots of them.

677
01:01:50,203 --> 01:01:53,546
And let him soak.

678
01:01:55,225 --> 01:01:58,736
So that he may rest.

679
01:02:00,907 --> 01:02:05,185
I'm the only one allowed to draw His Highness's bath,

680
01:02:05,185 --> 01:02:07,610
but I've been dizzy since the morning.

681
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:11,170
I'm in no condition to draw his bath.

682
01:02:12,058 --> 01:02:16,447
My lady! Please!

683
01:02:16,447 --> 01:02:18,506
Okay. Fine.

684
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:55,920
Your Highness,

685
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,922
today, I am adding peony root to your bath.

686
01:03:00,922 --> 01:03:04,180
It's an herb used to soothe an angry heart.

687
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:10,829
So you're trying to tell me to calm down, aren't you?

688
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:15,701
Not at all, Your Highness.

689
01:03:15,701 --> 01:03:17,486
Are you all right?

690
01:03:17,486 --> 01:03:19,031
I'm all right.

691
01:03:19,031 --> 01:03:21,193
Nothing is all right.

692
01:03:21,193 --> 01:03:24,550
Doctor, take the court lady to the Royal Infirmary.

693
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,514
But Your Highness…

694
01:03:26,514 --> 01:03:28,082
Now!

695
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,070
Take care of her.

696
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,284
What will we do? Someone has to add the herbs.

697
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:43,650
Who will go in there?

698
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:48,749
Wol Hye!

699
01:03:51,003 --> 01:03:53,703
You're all here.

700
01:03:53,703 --> 01:03:56,200
What are you all doing here?

701
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:22,265
Your Highness, isn't that Sir Preceptor and Maiden Sung?

702
01:04:22,265 --> 01:04:25,033
What could they be doing in the deep of night?

703
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:29,194
Just the two of them…

704
01:05:30,204 --> 01:05:34,194
Your Highness, may we enter with the medicinal herbs?

705
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:37,191
The water is cold, so bring some hot water as well.

706
01:05:37,191 --> 01:05:39,022
Yes, Your Highness.

707
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:23,563
Finish up quickly and leave.

708
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,263
Yes, Your Highness.

709
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:30,314
You!

710
01:06:30,314 --> 01:06:32,126
What are you doing here?

711
01:06:32,126 --> 01:06:34,871
Your Highness, I will add the herbs.

712
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:37,780
Hold on. Turn around.

713
01:07:03,305 --> 01:07:05,049
I'm ready.

714
01:07:11,558 --> 01:07:14,547
I thought you were at the Queen's Palace.

715
01:07:14,547 --> 01:07:16,224
When did you get here?

716
01:07:16,224 --> 01:07:19,691
I came here on a quick errand.

717
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:21,312
Is that so?

718
01:07:30,036 --> 01:07:33,413
Your Highness, I will add the herbs.

719
01:07:34,281 --> 01:07:35,826
Okay.

720
01:07:55,622 --> 01:07:57,177
You…

721
01:07:58,698 --> 01:08:01,584
You were alone with Preceptor Hong last night, weren't you?

722
01:08:01,584 --> 01:08:04,930
- Pardon?
- Preceptor and you…

723
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,546
You were so intimate with him!

724
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:12,068
What if someone saw the two of you like that?

725
01:08:12,068 --> 01:08:14,113
- Did you see us?
- Yes, I did!

726
01:08:14,113 --> 01:08:18,321
Then you should have scolded him for harassing this palace maid!

727
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:20,881
Why did you just watch?

728
01:08:22,615 --> 01:08:27,249
Weren't you aware that Sir Preceptor constantly harasses the palace maids?

729
01:08:27,249 --> 01:08:30,649
That he makes them tell him secrets that they see in the palace?

730
01:08:32,894 --> 01:08:37,315
You never scolded Sir Preceptor, your right-hand man,

731
01:08:37,315 --> 01:08:39,705
but chose to lash out at this powerless palace maid instead.

732
01:08:39,705 --> 01:08:42,771
I don't care about the other palace maids.

733
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:45,463
The only one I care about…

734
01:08:54,068 --> 01:08:58,924
I only care about my people.

735
01:09:00,415 --> 01:09:05,349
Were you worried about me?

736
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,150
Yes.

737
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:15,526
I apologize for causing you concern.

738
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,507
That's fine.

739
01:09:21,443 --> 01:09:23,954
Let me pour the water.

740
01:09:31,122 --> 01:09:32,940
I'll do it.

01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,690
Right.

747
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:55,200
So you have a crush on someone, Deok Im?

748
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:59,670
The person I like is... His Highness the Crown Prince.

749
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:03,850
Your Highness, we must recruit the secretary of the royal medical office.

750
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,730
Something must have happened at the hall of government affairs.

751
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:07,530
Do you think it's dementia?

752
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,970
The King is a human, too.

753
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:12,320
Look for a good lady.

754
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,000
I hope you'll be the Crown Prince's concubine.

755
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,900
Grandfather, you and I are different.

756
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,860
I'm not going to love as the way you loved.
