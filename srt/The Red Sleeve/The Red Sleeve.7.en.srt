As Lady Gwon is not here today, I will wash your hair.

Wait! I just met eyes with His Highness!

I heard that he recently stayed up all night reading the Book of Odes.

That's incredible.

Of course.

Where did you get these chestnuts?

55

It has been a while since we all gathered.

56
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,790
Maybe we should roast some more yams?

I smell roasted chestnuts.

Watch it with your fan. You're sending all the smoke my way.

- Forget it.
- Pardon?

66
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:15,675
It falls on the master to forgive

68
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,841

Oh. I saw Sir Preceptor on my way here.

72
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:33,733
He is so dreamy!

73
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,450
You must really like him a lot.

74
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,650
Of course.

75
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:44,257
Wait a minute. Do you not think he's handsome?

76
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:46,813
He is. He's handsome, but…

77
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:51,149
I prefer warriors over scholars.

78
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,361
That girl knows what she's talking about.

79
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:55,702
Of course, a dandy like Sir Preceptor

80
00:09:55,702 --> 00:09:59,733
is far less attractive than a burly warrior like me.

81
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:05,847
I can even wave this book to help cool His Highness.

82
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:08,003
Apologies, Your Highness.

83
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:11,777
Kyung Hee, do you like warriors better, too?

84
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,697
Of course.

85
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:20,747
A true man should be strong enough to carry at least two sacks of rice.

86

Then he will be able to satisfy a lady.

87

Hey! Sir Preceptor is really good in the sack.

88
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,903
Yes, indeed. How would you know?

89
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:31,674
Then how would you know?

90
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,375
I know everything, unlike you.

91
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,947
How dare they engage in such vulgar discourse!

92
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:43,828
How dare they talk about the deed in front of His Highness!

93
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:46,708
I'll go fetch the disciplinary court lady!

Forget it.

96
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,331
Yes, Your Highness.

97
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:57,130
How about you, Deok Im?

98
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,670
Do you prefer scholars or warriors?

99
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:04,597
What's taking you so long? Hurry.

100
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,647
Well…

101
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:16,146
The one I adore is neither a scholar nor a warrior.

102
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:17,650
What?

103
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,188
Deok Im, do you really have a crush on someone?

104
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:24,519
Yes.

105
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,344
Who is he? Do we know him?

106
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:31,192
If he's neither a scholar nor a warrior, is he a…

107
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,766
A eunuch?

108
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:35,022
She can't love a eunuch.

109
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:39,203
This is a secret,

110
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,553
but I'm only telling you guys.

111
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:48,103
The man that I adore is…

112
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:53,557
His Highness the Crown Prince.

113
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,414
Really?

114
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:01,780
- You adore…
- The Crown Prince?

115
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:07,882
Yes, I adore His Highness the Crown Prince.

116
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:12,666
I had no idea you adored His Highness.

117
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,153
The Crown Prince's handmaid who is in love with her master.

118
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:19,205
It's so romantic.

119
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:23,552
Hey, you're not pulling our leg, are you?

120
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:26,233
You really adore the Crown Prince, right?

121
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,297
Did you hear that, Your Highness?

122
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:31,336
Maiden Sung just said she adores you—

123
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:36,380
Oh? Your Highness? Where are you?

124
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,613
Such bliss!

125
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,455
Thank you for all your help.

126
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,083
You may return to the Crown Prince's Palace now.

127
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,966
I will never forget the debt of gratitude—

128
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:30,407
Or you may stay here.

129
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,049
Why don't you serve me?

130
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:38,163
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

131
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:46,443
I'm sorry.

132
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,671
When you first came here,

133
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:55,165
my thoughts were fixated on how I could use you.

134
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:58,224
Now I no longer have such thoughts.

135
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,719
I only ask you to remain for your own sake.

136
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:08,657
Even though I don't have much power, as a servant of the Queen, you would be protected from harm.

137
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,890
But the Crown Prince

138
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,830
has many enemies.

139
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:21,728
The ability to capture people's hearts is a talent.

140
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,297
You have that talent.

141
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:29,053
However, will that talent benefit you in the Crown Prince's Palace?

142
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,927
No doubt it will be your downfall.

143
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:45,370
My lady, I'm back!

144
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,850
Are you back here permanently?

145
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,385
Yes.

146
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,983
Take this.

147
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:56,878
Let's go.

148
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,260
But my lady, the Crown Prince's Palace is that way.

149
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:24,020
What the heck. I wasn't even able to set foot in the Crown Prince's Palace.

150
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:27,540
Have I been dismissed?

151
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:45,952
"Eui" meaning righteous, "gu" meaning dog.
[Euigudang]

152
00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:49,336
The house of the righteous dog?

153
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:52,744
I wonder who wrote this.

154
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,860
It was my father.

155
00:15:58,362 --> 00:15:59,984
Your Highness.

156
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,580
This is my late father's handwriting.

157
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,442
He built this house for our dog with his own hands

158
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:22,032
and even made the sign.

159
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,091
It's because I begged him to do so.

160
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:32,135
Despite how the world remembers him,

161
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:36,420
there was a time when he was gentle and kind.

162
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,569
Why are you so surprised?

163
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:53,105
Because this is the first time you've mentioned the deceased crown prince.

164
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:55,592
I wanted to tell you about him.

165
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:02,370
There's something I wish to show you.

166
00:17:18,978 --> 00:17:23,516
These flowers blossomed not too long ago.

167
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:30,210
It's the first time since my father passed away.

168
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,132
What…

169
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,771
could it mean?

170
00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:45,708
The reason you called me here...

171
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:53,414
I wanted to show you these flowers.

172
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:24,649
It's almost been an hour.

173
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:29,110
Shouldn't we wake His Majesty up?

174
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,750
Then will you do it?

175
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:40,935
Lord Jeong, you should awaken His Majesty.

176
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:43,794
After all, you are his grandson.

177
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:45,747
But…

178
00:18:45,747 --> 00:18:50,072
I am of humble origins

179
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:53,116
and would not dare to lay a finger on his royal person.

180
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:57,532
Then…

181
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,214
since there are no urgent matters today,

182
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:04,110
let us wait a little longer.

183
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,800
Yes.

184
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,530
Hey…

185
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,242
Your Majesty.

186
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,877
Please get up.

187
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,727
Who is it?

188
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,170
Oh, dear...

189
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,832
What time is it?

190
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,872
It is misi, Your Majesty.
(T/N: misi, or sheep hours - 1:00-3:00 pm; when sheep usually eats grass in the fields)

191
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:45,366
We have mountains of work to do.

192
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:49,178
Why didn't anyone wake me up?

193
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,528
Lords.

194
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:57,600
You must have missed lunch.

195
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:04,852
Let's see.

196
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:18,580
This is very cool and refreshing.

197
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:29,898
I'll have to send some ice to the public health center.

198
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:34,017
I'll also send some to the prison as well.

199
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:38,603
How much ice is left in the ice house?

200
00:20:41,135 --> 00:20:47,430
Your Majesty, you commanded that all the ice be taken from the ice house

201
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,380
ten days ago.

202
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:56,552
What? Ten…

203
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:57,739
As I remember,

204
00:20:57,786 --> 00:21:02,214
we already sent ice to the public health center and prison as per your command.

205
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:06,533
Really? I see.

206
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:15,719
Now I remember. That's what happened.

207
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:20,977
My mind must be cloudy because I just awoke from slumber.

208
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:27,550
Lords, go ahead and eat.

209
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:33,110
I'm going to look over some petitions.

210
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:59,200
Your Highness, we must recruit the royal doctor.

211
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,195
I do not wish to involve him in our affairs.

212
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:07,808
Now, who has been keeping an eye on royal relatives—

213
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:10,953
Please reconsider, Your Highness!

214
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:14,529
I beg of you.

215
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,558
His Highness has already reached his decision.

216
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:19,719
I beseech you, Your Highness.

217
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,608
I already told you no.

218
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:30,378
Your Highness, there must be a reason for Sir Preceptor's entreaties.

219
00:22:33,212 --> 00:22:35,853
Something must have happened at the hall of government affairs.

220
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:44,503
I still deny the request no matter what the reason may be.

221
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:46,805
Mention it no further.

222
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:56,173
Buy some taffy!

223
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:59,172
Delicious pumpkin taffy is here!

224
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:02,827
I waited three months to take a day off on the market day,

225
00:23:02,827 --> 00:23:06,422
but you seem to get days off whenever you want.

226
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:09,762
I have someone powerful watching out for me.

227
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:13,410
- I'm actually the Head Court Lady's niece.
- What?

228
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,861
Don't tell anyone.

229
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,903
Why don't you tell anyone?

230
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:19,477
People would be so much nicer to you.

231
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:24,662
I'm not too proud of it, and they're bound to find out someday.

232
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:27,799
Let's get some taffy. I'll buy you some.

233
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,832
Buy some taffy! It's pumpkin taffy!

234
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:34,688
- Welcome, ladies.
- Hello.

235
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:36,775
- How much is it?
- It's two pun.
(T/N: pun - smallest denomination of money at the time)

236
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:38,163
Choose one.

237
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:42,928
- There you go.
- Thank you.

238
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:49,432
You know, that man has been watching us this whole time.

239
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:53,053
It's probably because you're so pretty.

240
00:23:59,596 --> 00:24:02,428
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

241
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:06,210
You can look around slowly.

242
00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:11,156
- Ma'am! One bottle over here.
- Okay.

243
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:17,524
- Deok Im, go ahead and return to the palace.
- Why?

244
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:21,099
I have somewhere to go. I'll see you back at the palace.

245
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:28,085
I can't believe she just left me!

246
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:51,847
Who are you?

247
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:56,010
Do you feign innocence after poisoning my brother?

248
00:25:00,435 --> 00:25:05,746
Was your brother a royal guardsman for the Crown Prince?

249
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:11,073
At least you do not feign complete ignorance.

250
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:14,786
I will find out who you are working for.

251
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:16,521
Grab her!

252
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:42,079
Forgive me.

253
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,914
You're working with her, aren't you? You were with her!

254
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:17,321
Who are you?

255
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:20,883
You are all dead! I saw it!

256
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,387
I'll take you to the police!

257
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:27,919
Let go! Let go of me!

258
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:33,591
Do you know this man?

259
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:39,205
What shall I do with him?

260
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:44,024
Please let me live! I won't tell a soul what I saw!

261
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:46,646
Please, spare my life!

262
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,271
I'll go far away!

263
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,348
He must be crazy. Please let him go.

264
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:12,260
Are you…

265
00:27:22,096 --> 00:27:24,472
I don't care if I die.

266
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:29,642
But please, spare the life of my sister!

267
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:00,144
That day…

268
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:06,450
we went to Princess Hyebin…

269
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,699
It was a good idea, right?

270
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,739
I'm so sorry…

271
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:22,449
that I'm late.

272
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:26,886
Brother!

273
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:54,100
Your Highness, it is I, Court Lady Seo.

274
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,888
Enter.

275
00:29:10,386 --> 00:29:14,024
Isn't it Maiden Sung's turn to serve me?

276
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:16,097
So why are you here?

277
00:29:16,097 --> 00:29:20,041
Deok Im left the palace because it's her day off, Your Highness.

278
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:23,066
Has she not returned yet?

279
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,642
It will soon be the curfew.

280
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:28,785
Well... She actually returned,

281
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:32,402
but she was feeling ill and couldn't serve you.

282
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:34,604
Forgive her, Your Highness.

283
00:29:34,604 --> 00:29:39,277
These young girls... They roam the market so busily on their days off.

284
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,614
However, Your Highness, Deok Im isn't the only one…

285
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,766
- Court Lady Seo.
- Yes, Your Highness.

286
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:49,211
Is Maiden Sung very ill?

287
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:51,605
Pardon?

288
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:57,369
No, she is just a little fatigued,

289
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:59,833
but she's fine, Your Highness.

290
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,108
You have a free nature.

291
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:17,655
You should be able to roam the world freely.

292
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:20,457
It is sad that you must live caged in the palace.

293
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:22,769
Don't say that, Brother.

294
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:25,119
I like being a palace maid.

295
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,871
Even though you can never get married?

296
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:32,158
What's so great about getting married and living an ordinary life?

297
00:30:32,158 --> 00:30:35,102
I have so many things.

298
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,547
There's Court Lady Seo who is like a mother to me,

299
00:30:37,547 --> 00:30:40,077
and my friends, who are like family.

300
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:42,580
Also, I am really good at my job.

301
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,758
I'm probably the most talented of the attendant handmaids.

302
00:30:46,723 --> 00:30:49,671
I'm happy enough

303
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:53,058
so you just take good care of yourself.

304
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:55,510
Make sure to pass the exam for military officials

305
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,444
and don't worry about money.

306
00:30:57,444 --> 00:31:00,999
Your competent sister has got your back.

307
00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:09,030
Father was killed because he was a royal guardsman.

308
00:31:09,524 --> 00:31:13,732
He was branded a traitor on the day

309
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:16,750
the late Crown Prince died.

310
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:20,610
That could be the consequence of working for the government.

311
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:27,414
Would you still like me to become a military official?

312
00:31:27,414 --> 00:31:28,925
Then…

313
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:34,824
do you want to live in hiding without any dreams

314
00:31:34,824 --> 00:31:37,922
or any accomplishments until you die?

315
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:43,881
You told me so yourself

316
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:46,880
that you wanted to become Joseon's greatest soldier.

317
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,711
Make sure to realize that dream.

318
00:32:26,586 --> 00:32:28,890
You're here, Your Highness.

319
00:32:39,853 --> 00:32:41,696
Has something fortuitous happened?

320
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,061
Pardon?

321
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,832
It's just that you seem happy.

322
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:51,859
No, Your Highness. It's just…

323
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:54,645
because the weather is so beautiful.

324
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:59,056
- I heard that you were ill yesterday.
- Pardon?

325
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,795
Court Lady Seo told me so.

326
00:33:01,795 --> 00:33:06,190
She came in your stead because you were too sick to serve me.

327
00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:19,610
Apologies, Your Highness. I caught a cold yesterday.

328
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:30,334
It would be a travesty if I gave it to Your Highness, so I'll take my leave.

329
00:33:57,863 --> 00:33:59,963
You don't have a fever.

330
00:34:45,902 --> 00:34:48,571
- Sung Deok Im.
- Yes, my lady?

331
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:51,911
The Head Court Lady wants to see you.

332
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:54,696
- Pardon?
- Come with me.

333
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:01,127
I heard you denied the request of the lord's wife to transcribe her book.

334
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:03,385
Yes, My Lady.

335
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:07,671
I recommended you for the job.

336
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,995
I apologize, My Lady.

337
00:35:09,995 --> 00:35:14,043
As a royal handmaid, I am too busy to do the transcription.

338
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:17,605
Is that all?

339
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:19,154
Yes.

340
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:25,778
I thought you were trying to distance yourself from me.

341
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:33,412
I heard that you are the Crown Prince's favorite.

342
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:34,574
That is not true.

343
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:37,362
What do you think of His Highness?

344
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:44,380
While he may be difficult at times, I feel that he will make a fine ruler.

345
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,896
What do you think of him as a man?

346
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:50,449
I'm curious how you feel.

347
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:57,428
But my lady, the feelings of a palace maid are of no consequence.

348
00:35:57,428 --> 00:36:01,007
That is what those on the outside think.

349
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:04,224
They don't know that we court ladies have feelings and determination

350
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:09,729
and even goals that we would sacrifice our lives to achieve.

351
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:14,058
Then what is your goal, my lady?

352
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:18,312
It is to protect the 700 court ladies that are under my care.

353
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:21,276
I am always concerned and anguished

354
00:36:21,276 --> 00:36:26,462
that I may be too weak and insignificant to protect them.

355
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:34,009
I wish to make you the Crown Prince's concubine.

356
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:38,814
Not only for you but for all the court ladies.

357
00:36:38,814 --> 00:36:43,329
If one of our own becomes His Highness's woman and speaks for us,

358
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:45,992
I would feel reassured.

359
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:50,215
I remember when I first saw you.

360
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:54,246
I took a liking to you from the beginning.

361
00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:59,307
Then would I be correct to think that

362
00:36:59,307 --> 00:37:02,781
it was no coincidence I was assigned to the library of the Crown Prince's Palace as an apprentice maid?

363
00:37:02,781 --> 00:37:05,635
I assigned you to the library on purpose.

364
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:09,293
Also, did you make me transcribe

365
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:13,490
the books that His Highness was studying so that I could learn them as well?

366
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,624
A concubine must have learning and etiquette

367
00:37:16,624 --> 00:37:19,943
in order to become the king's companion.

368
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,347
My lady!

369
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,751
I have no intention of becoming a concubine.

370
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:46,746
I wish to continue to live as a court lady.

371
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:55,473
You did nothing wrong.

372
00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:03,278
I will not force it on you if that is how you feel.

373
00:38:03,278 --> 00:38:06,786
However, people are prone to changing their minds.

374
00:38:09,258 --> 00:38:14,049
Such an ornament is too precious to adorn the dress of a handmaiden.

375
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:17,793
However, if you were the royal concubine…

376
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:21,356
it would be perfect.

377
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:34,338
If something is about to appear,

378
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:38,110
send it away before it appears,

379
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,628
nip it in the bud

380
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:49,754
before it turns your entire life upside down.

381
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:20,143
Your Highness, this is a precious tangerine that they grew in the royal greenhouse.

382
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:23,908
It was offered on His Majesty's table before he bestowed it upon you.

383
00:39:23,908 --> 00:39:26,788
Send a messenger to His Majesty and convey my gratitude.

384
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:28,688
Yes, Your Highness.

385
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:40,329
Will you not eat it?

386
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:43,196
It would be different if it were sent from Jeju Island,

387
00:39:43,196 --> 00:39:46,259
but this single tangerine was all the royal greenhouse could produce.

388
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,109
I do not wish to become fond of the taste.

389
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:52,568
Then what will you do, Your Highness?

390
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:58,565
You can share it amongst the court ladies.

391
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:07,892
But Your Highness, that would cause a fight.

392
00:40:07,892 --> 00:40:12,513
Are you aware of how much maids love tangerines?

393
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:16,410
The younger palace maids go crazy for them.

394
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:20,407
It could cause quite a commotion amongst them.

395
00:41:00,868 --> 00:41:03,265
I ate it.

396
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:06,529
I didn't want to cause a fight amongst the maids.

397
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,473
I know the fruit is a rare treat,

398
00:41:11,473 --> 00:41:14,645
but did you also eat the peel?

399
00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:18,480
It was delicious.

400
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,779
Oh! I see…

401
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:29,110
You could fall if ill if you study too hard.

402
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,132
Please take a break.

403
00:41:33,226 --> 00:41:36,023
You're being quite kind to me,

404
00:41:36,023 --> 00:41:38,092
even expressing concern.

405
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,612
It is something that I ought to do.

406
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:43,787
It is my duty, after all.

407
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,438
You can be frank

408
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:55,031
and tell me that you worry for me.

409
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:58,023
Yes, I do worry for you.

410
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:04,551
Your Highness should take a break and engage in something you enjoy.

411
00:42:07,384 --> 00:42:10,529
Please take care of yourself once in a while, Your Highness.

412
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:24,293
Right now, I am engaged in something I enjoy.

413
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:26,461
I see.

414
00:42:29,898 --> 00:42:32,726
Here in my favorite place

415
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:37,484
with the person I adore.

416
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:12,546
Take it.

417
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,593
But this is a precious tangerine.

418
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:29,306
Did you bring it here to give it to me?

419
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:33,860
I simply had one left.

420
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:38,578
The inevitable moment has arrived.

421
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:42,465
It's the moment that I wished would never come.

422
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:47,834
The man in front of me adores me,

423
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:52,921
this man who will someday rule the kingdom.

424
00:43:57,756 --> 00:44:00,857
This is a precious fruit in which only His Majesty partakes.

425
00:44:00,857 --> 00:44:04,354
I would not dare receive it. Please take it back, Your Highness.

426
00:44:07,403 --> 00:44:10,757
I know it's precious,

427
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:14,504
but that's no reason to turn down a mere fruit.

428
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:16,524
Apologies, Your Highness.

429
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:27,598
Just take it and be happy! That's all you need to do!

430
00:44:28,636 --> 00:44:31,810
It's too precious for this humble servant!

431
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,700
That is why I decline!

432
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,490
I never wanted it in the first place!

433
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:40,653
Am I not allowed to decline because I am a lowly palace maid?

434
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:48,828
Please allow this humble servant

435
00:44:48,828 --> 00:44:50,804
to decline.

436
00:45:01,056 --> 00:45:03,266
Are we truly

437
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:10,387
talking about the tangerine?

438
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,713
- Head guardsman.
- Yes, Your Highness?

439
00:46:14,095 --> 00:46:16,417
I wish to ask you something.

440
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,935
Yes, Your Highness.

441
00:46:20,935 --> 00:46:25,121
A little while ago, we eavesdropped on

442
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:27,159
some palace maids, though it was not our intention to do so.

443
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:31,620
Do you remember?

444
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:33,884
Yes, Your Highness.

445
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:37,197
I am disturbed

446
00:46:40,603 --> 00:46:43,826
by what Maiden Sung said at the time.

447
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:49,773
I'm sure she said that…

448
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:55,610
Oh! You mean she said that she adored you, Your Highness?

449
00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:00,374
So you heard it, too?

450
00:47:00,374 --> 00:47:02,196
Yes, Your Highness.

451
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,734
So I wasn't mistaken.

452
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:10,024
I was worried that Your Highness

453
00:47:10,024 --> 00:47:13,178
might have misunderstood the situation.

454
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,217
Misunderstood?

455
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:21,867
The conversation continued after you left.

456
00:47:21,867 --> 00:47:24,845
Hey, you're not pulling our leg, are you?

457
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,184
You really adore the Crown Prince, right?

458
00:47:27,184 --> 00:47:30,322
Yes? Also…

459
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,638
this is a really big secret…

460
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:36,845
I'm not the only one who adores His Highness.

461
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:38,021
What?

462
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,196
She adores him, too.

463
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:40,821
What?

464
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:45,587
- Not true! I don't adore His Highness!
- Really?

465
00:47:45,587 --> 00:47:47,684
What are you talking about, Deok Im?

466
00:47:47,684 --> 00:47:50,173
I never adored the Crown Prince.

467
00:47:50,173 --> 00:47:54,776
All of the maids of the Crown Prince's Palace must adore him.

468
00:47:54,776 --> 00:47:58,593
You work at the Crown Prince's Palace, so why don't you adore him?

469
00:47:58,593 --> 00:48:01,214
For heaven's sake!

470
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,235
When His Highness ascends the throne,

471
00:48:07,235 --> 00:48:12,087
we will all have to adore him.

472
00:48:12,087 --> 00:48:15,396
It is the job of all subjects to adore their king.

473
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:21,107
Sung Deok Im, quit playing with us!

474
00:48:21,871 --> 00:48:25,485
I thought you really had a crush on His Highness the Crown Prince.

475
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:30,423
So Maiden Sung, as a loyal subject

476
00:48:30,423 --> 00:48:32,951
and without any sentimental feelings,

477
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,915
but with pure loyalty only,

478
00:48:35,915 --> 00:48:40,224
adores Your Highness who will later become her king.

479
00:48:40,224 --> 00:48:43,646
I know how Your Highness hates it when palace maids

480
00:48:43,646 --> 00:48:48,123
pretend to adore you just so that they can become your concubine.

481
00:48:48,123 --> 00:48:54,536
However, Maiden Sung would never engage in such tomfoolery.

482
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:58,348
I was so taken by her loyalty

483
00:48:58,348 --> 00:49:03,673
that if I could, I would make her a member of us guardsmen.

484
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:11,403
What a loyal woman!

485
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:27,698
You must be so happy, Your Highness.

486
00:49:41,382 --> 00:49:43,949
Your Highness, where are you going?

487
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:45,412
Your Highness!

488
00:49:46,232 --> 00:49:47,718
Your Highness!

489
00:49:50,314 --> 00:49:52,233
I'm scared.

490
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,635
I feel chills running down my spine.

491
00:49:56,378 --> 00:49:58,321
I wonder why.

492
00:50:05,531 --> 00:50:08,673
Bulls-eye!

493
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:24,596
Bull… bulls-eye again!

494
00:50:41,077 --> 00:50:44,713
Your Highness, it went clean through!

495
00:50:53,782 --> 00:50:57,673
You suspect it, but you are not sure?

496
00:50:57,673 --> 00:51:01,110
His Majesty is over eighty.

497
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,543
We cannot expect him to be as vigorous as before,

498
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:08,217
but he's acting a little strange.

499
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,996
Then…

500
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:16,699
could he be afflicted with dementia?

501
00:51:17,637 --> 00:51:23,501
Well, his mind seems to be too clear to think that.

502
00:51:24,357 --> 00:51:27,134
I really don't know.

503
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:40,720
Your Majesty, I have brought a novel to read to you before slumber.

504
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,790
It's so bitter.

505
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,898
Enter.

506
00:51:57,446 --> 00:52:00,823
Oh? What are you doing here?

507
00:52:00,823 --> 00:52:05,560
Court Lady Kim has come down with a cold and is unavailable to read.

508
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,498
You could have sent a handmaid.

509
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:13,774
The book is just an excuse.

510
00:52:13,774 --> 00:52:16,985
I wished to see His Majesty's royal countenance.

511
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:22,046
Sit down.

512
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,754
I apologize

513
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:41,673
that I have been so unavailable.

514
00:52:41,673 --> 00:52:46,645
I should have called you here more often and looked after you.

515
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:52,860
You are one of this old man's

516
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:57,743
oldest companions.

517
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:01,688
I am honored, Your Majesty.

518
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:05,743
Now, where should I start reading?

519
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:09,853
Well… that's…

520
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:12,259
That's…

521
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,071
Do you not remember, Your Majesty?

522
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:23,636
Of course, I remember.

523
00:53:23,636 --> 00:53:28,954
Do you know how angry I was yesterday because of that book?

524
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:31,631
Why were you so angry?

525
00:53:31,631 --> 00:53:34,420
It is not for you to know.

526
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:38,432
The mere thought of it fills me with fury.

527
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:44,142
I have not seen you in a long time and do not wish to be angry.

528
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:49,234
Then what shall I do with this book?

529
00:53:49,234 --> 00:53:54,704
I don't want to even see it so get rid of it as you see fit.

530
00:53:55,852 --> 00:53:57,907
Yes, Your Majesty.

531
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,204
My lady!

532
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:16,303
These books are useless so burn them all.

[Tale of the Gwak and Jang Families]

534
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,528
- Please!
- What's going on?

535
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:44,320
- Deok Im!
- A royal order was issued to burn them all.

536
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,276
- A royal order?
- That's right!

537
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,217
Deok Im…

538
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,321
Young Hee, we can't disobey a royal order.

539
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:58,744
No! I can't let these books get burned.

540
00:54:58,744 --> 00:55:01,437
They are priceless to me.

541
00:55:01,437 --> 00:55:03,790
I, a lowly girl like me,

542
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:09,026
transcribed these books with two princesses for the King.

543
00:55:09,026 --> 00:55:12,067
Deok Im, please try to understand

544
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:15,220
how dear these books are to me.

545
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,876
Even so, Young Hee, we have no way to protect them.

546

Sir Preceptor!

548
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,690
[Tale of Gwak and Jang Families]

549
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:41,020
These are good books. Too good to burn.

550
00:55:42,868 --> 00:55:45,638
Don't you agree, Maiden Jung?

551
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:50,284
Pardon? Yes, I do agree.

552
00:55:50,284 --> 00:55:55,588
If they are to be burned anyway, wouldn't it be better to give them to someone that wants them?

553
00:55:58,419 --> 00:56:02,204
Please, Maiden Jung.

554
00:56:02,204 --> 00:56:06,520
Please let her have these books.

555
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,462
Yes. For you, anything.

556
00:56:11,462 --> 00:56:13,412
Thank you.

557
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:17,058
You'd better hide them.

558
00:56:17,884 --> 00:56:20,298
Thank you!

559
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:23,299
Thank you, Sir Preceptor.

560
00:56:25,191 --> 00:56:28,588
Take care, Maiden Jung.

561
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:30,259
Bye.

562
00:56:39,985 --> 00:56:41,768
Why the sour expression?

563
00:56:41,768 --> 00:56:46,485
Shouldn't you be happy that I helped your friend?

564
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:50,506
Those books belong to His Majesty,

565
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:53,670
but you gave them to a maid without permission.

566
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:55,890
Do you not think that could cause a problem?

567
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,798
Then you should have stopped me.

568
00:56:59,725 --> 00:57:02,017
That was cowardly.

569
00:57:04,017 --> 00:57:06,753
There's no need to overthink it.

570
00:57:06,753 --> 00:57:08,976
It would be better for

571
00:57:08,976 --> 00:57:12,657
those books to bring someone joy than getting incinerated.

572
00:57:14,762 --> 00:57:18,059
There's no need to thank me.

573
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:23,298
Your happy expression is payment enough.

574
00:57:23,298 --> 00:57:25,001
I doubt that.

575
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:27,517
You made me owe you a debt.

576
00:57:27,517 --> 00:57:30,563
If you think that, then we'll call it a debt.

577
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,874
Now, would you like to repay me?

578
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:52,603
My! Are we so close that

579
00:57:53,328 --> 00:57:56,254
now we exchange tokens of love?

580
00:57:59,196 --> 00:58:01,604
I am repaying my debt for the kindness

581
00:58:01,649 --> 00:58:04,485
you showed a dear friend.

582
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:08,940
Please give the incense pouch to your sister.

583
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,618
Tell her to keep it as a memento of the palace.

584
00:58:14,302 --> 00:58:19,876
I still vividly remember how happy your sister was that day.

585
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:27,282
With this, I owe you no more.

586
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:00,126
Your Majesty, it gets cold when the sun goes down.

587
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:01,716
We should go back.

588
00:59:01,716 --> 00:59:04,868
Give me some time.

589
00:59:04,868 --> 00:59:07,018
There's something I need to tell you.

590
00:59:07,018 --> 00:59:09,140
You could tell me at your court.

591
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:14,563
There are too many eyes and ears there.

592
00:59:25,555 --> 00:59:29,063
Cast the line farther.

593
00:59:37,048 --> 00:59:39,149
Good.

594
00:59:42,934 --> 00:59:45,338
San.

595
00:59:45,338 --> 00:59:50,782
Your grandpa is very old now.

596
00:59:50,782 --> 00:59:55,696
I'm no longer strong.

597
00:59:56,610 --> 01:00:01,020
Long ago, I made a promise to someone.

598
01:00:02,392 --> 01:00:04,892
I wish to tell you

599
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,524
before I die.

600
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:11,424
Then, I would rather not hear it ever.

601
01:00:11,424 --> 01:00:13,721
All I wish for is

602
01:00:13,721 --> 01:00:16,566
His Majesty's health and wellness.

603
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:22,620
I see that you've learned to lie.

604
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,657
I am not lying, Your Majesty.

605
01:00:24,657 --> 01:00:26,665
All right.

606
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:30,282
Then let's talk about something else today.

607
01:00:32,243 --> 01:00:36,696
The man who will ascend the throne

608
01:00:36,696 --> 01:00:40,198
needs someone with whom he can share

609
01:00:40,198 --> 01:00:42,415
his innermost thoughts.

610
01:00:42,415 --> 01:00:45,454
Isn't that why His Majesty sent me Hong Deok Ro as a companion?

611
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:47,535
No.

612
01:00:47,535 --> 01:00:53,370
He is someone who will become your subject.

613
01:00:54,056 --> 01:00:56,026
A subject

614
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,031
can go against the king

615
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,485
for his beliefs and faction.

616
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:08,499
It cannot be a subject.

617
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:11,024
It must be a woman.

618
01:01:12,012 --> 01:01:16,599
A woman who will always stay by your side.

619
01:01:18,198 --> 01:01:21,563
A king is also a man.

620
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:25,855
He needs a woman

621
01:01:25,855 --> 01:01:31,385
he can truly love and cherish.

622
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:34,196
Or else,

623
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:37,274
you won't bear the pressure.

624
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,118
When you ascend the throne,

625
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:44,954
find a good lady

626
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:50,784
just as this old grandpa found your grandmother.

627
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,532
Find a good woman.

628
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:05,345
Your Highness, it is time for your evening lesson.

629
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:12,277
You may go now.

630
01:02:12,277 --> 01:02:14,899
Yes, Your Majesty.

631
01:02:38,346 --> 01:02:41,129
What are a king's affections?

632
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,832
Is it to kill the child of his love

633
01:02:45,832 --> 01:02:50,187
so that woman lives

634
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:53,251
as a ghost of her former self?

635
01:02:55,267 --> 01:03:00,061
I'm different from you, Grandfather.

636
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:03,413
I am going to protect the one I love no matter what.

637
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:06,963
I am never going to love

638
01:03:06,963 --> 01:03:09,345
the way you loved.

639
01:03:14,095 --> 01:03:19,112
I don't care if you have no affections for me.

640
01:03:19,756 --> 01:03:22,165
You're still a palace maid,

641
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:26,506
and you'll always remain in the same place.

642
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:49,771
Did you come here to find me?

643
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:56,243
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

644
01:05:00,993 --> 01:05:03,188
The eunuch and court ladies are looking for you.

645
01:05:03,188 --> 01:05:06,259
I asked if you came here to find me.

646
01:05:06,259 --> 01:05:10,915
No, Your Highness. I am here on an errand.

647
01:05:10,915 --> 01:05:14,424
I did not know you were here.

648
01:05:20,022 --> 01:05:23,423
What are you thinking, Your Highness?

649
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:27,520
I was thinking of you.

650
01:05:46,034 --> 01:05:48,685
I thought that I knew you.

651
01:05:50,556 --> 01:05:55,251
But for the first time ever,

652
01:05:55,251 --> 01:06:01,088
it occurred to me that I might not know you at all.

653
01:06:02,499 --> 01:06:04,334
Tell me.

654
01:06:05,634 --> 01:06:07,472
Do you belong to me?

655
01:06:07,472 --> 01:06:09,526
Of course, Your Highness.

656
01:06:09,526 --> 01:06:12,406
I have taken an oath to serve and protect you forever.

657
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:15,938
Then does your everything belong to me?

658
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:19,009
Your thoughts,

659
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:21,365
your will

660
01:06:21,365 --> 01:06:24,884
and your heart, do they belong to me?

661
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,857
Answer me!

662
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,735
That isn't so, Your Highness.

663
01:06:31,735 --> 01:06:34,726
Even a palace maid has her own will and heart

664
01:06:34,726 --> 01:06:37,765
even though they may seem trivial to others.

665
01:06:38,821 --> 01:06:40,315
Even though I belong to you,

666
01:06:40,315 --> 01:06:43,674
my everything does not

667
01:06:43,674 --> 01:06:46,001
belong to you.

668
01:06:50,431 --> 01:06:52,681
What nonsense.

669
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:38,230
♫ The quiet warmth fills this place with warmth ♫

670
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:45,420
♫ As if it was decided, everything flows side by side ♫

671

[The Red Sleeve]

673
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:56,440
Do not ever trust the King.

674
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,020
We can only trust ourselves.

675
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:02,500
Royal doctors have prescribed an herb medicine for dementia.

676
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,320
So His Majesty has dementia.

677
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,160
What on earth is going on?

678
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,640
This book is Yeo Beom: A story of ladies. This belongs to the late Yeongbin.

679
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,340
His Majesty, who gave me that book,

680
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,930
is the witness.

681
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:19,270
What happens if His Majesty doesn't recall what happened in the past?

682
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:24,760
Those who steal royal possessions are sentenced to death.
