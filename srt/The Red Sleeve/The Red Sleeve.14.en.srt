[This work is based on historical events,]

[but all depiction of details of their lives and motives are fictional.]

3
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:44,480
To wait for His Majesty

4
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,293
all night long is the duty

5
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:51,407
of his handmaid.

6
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,616
Clear your mind of useless thoughts.

7
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,212
Am I dreaming?

8
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:37,985
I would know if I could pinch him...

9
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:43,029
But I couldn't pinch His Majesty even in my dreams.

10
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:59,120
What are you doing here, Your Majesty?

11
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:02,118
You shouldn't be here.

12
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:05,891
What is good about being a king

13
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:11,174
is that no one can stop me from doing what I want.

14
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:15,112
Wherever I go

15
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,797
or whomever I meet,

16
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:20,404
no one can dare to stop me.

17
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:28,026
Is there something wrong?

18
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:32,304
You seem unhappy.

19
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:35,411
Yes.

20
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:37,780
I am unhappy

21
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,716
because of you.

22
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:45,923
You have a way of confounding my heart.

23
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:50,727
Even in the midst of governing,

24
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:53,518
thoughts of you will creep into my head.

25
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:58,755
I have been distracted all day because of you.

26
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:04,109
Whenever I get reminded of you taking the night shift today,

27
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:07,513
my heart would feel heavy.

28
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:14,523
But it seems my concern was for naught

29
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:19,427
as you have been sleeping here while drooling.

30
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:27,323
You are either very conniving or very dull.

31
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:29,913
You get on my nerves.

32
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:33,537
You are insolent.

33
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,513
Just look at you,

34
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:40,005
glaring at me with those big round eyes.

35
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:43,715
Do you

36
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:46,127
know how much…

37
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:59,419
Go back to your quarters and rest if you are tired.

38
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:28,717
Instead of the Concubine Wonbin's quarters, His Majesty went to the royal observatory last night.

39
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:31,782
He was furious at the officials there.

40
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:36,510
So it's true that more than half of the officials there were stripped of their positions?

41
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,615
Yes. They were bribed and gave a false date for His Majesty's first night with the Concubine.

42
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,031
The person behind the ploy…

43
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,300
Fine.

44
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,599
We won't badmouth Lord Chief Secretary Hong, so stop crying.

45
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:58,373
Lord Hong is quite a character.

46
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:01,881
He escaped unscathed the brunt of His Majesty's fury.

47
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,890
[Episode 14]
This is none of your business, Captain.

48
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,390
This is none of your business, Captain.

49
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:11,198
I felt compelled to talk to you.

50
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:13,887
You crossed the line this time

51
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,587
bribing the officials at the royal observatory.

52
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,296
Just because His Majesty did not punish you

53
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:24,946
does not mean that he is not angry at you.

54
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:33,513
I am sure that His Majesty is angry at me.

55
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:37,408
However, he has always forgiven me for my infractions,

56
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:41,616
and it will be no different this time.

57
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,491
I am certain that I have

58
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:47,541
His Majesty's absolute favor.

59
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:57,413
In any case,

60
00:05:57,413 --> 00:06:00,486
I am concerned for you.

61
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,322
Good day.

62
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,424
Captain.

63
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:16,135
Are you aware

64
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:20,830
of the three things that His Majesty

65
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,719
wishes to accomplish?

66
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:26,590
My memory may be inferior,

67
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,316
but I still retain things that I have heard multiple times.

68
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:34,332
Will you tell me what they are?

69
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:40,611
Are you testing me?

70
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,923
The first is

71
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:50,691
waterworks.

72
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,308
The second…

73
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,985
As soon as we finish the waterworks,

74
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,194
I wish to proceed to the next plan.

75
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:05,117
Is it for the purpose of national defense to build a fortress?

76
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:08,088
Of course, that is one reason.

77
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:11,199
But there is also another reason.

78
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,213
I wish to give the people a new experience.

79
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:21,104
I want them to have the experience of being paid for their labor.

80
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,193
Until now, they have always been

81
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:31,381
forced into labor whenever a fortress was built.

82
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:35,083
They had to give up their livelihoods as they worked.

83
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:41,918
While it was the norm that the people were used to, it is not just.

84
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:47,626
No one will change this injustice if I don't do it.

85
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:52,197
I have already decided on the name of the fortress.

86
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,506
Hwaseong Fortress.
(T/N: A historical landmark in Suwon)

87
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:58,206
Hwaseong Fortress.

88
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:13,113
His Majesty

89
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:15,700
did not tell me of matters

90
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,539
that he told all the others.

91
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,708
Why?

92
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:24,496
How come?

93
00:08:26,494 --> 00:08:31,913
Your Highness, Maiden Sung from the King's Palace has arrived.

94
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,299
Miss Maiden!

95
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,188
Maiden Sung.

96
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:41,313
Come near.

97
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,316
Your Highness.

98
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:56,098
I asked Court Lady Kwon

99
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:58,804
to arrange an audience with you.

100
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,018
Maiden Sung,

101
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,596
is my brother all right?

102
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:08,609
His Majesty will

103
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:11,295
still hold him in high regard, right?

104
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:13,821
Of course, Your Highness.

105
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:17,706
I'm relieved.

106
00:09:18,513 --> 00:09:21,424
Everyone tells me so,

107
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:24,345
but I can't help but worry.

108
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,195
So I wanted to ask someone I could trust.

109
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,892
Why are you worried about Lord Hong?

110
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:34,118
Now that His Majesty

111
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:38,196
knows what kind of person I am…

112
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:44,415
He knows that I am a useless fool.

113
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,791
I am worried

114
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,132
that he will hate my brother

115
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,598
because of me.

116
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:57,586
Why would you harbor such a baseless concern?

117
00:09:57,586 --> 00:10:00,299
I wish to help Brother,

118
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,232
if only once in my life.

119
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:06,329
But I'm

120
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:09,824
so useless…

121
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,104
Did you call me, Your Majesty?

122
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:03,421
I saw you on my way here.

123
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:05,811
You were exiting Concubine Wonbin's Palace.

124
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:06,998
Yes.

125
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:09,719
Why were you there?

126
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,941
Did Concubine Wonbin call you?

127
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:16,052
Did she call you on purpose?

128
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:19,669
- Or was it Lord Hong—
- It is not what you are thinking.

129
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:24,015
I merely am acquainted with Concubine Wonbin from before.

130
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:28,443
She summoned me because she was glad to see a familiar face.

131
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:30,414
Is this true?

132
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:34,807
Your Majesty, Concubine Wonbin is still a little girl.

133
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:40,010
In my eyes, she is innocent.

134
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,600
And she is having difficulty adjusting to life in the palace.

135
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,723
She suffers from depression,

136
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:50,121
and it is not a matter to be taken lightly.

137
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:55,705
Since depression is an illness of the heart, she needs someone that she can depend on.

138
00:11:55,705 --> 00:12:00,984
Since you are her man, you must be the one that she depends on.

139
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:07,239
- If you visit her more often and show her kindness—
- Why should I

140
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:13,217
hear such advice from you?

141
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:18,139
Do you wish me to be kind to her?

142
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,928
She's only a little girl?

143
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:26,858
Nonsense.

144
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:29,628
What does age matter?

145
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:32,509
She is my royal concubine.

146
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,220
Why do you

147
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:40,718
want me in the arms of another woman?

148
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,134
Do you have no regard for my feelings?

149
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:51,296
Do you no longer

150
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,312
see me as a man?

151
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:58,915
You promised to protect me

152
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,876
though you are only a palace maid.

153
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:05,548
Until the day I die,

154
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,216
I will

155
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,420
protect you, Your Highness.

156
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:21,324
You put your life on the line to save mine.

157
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,521
How can I

158
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:27,998
not love such a woman?

159
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,623
I've always thought

160
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:45,418
that you harbored affections for me,

161
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,723
that your feelings for me

162
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:54,209
ran as deeply

163
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,421
as mine for you.

164
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:03,615
If this is not so, tell me here and now.

165
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,629
Do you truly

166
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:17,701
have no affections for me?

167
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,123
I…

168
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,912
I…

169
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:43,821
do not wish to be your woman.

170
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,926
Not once

171
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:52,669
have I wanted to become your woman.

172
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,312
Guys, I'm back!

173
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:26,439
- Hi, Deok Im.
- Hi!

174
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:30,505
Deok Im, this book is really good. Come join us.

175
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:32,726
Hey, I can't see anything.

176
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:34,780
Deok Im just got here.

177
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,667
Just put the book in the middle.

178
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,828
Of course. This is where I belong.

179
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:44,837
What are you talking about?

180
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:52,395
Hey, I'm not done yet.

181
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,506
Hurry up.

182
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,815
I'm done.

183
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:19,399
Your Majesty, it is late.

184
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,908
What thoughts are keeping you at the official court until this hour?

185
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:29,183
Your Majesty?

186
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,917
I was thinking of someone.

187
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,228
Someone whom I cherish.

188
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:42,725
Who I thought belonged to me but doesn't.

189
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:47,600
I thought that she was

190
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,229
always waiting for me, standing in the same place.

191
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,714
But she was not waiting for me.

192
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,534
She merely stood there

193
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:01,806
because it was her place to be.

194
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,920
I thought she would come to me if I called her,

195
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,706
but I was a fool to believe so.

196
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,119
What do you think, Court Lady?

197
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:27,511
I do not understand.

198
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:32,144
Should I force her to be mine?

199
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:39,505
I have finally ascended the throne after years of perseverance,

200
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,595
so maybe I should reward myself?

201
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:45,426
- Your Majesty…
- Someone once told me

202
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:50,034
that there is nothing wrong in desiring something.

203
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:53,306
That now that I am King,

204
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:57,014
I may desire anything

205
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:59,525
and command it to be so.

206
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:04,809
Do you agree, Court Lady?

207
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:09,494
I would not dare to speak out of my place.

208
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:13,346
I am merely here to follow your royal command.

209
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:16,220
However,

210
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,914
I have seen Your Majesty since you were a little prince

211
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:23,727
so I dare to give you my opinion.

212
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:28,126
Your Majesty, you are not that kind of man.

213
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:32,433
And you are not that kind of king.

214
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:39,625
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

215
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:44,600
I have an urgent message from Concubine Wonbin's Palace.

216
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,223
Princess Wonbin is deathly ill.

217
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:13,448
Your Highness.

218
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,519
Do not frighten your brother.

219
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:25,131
Please open your eyes and get up.

220
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,506
Give Her Highness her medicine.

221
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,517
Lord Hong,

222
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,237
Her Highness

223
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,637
has already

224
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:43,636
passed away.

225
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:50,736
I told you to bring her back!

226
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,787
Please bring her back!

227
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:57,646
I do not know why Concubine Wonbin suddenly passed.

228
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:59,839
Has she passed?

229
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,797
Give her the medicine!

230
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:06,848
Now! Do it!

231
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:09,147
Please!

232
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:12,203
- Do something!
- Hong Deok Ro!

233
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:22,339
What happened to Concubine Wonbin?

234
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,519
Your Majesty,

235
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,120
Wonbin,

236
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:45,127
your concubine,

237
00:20:48,304 --> 00:20:51,425
has passed away.

238
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:09,111
Sister!

239
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:11,914
No!

240
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:36,609
It is my fault for being unable to save Concubine Wonbin.

241
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:40,406
Please kill me, Your Majesty!

242
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,511
It is not only your fault, Royal Doctor.

243
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:49,503
I am also to blame

244
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:53,705
for bringing such a valuable person here without offering proper care.

245
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:59,430
Send someone to comfort her mother.

246
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:04,397
Hold her funeral according to the royal protocols.

247
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:07,806
Yes, Your Majesty.

248
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:12,503
What will happen to Lord Hong?

249
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:15,205
I don't know.

250
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,214
Chief State Councilor, your excellency,

251
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:26,598
a royal concubine passed away so suddenly.

252
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:29,086
Isn't it strange?

253
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:34,908
Now that his plans have been derailed,

254
00:22:34,908 --> 00:22:38,611
Lord Hong will act out of control.

255
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:06,714
Lord.

256
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,705
You must be in such pain.

257
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:14,972
His Majesty is deeply concerned for you.

258
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:22,414
Please try to take heart

259
00:23:22,414 --> 00:23:24,712
if only for His Majesty.

260
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:27,714
I know it is painful,

261
00:23:28,286 --> 00:23:31,223
but we must forget about

262
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,653
those who have already passed on.

263
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:37,117
My healthy sister has been murdered.

264
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:42,112
How can I just forget?

265
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:51,226
What do you mean?

266
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:53,409
She was murdered?

267
00:23:57,092 --> 00:23:58,933
That is right.

268
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:04,522
My sister was murdered.

269
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,810
Lord Hong

270
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,394
must be deeply saddened.

271
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:22,622
I'm sure he's sad

272
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:25,996
since his dream to become the royal uncle of a prince has been dashed.

273
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:29,470
You're so mean, Kyung Hee.

274
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,170
Lord Hong lost his sister. He lost his family.

275
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,100
I don't care if you don't like him but don't be so cruel.

276
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:41,477
I also think it's unfortunate that the Concubine Wonbin has passed away,

277
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:44,022
but I barely even knew her.

278
00:24:44,022 --> 00:24:48,128
It's not like we have to mourn for everyone as if they were our friends.

279
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:55,108
Lord Hong deeply cherished his sister.

280
00:24:55,108 --> 00:24:59,526
If someone shares his grief, he will be comforted.

281
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,823
Do you think so?

282
00:25:02,823 --> 00:25:07,133
She was so young. I am deeply saddened.

283
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,230
Miss Maiden!

284
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,617
- Sam Wol.
- Here.

285
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,506
I hope that it's not too late.

286
00:25:21,506 --> 00:25:23,708
Maiden Bae gave it to me.

287
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,525
Kyung Hee did?

288
00:25:30,803 --> 00:25:34,271
I'll see you at Neungheojeong Pavilion at midnight.

289
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:39,208
Didn't she say anything else?

290
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,102
No. Good day.

291
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:31,976
What do you mean?

292
00:26:31,976 --> 00:26:34,231
Kyung Hee has disappeared?

293
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:38,781
I was supposed to meet her at Neungheojeong Pavilion, but she never showed up.

294
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:41,625
Are you sure she isn't somewhere else?

295
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:45,801
We looked everywhere in the palace, but we couldn't find her.

296
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,387
What should we do?

297
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:50,471
Let's wait until dawn breaks.

298
00:26:50,471 --> 00:26:54,133
I will inform Court Lady Seo in the morning.

299
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:02,931
So

300
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:07,126
the faction led by Head Court Lady Jo still remains

301
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,089
and their leader

302
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:11,312
is Hong Deok Ro?

303
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:12,990
Your Majesty,

304
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:17,794
all of the late court lady's connections and resources

305
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:22,034
are now under the control of Lord Hong.

306
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:23,219
He has taken bribes

307
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:26,337
from families of the rich and powerful in exchange for government posts

308
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:31,503
and has taken bribes from wealthy merchants, as well.

309
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:35,695
I dare to offer advice, Your Majesty.

310
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,280
Your Majesty commanded that Lord Hong

311
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,509
weed out the faction of the late Head Court Lady Jo.

312
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:46,675
However, that faction still remains

313
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:49,024
and its leader

314
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:52,193
is none other than Lord Hong.

315
00:27:56,795 --> 00:27:58,816
I understand. You are all dismissed for today.

316
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:01,365
Your Majesty, we cannot just let Lord Hong—

317
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:04,024
I said you are dismissed.

318
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,010
Oh, dear. Has Kyung Hee disappeared, too?

319
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,502
What do you mean?

320
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:42,080
Have others disappeared, as well?

321
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,587
The nurse who prepares medicine for the Queen has also disappeared.

322
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:47,780
But that's not all.

323
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,587
This is something only the senior court ladies are aware of.

324
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:55,405
Court ladies have been disappearing for days now.

325
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:57,308
It's not just royal nurses.

326
00:28:57,308 --> 00:29:00,108
No less than six court ladies are missing.

327
00:29:00,108 --> 00:29:02,908
They're all ladies of the Queen's Palace.

328
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:28,372
Sit down.

329
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,558
I have been informed that court ladies have been disappearing.

330
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:41,433
Were you

331
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:44,130
aware of this?

332
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,710
No, Your Majesty.

333
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,199
It is only a trivial matter.

334
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:54,926
Court ladies commit suicide once in a while.

335
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:59,148
It happens three or four times a year, so it is a common occurrence.

336
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:04,211
I said that they disappeared,

337
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:08,424
I did not say that they had died.

338
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:13,629
Lord Hong, since you are in charge of palace security,

339
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:16,300
this is your responsibility.

340
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:20,207
Find the missing court ladies.

341
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:23,472
I will do as you command, Your Majesty.

342
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:52,408
I bet Maiden Bae was taken by ghosts.

343
00:30:52,408 --> 00:30:54,100
What?

344
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,820
That's what everyone says.

345
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,507
- They say the missing court ladies were all taken by ghosts.
- Ghosts?

346
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:02,696
Stop talking nonsense and tell us about Kyung Hee.

347
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:06,783
Sam Wol, you were the last person to see Kyung Hee.

348
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,925
Don't you know anything?

349
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:13,802
I don't know anything. Asking me questions won't change that.

350
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:18,230
Okay. We're sorry for taking your time. You can go.

351
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:23,722
Wasn't that suspicious?

352
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:28,715
She keeps talking about ghosts or whatnot instead of answering our questions.

353
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:33,816
I think she must be hiding something.

354
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:37,332
Deok Im, you should go to the Queen Dowager's Palace now.

355
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:41,641
Her Highness the Queen Dowager called you. You can't be late.

356
00:31:42,786 --> 00:31:46,112
Did a ghost really take her?

357
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:49,145
Where in the world could Kyung Hee be?

358
00:31:53,884 --> 00:31:58,958
"After the war, Pyeongguk fell seriously ill and was given medicine day and night."

359
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,417
"So the King sent him a skilled doctor."

360
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,887
"After examining Pyeongguk, the doctor informed the king

361
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:09,018
that while the illness was not serious, he discovered something suspicious."

362
00:32:09,018 --> 00:32:13,514
"Upon further questioning, the doctor hesitantly revealed"

363
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,915
"that when he examined Pyeongguk,"

364
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:18,636
"he found her to be a woman."

365
00:32:21,602 --> 00:32:23,233
So?

366
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:27,297
The King found out that Pyeongguk was a woman?

367
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:29,408
Yes, Your Highness.

368
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,486
So the rumor is true.

369
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:37,816
You make even the most common folktale novels interesting and fun.

370
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:40,103
I am flattered, Your Highness.

371
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,233
I do not know how much a storyteller gets paid outside so I prepared a few things.

372
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:56,402
Will it be enough?

373
00:32:56,402 --> 00:33:00,593
It is too much, Your Highness. Please take it back.

374
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:03,599
I am borrowing the King's most cherished servant

375
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:06,208
so it is just remuneration.

376
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,423
My apologies.

377
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:30,608
Fine. So have you found your missing friend?

378
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,741
I have heard that court ladies have been disappearing.

379
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:39,925
One of them is your friend, is she not?

380
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:41,598
Yes.

381
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:46,606
Why is it taking so long to find the missing ladies?

382
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:49,681
What is His Majesty doing?

383
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:55,325
Does he not care because he thinks that court ladies are nothing?

384
00:33:58,387 --> 00:34:00,013
If I were him,

385
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:03,798
I would not be sitting on my hands doing anything.

386
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:08,065
Don't you

387
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:11,083
find it to be strange?

388
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:17,237
I'm sure that the case will be solved

389
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:21,093
and all the court ladies will return safely.

390
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,623
All right.

391
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,334
I will take my leave.

392
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:32,215
Is there anything else you would like me to do?

393
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:36,174
Could you transcribe that book for me?

394
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,314
Yes, Your Highness.

395
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:57,527
There aren't many people I can talk to.

396
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:03,325
I wish to keep you nearby.

397
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:07,292
I'm sorry, Your Highness, but I am—

398
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:09,492
A maid of the King's Palace?

399
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,297
Just remember.

400
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:24,819
I hold you in much higher esteem

401
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:28,642
than you think.

402
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:32,700
Tell me if any difficulty should arise.

403
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,902
I will extend you my hand.

404
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:56,816
What is His Majesty doing?

405
00:35:57,602 --> 00:36:00,734
Does he not care because he thinks

406
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:03,519
that court ladies are nothing?

407
00:36:33,597 --> 00:36:35,749
I thought it was Kyung Hee's.

408
00:36:41,287 --> 00:36:43,605
What are you doing!

409
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:56,308
Your Majesty!

410
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:19,205
Sit down.

411
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:26,803
Explain what just happened in the pond.

412
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:30,411
Explain!

413
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:35,120
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

414
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:38,082
Maiden Sung,

415
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:40,013
answer His Majesty.

416
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:43,892
Surely you did not enter the pond to kill yourself?

417
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:47,128
My friend has disappeared.

418
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:49,084
She is a maid of the sewing house in the Queen's Palace.

419
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:51,441
Her name is Bae Kyung Hee.

420
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:54,688
I could not sit back and do nothing,

421
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:58,621
so I've been looking for her every chance I had.

422
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:01,376
Just now,

423
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:04,091
I saw a fragrance purse in the pond

424
00:38:04,091 --> 00:38:06,496
and thought it to be hers

425
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:09,694
so I jumped into the water to fetch it.

426
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:13,628
If she is dead…

427
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,320
I am scared that we will never

428
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,388
be able to find her.

429
00:38:27,824 --> 00:38:30,007
Do not cry.

430
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:32,513
Your tears

431
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,084
make me feel helpless.

432
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:39,118
Do not make me a helpless king.

433
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:44,185
I will return your friend to you, no matter what.

434
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,223
I give you my word.

435
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:54,410
Lord Hong is already searching for the missing court ladies.

436
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,492
I am certain he will find them.

437
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,300
Is that not so?

438
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:05,198
It is so, Your Majesty.

439
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:10,007
Shed no tears, Maiden Sung.

440
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,813
I am doing my best to find the court ladies.

441
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,884
Please, trust me

442
00:39:16,884 --> 00:39:19,418
and have a little patience.

443
00:39:19,418 --> 00:39:21,598
Yes, Lord Hong.

444
00:39:23,992 --> 00:39:26,603
I am deeply grateful, Your Majesty.

445
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:34,615
I see you can be as sly as a fox.

446
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:44,836
I never imagined you would shed tears to move His Majesty.

447
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:49,394
Take no offense.

448
00:39:49,912 --> 00:39:54,301
I am merely praising you for your cleverness.

449
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:59,497
Only you could sway the king with your tears.

450
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:03,407
Lord Hong, you gave His Majesty your word

451
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:06,424
that you will find the missing court ladies.

452
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,917
Make sure to keep your word.

453
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:15,114
Or else, you will have to be worried for your safety.

454
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,536
I doubt it.

455
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:21,801
What do you mean?

456
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:25,404
Do you think I will lose His Majesty's favor

457
00:40:26,703 --> 00:40:29,814
just because I fail to find a few missing court ladies?

458
00:40:29,814 --> 00:40:32,507
Of course, he will punish me

459
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:36,011
by lowering my wages

460
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:38,607
or giving me a demotion,

461
00:40:39,808 --> 00:40:42,308
but it'll be nothing of consequence, I imagine.

462
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:48,006
Who does the king cherish more?

463
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,504
Between me, Hong Deok Ro, and the missing court ladies,

464
00:40:52,504 --> 00:40:55,196
who do you think His Majesty cherishes more?

465
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,220
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

466
00:41:18,703 --> 00:41:21,329
Court Lady Seo Ok Geum, listen carefully.

467
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,407
Yes, Your Majesty.

468
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:27,583
- Keep an eye on Sung Deok Im.
- Pardon?

469
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:32,027
Find out where she goes and whom she meets.

470
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:35,902
And if anything happens to her, report it immediately to the Captain of the Palace Guard.

471
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:40,309
May I dare to ask the reason for this assignment?

472
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:43,015
No one likes to be monitored.

473
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:45,196
Your Majesty could end up hurting her feelings.

474
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:48,510
I do not care if I hurt her feelings.

475
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,144
I just need her to be safe.

476
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,920
Do not forget your assignment.

477
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:02,531
Yes, Your Majesty.

478
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:04,497
You may leave.

479
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:06,323
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:42:20,803 --> 00:42:22,913
Go on inside.

481
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,496
You are here.

482
00:42:33,496 --> 00:42:36,410
I was informed that it was an urgent matter, so I came as fast as I could.

483
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,483
What do you need me to do, Your Majesty?

484
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:41,608
The late Head Court Lady had a hideaway that she was using.

485
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:44,709
Yes, Your Majesty. I saw it for myself.

486
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:49,633
I had commanded Lord Hong to burn the place down.

487
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,984
I wish to see with my own eyes

488
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:55,404
if Lord Hong obeyed my command.

489
00:42:55,404 --> 00:42:58,407
Yes, Your Majesty. I will take you there.

490
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:30,406
Your Majesty, it's this way.

491
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,995
What is going on?

492
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:52,614
Next, Court Lady Kim

493
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,200
from the sewing house.

494
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,818
Yes, Lord!

495
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:24,410
Keep a close eye on the situation and make sure none of the ladies are hurt.

496
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:26,309
Yes, Your Majesty.

497
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:54,095
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

498
00:45:55,525 --> 00:45:57,288
Sit down.

499
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:19,623
This is the first time that you have called me to the library.

500
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:22,008
I am overjoyed.

501
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:24,740
Seeing you come here

502
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,020
brings back old memories.

503
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:32,594
For years, the Crown Prince's Palace was a veritable prison.

504
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:34,599
You

505
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:37,916
were always by my side.

506
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,128
I still remember.

507
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:48,115
Every morning, the gates would open and you would walk in.

508
00:46:49,287 --> 00:46:51,790
You would have a newspaper in your hand,

509
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,997
and you would inform me

510
00:46:54,997 --> 00:46:57,211
of all the news of this land.

511
00:46:57,211 --> 00:47:00,125
Now as then,

512
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:03,023
I am always by Your Majesty's side.

513
00:47:09,898 --> 00:47:13,442
I wanted to ask your opinion.

514
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:16,283
Please answer carefully

515
00:47:16,796 --> 00:47:19,215
as it is an important matter.

516
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:30,288
Some day, I plan to free all the slaves of this land.

517
00:47:31,102 --> 00:47:35,891
That is my most important goal as King of Joseon.

518
00:47:36,795 --> 00:47:38,414
Why would you have such a goal?

519
00:47:38,414 --> 00:47:40,835
Joseon is my home,

520
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:43,995
and everyone that lives in this land

521
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:46,204
is my family.

522
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,908
I cannot bear to watch

523
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:55,809
my family being treated no better than beasts while I live in luxury.

524
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,971
Your Majesty,

525
00:48:01,971 --> 00:48:04,897
please try to be realistic.

526
00:48:04,897 --> 00:48:07,731
Slaves have no power.

527
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:10,212
By helping useless slaves,

528
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:14,023
you could lose the approval of important people.

529
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:21,006
Your Majesty must take care of the owners, not the slaves.

530
00:48:21,006 --> 00:48:23,320
They are the people

531
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:26,616
who have the power to help you.

532
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,208
So

533
00:48:30,503 --> 00:48:32,388
I should ignore

534
00:48:32,388 --> 00:48:35,415
those who are weak and useless?

535
00:48:35,994 --> 00:48:38,783
Is that what you think?

536
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:42,603
As I said, this is the reality of the matter.

537
00:48:42,603 --> 00:48:45,117
Then how about court ladies?

538
00:48:45,702 --> 00:48:46,588
Pardon?

539
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:50,017
Most of them come from the slave class.

540
00:48:50,017 --> 00:48:52,418
Are they useless too

541
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,826
because they come from lowly backgrounds?

542
00:48:54,826 --> 00:48:59,634
Why would they be useless when they serve Your Majesty?

543
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:03,029
But…

544
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:05,409
But?

545
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,826
I can easily find women to take their place.

546
00:49:18,996 --> 00:49:20,799
I understand.

547
00:49:22,515 --> 00:49:25,131
So that is what you think.

548
00:49:27,224 --> 00:49:29,996
I understand you completely now.

549
00:49:31,112 --> 00:49:33,413
You may leave.

550
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:20,089
When I heard Your Majesty wished to play Go with me, I was surprised.

551
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:23,227
I am not very good

552
00:50:23,227 --> 00:50:26,102
at Go or Chess,

553
00:50:26,622 --> 00:50:31,901
but I know you enjoy those games so I have decided to learn them.

554
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:47,195
Three years have passed since I took the throne.

555
00:50:47,195 --> 00:50:49,992
After years of perseverance,

556
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:54,703
I have finally managed to establish my power.

557
00:50:55,315 --> 00:50:58,702
This is all thanks to your help, Grandmother.

558
00:51:00,328 --> 00:51:02,213
If you wish,

559
00:51:02,705 --> 00:51:06,255
I will relocate Kim Gwi Ju from exile in Heuksan Island

560
00:51:06,255 --> 00:51:08,617
to Naju.

561
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:11,191
Will you do that for my brother?

562
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:14,396
Some day, he may even return to the capital.

563
00:51:17,017 --> 00:51:20,703
You are offering me an unexpected favor.

564
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:24,083
What do you expect from me in return?

565
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,905
I hope you would

566
00:51:28,814 --> 00:51:31,583
play Go with me as today.

567
00:51:32,693 --> 00:51:34,713
Your Highness,

568
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:40,317
you are an elder of the Royal Household that even I, the king, must respect.

569
00:51:40,317 --> 00:51:44,103
I wish to play Go with you from time to time,

570
00:51:44,103 --> 00:51:47,584
and you may ask me for favors whenever you wish.

571
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:50,697
As your grandson, I will do my best to fulfill my filial duty.

572
00:51:52,991 --> 00:51:55,691
May I ask for a favor now?

573
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:01,090
As your late concubine failed to produce an heir,

574
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:04,196
we must select a new concubine.

575
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:09,613
I will do as you wish.

576
00:52:10,186 --> 00:52:11,853
However,

577
00:52:11,853 --> 00:52:14,520
this time, I will select my concubine.

578
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:18,518
Of course, it won't be someone from Your Highness's faction.

579
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:22,202
What if I disagree with you?

580
00:52:22,202 --> 00:52:25,420
Then I will not send your brother to Naju.

581
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,600
Instead, he will be executed at Heuksan Island.

582
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:35,702
I see.

583
00:52:35,702 --> 00:52:37,722
This is much better.

584
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:40,396
We should be honest with each other.

585
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:44,522
You should have made your intentions clear from the beginning.

586
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,638
Your Majesty,

587
00:52:48,189 --> 00:52:50,118
the women of the royal household

588
00:52:50,118 --> 00:52:54,015
did not come here of their own volition.

589
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:57,115
It is a burdensome position

590
00:52:57,115 --> 00:52:59,409
fraught with even

591
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,987
heavier responsibilities.

592
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:05,110
However,

593
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,810
His Majesty always looks at us with a wary eye.

594
00:53:09,585 --> 00:53:14,895
I know you are here to earn my support for some action.

595
00:53:21,193 --> 00:53:23,908
I enjoy playing Go,

596
00:53:24,622 --> 00:53:27,474
so please come more often.

597
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:31,220
I will do so, Grandmother.

598
00:53:41,704 --> 00:53:43,692
Deok Im.

599
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,820
I'm going to go see Sam Wol.

600
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,550
Again?

601
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,623
She's the only clue we have.

602
00:53:51,387 --> 00:53:53,714
She's acting strangely these days.

603
00:53:53,714 --> 00:53:56,020
Don't you agree?

604
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:59,753
She keeps telling people the missing court ladies were taken by ghosts,

605
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:02,753
and people keep avoiding her because she is acting strangely.

606
00:54:03,885 --> 00:54:06,702
I think she's doing that intentionally.

607
00:54:08,298 --> 00:54:10,218
I'm off.

608
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:22,921
Deok Im, wait for us.

609
00:54:23,714 --> 00:54:25,490
But you have to work early.

610
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,800
Deok Im.

611
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:30,519
You mean as much as Kyung Hee means to us.

612
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:31,832
That's right.

613
00:54:31,832 --> 00:54:35,219
And what if something were to happen to you?

614
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:39,297
We'll go with you.

615
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:02,310
Is this where she lives?

616
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,063
Yes.

617
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,608
Sam Wol!

618
00:55:22,232 --> 00:55:24,309
Sam Wol!

619
00:55:26,714 --> 00:55:28,798
Sam Wol!

620
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:31,522
Sam Wol!

621
00:55:41,313 --> 00:55:43,180
Hurry!

622
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:55,769
Sam Wol.

623
00:56:06,814 --> 00:56:09,404
Do you feel like talking now?

624
00:56:11,283 --> 00:56:15,140
What in the world is going on?

625
00:56:25,932 --> 00:56:27,891
This is poison.

626
00:56:28,907 --> 00:56:31,213
Lord Hong

627
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:34,548
commanded me to hide this in the Queen's Palace.

628
00:56:37,738 --> 00:56:40,530
He wanted to use it

629
00:56:42,927 --> 00:56:46,427
as evidence that the Queen murdered the Concubine Wonbin.

630
00:56:48,026 --> 00:56:49,727
So

631
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:53,097
you tried to kill yourself?

632
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:56,373
Framing the Queen is treason.

633
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:03,719
If I get caught, it won't be just me that's killed.

634
00:57:05,707 --> 00:57:09,332
My entire family will be executed.

635
00:57:13,187 --> 00:57:18,013
I thought it would be better to die by myself.

636
00:57:21,782 --> 00:57:26,409
So Lord Hong kidnapped the missing court ladies?

637
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:30,806
Then where is he keeping them?

638
00:57:30,806 --> 00:57:33,214
I don't know.

639
00:57:33,214 --> 00:57:35,400
It's true.

640
00:57:49,797 --> 00:57:53,611
So how did he get them out of the palace?

641
00:57:53,611 --> 00:57:56,101
He couldn't have taken them through the gates.

642
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:58,718
He would have gotten caught.

643
00:57:58,718 --> 00:58:00,690
So how?

644
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,819
There must be a secret passageway no one knows about.

645
00:58:05,301 --> 00:58:08,804
What are we going to do?

646
00:58:11,611 --> 00:58:13,046
You guys.

647
00:58:13,046 --> 00:58:17,298
There's a secret place that I know of.

648
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:21,413
The missing court ladies must be there.

649
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:22,787
Where is it?

650
00:58:22,787 --> 00:58:23,920
I can't tell you.

651
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,521
I can't put you guys in danger, too.

652
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:35,577
Here's the book the Queen Dowager requested that I transcribe for her.

653
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:38,412
I'm going to go look for Kyung Hee right now.

654
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:42,609
If I don't return by noon tomorrow, please take this book

655
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:44,025
to the Queen Dowager for me.

656
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:47,563
Hey, this is no time to be thinking about a book.

657
00:58:47,563 --> 00:58:49,008
The book is important.

658
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:53,158
It's the only way you can gain an audience with Queen Dowager.

659
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,077
I'm going to write a letter.

660
00:58:55,077 --> 00:59:00,219
I'll write about the missing court ladies and Lord Hong's involvement.

661
00:59:00,819 --> 00:59:04,009
I'll leave the letter in this book.
[The Story of Hong Gye Wol]

662
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:09,130
If I fail to return, make sure to give the book to Queen Dowager.

663
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:12,328
No. You're a maid of the King's Palace.

664
00:59:12,328 --> 00:59:16,587
You could incur His Majesty's wrath if you involve Queen Dowager.

665
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:19,693
He'll be angry that you didn't inform him first.

666
00:59:19,693 --> 00:59:23,398
That's right. Let's go inform the King, okay?

667
00:59:23,398 --> 00:59:25,740
I can't trust the King.

668
00:59:26,203 --> 00:59:31,125
You guys, as the King, His Majesty is always calculating.

669
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,905
What if he's already calculated

670
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:38,305
and thinks that Lord Hong's life is more important than the life of a court lady?

671
00:59:38,997 --> 00:59:43,403
I'm not like him. I cannot weigh the worthiness of people's lives.

672
00:59:43,403 --> 00:59:45,415
Kyung Hee is what's important to me.

673
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,111
I'll do anything to save her.

674
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:51,011
So you'll even involve Queen Dowager?

675
00:59:51,011 --> 00:59:55,990
She is the most powerful person who will help me.

676
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:59,291
Deok Im, things might not work out as you said.

677
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:03,252
You could end up getting killed.

678
01:00:03,252 --> 01:00:04,944
I know.

679
01:00:05,617 --> 01:00:09,612
But this is the only thing I can do for Kyung Hee.

680
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:24,823
The four of us should always stay together.

681
01:00:24,823 --> 01:00:26,281
Wait.

682
01:00:26,281 --> 01:00:28,416
I'll go

683
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:31,302
and find our missing friend.

684
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,593
Please return to us safely.

685
01:00:42,603 --> 01:00:44,789
We'll be waiting for you.

686
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:18,687
Take her away.

687
01:02:18,687 --> 01:02:20,352
Yes, Lord!

688
01:02:34,581 --> 01:02:37,650
Come here, Maiden Sung.

689
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:47,961
I see that you've found this place.

690
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:57,002
Did you think of escaping punishment after concocting such an evil plan?

691
01:02:57,002 --> 01:02:59,434
Are you not afraid His Majesty will find out?

692
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:03,660
Why did you come here without informing His Majesty?

693
01:03:10,746 --> 01:03:13,590
So you don't trust him.

694
01:03:16,419 --> 01:03:22,720
You were not sure whether informing His Majesty

695
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,100
was the way to save your friend

696
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,710
or to ensure her demise.

697
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:33,912
That's why you came here first.

698
01:03:36,517 --> 01:03:39,086
You are quite bold.

699
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:43,260
You have become reckless because you have the King's favor.

700
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:47,270
It is you who have become reckless because of His Majesty's favor.

701
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,390
Do you think that everything will turn out as you will it?

702
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:54,784
If that were so, then Concubine Wonbin would still be alive,

703
01:03:54,784 --> 01:03:59,191
produce the royal heir, and smile happily.

704
01:03:59,914 --> 01:04:05,208
She would show me how happy she was.

705
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:10,826
Do you truly think that she was happy as a concubine?

706
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:16,018
She would still be alive had she not become a concubine—

707
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:22,607
So it's my fault that my sister died?

708
01:04:22,607 --> 01:04:24,734
That's not true!

709
01:04:24,734 --> 01:04:26,677
My sister was murdered!

710
01:04:26,677 --> 01:04:29,990
How else would she have died so suddenly?

711
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,690
It's the Queen who killed her.

712
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:36,403
Her cruel acts of discipline caused my sister to perish.

713
01:04:39,005 --> 01:04:44,528
Do you have any idea of the nefarious acts in the world of concubines?

714
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:48,332
Do you have evidence of this?

715
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:50,502
You cannot accuse the Queen without evidence.

716
01:04:50,502 --> 01:04:54,103
Unfortunately, I was unable to find evidence,

717
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,622
but there's no need to worry.

718
01:04:56,622 --> 01:04:59,750
I can always conjure up evidence.

719
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,215
You will help me do that.

720
01:05:09,195 --> 01:05:11,123
Let's go.

721
01:05:17,698 --> 01:05:19,919
Write!

722
01:05:19,919 --> 01:05:22,293
Write it now!

723
01:05:28,404 --> 01:05:31,210
The royal nurse is no good.

724
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:34,851
You'll have to help me instead, Maiden Sung.

725
01:05:39,689 --> 01:05:41,553
Here!

726
01:05:41,553 --> 01:05:44,771
Now, make the evidence for me!

727
01:05:44,771 --> 01:05:46,911
Don't worry about its content.

728
01:05:46,911 --> 01:05:49,000
I will tell you what to write.

729
01:05:50,302 --> 01:05:53,580
The Queen poisoned Concubine Wonbin

730
01:05:54,093 --> 01:05:57,757
and bribed the royal doctor and the royal nurse to say she died of an illness.

731
01:05:58,578 --> 01:06:01,731
- That's what you should write.
- Are you out of your mind?

732
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:05,787
- If you were caught doing this—
- You will be killed along with me.

733
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:11,605
If you're forced to write a treasonous letter about the Queen, the nation's mother,

734
01:06:11,605 --> 01:06:16,110
it's better to rather chew on your tongue and kill yourself.

735
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:21,001
Do not blame me.

736
01:06:21,928 --> 01:06:24,496
That is this nation's law.

737
01:06:26,985 --> 01:06:30,730
It is especially cruel to lowly palace maids.

738
01:06:36,579 --> 01:06:38,548
What?

739
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:41,416
Offended that I called you lowly?

740
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:45,760
But aren't palace maids

741
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,600
mostly from the slave class?

742
01:07:00,004 --> 01:07:01,605
Write it now!

743
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:04,105
Let go of her hand!

744
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:14,232
Arrest all of these men!

745
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:15,914
Yes, Lord!

746
01:07:37,865 --> 01:07:41,943
Your Majesty, I can explain everything.

747
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:45,435
- I can explain—
- Take him away!

748
01:07:45,435 --> 01:07:47,317
Yes, Your Majesty.

749
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:49,067
Get up.

750
01:08:02,012 --> 01:08:04,000
Deok Im…

751
01:08:06,793 --> 01:08:08,686
Kyung Hee.

752
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:12,160
[The Story of Hong Gye Wol]

753
01:08:14,992 --> 01:08:17,012
Take it.

754
01:08:44,134 --> 01:08:47,084
I understand that Your Majesty is angry at me.

755
01:08:47,084 --> 01:08:50,902
However, I have recently lost my sister.

756
01:08:50,902 --> 01:08:53,112
I had just cause for my actions.

757
01:08:53,112 --> 01:08:57,897
You attempted to plot against our nation's mother, the Queen!

758
01:08:57,897 --> 01:09:03,113
How can anything justify such an evil deed?

759
01:09:03,113 --> 01:09:06,486
Your Majesty, there is nothing more to hear.

760
01:09:06,486 --> 01:09:09,836
Think of the heinous act that Lord Hong has committed.

761
01:09:09,836 --> 01:09:15,718
Lord Hong, His Majesty has been aware of your plot all along.

762
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:20,931
Even so, he was waiting for you.

763
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:25,415
He told us that he wanted to

764
01:09:25,415 --> 01:09:27,770
give you one more chance.

765
01:09:30,936 --> 01:09:32,686
What are you waiting for?

766
01:09:32,686 --> 01:09:35,896
Tell His Majesty of Lord Hong's sins.

767
01:09:36,691 --> 01:09:39,031
Why do you hesitate?

768
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,809
You must have been waiting for an opportunity such as this.

769
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,985
Go ahead and slander me.

770
01:09:46,985 --> 01:09:48,820
Hong Deok Ro,

771
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:52,990
I admit that I dislike you,

772
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:56,634
but I always considered you a comrade from our days in the Dongdeok Order.

773
01:09:57,826 --> 01:10:01,526
As a royal brother-in-law, I cannot become an official.

774
01:10:01,526 --> 01:10:04,204
But the days

775
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:09,108
when you and I served His Majesty in the Dongdeok Order

776
01:10:09,108 --> 01:10:13,923
were the most precious and happiest of my life.

777
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:22,494
Frankly, it pains me to advise His Majesty to kill my colleague.

778
01:10:22,494 --> 01:10:24,190
How…

779
01:10:25,614 --> 01:10:27,477
How did you become like this?

780
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:31,144
Your Majesty, the palace is full of people

781
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:34,711
who wish to harm me because I have become such a high official.

782
01:10:34,711 --> 01:10:36,461
However, Your Majesty,

783
01:10:36,461 --> 01:10:40,101
I do not care if all the world is against me

784
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:43,589
as long as His Majesty trusts me.

785
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:47,926
Everyone makes mistakes.

786
01:10:47,926 --> 01:10:49,880
Mistakes?

787
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:55,392
This was not a mistake.

788
01:10:57,524 --> 01:11:03,316
You were well aware that you were committing a sin,

789
01:11:05,109 --> 01:11:09,140
but you were certain you would be forgiven no matter what you do.

790
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:17,685
Until now, I have forgiven you for countless infractions.

791
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:22,029
Do you know why?

792
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:27,210
It is because I felt guilty.

793
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,750
From long ago,

794
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,900
I knew that such a day would come.

795
01:11:37,712 --> 01:11:42,410
I knew that you would become

796
01:11:43,005 --> 01:11:46,321
a threat to me and my nation.

797
01:11:46,321 --> 01:11:48,710
I knew that I would have to kill you

798
01:11:52,419 --> 01:11:55,312
when that time came.

799
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:03,602
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

800
01:12:03,602 --> 01:12:06,794
I knew that the time had come,

801
01:12:06,794 --> 01:12:12,912
but I continued to put it off, and now it has come to this.

802
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:21,999
You plotted against the nation's mother and kidnapped my people.

803
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:31,009
All of this happened as I hesitated, bound by trivial sentiment.

804
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,150
I did not

805
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:42,220
wish to kill you.

806
01:12:48,424 --> 01:12:50,500
But now,

807
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:57,496
you are my maternal relative who I must be most beware and also a servant whom I despise most.

808
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:04,405
Now tell me,

809
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:11,710
do you think that I will spare your life?

810
01:13:12,816 --> 01:13:15,303
So you forgave me until now

811
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:21,708
so that you could kill me in the end?

812
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:30,812
You built me up so that you could take me down?

813
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,860
Your Majesty, I must have greatly angered you.

814
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,930
Is that why you are trying to scare me?

815
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:47,745
I am sorry, Your Majesty!

816
01:13:50,484 --> 01:13:54,306
But I know you are only saying these things because you are angry.

817
01:13:54,306 --> 01:13:58,131
But that anger will dissipate in time.

818
01:13:58,131 --> 01:14:02,385
Your Majesty, remember who I am.

819
01:14:02,385 --> 01:14:05,905
It is me, Hong Deok Ro, who devoted his entire life to serving Your Majesty.

820
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:13,925
You gave me your word on the day I saved your life.

821
01:14:13,925 --> 01:14:16,382
As I pledged on that day,

822
01:14:17,103 --> 01:14:20,053
I have always protected you, Your Majesty.

823
01:14:20,053 --> 01:14:23,313
I have repaid all my debts and more!

824
01:14:31,594 --> 01:14:35,799
Now, it's my turn to claim what I am owed.

825
01:14:35,799 --> 01:14:42,597
The price is your life!

826
01:14:44,697 --> 01:14:50,111
You will never understand your sins.

827
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:54,025
You will never understand what you did wrong!

828
01:14:54,025 --> 01:14:58,230
You will never give me your loyalty.

829
01:14:58,751 --> 01:15:02,800
No matter how long I wait!

830
01:15:11,412 --> 01:15:13,211
So

831
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:20,728
you never considered me your person?

832
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,617
Was I never

833
01:15:32,038 --> 01:15:35,213
truly loyal to Your Majesty?

834
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,850
Not once

835
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:43,200
were you truly loyal.

836
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:05,520
Then

837
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:09,910
kill me.

838
01:16:12,733 --> 01:16:15,211
When my sister passed away,

839
01:16:19,602 --> 01:16:23,530
I thought I had lost all hope in life,

840
01:16:25,701 --> 01:16:28,235
but I realized I was wrong.

841
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:36,814
Your Majesty

842
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,500
was my life's purpose

843
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:47,306
and my hope.

844
01:16:51,613 --> 01:16:53,985
Please, kill me.

845
01:16:58,185 --> 01:17:03,020
I have now lost everything.

846
01:17:08,713 --> 01:17:12,908
Your Majesty, please spare Lord Hong!

847
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:16,600
Please spare his life!

848
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,269
I…

849
01:17:18,269 --> 01:17:20,213
I beg of you!

850
01:17:20,213 --> 01:17:24,111
Captain, are you not my subject?

851
01:17:24,111 --> 01:17:28,827
How dare you interfere in my judgment!

852
01:17:28,827 --> 01:17:31,108
Apologies!

853
01:17:31,108 --> 01:17:32,982
Apologies, Your Majesty.

854
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:36,060
Did you not tell me

855
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:41,620
that you have no thoughts?

856
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,697
That all you would do is follow my commands?

857
01:17:47,975 --> 01:17:50,656
I did not think.

858
01:17:50,656 --> 01:17:53,100
I have always followed.

859
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,820
However,

860
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,610
I would dare inform Your Majesty

861
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:00,347
that your true desire

862
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:05,280
is for someone to beg for Lord Hong's life to be spared.

863
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:11,385
That is why I am begging.

864
01:18:11,385 --> 01:18:13,300
Am I wrong?

865
01:18:14,397 --> 01:18:17,689
Truly, am I wrong?

866
01:18:17,689 --> 01:18:19,931
I…

867
01:18:34,004 --> 01:18:36,310
See?

868
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:40,325
Do you not understand what His Majesty truly desires?

869
01:19:16,407 --> 01:19:22,783
Last night, Lord Hong resigned from his post.

870
01:19:25,799 --> 01:19:29,271
I will give him the title of Bongjoha
(T/N: Title for retired officials)

871
01:19:29,271 --> 01:19:34,097
and will accept his retirement.

872
01:20:12,778 --> 01:20:14,443
Kyung Hee!

873
01:20:14,443 --> 01:20:16,337
Kyung Hee!

874
01:20:21,614 --> 01:20:22,973
Stupid.

875
01:20:22,973 --> 01:20:25,406
What the heck, Kyung Hee?

876
01:20:25,406 --> 01:20:29,124
I mean you, Deok Im.

877
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,805
Why did you act so recklessly?

878
01:20:32,612 --> 01:20:36,120
If His Majesty had not appeared when he did,

879
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:39,680
you could have been hurt.

880
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:44,070
Did you do it for me?

881
01:20:44,635 --> 01:20:46,193
Yes.

882
01:20:46,992 --> 01:20:48,595
Are you angry?

883
01:20:48,595 --> 01:20:50,314
No.

884
01:20:51,164 --> 01:20:53,033
I'm happy.

885
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,720
Hey, how did you get kidnapped?

886
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,024
I saw some men

887
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:05,219
kidnap a court lady from the Queen's Palace.

888
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:08,590
I thought they hadn't seen me.

889
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:10,114
So...

890
01:21:10,114 --> 01:21:12,809
I sent Deok Im a note to discuss.

891
01:21:12,809 --> 01:21:16,101
Sam Wol was working for Lord Hong.

892
01:21:16,101 --> 01:21:18,916
I knew that bitch was suspicious—

893
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,612
Lie down.

894
01:21:24,494 --> 01:21:27,859
Hey, you need to rest.

895
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:31,310
We have night duty tonight,

896
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:34,972
but we will come back in the morning, so get some rest.

897
01:21:34,972 --> 01:21:36,437
Okay.

898
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:50,111
Deok Im, I'm really sorry for losing your book.

899
01:21:50,111 --> 01:21:52,073
It's not Young Hee's fault.

900
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:57,291
She went to the restroom at night, and the book was gone.

901
01:21:57,291 --> 01:21:58,879
All right.

902
01:21:59,785 --> 01:22:04,060
Who could have stolen it in the middle of the night?

903
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:16,767
Deok Im.

904
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:20,709
His Majesty has called for you.

905
01:22:48,225 --> 01:22:50,008
Are you going to explain yourself?

906
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:51,613
No, Your Majesty.

907
01:22:51,613 --> 01:22:53,410
Are you going to beg for forgiveness?

908
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:55,950
I will dare not.

909
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:07,422
So do you think you did nothing wrong?

910
01:23:07,422 --> 01:23:11,408
Your Majesty was aware of everything from the beginning.

911
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:13,080
That's right.

912
01:23:15,396 --> 01:23:18,122
I had everything under control.

913
01:23:18,122 --> 01:23:23,321
I had a plan to end it until you arrogantly interfered

914
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:26,913
and even tried to involve Queen Dowager in this!

915
01:23:29,392 --> 01:23:32,025
Deok Ro is my subject.

916
01:23:32,025 --> 01:23:36,593
I could have handled him no matter how reckless he was.

917
01:23:36,593 --> 01:23:38,624
It's different with Queen Dowager.

918
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:43,883
She is the only person in this land that can oppose the king.

919
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:47,995
Had she found out about everything—

920
01:23:47,995 --> 01:23:50,945
You would have had to kill Lord Hong.

921
01:23:50,945 --> 01:23:55,119
There would have been no way to spare his life.

922
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:59,385
Just like you had to kill your own brother, you would have had to kill him, too.

923
01:23:59,385 --> 01:24:02,429
This is not child's play we are talking about!

924
01:24:05,243 --> 01:24:09,918
It is a matter of the royal court and this entire nation!

925
01:24:09,918 --> 01:24:13,988
Nothing can be allowed to escape my control!

926
01:24:13,988 --> 01:24:19,052
But you attempted to derail my plans.

927
01:24:19,052 --> 01:24:21,646
I know that it was not child's play!

928
01:24:21,646 --> 01:24:26,076
I knew that I would incur your wrath, but I did it anyway to save my friend!

929
01:24:26,076 --> 01:24:29,536
That is why I tried to involve Queen Dowager!

930
01:24:29,536 --> 01:24:31,611
That's how important it was for me.

931
01:24:31,611 --> 01:24:33,911
More important than my own life.

932
01:24:35,388 --> 01:24:38,483
Your Majesty was aware of the situation as you formulated your plan.

933
01:24:38,483 --> 01:24:41,101
Your Majesty was playing politics!

934
01:24:41,101 --> 01:24:45,114
All the while, my friend could have been killed!

935
01:24:45,114 --> 01:24:48,124
Is it all right for a lowly court lady to lose her life

936
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:51,738
even though she has dedicated her entire life to serving the royal family?

937
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:55,619
I was going to save all of them when the time was right.

938
01:24:55,619 --> 01:25:00,882
What if someone had died before your designated time?

939
01:25:00,882 --> 01:25:04,030
Would that merely be collateral damage?

940
01:25:05,894 --> 01:25:07,689
Do you know?

941
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:10,309
I was so scared that I would lose my friend

942
01:25:10,309 --> 01:25:13,427
that I searched near the pond every night

943
01:25:13,427 --> 01:25:17,629
and even jumped in when I saw a fragrance pouch!

944
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:21,821
Every moment was full of fear and agitation!

945
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:29,230
Did I not give you my word that I would rescue your friend?

946
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:32,103
I was so overjoyed at your promise that I cried.

947
01:25:32,103 --> 01:25:37,704
But in reality, Your Majesty was deceiving me all along.

948
01:25:37,704 --> 01:25:40,913
You thought it was okay to deceive a lowly court lady,

949
01:25:40,913 --> 01:25:43,400
but I did not want to be deceived!

950
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,048
I could not bear it!

951
01:25:45,048 --> 01:25:47,221
How dare you!

952
01:25:50,195 --> 01:25:55,546
You are truly haughty and reckless.

953
01:25:55,546 --> 01:25:58,397
Yes, I am aware of that.

954
01:25:58,397 --> 01:26:00,224
So punish me.

955
01:26:00,224 --> 01:26:03,209
I am but a lowly palace maid whose life means nothing.

956
01:26:03,209 --> 01:26:06,520
You can kill me at a whim!

957
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:31,810
I have harbored you in my heart.

958
01:26:33,726 --> 01:26:36,895
I asked you to become my family.

959
01:26:38,394 --> 01:26:44,819
Until now, you were the only one.

960
01:26:46,922 --> 01:26:52,172
Since I came into this world, the only woman I've ever loved

961
01:26:53,914 --> 01:26:55,822
is you.

962
01:27:04,292 --> 01:27:07,439
I have never loved you, Your Majesty.

963
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:10,725
I have never thought of you as a man.

964
01:27:11,594 --> 01:27:16,491
And such a thing will never happen.

965
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:15,190
♫ My heart is broken, your warmth is gone  ♫

966
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:22,310
♫ I'm losing my color here ♫

967
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:25,780
♫ In the scattered time ♫

968
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:29,840
♫ I've lost my way ♫

969
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,100
♫ You are blowing this way  ♫
