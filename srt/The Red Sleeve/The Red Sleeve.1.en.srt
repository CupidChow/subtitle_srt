To show such generosity to an unfortunate girl like me!

Why should you hear it first?

We all agreed to listen to Deok Im's reading when everyone has time.

- I'm sorry.

How can you take it?

50
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,520
Why not? It doesn't matter as long as I get the money.

51
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,760
Now, all I need is ninety-five more nyang and I'll have 100.
(T/N: Nyang was their currency. 1 won = 10 nyang)

52
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,860
Why do you need 100 nyang? That's so much money.

53

Everything has its reason.

When I collect 100 nyang,

60
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,327
I'll tell my secret to the person who gives me the last nyang.

If you are desperate, you can pay me a good amount for my stories.

- Bring it here.
- Yes, My Lady.

81
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,253
It was a difficult item to bring in,

82
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,440
as it is from the West.

83

There's an ink stick inside.

90

A liar wouldn't have dared to touch it so her hand must be clean.

An honest person would have no reason to hesitate

92
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,862
so her hand must be stained with ink.

93

- Twenty lashes for everyone except that girl.
- Yes, My Lady.

- you lied to me?
- Yes.

100
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:38,051
Then why did you touch the ink stick?

101
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:41,940
- Weren't you afraid of the creature?
- I'm sorry to say…

102
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,133
I had a feeling…

103
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,000
that you were lying to us.

104
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
Why did you think that?

105
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,660
If there were really a creature that bites off the hands of liars…

106
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,811
there is no way I would still have hands.

It's the middle of the night. How will you get there by yourself?

00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,620
San,

168
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,760
as your grandfather,

169
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,040
I really appreciate your compassion.

170
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,300
But what can I do?

171
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,430
You can no longer see her

172
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,390
as easily as you used to.

173
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,460
I implore you, Grandfather.

174
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,940
Royal Concubine Yeong was still my biological grand—

175
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,631
If she was your biological grandmother,

176
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,700
is the late Crown Prince that died in the year of black horse your father?

177
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,420
Crown Prince Sado, who died as a sinner?

178
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,980
If he was your father, then

179
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,400
you'll have to live the rest of your life as a sinner's child.

180
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,376
No, that's not true, Grandfather!

181
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:46,400
I'll never again ask you to let me see Royal Concubine Yeong.

182
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,420
I ask you to please forgive me!

183
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:12,680
Who is there?

184
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,420
I'm letting you know…

185
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

186
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,500
I mean it!

187
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,660
I'm not afraid of ghosts…

188
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,340
Not at all…

189
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm not afraid…

190
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,700
Hey, hey!

191
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,700
Hey!

192
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,260
Do you know the way to Royal Concubine Yeong's residence?

193
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:45,952
Do you not?

194
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,020
You!

195
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,800
You scared me to death!

196
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,280
- Be careful!
- I will!

197
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,260
Shine the light carefully!

198
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,039
Careful! There we go.

199
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,980
A young apprentice palace maid? Out of blue like this?

200
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,353
Maybe she's a fox spirit in human form?

201
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:32,478
A playmate of the Crown Prince

202
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,680
sent on an errand by His Highness?

203
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,820
An errand in the middle of the night?

204
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:39,582
Is he really a crown prince's playmate?

205
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,620
What's your name?

206
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,082
Why should I tell my name to a lowly apprentice maid?

207
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:47,780
Hey!

208
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,132
Do you think being His Highness' playmate makes you something?

209
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:54,692
I'm going to be a fifth-level court lady someday.

210
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, really?

211
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,962
A fifth-level court lady…

212
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:00,522
Hey!

213
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,620
I don't even have to lift a finger to get there, either.

214
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,720
As for you…

215
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,530
Even now that you're the crown prince's playmate,

216
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,628
if you can't pass the state exam, you're not going anywhere.

217
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,328
State exam?

218
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,341
I don't take those kinds of tests!

219
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,101
Oh, really?

220
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,810
Then you're lower than me!

221
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,152
Come on!

222
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,560
What is with the lights?

223
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,800
If you follow the lights,

224
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,600
they'll lead you to Royal Concubine Yeong.

225
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:23,640
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,380
- Ask them to open it.
- No, we can't!

227
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,948
Why not?

228
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,940
Honestly,

229
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,940
I came here without permission.

230
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,140
You're crazy!

231
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,460
You can't come here without permission!

232
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,340
If a man enters the concubines' chamber without permission, it's the death penalty.

233
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,920
They won't let you off just because you're young.

234
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:49,100
Then what should I do?

235
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,720
Royal Concubine Yeong passed away.

236
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,700
She's gone forever.

237
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,140
If only I had hurried,

238
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,020
I would have seen her one last time.

239
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:07,372
I'm…

240
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,219
a coward.

241
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,560
Hurry and come down.

242
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,860
You should take your shoes.

243
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:25,361
Why is there nobody here?

244
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:53,149
Royal Concubine Yeong...

245
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:55,509
It's me.

246
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:57,925
San is here.

247
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,740
I meant to tell you myself that

248
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,160
what I said to you then…

249
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,180
I didn't really mean any of it.

250
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,540
I really meant to tell you…

251
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,660
Grandmother, did you really tell Grandfather

252
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,200
to have my father killed?

253
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,420
Is it true?

254
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,130
Yes, it is…

255
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,822
Your Highness.

256
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:35,400
You're my father's own mother.

257
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,380
What kind of mother kills her own son?

258
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,722
My father is dead because of you!

259
00:24:40,722 --> 00:24:43,840
How can you call yourself a mother?

260
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,900
Are you all right, Your Highness?

261
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,140
Don't act as if you're worried.

262
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,390
You always pretended to be worried about Father, too.

263
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,080
If I become like Father…

264
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:13,270
will you leave me, too?

265
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:27,998
Your grandmother… killed your father.

266
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,460
I never sought your forgiveness.

267
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,520
Everything…

268
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,210
is grandmother's own fault.

269
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,220
My poor grandson…

270
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,470
I don't deserve your forgiveness.

271
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,220
You'll make yourself sick if you cry too much.

272
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,780
I'm sure she wouldn't want that.

273
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,440
No,

274
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,360
I'm sure that she hates me

275
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,900
because of the cruel words I said.

276
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,840
How much she must hate me!

277
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,440
I'm sure she knows how you feel.

278
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,200
- How would the dead know anything?
- You silly!

279
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,600
She knows because she is dead.

280
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:55,889
The dead know everything.

281
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:59,260
Even your hidden emotions.

282
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,220
I have proof. Shall I tell you?

283
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,620
What is it?

284
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,640
Remember those lights we saw?

285
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,180
The lights didn't go out even when the wind was blowing.

286
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,120
She was glad to see you coming.

287
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,660
"I'm glad you are here. I have missed you!"

288
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,160
"It is dark. Be careful and follow the lights."

289
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,990
Do you really not know that?

290
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:32,445
- Do you think that is true?
- Would I lie?

291
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:35,700
I got to hear about her thanks to you.

292
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,377
She was a good person.

293
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:42,240
At first, seeing her lying down like that was a little scary.

294
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,325
I'm not scared anymore.

295
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:46,330
It is all thanks to you.

296
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,329
Thank you, San!

297
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,560
You!

298
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,200
How do you know my name?

299
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,940
You said it yourself earlier.

300
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:02,300
Okay, so what is your name?

301
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,260
My name is—

302
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,080
His Majesty arrives!

303
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,140
Step aside! Step aside!

304
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,480
Open!

305
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,120
You can't, Your Majesty!

306
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,719
Royal Concubine Yeong bore me six children.

307
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:27,310
Why would I be prohibited from being by her side in this moment of all?

308
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,880
Does that make sense?

309
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,045
It is the law.

310
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,600
Go away!

311
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,440
Those irritating laws, laws!

312
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:45,558
And who are you?

313
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:46,940
Your Majesty,

314
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,220
I'm one of the Crown Prince's apprentice maids.

315
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,495
I was paying my respects to Royal Concubine Yeong.

316
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:55,780
Raise your face!

317
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,980
You look like Princess Hwa Pyeong when she was little.

318
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,250
Come here!

319
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:23,390
That person

320
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,120
went through great lengths

321
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,060
for me and our future.

322
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,969
But now,

323
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:36,972
I can't even stay by her side in death.

324
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:43,432
No king has ever attended a concubine's burial.

325
00:30:43,432 --> 00:30:46,800
How cruel is that?

326
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:49,320
What do you think?

327
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,260
Your Majesty is right.

328
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,160
Is that so?

329
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,300
Your Majesty is certainly right!

330
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,480
Even a young apprentice maid like you knows loyalty.

331
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,160
You're here to pay respects.

332
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,100
Let us both spend some time with Royal Concubine Yeong.

333
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,040
She used to be beautiful in her younger days.

334
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,720
She was a court lady, like you.

335
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,780
The ends of her sleeves were very red.

336
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,660
Every time I saw them, my heart ached so much.

337
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,720
Why did it hurt?

338
00:31:55,907 --> 00:32:03,280
When the court ladies dye their sleeve ends red,

339
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,388
it shows that they are the king's ladies.

340
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,570
At the time,

341
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,140
I was just a lowly prince born from a concubine.

342
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,080
I never dared to dream to be throned.

343
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,640
However, as time passed,

344
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,900
I received Heaven's will and became a king.

345
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,920
I was awarded the crown, and she came along with it.

346
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,380
I deluded myself into thinking

347
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,580
I could do anything I wanted in this world.

348
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,040
Why was that a delusion?

349
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,100
Since you are the king, can you not do anything you want?

350
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,060
Do you know how many things a king cannot control?

351
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:04,020
You would be stunned when you eventually find out.

352
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,280
Even ice can't be colder than my heart.

353
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,850
I…

354
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,900
have finally lost her.

355
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,390
Now

356
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,060
she won't ever come back.

357
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,140
It is fate that we met tonight.

358
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,293
I will grant you a special Imperial gift.

359
00:33:45,293 --> 00:33:47,720
Let's see…

360
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,180
Let me ask you.

361
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:56,792
What kind of court lady do you wish to be?

362
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:59,022
I want to…

363
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,420
become a court lady who writes well.

364
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,630
Do you want to be a good writer?

365
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,650
Here, take this.

366
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,520
[Yeo Beom: A story of ladies - How to become a good daughter, a mother, a wife]

367
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,125
Royal Concubine Yeong wrote this book herself.

368
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:40,700
Can I receive such a precious book?

369
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:46,141
Tonight, fate brought you here.

370
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:52,651
Did you say you were one of the Crown Prince's young ladies?

371
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:54,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

372
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,600
You never know.

373
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,000
Your fate

374
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:08,245
might turn out the same as the owner of this book.

375
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,350
[Yeo Beom: A story of ladies - How to become a good daughter, a mother, a wife]

376
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,350
I hope Yi San went back safely.

377
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,580
Did I really meet the king?

378
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,770
[Yeo Beom: A story of ladies - How to become a good daughter, a mother, a wife]

379
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:56,100
My Lady.

380
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,400
You bravely carried out my errand.

381
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,680
You must have been scared.

382
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,060
You did well.

383
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,337
My Lady.

384
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,972
Why did you ask a lowly, young apprentice maid like me

385
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:18,760
to show final respects to somebody

386
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,318
as precious as Royal Concubine Yeong?

387
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:23,380
I wanted to show you

388
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,600
the last moments of a Royal Noble Concubine with the highest rank.

389
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,060
A court lady can't die inside the palace.

390
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,460
Only royalty is allowed to die here.

391
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,360
An old and infirm court lady has to leave the palace.

392
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,160
Regardless of the authority she had while in the palace,

393
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,060
her last moments are always shabby and insignificant.

394
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,460
However, there is an exception.

395
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,850
There is a way to die in the palace.

396
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,060
Win the King's favor.

397
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,140
If you win the King's favor and become a royal concubine,

398
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,460
you gain the right to die inside the palace.

399
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,080
Look at that!

400
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,780
That's an honor reserved only for those favored by the King.

401
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,980
It's every court lady's last wish.

402
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:45,588
I'm sure you wish the same.

403
00:37:45,588 --> 00:37:48,020
Actually, I…

404
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:55,200
don't really understand what you mean.

405
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,620
Such a pretty face.

406
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,210
It will get prettier as you grow up.

407
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,540
Look carefully.

408
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,660
Start dreaming.

409
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,920
A dream that you can surely become like her.

410
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,360
His Highness wants ginseng stew for his midnight snack.

411
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,420
I will inform the kitchen staff.

412
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,480
Yes, Sir.

413
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,300
Why do you do such dangerous things?

414
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:33,227
Thank you for helping me avoid getting caught,

415
00:39:33,227 --> 00:39:34,995
but I refuse to allow you to meddle.

416
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:38,910
Do you think I'm making a fuss only over your absence?

417
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,358
I found it.
[Sagi]
(T/N: Sagi, or Shi Ji, records a history of more than 3,000 years from the ancient Yellow Emperor to the Han Dynasty.)

418
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,060
I found this book in the Crown Prince's library.

419
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,740
You carefully hid this behind other books,

420
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,018
but anyone could have found it if they really wanted to.

421
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,980
Put it back where you found it.

422
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,680
No, you must burn it immediately.

423
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,400
His Majesty banned this book.

424
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,790
Why are you reading this?

425
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,580
What if I read this book because it's banned?

426
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,730
What if I read it because Grandfather His Majesty told me not to?

427
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:16,329
In your eyes, you must see me as a puppet of His Majesty.

428
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,160
Your Highness,

429
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,480
I really don't see you as His Majesty's puppet.

430
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,340
In fact, I'm constantly amazed

431
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,580
by how someone like you can exist.

432
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,040
There is no one else like you in this world.

433
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,180
I consider it a fortune to be able to serve you as my master.

434
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,440
When you eventually reach the throne, you'll usher in a new world.

435
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,110
I, Hong Deok Ro,

436
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,280
want to see that new world.

437
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,324
I always want to serve you.

438
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm sure you'll always be by my side.

439
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,219
Because Grandfather sent you to me.

440
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:10,380
You're always watching everything I do.

441
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,900
Isn't your job to report it to Grandfather?

442
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,480
Take this book back to the library.

443
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,980
Yes, Your Highness.

444
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,180
Everyone, line up, please!

445
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,020
You know the storyteller doesn't come every day!

446
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,380
Sung Deok Im will read for us!

447
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,660
Everyone, line up!

448
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,820
- Read mine first!
- No, mine!

449
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,880
Line up, please!

450
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,320
Why are you cutting in line?

451
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,020
I will read the book of whoever pays me the most first.

452
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,870
"The Story of Hong Gye Wol" is first.

453
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,260
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

454
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,810
- Deok Im.
- Deok Im.

- Deok Im.
- Deok Im?

456
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,020
You! Didn't you just get scolded?

457
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,160
Storytelling, again?

458
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,190
That's how I make the most money.

459
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,160
I don't want to hear it! It's always money with you.

460
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,940
If I save 100 nyang, I'll get my wish. That's what you said!

461
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,560
All right!

462
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,400
Be that as it may, you still have to study!

463
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,637
You are the Crown Prince's maid.

464
00:42:56,637 --> 00:43:00,560
In order to serve him correctly, you'll have to grow up properly.

465
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,640
Honestly, I don't want to serve the Crown Prince.

466
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,620
What?

467
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,080
It's not like I will be paid.

468
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,200
I just wish to be a regular palace servant working at a quiet hall.

469
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,420
You! How can a Crown Prince's maid say that?

470
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,840
Your only duty as a maid of the Crown Prince's Palace

471
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,560
is to think of the well-being of His Highness!

472
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,320
Do you know what will happen to you if the Crown Prince gets ill?

473

[Palace Exile]

474
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,660
Palace exile.

475
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,020
- Palace exile!
- Louder!

476
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,720
- Palace exile!
- Palace exile!

477
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,060
If your immediate superior dies,

478
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,640
all the court ladies of the deceased will exit the palace.

479
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,460
She will immediately leave the palace.

480
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,220
If you don't want to leave, serve your master well.

481
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,720
Understood?

482
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

483
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,440
Okay. Let's take a break.

484
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,160
Here.

485
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,049
Since you couldn't read it today, read it for me next time, okay?

486
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:30,640
Crown Prince…

487
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,120
What?

488
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,170
Please, live a long and healthy life!

489

[Palace Exile]

490
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,480
I will be teaching you something really important.

491
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,220
Close the windows.

492
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,460
Yes, My Lady.

493

Now…

494
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,900
I will be teaching you about the palace taboos.

495
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,800
In the palace, there are banned books.

496
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,440
You'll be punished if you are caught reading them.

497
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,180
There was once a King's Eunuch Officer who was caught reading a banned book.

498
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,060
He was beheaded.

499
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,340
This is the book he was caught reading.

500
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,100
[Sagi]
(T/N - Sagi, or Shi Ji, records a history of more than 3,000 years from the ancient Yellow Emperor to the Han Dynasty)

501
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,740
His Majesty's biological mother was a lowborn.

502
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,280
She was a lowly servant for the court ladies.

503
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,180
Merely a lowly maid.

504
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:42,080
In this book here, called "Sagi" there was a verse.

505
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,310
[Imobia: Your mother is a lowly servant]

506
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,320
Sung Deok Im, please explain.

507
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,880
"Ee" as in "your."

508
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,320
"Mo" as in "mother."

509
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,260
"Bi" as in female servant."
[Imobia: Your mother is a lowly servant]

510
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,764
"Your mother is…"

511
00:47:25,764 --> 00:47:28,280
"a lowly servant."

512
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,260
Because of this particular verse,

513
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,300
His Majesty loathes this book.

514
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,600
Remember.

515
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,360
You are never to read or keep this book.

516
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,700
Understood?

517
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,780
Yes, My Lady.

518
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,540
Are you asleep, My Lady?

519
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,740
What is it?

520
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:27,480
How is the Crown Prince? Is he well?

521
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,200
Yesterday, you had no interest in him.

522
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,600
I…

523
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,440
have nowhere to go outside of the palace.

524
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,260
His Highness is very healthy.

525
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,920
- He will live a very long life.
- I'm relieved.

526
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,700
Deok Im.

527
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,800
Yes.

528
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,380
You are the Crown Prince's maid.

529
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,560
He is your master.

530
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,400
You have to take immense pride

531
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,640
in the fact that you are allowed to take care of him.

532
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:14,300
When that loses its value, your life also loses its value.

533
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,343
Don't let that happen.

534
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:19,550
Yes, My Lady.

535
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,820
My Lady.

536
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,940
I'm going to the bathroom.

537
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,710
I will be going by myself.

538
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,360
Did he really promise?

539
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,260
Will my little princesses be marrying men of noble birth?

540
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,500
As long as you do your job,

541
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,680
I'll do whatever it takes. Tell me.

542
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,320
He found a chance to dethrone the Crown Prince.

543
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,820
- He was reading "Sagi," the banned text.
- Oh, gosh.

544
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,540
His Majesty hates that book!

545
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,025
It was found in the Crown Prince's library.

546
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:36,460
Give His Majesty a slight hint.

547
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,540
In a little while, His Majesty will visit

548
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,360
His Highness for a late-night snack.

549
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,200
All right!

550
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,380
He found a chance to dethrone the Crown Prince.

551
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,418
So…

552
00:51:01,418 --> 00:51:04,800
I will first tell Lady Seo, next…

553
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,332
You are the Crown Prince's maid.

554
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:09,940
His Highness is your master.

555
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,963
I'm the Crown Prince's palace maid.

556
00:51:12,963 --> 00:51:15,049
His Royal Highness…

557
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,420
is my master.

558
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,470
The book is in the Crown Prince's library.

559
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,340
Grandfather!

560
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,500
I made a terrible mistake!

561
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,660
I will never again go against your order nor disappoint you.

562
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,130
Please forgive me!

563
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,660
Oh, dear.

564
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,420
I've treated the crown prince so well!

565
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,540
I've cared for him so much!

566
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,700
You are his mother! Answer me!

567
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,520
What did I do wrong?

568
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,920
Your Majesty

569
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,240
has always

570
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,922
- cared for him with your love—
- Shut your mouth!

571
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,500
Then…

572
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,400
why does the Crown Prince insults me?

573
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,900
I see…

574
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:27,740
He always looked down on his Grandfather's lowly birth.

575
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,840
Yes, that's it!

576
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,100
He's exactly like his father.

577
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,040
He's exactly like his father!

578
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,980
Get away!

579
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,200
Listen closely!

580
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:54,678
What have you been doing?

581
00:52:54,678 --> 00:52:59,580
Bring me that book the Crown Prince has been reading right now!

582
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:05,653
Before I depose him, I want to confirm it with my own eyes.

583
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:09,150
- Right now!
- Yes!

584
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,360
What is it?

585
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,671
Today's class was canceled so I thought I would read a book.

586
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:42,600
You can leave the palace.

587
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,700
I said, exit the palace!

588
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:50,920
As I am His Highness the Crown Prince's playmate, I have to adhere to his command.

589
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,320
I didn't hear an order to leave.

590
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,500
Everyone, search carefully!

591
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,390
Yes!

592
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,280
My Lord! We couldn't find it!

593
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,020
Look everywhere!

594
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,660
Look underneath the table and behind the shelves!

595
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,100
Yes!

596
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,720
Search carefully!

597
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,890
Yes!

598
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,420
I found it!

599
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,240
This isn't the right book!

600
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,400
Don't you know how to read?

601
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,340
I'm so sorry, My Lord.

602
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,950
- Search again!
- Yes!

603
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,280
[Imobia]
(T/N: Imobia - Your mother is a lowly servant)

604
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,040
[Sagi]

605
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,740
Everyone, stop!

606
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,740
Now that we found the book, let's go back to the king's royal chamber.

607
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,080
Yes, My Lord!

608
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,580
Everyone…

609
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:18,840
calls me "Your Majesty" to my face and bows down to me.

610
00:56:20,096 --> 00:56:22,056
Behind my back,

611
00:56:22,056 --> 00:56:27,021
they jeer at me, calling me a lowborn.

612
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:35,561
Do you also look down on me as they do?

613
00:56:38,157 --> 00:56:39,844
I do not look down on you.

614
00:56:39,844 --> 00:56:41,225
Really?

615
00:56:41,225 --> 00:56:44,240
I disobeyed the rules and read the banned book.

616
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,635
Since I broke the king's order, please punish me accordingly.

617
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:51,626
If you order me to step down, I will.

618
00:56:51,626 --> 00:56:58,778
However, Grandfather, I have never looked down on you.

619
00:56:58,778 --> 00:57:02,891
I could have lied about reading the banned book,

620
00:57:02,891 --> 00:57:05,880
but I never did.

621
00:57:06,837 --> 00:57:16,287
I believe that, to show you my genuine affection, I should never lie to you.

622
00:57:18,822 --> 00:57:27,531
On that day in the year of the black horse, you could've taken my life away as well.

623
00:57:29,026 --> 00:57:34,726
But you let me live. You protected me.

624
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:42,154
You chose me as the Crown Prince, as your heir.

625
00:57:42,154 --> 00:57:45,720
I apologize for not having been able to show my gratitude for your generosity.

626
00:58:01,075 --> 00:58:04,204
How arrogant of you.

627
00:58:04,204 --> 00:58:08,429
When you could lie,

628
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:12,700
do you think you can take my place?

629
00:58:26,427 --> 00:58:27,766
Your Majesty,

630
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:31,524
we found the book in the Crown Prince's Library.

631
00:58:46,584 --> 00:58:49,480
This page is torn out.

632
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,240
San!

633
00:58:54,552 --> 00:58:58,732
Did you tear out this page?

634
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:01,560
This book I banned you from reading.

635
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:07,420
You tore out this book to respect my order!

636
00:59:13,112 --> 00:59:15,501
Yes, I did.

637
00:59:16,382 --> 00:59:19,670
I tore out this book.

638
00:59:20,213 --> 00:59:25,101
I was afraid I might read the page you banned

639
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:30,063
so I tore out that page in advance.

640
00:59:30,063 --> 00:59:32,452
Yes, of course.

641
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:35,419
That's my grandson.

642
00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:42,482
I failed to recognize your deep, genuine feelings for me.

643
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:48,133
I got mad just because someone told me you read the banned book.

644
00:59:48,722 --> 00:59:51,038
What should we do?

645
00:59:51,038 --> 00:59:52,940
Oh, my.

646
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:57,056
Your hands are cold.

647
00:59:57,056 --> 00:59:58,823
Why are you just standing there?

648
00:59:58,823 --> 01:00:00,949
The Crown Prince is trembling with cold.

649
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:03,555
Bring me my coat.

650
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:05,660
Right now!

651
01:00:12,435 --> 01:00:14,700
Give it to me!

652
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,110
Here. Here!

653
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:40,550
Your Highness, Crown Prince's playmate Hong Deok Ro is here!

654
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,937
I heard you were looking for me.

655
01:01:06,937 --> 01:01:10,330
I have something to ask you.

656
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:13,677
The book was torn.

657
01:01:13,677 --> 01:01:18,230
The page my Grandfather forbade me to read,

658
01:01:18,995 --> 01:01:21,304
did you tear it out?

659
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,141
Was it you?

660
01:01:28,141 --> 01:01:29,938
Your Highness,

Yes, I did.

663
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:42,230
I was afraid His Majesty would be angry at you.

664
01:01:47,994 --> 01:01:49,925
Thank you, Deok Ro.

665
01:01:49,925 --> 01:01:51,967
You saved me today.

666
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:55,153
I’ll never forget what you did for me today.

667
01:01:55,153 --> 01:01:58,143
It was nothing. It’s an honor, Your Highness.

668

From now on, always stay by my side.

669

When I become King, I will make sure to repay this debt.

Your generosity is immeasurable!

671

Wasn't Deok Im supposed to come today?

672
01:02:24,592 --> 01:02:26,061
We were supposed to go together.

673

I don't know where she went.

We were planning on sneaking into the kitchen tonight.

I don’t think she will stand us up, do you?

- That's right.

Deok Im, this girl,

Let's go back to the palace.

I’m fine now, Mother.

What have you been doing?

691
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:51,799
I have been just looking…

01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:55,040
at my place, where I will live forever.

A while ago, about the favor you asked me...

01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:06,622
Did you find that girl?

695
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:13,249
The apprentice maid you were looking for has already left the palace.

696
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,974
What do you mean she left?

697
01:04:14,974 --> 01:04:16,502
How?

698
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:18,716
She said she was a maid from the crown prince’s palace.

699
01:04:18,716 --> 01:04:23,440
I'm her master. When I am still alive, how could she leave?

700
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,080
Let's just think that she has left.

701

It is better than being dead.

702
01:04:33,433 --> 01:04:38,738
What do you think will happen if His Majesty finds out you went to see Royal Concubine Yeong?

703
01:04:38,738 --> 01:04:43,240
Not only Your Highness, but that maid, too, would receive a great punishment.

704
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:52,141
Don't be too disappointed.

705

With the passing of time, you’ll forget about Royal Concubine Yeong.

706
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,889
I will look for that girl then.

707
01:05:00,889 --> 01:05:04,600
No, you don't need to.

708
01:05:06,186 --> 01:05:12,336
Mother, what you say is true. What would be good in meeting her again?

709
01:05:12,336 --> 01:05:14,061
I'm the Crown Prince,

710
01:05:14,061 --> 01:05:17,428
and she’s just a mere apprentice maid.

711
01:05:17,428 --> 01:05:20,254
We cannot even be friends

712
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:24,442
or sit together and look at each other’s faces as equals.

713
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:30,704
Since you say she left the palace, I will believe you.

714
01:05:32,693 --> 01:05:35,360

I wanted to thank you for being there with me.

You will get sick if you cry too much.

But… it is better for you if you are away.

When somebody is with me, it can get dangerous for them.

729

Whatever danger lies ahead, I will be by your side.

730
