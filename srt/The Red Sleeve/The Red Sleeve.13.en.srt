[This work is based on historical events, but all depiction of details of their lives and motives are fictional.]

2
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:55,130
What I am saying is that

3
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,718
I want you to become my concubine.

4
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:39,465
Captain.

5
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:41,364
Yes, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:43,498
How well

7
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:49,343
do you know the hearts of women?

8
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,054
Pardon?

9
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:52,844
It's nothing.

10
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,703
Your Majesty.

11
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:58,073
If it is a woman's heart you're curious about,

12
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:03,232
I am indeed an expert.

13
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:06,932
What would you like to ask me, Your Majesty?

14
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:08,541
Well…

15
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:11,637
I wonder how…

16
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:15,385
you can win a woman's heart…

17
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,318
Or…

18
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:20,285
how you can…

19
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:26,798
Never mind.

20
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,993
Your Majesty,

21
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:35,638
as you know, I got married not too long ago.

22
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:40,320
I had chased my wife for some time and asked her to marry so many times,

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,642
but she would not give me an answer.

24
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:47,238
She should've said no if she didn't want to marry me, don't you think so?

25
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:50,434
Of course. So?

26
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:54,354
At first, I thought I would seduce her with my manly charms

27
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:57,271
so I made a show of my sword skills…

28
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:59,000
Apologies, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,023
I showed her my agility with bow and arrow with bulls-eye after bulls-eye.

30
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:10,929
But she distanced herself from me saying that I scared her.

31
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:13,550
Why would… So?

32
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,903
One day, as I was training the soldiers,

33
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:19,732
- I hurt my hand.
- I remember that.

34
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,646
I didn't want to show my weakness

35
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:25,888
so I did my best to avoid the object of my affections.

36
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:31,846
But... suddenly, she began to show interest in me.

37
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:34,229
Once, she approached me and asked,

38
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:36,762
"Have you eaten?"

39
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:41,712
When I replied, "I could not eat because of my injured hand,"

40
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:45,637
she fed me a bowl of rice stew.

41
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,307
Once she asked,

42
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:50,167
"Did you wash your face?"

43
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:56,732
When I said, "I could not because of my injured hand,"

44
00:03:56,732 --> 00:04:00,642
she said, "Oh, you filthy man,"

45
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:03,629
and washed my face for me.

46
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:12,688
Do you understand, Your Majesty?

47
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,665
Understand what?

48
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,241
Your Majesty.

49
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:22,124
To win her affections,

50
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:25,735
you must pretend to be weak and pitiful

51
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:30,617
so she may take pity on you.

52
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:34,042
That's the way to a woman's heart.

53
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,502
Pretend to be weak

54
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,060
and pitiful?

55
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,533
Yes, Your Majesty.

56
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,148
Is this true?

57
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:48,620
I would wager my life on it.

58
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,154
Pretend to be weak... and piti—

59
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,375
Captain!

60
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:04,185
It must be assassins!

61
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:06,126
Bring them to me alive.

62
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:07,858
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,317
Attack!

64
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:19,521
An incident has occurred in the palace.

65
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:24,262
The palace was infiltrated by assassins, who made an attempt on the King's life.

66
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,703
Is His Majesty unharmed?

67
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:31,042
Fortunately, he managed to come out of it unscathed.

68
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,995
He has commanded a search.

69
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,981
The assassins must still be hiding in the palace.

70
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,065
Pair up and search the palace grounds.

71
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:43,784
Yes, my lady.

72
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:46,173
- Hurry.
- Let's go together.

73
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,990
Let's go.

74
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:13,369
You don't have anything to do with today's incident, do you?

75
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:16,059
Shouldn't that be obvious?

76
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:21,010
Hey, you. I can't believe you're suspecting me.

77
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:28,727
Did you hear that?

78
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:32,765
What? I didn't hear anything.

79
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:37,059
Something moved over there.

80
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:40,257
Let's go.

81
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:43,271
But we should investigate.

82
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:45,005
Stop!

83
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:55,895
What if it really is an assassin? There are only the two of us.

84
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:58,649
- But we were commanded to search for—
- Hey!

85
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:02,248
We are not even soldiers. We are just going through the motions here.

86
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,729
Do you have a death wish or what?

87
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:13,606
See? There is nothing here.

88
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:15,209
Let's go.

89
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,338
Captain.

90
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:54,482
Yes, Lord Hong?

91
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,867
Arrest the traitor.

92
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,418
Yes, my lord.

93
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:17,480
Arrest her!

94
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,106
Yes, my lord!

95
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,054
How dare a maid of His Majesty's Palace

96
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:40,959
attempt to murder His Majesty?

97
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,251
- Take her away.
- Yes, my lord.

98
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:48,926
Take her away.

99
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:11,631
But…

100
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:13,646
will you be all right?

101
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:14,932
What do you mean?

102
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:17,740
You've falsified your identity.

103
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:21,749
You're listed as the daughter of Princess Hyebin's servant,

104
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:24,607
but your father was a soldier.

105
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,238
My father passed away in the Year of the Horse.

106
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:37,943
Was he

107
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:39,938
a royal guardsman

108
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:42,770
who served the late Crown Prince Sado?

109
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,823
On the day that Prince Sado was locked in the rice chest,

110
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:49,724
all of his guardsmen were also killed.

111
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:56,693
They were branded as traitors for allowing their master to go down a sinful path.

112
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:00,373
Mother could not bear it

113
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:04,253
and decided to follow my father to the grave.

114
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:06,434
Should you be telling me this?

115
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:10,649
If I were to tell our superiors, you could lose your life.

116
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,267
You would never tell. I know you, Wol Hye.

117
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:17,571
Are you sure you know me?

118
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:19,107
Absolutely.

119
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:23,418
You're Wol Hye, and we used to ride on swings and fly kites together when we were young.

120
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,010
Those were such carefree days.

121
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,984
I miss them.

122
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,676
Don't you wish we could go back to those days?

123
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:48,245
Okay. I made up my mind.

124
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:50,951
About what?

125
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,096
We will never be able to go back to those good old days,

126
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:01,243
but you are my friend from those times, so I will protect you.

127
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,873
Wait right here.

128
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:56,047
Deok Im… Deok Im…

129
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,404
Are you here to be interrogated?

130
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:23,339
But you have no bruises.

131
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,795
You are truly His Majesty's favorite.

132
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,406
Wol Hye…

133
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:33,212
Would you brush away my hair?

134
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,963
I can't see very well.

135
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:55,259
That's better.

136
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,793
Their methods of torture were so severe.

137
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:02,985
You committed a crime, so you deserve the punishment.

138
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,704
There were assassins

139
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:10,223
hiding in that brush, weren't there?

140
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:15,755
Why did you let me live?

141
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:20,584
I just wanted to.

142
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:27,390
I deserve to have things my way once in a while, too.

143
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:32,542
What's so wrong with saving the life

144
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,621
of a childhood friend?

145
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:42,603
You are but an ordinary girl.

146
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:45,532
But strangely, I never hated you in any way.

147
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:48,120
Some people are like that.

148
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:52,834
Everyone is fond of them

149
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:56,135
and wants to keep them around.

150
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,181
Such a talent is beneficial

151
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:05,391
outside the palace walls.

152
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,753
But inside the palace,

153
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:10,928
such a talent

154
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,284
can be a liability.

155
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:24,213
If too many people become fond of you,

156
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:30,098
it may not end well.

157
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,413
Goodbye.

158
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:07,424
What about the Food Inspector Court Lady?

159
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:10,942
I heard that she is being interrogated by Chief Royal Secretary Hong.

160
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:18,501
It should suffice that I am unharmed.

161
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:22,404
There is no reason for you to be gloomy because of traitors.

162
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,040
You look like a dog in mourning.

163
00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:33,018
That is such a horrid thing to say.

164
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,749
I am greatly disappointed, Your Majesty.

165
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:39,529
Good. Be angry.

166
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,418
It is better than to see you gloomy and listless.

167
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:50,006
Why don't we make a wager?

168
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:51,590
Pardon?

169
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:57,285
The loser must grant one wish to the winner.

170
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:05,018
So you will grant anything I wish for?

171
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:09,062
Will you do it?

172
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:11,076
Yes, Your Majesty.

173
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,467
You must have a wish that you so desire to come true.

174
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:20,112
A friend of mine was a maid in the King's Palace.

175
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:24,073
But she was discharged from the palace after the Late King's passing.

176
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:30,199
If I were to win the wager, I would like that friend to be reinstated to the palace.

177
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,832
Would you allow it?

178
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,879
I will.

179
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,063
Why are you so happy?

180
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:39,660
There is no guarantee that you will win the wager.

181
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,045
Your Majesty, what would be your wish if you were to win?

182
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:47,204
I wish to hear the answer to the question

183
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,660
that I asked a while ago.

184
00:18:52,968 --> 00:18:55,488
As for the wager,

185
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:59,285
we may wager on whatever game that you wish.

186
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:05,818
Will you do it?

187
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:33,540
Stone skipping is a simple game that the common folk play.

188
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,973
I know.

189
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,832
Have you ever played it?

190
00:19:38,564 --> 00:19:40,603
Only a few times

191
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:42,697
when I was little.

192
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:47,396
I have chosen your stone for you, Your Majesty.

193
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,819
Maiden Sung,

194
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:53,285
that rock is not appropriate.

195
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,265
For skipping stones,

196
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:01,613
stones that are wide and thin are better.

197
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:03,098
Your Majesty,

198
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:05,195
I will give you a demonstration.

199
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:07,329
Look, Your Majesty.

200
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,674
Did you see it?

201
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:23,034
- Now stand back.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

202
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,346
I will let you have a practice throw, so go ahead.

203
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:12,801
Best out of three throws wins the wager.

204
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:13,794
Yes, Your Majesty.

205
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:17,067
- Captain, go find me some stones.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

206
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:25,683
Don't just stand there.

207
00:21:25,683 --> 00:21:27,672
Find yours.

208
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:39,130
This is for His Majesty.

209
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:55,335
I've brought you the best stones.

210
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,307
You may begin.

211
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:06,532
You go first.

212
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,801
I won!

213
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:40,085
I won this time.

214
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:48,376
Is the palace maid you wish to reinstate Kim Bok Yeon?

215
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:50,815
How did you know, Your Majesty?

216
00:22:58,606 --> 00:23:01,662
I saw you with those girls from time to time.

217
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:05,110
You were always smiling,

218
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:07,920
and I always felt

219
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,723
that I was losing what's mine.

220
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:21,020
Do you cherish your friends

221
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:24,768
more than you cherish me?

222
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:58,026
As you have won, I will keep my promise.

223
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:04,072
Your Majesty…

224
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:26,867
- Bok Yeon!
- Bok Yeon!

225
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:28,901
You guys!

226
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:32,271
How have you been?

227
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:35,605
There's no need to cry.

228
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:39,069
I'm wearing this!

229
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:41,278
That was our present to you!

230
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,370
- That looks nice on you.
- I'm wearing all of them.

231
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,606
Bok Yeon.

232
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:52,242
I missed you!

233
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:56,660
Your Majesty,

234
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,195
I have been reunited with my friend thanks to your boundless grace.

235
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,346
I am profoundly grateful.

236
00:25:07,988 --> 00:25:10,123
You must be quite happy.

237
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:11,948
Yes, Your Majesty.

238
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:15,974
Now, you can grind the inkstone.

239
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:39,873
Your Majesty,

240
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,893
have you learned of the people behind the assassination attempt?

241
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,699
I'm glad.

242
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:52,248
Please root out all who are against you.

243
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:58,140
But then I would have to kill them all.

244
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:05,410
Do you think I should kill them?

245
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,202
You should not forgive those who threaten your safety—

246
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:10,753
Your Majesty.

247
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:14,602
Chief Royal Secretary wishes to have an audience with you.

248
00:26:14,602 --> 00:26:16,469
Send him in.

249
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:18,357
Yes, Your Majesty.

250
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:32,373
I told you that I would make the decision tomorrow at the official court.

251
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:40,365
This matter cannot wait.

252
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:45,903
If you do not allow it, I shall remain here begging for your decision.

253
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:52,129
Your Majesty knows that the decision is inevitable.

254
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:55,260
Please execute Prince Eunjeon.

255
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,430
(T/N: Prince Eunjeon is Yi San's half brother)

256
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:05,345
We don't need the tea. Leave us two alone.

257
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:07,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

258
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,692
What's the matter, Deok Im?

259
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:50,472
Aren't you happy that Bok Yeon is back?

260
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:52,317
I am,

261
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,035
but I'm also a little frightened.

262
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:06,364
I think I made a big mistake today.

263
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:08,855
Mistake?

264
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:12,551
I was a little excited because of Bok Yeon's return,

265
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:17,299
so I thanked His Majesty

266
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:20,192
and tried to show him

267
00:28:20,192 --> 00:28:23,063
how concerned I was for his well-being.

268
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:27,231
And I asked him to root out all traitors.

269
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:29,387
What's wrong with that?

270
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:32,335
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.

271
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:37,815
But Prince Eunjeon was among the traitors.

272
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:42,368
Now, His Majesty has to kill his younger brother.

273
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:47,637
In effect, I asked His Majesty to kill his younger brother.

274
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:51,488
Deok Im…

275
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:54,889
You didn't know his brother was a traitor.

276
00:28:54,889 --> 00:29:00,571
You have to watch your mouth in front of His Majesty.

277
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,231
I feel as if I can't even breathe.

278
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:58,450
Traitor Hong Jeong Yeo, come out to hear His Majesty's command!

279
00:30:15,222 --> 00:30:20,581
These days, I've been hearing a lot about you.

280
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:24,957
They say you have His Majesty's favor

281
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:29,538
so all in this kingdom would bow down to your commands.

282
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:32,528
Things have changed quite a bit.

283
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:36,023
And what about you?

284
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:39,335
Do you regret the past?

285
00:30:39,335 --> 00:30:43,974
Of course, I regret it.

286
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:51,946
I should have killed the King when he was still Crown Prince.

287
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:56,607
I should have attacked him

288
00:30:56,607 --> 00:31:00,762
at my fullest strength and the fierceness of a beast

289
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:05,467
and brought an end to his life.

290
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:08,470
Instead, I relied on cunning schemes

291
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:13,810
and elaborate plots only to see an end like this.

292
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:21,382
What?

293
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:27,295
You never thought that you would end up like me?

294
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:33,984
Do you think you will wield such power forever?

295
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:47,326
I am well-aware

296
00:31:47,326 --> 00:31:51,256
that I only wield power thanks to the favor of His Majesty.

297
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:54,334
Maybe someday I might lose that favor.

298
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:59,863
But you need not worry.

299
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:06,359
I am making preparations for such eventualities in the future.

300
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,149
I see.

301
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:16,348
I will observe from beyond the grave whether your plans come to fruition.

302
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:22,976
But I have a sneaking suspicion that we'll meet

303
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:26,407
sooner than you think.

304
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,664
Hey, Deok Ro.

305
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:34,658
I mean, Hong Gook Yeong.

306
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:43,542
The King is a much scarier person than you think.

307
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:49,427
I think I know His Majesty a little better than you.

308
00:32:50,496 --> 00:32:56,668
There are things that can only be seen from a distance.

309
00:32:56,668 --> 00:32:59,321
I think it's time to say our final goodbyes.

310
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:12,316
I only came here to pay my last respects to an elder of the Hong clan.

311
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,606
I shall take my leave.

312
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,973
Aunt, your son has passed away in exile.

313
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:21,679
I called you here as I feel that it is my duty to inform you personally.

314
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:27,299
Did you have him killed, Your Majesty?

315
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,417
Yes.

316
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,737
I had him killed.

317
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:37,838
I killed your son instead of you, Aunt.

318
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:43,306
Take care of yourself as your son exchanged his life for yours.

319
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:47,454
You may leave.

320
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:05,111
Mrs. Jeong, you must pay your respects to His Majesty before you leave.

321
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:19,184
As my life was spared in exchange for my son's,

322
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:22,380
I will not recklessly throw it away.

323
00:36:04,507 --> 00:36:08,569
Watch your step, Your Majesty!

324
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:11,480
- Your Majesty!
- His Majesty is very drunk.

325
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,525
This way.

326
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:16,570
- I'm not drunk.
- No, you aren't.

327
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:22,013
- I will go fetch the doctor.
- Yes.

328
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:26,920
Your Majesty.

329
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,274
Is that you, Deok Im?

330
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:46,760
Thank you for helping me at this late hour.

331
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:54,820
You too, Court Lady Seo. Thank you.

332
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:09,784
Thank you.

333
00:37:10,406 --> 00:37:11,836
- Captain.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

334
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:14,512
I appreciate your help, as well.

335
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:16,326
I am honored, Your Majesty.

336
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:18,293
Today,

337
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:23,488
I will bestow gifts upon the three of you.

338
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:26,307
- I am honored, Your Majesty.
- I am honored, Your Majesty.

339
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:29,330
Now, let's see.

340
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,740
Well... Let's see...

341
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,660
Wait. Right here.

342
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:54,113
Go fetch some honey tea.

343
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:55,677
- Court Lady Seo.
- Yes?

344
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:57,670
Actually, today...

345
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:03,862
Sung Deok Im, where are you going?

346
00:38:03,862 --> 00:38:07,005
I was just about to bestow you with a gift.

347
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:09,354
Draw near.

348
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:22,281
I will present you with a personal gift

349
00:38:22,281 --> 00:38:26,379
which you may hand down in your families.

350
00:38:26,379 --> 00:38:29,720
- Do you understand?
- We are honored, Your Majesty.

351
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:42,895
Thin

352
00:38:42,895 --> 00:38:47,356
and long.

353
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:50,554
- Court Lady Seo.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

354
00:38:50,554 --> 00:38:53,789
How do you like my orchid?

355
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,281
That is a beautiful painting.

356
00:38:57,281 --> 00:39:01,430
Other artists will be green with envy.

357
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:08,721
Nothing can compare to a true masterpiece like this!

358
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:12,419
- Really?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

359
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:15,593
Then this will be yours, Court Lady Seo.

360
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:18,588
I am deeply honored, Your Majesty.

361
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:22,365
- Captain.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

362
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:27,875
Would you also like a painting?

363
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,633
Yes, I would like one, too.

364
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:36,592
Then I will paint an orchid that looks exactly like you.

365
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:38,731
I am honored, Your Majesty.

366
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:55,452
Here. This is for you!

367
00:39:57,515 --> 00:39:58,883
What is this, Your Majesty?

368
00:39:58,883 --> 00:40:04,931
What do you think? It looks just like you, doesn't it?

369
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:10,218
It looks exactly like me!

370
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:18,821
You are very quiet today.

371
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:24,076
Now,

372
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:27,902
I will paint a picture for you, too, Sung Deok Im.

373
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:44,099
Here...

374
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:47,703
How do you like my painting?

375
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:51,907
I must be frank with you, Your Majesty.

376
00:40:56,185 --> 00:40:59,776
I heard that Kim Hong Do is a good painter,
(T/N: Kim Hong Do is a famous artist in Joseon)

377
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:04,292
but your artistic prowess far outshines his.

378
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:06,217
Really?

379
00:41:07,013 --> 00:41:10,673
- Is that so?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

380
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,160
Really? Then I will give this painting to you, Deok Im.

381
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:21,654
I am jealous, Your Majesty.

382
00:41:21,654 --> 00:41:23,563
Please paint me another picture.

383
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:28,365
You mustn't only show favor to Deok Im.

384
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:31,671
If that's what you think,

385
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:36,731
I will paint one more picture for you each.

386
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:39,434
Yes, Your Majesty.

387
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:41,245
I will go fetch some honey tea.

388
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:46,852
All right. Let me paint a picture that looks exactly like the two of you.

389
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,286
Thank you, Your Majesty.

390
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:54,088
This is for the Captain of the Palace Guard.

391
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:02,611
That's incredible!

392
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,140
Take this to the head eunuch.

393
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

394
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:21,388
So His Majesty executed Prince Eunjeon?

395
00:42:22,046 --> 00:42:27,967
During the interrogation, the traitors accused him of treason.

396
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:34,434
That's why His Majesty had no other options but consent to the execution.

397
00:42:35,547 --> 00:42:42,014
For days, he turned down all petitions to execute his brother.

398
00:42:43,326 --> 00:42:46,368
He must be wracked with guilt.

399
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:10,715
Your Majesty, the others—

400
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:13,663
I wished to be alone, so I sent them away.

401
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:17,534
I thought you had left as well.

402
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,909
Have some tea.

403
00:43:56,412 --> 00:43:58,932
You must be heartbroken.

404
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:03,581
You're one to talk.

405
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:09,976
You've broken my heart more than anyone else.

406
00:44:13,123 --> 00:44:15,729
Why do you avoid me?

407
00:44:17,774 --> 00:44:20,484
You never come to the annex building.

408
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:24,446
I've just been preoccupied with work…

409
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:27,990
You've been avoiding being left alone with me, haven't you?

410
00:44:30,388 --> 00:44:34,540
Are you scared that I will pry you for an answer?

411
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:47,448
These days, you treat me as the others do.

412
00:44:47,448 --> 00:44:48,938
I don't understand, Your Majesty.

413
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:52,370
You are frightened of me just as all the others are.

414
00:44:53,893 --> 00:44:57,496
Is it because I killed my own brother?

415
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,816
You don't feel comfortable with the man who killed his own flesh and blood?

416
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:04,321
How can you say such a thing, Your Majesty?

417
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:07,237
Then why do you look at me with such eyes?

418
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:10,537
I see the depth of your pain and suffering.

419
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:15,854
Ever since you ascended the throne, you have been suffering, Your Majesty.

420
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:19,038
Never have you seemed at peace since then.

421
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:21,096
I want to help you,

422
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:23,784
but there is nothing I can do.

423
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,947
So I feel more and more helpless every day.

424
00:45:29,947 --> 00:45:33,715
I wish I were a warrior with great sword skills.

425
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:37,673
Then at least I could protect you with my sword.

426
00:45:38,506 --> 00:45:40,590
Nonsense.

427
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:45,851
I have enough warriors to protect me.

428
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:49,345
You should know fully well

429
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:55,580
what it is that I truly want from you.

430
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:14,156
You're out of luck today.

431
00:46:15,046 --> 00:46:19,802
You and I are all alone.

432
00:46:20,552 --> 00:46:23,184
You are inebriated, Your Majesty.

433
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:27,257
Whatever you tell me today, you will no longer remember tomorrow.

434
00:46:27,257 --> 00:46:28,917
As you said,

435
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:34,095
I will forget everything tomorrow.

436
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:43,115
If I will forget everything that happens today, then I can do whatever I want, right?

437
00:46:43,115 --> 00:46:48,188
While you may forget, Your Majesty, I will not. So please—

438
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:49,987
You're right.

439
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:53,882
You'll remember.

440
00:46:55,495 --> 00:46:57,273
That will be my punishment to you.

441
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:59,043
Punishment?

442
00:46:59,043 --> 00:47:00,760
What did I do wrong?

443
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:08,067
You tried to push me away.

444
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:39,670
Your Majesty?

445
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,046
You will designate a concubine for me?

446
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:39,417
You do not have an heir.

447
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:44,417
If this continues, I will feel guilty towards your late grandfather.

448
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:51,768
It is my duty to designate a concubine to ensure that the royal lineage continues.

449
00:48:51,768 --> 00:48:56,852
I will decide who I keep by my side.

450
00:48:56,852 --> 00:49:00,476
Then hurry and designate your concubine.

451
00:49:00,476 --> 00:49:05,599
You can have any woman you want in the land of Joseon.

452
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:10,371
Is there a woman who would dare decline your proposal?

453
00:49:10,371 --> 00:49:16,888
Please let me handle my own business.

454
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:19,424
This is not just your business.

455
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:24,007
As the Queen Dowager, it is also my business.

456
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:29,267
I will designate a concubine for you.

457
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:32,527
And your duty is to acquiesce.

458
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:39,913
So you will decide my concubine without consulting me?

459
00:49:39,913 --> 00:49:45,985
Did you consult me when you exiled my brother?

460
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:53,123
I gave you my assistance when you were still Crown Prince.

461
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:59,238
However, you forgot about your debt to me as soon as you ascended the throne.

462
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,099
Although you are the ruler of this land,

463
00:50:03,112 --> 00:50:06,348
I hold full discretion in affairs of the royal household.

464
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:10,935
So do not dare disobey me.

465
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:19,904
I will choose a woman who is appropriate for Your Majesty.

466
00:50:32,111 --> 00:50:34,678
- Head Eunuch.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

467
00:50:34,678 --> 00:50:37,532
Where is Mother right now?

468
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,909
Why have you allied yourself with the Queen Dowager?

469
00:50:45,113 --> 00:50:50,657
When you tried to kill my brother and nephews,

470
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:56,765
I wished for Queen Dowager to help me.

471
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:59,102
That is why I did not object to her choosing your concubine.

472
00:50:59,102 --> 00:51:01,788
I had no reason to.

473
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,331
In any case, it is merely a formality.

474
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:10,779
The woman who will be your concubine has already been chosen.

475
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:13,112
Who is it?

476
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:17,973
Is it Hong Deok Ro's sister?

477
00:51:17,973 --> 00:51:21,552
Lord Hong is a loyal subject, so his sister will be—

478
00:51:21,552 --> 00:51:27,413
Would a loyal subject meet you without my consent?

479
00:51:27,413 --> 00:51:32,801
So you introduced Lord Hong to Queen Dowager?

480
00:51:34,379 --> 00:51:39,599
You must be overjoyed as Hong Deok Ro is part of

481
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,099
the Hong clan as are you.

482
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,856
- Your Majesty.
- Yes?

483
00:51:44,856 --> 00:51:49,502
Everything worked out as you intended, Mother.

484
00:51:49,502 --> 00:51:53,360
My Queen is a lady from the highest aristocracy.

485
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,856
The new concubine will also be a member of the aristocracy

486
00:51:56,856 --> 00:52:00,146
and also a member of the Hong clan like yourself.

487
00:52:01,112 --> 00:52:03,920
Are you satisfied?

488
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,850
Your Majesty.

489
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:11,457
I understand why you are upset.

490
00:52:11,457 --> 00:52:16,627
It's because you already hold another woman dear in your heart.

491
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:25,242
Do you know whom I called when Lord Hong visited me?

492
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:30,479
I called Sung Deok Im.

493
00:52:31,787 --> 00:52:37,349
I asked her to be your concubine

494
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:40,295
and always support you.

495
00:52:40,295 --> 00:52:43,942
My apologies, Your Highness.

496
00:52:43,942 --> 00:52:48,030
I do not wish to be his concubine.

497
00:52:56,153 --> 00:52:58,096
Did she

498
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:03,662
truly say those words?

499
00:53:03,662 --> 00:53:05,800
Your Majesty,

500
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,942
I can force the girl to become your concubine if you wish.

501
00:53:10,942 --> 00:53:13,743
While I am fond of the girl,

502
00:53:14,721 --> 00:53:18,830
you are my son and more precious to me than my own life.

503
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:25,599
What would you have me do?

504
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:41,582
Your Majesty, is this the book you are looking for?

505
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:53,196
The book was merely an excuse to call you here.

506
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,009
There is something I must ask you.

507
00:54:01,264 --> 00:54:04,246
Did you see my mother?

508
00:54:07,356 --> 00:54:13,959
Did she request that you be my concubine?

509
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:16,088
Yes, Your Majesty.

510
00:54:16,088 --> 00:54:18,659
And you turned her down?

511
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:21,245
That is true, Your Majesty.

512
00:54:26,927 --> 00:54:32,949
Why must I hear such a thing from my mother?

513
00:54:34,436 --> 00:54:37,370
Whether you accept or decline,

514
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,940
I should have been informed directly!

515
00:54:44,422 --> 00:54:46,740
What are you so scared of?

516
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:54,204
No matter how angry I am, I would never harm you.

517
00:55:01,273 --> 00:55:04,417
Why do you not wish to become my concubine?

518
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:07,162
It is because I will lose everything.

519
00:55:07,162 --> 00:55:09,731
I do not understand you.

520
00:55:09,731 --> 00:55:11,417
Make yourself clearer.

521
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:13,124
If I become your concubine,

522
00:55:13,124 --> 00:55:18,353
I must give you my everything and nothing of my own will remain.

523
00:55:20,722 --> 00:55:23,131
It is human nature

524
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:28,093
to want everything from the man that you give your everything to.

525
00:55:28,093 --> 00:55:32,960
However, Your Majesty, you cannot give your entire self to me.

526
00:55:34,057 --> 00:55:35,273
I will

527
00:55:35,273 --> 00:55:40,280
merely be just one of the countless women in your life.

528
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:47,135
But my entire life will change and there will be no going back.

529
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:55,760
I'm afraid that I'll lose everything.

530
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:04,557
Are you afraid you'll lose my affection?

531
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:06,374
No, Your Majesty.

532
00:56:06,374 --> 00:56:10,350
I am afraid I will lose myself.

533
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:19,932
I will postpone my proposal for a while.

534
00:56:22,498 --> 00:56:28,365
I will postpone it, but I will not forget.

535
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:19,888
Hello, Assistant Counselor.

536
00:57:19,888 --> 00:57:24,418
Chief State Councilor, have you seen the notice?

537
00:57:24,418 --> 00:57:28,768
Queen Dowager has issued an edict.

538
00:57:28,768 --> 00:57:30,302
I know.

539
00:57:30,302 --> 00:57:32,729
So they will choose a concubine?

540
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:37,668
Do you know who the strongest candidate is?

541
00:57:37,668 --> 00:57:40,680
Isn't it obvious?

542
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:47,217
Hello, Lord Hong. Welcome.

543
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:50,440
You look especially handsome today.

544
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:03,471
Your Excellency.

545
00:58:03,471 --> 00:58:05,580
Hello.

546
00:58:33,598 --> 00:58:35,740
As the selection of the concubine is the business of the Queen Dowager,

547
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:40,112
I forbid any discussion of it in the royal court.

548
00:58:40,112 --> 00:58:45,907
The fate of the entire nation hinges on the production of a royal heir.

549
00:58:45,907 --> 00:58:49,759
We cannot ignore such an important issue.

550
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:52,632
Only the Queen Dowager has the power

551
00:58:52,632 --> 00:58:56,504
to select the woman who will be my concubine.

552
00:58:56,504 --> 00:59:01,547
There is nothing I can do but accept the choice that has been made by the royal elder.

553
00:59:02,358 --> 00:59:07,515
A truly loyal servant would not involve himself in this affair.

554
00:59:09,176 --> 00:59:11,353
Your Majesty,

555
00:59:23,499 --> 00:59:25,932
I, Shim Hwi Won,

556
00:59:25,932 --> 00:59:30,515
would like to ask you one question.

557
00:59:30,515 --> 00:59:32,257
You may talk, Assistant Counselor.

558
00:59:32,257 --> 00:59:35,424
I still fail to understand

559
00:59:35,424 --> 00:59:39,400
Your Majesty's grand scheme.

560
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:44,102
Your Majesty always stays at the royal library

561
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:49,021
and insists on consorting with officials of lowly backgrounds.

562
00:59:49,021 --> 00:59:50,983
I would be remiss if I didn't ask

563
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:55,046
what use you have for such people.

564
00:59:55,046 --> 01:00:01,099
What is your grand scheme moving forward?

565
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:09,810
I wish to get rid of some abuses among government officials.

566
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:13,806
Also, there are three things that I wish to accomplish.

567
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:18,709
I'm not even Emperor Yao.
(T/N: Emperor Yao was a legendary Chinese ruler)

568
01:00:18,709 --> 01:00:21,813
Three could be too ambitious.

569
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:24,760
Two should be enough.

570
01:00:29,646 --> 01:00:35,907
Actually, come to think of it. Even two is too many.

571
01:00:35,907 --> 01:00:40,394
If I can accomplish just one, that will be satisfactory.

572
01:00:43,055 --> 01:00:45,177
Irrigation.

573
01:00:45,177 --> 01:00:46,866
Irrigation?

574
01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:51,284
Are you talking about fixing the waterworks?

575
01:00:51,284 --> 01:00:55,767
I mean building dams and irrigation channels to prevent flooding and famine.

576
01:00:55,767 --> 01:01:04,216
Your Majesty, there is a government institution for that purpose.

577
01:01:04,216 --> 01:01:05,926
But

578
01:01:08,017 --> 01:01:13,060
I think that nothing is more important than waterworks

579
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,279
and nothing is more urgent.

580
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:21,349
So let us discuss this matter.

581
01:01:22,185 --> 01:01:25,951
Assistant Counselor I would like to hear your thoughts on this matter.

582
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:30,414
My apologies, Your Majesty.

583
01:01:31,969 --> 01:01:34,158
I do not have any thoughts on this.

584
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:45,373
Does anyone have an opinion on this matter?

585
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:36,610
Your Majesty, I was worried that you would not come.

586
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:49,170
As we are choosing your companion, it is only befitting that you attend.

587
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:57,233
Oh, it's you.

588
01:02:57,233 --> 01:02:58,576
Your Highness.

589
01:02:58,576 --> 01:03:00,679
I'm glad to see you.

590
01:03:00,679 --> 01:03:02,918
Lately, I've been feeling bored.

591
01:03:02,918 --> 01:03:06,712
Why don't you drop by and read me some books?

592
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:10,058
If you wish,

593
01:03:10,058 --> 01:03:12,630
I will select some court ladies who read well

594
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:15,830
and send them to your palace.

595
01:03:15,832 --> 01:03:18,688
I like her.

596
01:03:22,815 --> 01:03:26,537
Do as Her Highness wishes.

597
01:03:27,339 --> 01:03:29,563
Yes, Your Majesty.

598
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:34,387
Your Majesty.

599
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:38,596
Your grandma is feeling a bit dizzy.

600
01:03:38,596 --> 01:03:42,805
Would you assist me as I walk?

601
01:04:04,584 --> 01:04:09,972
As Grandmother, let me give you a piece of advice.

602
01:04:11,184 --> 01:04:14,993
There is nothing wrong with desiring something.

603
01:04:15,927 --> 01:04:22,899
Now that you are king, you may desire anything.

604
01:04:22,899 --> 01:04:28,344
If you wish it to be so, you may command it to be so.

605
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:33,699
I don't understand what you are trying to say, Your Highness.

606
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:38,880
I can always help you if you need anything.

607
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,150
I just want you to know that.

608
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:47,592
The only thing I wish is to be a good king.

609
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:51,061
I try my best to ignore trivial matters.

610
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:54,422
You must try harder then.

611
01:04:55,669 --> 01:05:00,194
You have not accomplished anything in my opinion.

612
01:05:00,194 --> 01:05:02,975
You've killed your granduncle

613
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:06,075
and the adopted son of your aunt

614
01:05:06,075 --> 01:05:08,800
and even your own brother.

615
01:05:15,513 --> 01:05:22,458
I know that you had to struggle to survive.

616
01:05:24,493 --> 01:05:29,482
But I see nothing

617
01:05:29,482 --> 01:05:32,790
that you have accomplished so far.

618
01:05:55,726 --> 01:06:01,732
As you know, Princess Wonbin has been selected as His Majesty's concubine.

619
01:06:01,732 --> 01:06:05,805
She must first learn the protocols and etiquette of the palace.

620
01:06:05,805 --> 01:06:10,561
Court Lady Kwon has left for the Concubine Wonbin's Palace.

621
01:06:10,561 --> 01:06:14,855
There must be no problems during her absence.

622
01:06:14,855 --> 01:06:16,754
Do you understand?

623
01:06:16,754 --> 01:06:19,572
Yes, my lady.

624
01:06:22,725 --> 01:06:26,113
Lord Hong is quite impressive.

625
01:06:26,113 --> 01:06:29,202
He received promotion after promotion

626
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:33,350
and now, his sister has been designated His Majesty's concubine.

627
01:06:34,821 --> 01:06:37,496
You were always so infatuated with him.

628
01:06:37,496 --> 01:06:39,688
Do you see who he really is now?

629
01:06:39,688 --> 01:06:43,125
He is an ambitious powermonger.

630
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:46,405
Don't you dare badmouth Sir Preceptor.

631
01:06:46,405 --> 01:06:48,386
He's no longer Sir Preceptor.

632
01:06:48,386 --> 01:06:52,379
He is a Lord Chief Royal Secretary who wields tyrannical power.

633
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:57,174
You know, he tortured dozens of court ladies for treason.

634
01:06:57,174 --> 01:07:01,369
I hear even innocent ones were tortured.

635
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:02,840
Kyung Hee…

636
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,010
That's enough.

637
01:07:07,043 --> 01:07:10,165
Maiden Sung?

638
01:07:12,842 --> 01:07:13,964
Concubine Wonbin!

639
01:07:13,965 --> 01:07:16,282
It is you!

640
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,969
I really wanted to see you again.

641
01:07:20,366 --> 01:07:21,755
Look.

642
01:07:21,755 --> 01:07:26,414
I still have the fragrance pouch that you gave me.

643
01:07:26,414 --> 01:07:30,868
My brother would talk about you from time to time.

644
01:07:30,868 --> 01:07:36,686
He said that you were a good person, that you were trustworthy.

645
01:07:37,585 --> 01:07:40,184
Your Highness the Concubine Wonbin!

646
01:07:40,184 --> 01:07:42,768
Your Highness!

647
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:47,429
Where are you, Your Highness Wonbin?

648
01:07:58,223 --> 01:08:04,210
His Majesty will be going to the Concubine Wonbin's Palace tonight.

649
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:06,032
Yes, my lady.

650
01:08:06,032 --> 01:08:12,780
He is not going to come back tonight so there's no use standing there.

651
01:08:13,563 --> 01:08:16,794
Here. I'll give you a present.

652
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,279
What is it?

653
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,347
It has cotton in it. It's very soft and nice to hold onto.

654
01:08:23,347 --> 01:08:27,161
Why don't you lean on the wall and get some shut-eye?

655
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,693
Thank you, my lady.

656
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:53,343
To wait for His Majesty all night long

657
01:08:53,343 --> 01:08:58,154
is the duty of his handmaid.

658
01:08:58,154 --> 01:09:01,257
So

659
01:09:01,257 --> 01:09:03,050
clear your mind of useless thoughts.

660
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:05,449
♫ It's like the night sky where the moon has set ♫

661
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:08,800
You have to get used to waiting.

662
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:13,900
You're just a palace maid who serves the King.

663
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:20,160
♫ Even the flower petals ♫

664
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,910
♫ Fall down one by one ♫

665
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:30,190
♫ Love, that is no extraordinary feeling ♫

666
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:37,420
♫ With those feelings, I've endured those lonely days ♫

667
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:46,000
♫ In your tight embrace ♫

668
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,970
♫ I held back my tears ♫

669
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:57,960
♫ You've fully occupied my life ♫
