[Episode 2]

4
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,605
This was done by a beast.

5
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:47,652
A tiger came into Hanseong and murdered twelve people.

6
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:50,751
I'm sure it was the same tiger.

7
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:56,124
Three people have already died.

8
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:58,521
Why isn't anyone coming?

9
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,358
Are the Hanseong Ministry and Police Bureau not doing anything about this?

10
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:08,908
- Go after it.
- Your Highness.

11
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:11,994
Your Highness! Let's go!

12
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,174
Woo Ik, go east and stop the tiger from going down to the private homes.

13
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,690
Yes, Your Highness.

14
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,320
Let's go!

15
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,549
Your Highness.

16
00:02:57,894 --> 00:02:59,465
He's still alive.

17
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:01,521
It must have known it was being chased.

18
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:04,979
It left behind the food it was dragging.

19
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,237
That tiger knows about people.

20
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:10,033
It's very cunning and smart.

21
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:12,822
You save him and take him to the Village Hospital.

22
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:14,213
Yes.

23
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,686
We rejoice at your safe return!

24
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:35,625
How could you leave the palace without the King's permission?

25
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:39,317
Do you know how worried I was?

26
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:22,289
What happened to the man who was taken to the Village Hospital?

27
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:27,779
He was treated by the doctor but couldn't be saved.

28
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:34,285
Starting today, take all the private bodyguards and chase that tiger.

29
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:37,333
Your Highness, we need His Majesty's permission.

30
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,710
I will write an appeal to His Majesty.

31
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,336
We must get his permission—

32
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:51,979
Your Highness!

33
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:55,668
You dare to try to assassinate the Crown Prince?

34
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:58,602
No... that is not true! I'm just an apprentice maid!

35
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,983
Hurry and save His Highness first.

36
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:03,041
You go in first.

37
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:06,596
I'm afraid of water.

38
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,516
You're scaring me!

39
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,495
Do not worry!

40
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:12,833
I will bring him back!

41
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,021
- Your Highness!
- Hurry and untie this for me!

42
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:19,624
Take his hands! Your Highness!

43
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:21,983
Be careful, Your Highness! She might be an assassin!

44
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:24,893
No, I'm not! I'm just an apprentice maid!

45
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:27,840
Are you all right, Your Highness?

46
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,532
She could be an assassin, Your Highness!

47
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,343
I will protect you, Your Highness!

48
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:33,724
Are you all right?

49
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,086
Why can I not take off my armor?

50
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:39,137
I will help you. Don't worry!

51
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:41,378
Are you all right, Your Highness?

52
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,544
Let me help you up…

53
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,549
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

54
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,054
Your Highness! Your Highness!

55
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:52,726
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

56
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,806
Are you all right?

57
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:56,344
Your Highness.

58
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,342
Your Highness.

59
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:07,950
Your Highness. Your Highness.

60
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,774
You!

61
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,962
Your Highness.

62
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,887
I have committed a grave sin.

63
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,926
If you forgive me this once,

64
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:27,103
I will be deeply indebted and never forget your generosity.

65
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:32,812
Please forgive this foolish and inadequate girl, Your Highness.

66
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:35,607
His Highness has already left.

67
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:38,916
Pardon?

68
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:44,741
He wants you to write a letter of apology.

69
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:47,507
A letter of apology?

70
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,709
Is that all I need to do?

71
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,004
Try your best.

72
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:57,124
Bring it to the Crown Prince's quarters in three days.

73
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:10,128
Will a letter of apology suffice?

74
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,055
I still can't believe it!

75
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:26,378
I can't believe I'm transcribing a book with His Majesty's granddaughters.

76
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:31,019
We can share refreshments like companions.

77
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,826
Deok Im is running late.

78
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:39,696
What if the princesses arrive first?

79
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:43,430
She's the first one to do it.

80
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,216
Deok Im!

81
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:52,975
Deok Im!

82
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:02,521
- How on earth...?
- Why are you soaking wet?

83
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:09,006
Deok Im, what happened?

84
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:18,161
Wow! So you met our older brother?

85
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,260
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,386
How did he look?

87
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:26,895
Don't you think he's handsome?

88
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:30,469
I shouldn't dare to look straight at His Highness's face so...

89
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:35,423
True. Did he not say anything else?

90
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:40,013
Actually,

91
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:44,301
I received punishment for doing something wrong.

92
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:49,247
It's not a huge punishment. He wants me to write a letter of apology.

93
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,218
A letter of apology?

94
00:08:56,246 --> 00:09:00,904
Deok Im! If it's too much for you, you can come to my house.

95
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:03,125
All right?

96
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,649
You can come to mine as well.

97
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,166
Excuse me?

98
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:13,527
If it were me, I wouldn't have let Young Hee and Bok Yeon join you.

99
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:17,986
Yes, we are close, but it is true that they have bad handwriting.

100
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:19,723
Just because they asked, you accepted.

101
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:22,057
You have to work all night to fix their mistakes.

102
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:24,079
We have nothing to gain.

103
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,194
Why are you so foolish?

104
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:30,469
What do you mean by "we didn't gain anything"? We saw their happy faces.

105
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:34,147
It's not even a big deal. It only allowed us to work together.

106
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,428
And they are already that happy about it.

107
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:38,948
So is this how you're going to live?

108
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:42,562
Kyung Hee, we are all palace maids, after all.

109
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:45,060
We can never leave the Palace.

110
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,951
Whether we gain or lose...

111
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:50,672
What's the point?

112
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:56,239
There is not much I can do here as who I truly am.

113
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,654
Even if it's trivial, it's okay.

114
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:01,617
I want to live my life by making choices.

115
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:05,420
I decided to let Young Hee and Bok Yeon join.

116
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,475
It was my decision.

117
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:05,263
Let's light up and be wary of everything.

118
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,904
Yes, Sir!

119
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:29,020
Make sure the King doesn't find out.

120
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,553
Yes, Sir!

121
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,000
His Highness is waiting.

122
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,456
Yes.

123
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,772
[The son of a sinner cannot be the King]

124
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:19,847
I will convene a meeting.

125
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:23,425
Your Highness, let's wait for daybreak.

126
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,452
If you move now, the King will find out.

127
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:29,670
If His Majesty were to find out about the contents of this anonymous letter...

128
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,137
I don't know if it will be beneficial or harmful.

129
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:35,758
Are you certain, Your Highness?

130
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,827
I will catch the criminal for you.

131
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:47,825
Even if it takes several years or even decades,

132
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:50,261
I will definitely catch him.

133
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:54,766
Will you wait for me?

134
00:12:56,997 --> 00:13:01,294
Several decades is too much.

135
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,050
[May you live a long life.]

136
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,989
"I have made a grave mistake."

137
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,811
"Your Highness's generosity of forgiving me."

138
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:23,828
"It will be deeply engraved in my bones."

139
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:28,434
"I will definitely pay you back."

140
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:33,722
"May you live a long life. Long live the King!"'

141
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:38,383
It's finished. It's perfect!

142
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:40,025
Deok Im!

143
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:42,723
Do this for me.

144
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,884
Sa Wol isn't good at this.

145
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:53,394
My Lady.

146
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:59,362
When does His Highness normally feel best?

147
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:02,513
I'm not sure.

148
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:04,788
Usually during his snack time,

149
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:08,481
or when he's chatting with the local government officials.

150
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:11,408
Why do you ask?

151
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:16,150
Just curious.

152
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,942
Why are you curious?

153
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,133
Actually…

154
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:25,940
My Lady, the Head Court Lady is here.

155
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,517
- Help me up…
- Hurry, My Lady!

156
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,073
There is no special news in the jobo.
(T/N: Jobo - State Newspaper)

157
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:48,263
I heard His Majesty and the Queen, Her Highness, are resting comfortably.

158
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,297
But…

159
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:54,208
I think something happened in the Crown Prince Palace last night.

160
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,180
The light was on all night.

161
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:59,983
I hope it's nothing.

162
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,447
I'm worried for some reason.

163
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:07,733
When the Crown Prince's palace maids come back from their duty, report back to me.

164
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,816
Yes, My Lady.

165
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:12,516
I hope you have a great day.

166
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:15,292
Yes, My Lady.

167
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:28,245
I have a feeling His Highness won't be in a good mood.

168
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:32,854
I don't feel like working this morning.

169
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:12,735

[quoting from the book, Supplement to the Exposition on the Great Learning by Qiu Jun]

178
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:49,795
In ruling a country…

179
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:54,422
Nothing is more urgent than providing for the people.

180
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,861
This particular phrase in the Supplement to the Exposition on the Great Learning...

181
00:17:56,861 --> 00:18:01,218
I think it is a virtue that you have to keep in mind forever, Your Highness.

182
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:03,408
I will bear that in mind.

183
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:06,564
Your Highness, instead of the king of a country,

184
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:10,172
have you ever wanted to be just an ordinary man?

185
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,818
Not even once.

186
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:16,529
Have you ever felt that being a crown prince was a burden?

187
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,387
How can a person who received Heaven's will complain?

188
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:24,874
As the Crown Prince, I can read as much as I want.

189
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:27,883
I have well-informed people around me.

190
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:32,434
It is worthwhile to use my good fortune entirely for the sake of Joseon.

191
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:34,510
I can't trade it for anything.

192
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,523
But is it not still difficult?

193
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:41,897
How can I complain when there are people that are starving?

194
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:43,477
I wear silk clothes, and

195
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:47,799
I eat great food. If I still complain,

196
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,257
I would be a worthless person.

197
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:53,456
That is an excellent answer, Your Highness.

198
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:56,456
The heavenly commandments come down to me.

199
00:18:56,456 --> 00:19:01,470
In the future, I will carry the fate of the entire nation.

200
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:04,215
I won't hide or run away

201
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:09,113
from the heavenly commandments.

202
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:31,677
All the court ladies are afraid of His Highness.

203
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:34,307
They call him "The Tiger Crown Prince."

204
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:39,707
Where the Crown Prince is located is called the Goblin's Square.

205
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:43,597
But I think the Crown Prince

206
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,623
is an admirable person.

207
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,870
[...providing for the people]

Are you the maid in charge of looking after this library?

00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,487
Yes.

210
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:02,160
You can see the class location well from here.

211

You can hear everything, right?

212
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,576
Did you see or hear anything suspicious recently?

213
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:17,418
Pardon?

214
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:19,997
Don't make me ask you twice.

215
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:23,340
Was there anyone who snooped around here secretly?

216
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,413
Did you not see any spies?

217
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:30,586
Who in the world is spying on who?

218
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:33,242
Who are you, by the way?

219
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:38,131
Who are you to suddenly come in and ask me these questions?

220
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,831
I am…

221
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,109
You don't need to know.

222
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:06,015
Now you feel like talking.

223
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:09,959
Are you trying to bribe a palace maid with this little money?

224
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,748
Is five nyang not enough?
(T/N: nyang - old Korean currency)

225
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:14,863
Do you think I'm only worth five nyang?

226
00:22:17,884 --> 00:22:20,259
This is the Crown Prince's library.

227
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:23,015
Even if he doesn't come here because it's old and shabby,

228
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:25,422
it still belongs to the Crown Prince His Highness for sure.

229
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:29,318
Also, even though I'm still an apprentice maid, I'm the Crown Prince's palace maid.

230
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:33,115
How dare you bribe His Highness's subject?

231

Are you… His Highness's subject?

232

233
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:51,532

- Didn't I tell you to stop?

Sir Preceptor,

327
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,980
that's what I am.

328
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,966
Sir Preceptor?

329
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,074
Liar.

330
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:35,363
What?

331
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:37,800
I am the Royal Preceptor.

332
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,359
I heard he was really handsome.

333
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:47,010
- What?
- Since he's the most handsome in Hanseong, I heard he's very sought after.

334
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,230
You're disappointed

335
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,480
now that you have seen me?

336
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:55,576
You know how rumors are.

337
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,970
The words and actions of the Crown Prince

338
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,320
should not be overheard.

339
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,440
I will let you go today since I don't have proof.

340
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,070
You...

341
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,950
better be careful.

342
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,955
The "most handsome in Hanseong."

343
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,550
Hey.

344
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,020
Did you just throw salt on me?

345
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,605
Open this door when I'm still kind.

346
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:52,497
Hurry!

347
00:31:52,497 --> 00:31:53,650
What

348
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,590
do you think you're…

349
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,693
Salt?

350
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,805
How…

351
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,153
How…

352
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,025
Your Highness.

353
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,790
The "most handsome man"

354
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,374
"in Hanseong."

355
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,207
- Excuse me?
- It's nothing.

356
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,500
Your Highness.

357
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,510
I'm sorry

358
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,130
but see me for a second.

359
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,674
It's a report posted by the Police Bureau.

360
00:33:18,674 --> 00:33:19,973
Please read it.

361
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:21,784
(Gyebon: documents submitted when asking the king about a big issue)

362
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,846
That's okay.

363
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:27,490
What's the use of reading excuses from incompetent people?

364
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,901
You seem very irritated.

365
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,482
The Crown Prince's palace maids

366
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:35,805
complain to me that you scare them.

367
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,801
Who cares what they say?

368
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,660
If it involved me,

369
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,920
would you listen?

370
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,130
I feel kind of heavy

371
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,320
knowing my master's mind is not at ease.

372
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,192
I want to take you somewhere.

373
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,963
Is today the palace maids' festival day?

374
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:06,520
It's in ten days.

375
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,810
They are just rehearsing.

376
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,770
If they are all playing like that,

377
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,499
who is taking care of their superiors?

378
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:14,563
The other court ladies are taking care of it.

379
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,410
They seem excited.

380
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,410
The Eunuch Officer and the guards are also coming to see them on the festival day.

381
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,900
Seeing the palace maids having fun...

382
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,000
Does that make you upset?

383
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,898
They're useless games.

384
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:34,600
Never mind. They got royal assent afterall.

385
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,925
Line up! Sung Deok Im is about to read a book!

386

387

Line up! Sung Deok Im is reading!

394
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,661
The novel I'm reading today…

395
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:31,183
It's set in the royal family of the Han Dynasty.

396
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:35,050
It's a story of two brothers' tragedy.

397
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,830
"We are brothers born from the same womb"

398
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:53,360
"Why does the King hate only me?"

399
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,390
"As you grow up,"

400
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,270
"my worries grow bigger."

401
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,740
"Because of you,"

402
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,577
"I'm no longer"

403
00:37:03,577 --> 00:37:05,687
"needed."

404
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,950
"The more he likes you,"

405
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,550
"the more he hates me."

406
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,690
"Hate ripens as"

407
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,960
"the kindness deepens."

408
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,466
"Young brother…"

409
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:19,860
"you"

410
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,580
"were born to kill me."

411
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,287
"Because of you, I lost my father's favor."

412
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:30,230
"I'm... forever in despair."

413
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,920
"Because you and I are brothers,"

414
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,470
"we always look alike."

415
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,140
"How did"

416
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,460
"our situation change so much?"

417
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,231
I told you not to come.

418
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,249
But…

419
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,395
I heard you were leaving the Palace.

420
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,109
I wanted to give a proper goodbye to Father His Highness.

421
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:57,820
He just wanted

422
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,850
to say farewell to his parents.

423
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,741
Do you not know your own son?

424
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:06,194
I don't even know my parents. Would I know my son?

425
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,627
Go away!

426
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,016
His Majesty says he's only taking you with him!

427
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,880
Grandfather

428
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,790
is only taking me.

429
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,679
Then what about Father…

430
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,853
I'm not needed as long as that child exists.

431
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,601
He was born to kill me!

432
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:47,935
- No!
- He was born to kill me!

433
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,980
No!

434
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,073
"You were born to kill me."

435
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:04,540
He was born to kill me.

436
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,447
That's all for today!

437
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,967
Please read more!

438
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,410
Let's go back.

439
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,836
Yes.

440
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,908
Are you still transcribing at night?

441
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,130
Is all that money

442
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,160
not enough?

443
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,270
What…

444
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,380
Why are you here?

445
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,430
I just needed a place to be alone.

446
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,198
You are the intruder.

447
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:09,600
All right. Then stay alone.

448
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,620
Are you making enough money?

449
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,708
Pardon?

450
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,030
I'm talking about the paegwansoseol.

451
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,780
(T/N: Paegwansoseol - a folktale novel)

452
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,950
People

453
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,380
like it.

454
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,355
I don't.

455
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:27,930
Novels only mess up my mind.

456
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,583
It stimulates false curiosity.

457
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:34,927
It just makes people curious about the end.

458
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,442
You just

459
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:49,024
make money by using your tricks.

460
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,148
No matter how the listener feels

461
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:55,127
doesn't matter to you.

462
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,228
How did you know I read books?

463
00:40:59,228 --> 00:41:01,518
Did you come to the palace maids' residence?

464
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:03,744
You could get in real trouble.

465
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:06,110
Don't read.

466
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,210
You're not supposed to read books to people.

467
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,707
How dare he?

468
00:41:31,707 --> 00:41:34,774
He told me to stop reading books.

469
00:41:34,774 --> 00:41:36,853
What do you think?

470
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:41,007
- Deok Im.
- In the first place, it was him that eavesdropped on me reading a book!

471
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,390
Here is more work.

472
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,301
Can you do it alone?

473
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:00,112
Yes, My Lady.

474
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:02,420
Let me know if you can't handle it.

475
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,220
If you don't say it first,

476
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,270
no one will know.

477
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,405
Don't worry.

478
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,762
Deok Im,

479
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:30,151
if you really met the Sir Preceptor,

480
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:33,755
don't curse him in front of others.

481
00:42:33,755 --> 00:42:36,506
- Why not?
- You might get arrested.

482
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:40,396
You might be dragged into a well in the middle of the night.

483
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:42,180
By whom?

484
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,449
You have to pick it once.

485
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,207
What is this?

486
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:01,794
- Why do we have to do this every day?
- Let's not this anymore.

487
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,460
I got it.

488
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,540
I got it.

489
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,721
You will get it tomorrow.

490
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:14,144
Deok Im, Young Hee!

491
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:16,770
I got it!

492
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:20,092
I'll bring water to Sir Preceptor tomorrow morning.

493
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:22,280
Water? What water?

494
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,900
Every time Sir Preceptor

495
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,810
comes to the Palace, every morning,

496
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,398
he drinks water by the well.

497
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:31,580
I will give it to him tomorrow morning.

498
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,376
I'm so happy!

499
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,387
Sir Preceptor is so wonderful!

500
00:43:49,387 --> 00:43:53,255
When he passes by

501
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,508
I can feel a spring breeze.

502
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,350
Spring breeze, my foot.

503
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,840
It's more like a gust whenever he opens his mouth.

504
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,575
There are a lot of women who are infatuated with someone like that.

505
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:07,750
I don't understand.

506
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,092
Are you all right?

507
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,821
I am fine.

508
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:30,811
If one side doesn't move, you can't go through it.

509
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:32,390
I will get out of the way

510
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,290
so go ahead.

511
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,725
Miss Young Maiden!

512
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,876
You dropped this.

513
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,163
It suits you.

514
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,763
If that was Sir Preceptor,

515
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,135
I would understand why.

516
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,160
Your Majesty,

517
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,206
Sir Preceptor is here.

518
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:46,349
Let him come in.

519
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,990
Your Majesty.

520
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,690
Did you call me?

521
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,227
Come here and sit.

522
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,680
Hey, Deok Ro!

523
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,030
About the Crown Prince.

524
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:23,053
He appeals every single day.

525
00:46:23,053 --> 00:46:25,550
He's going to kill me

526
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,350
before he catches the tiger.

527
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,020
And

528
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,980
he shouldn't use his private bodyguards to catch a tiger.

529
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:38,730
His bodyguards are there to protect the Crown Prince.

530
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,205
Where does he want to send them?

531
00:46:42,205 --> 00:46:45,770
I'll go to the Crown Prince Palace and deliver Your Majesty's royal command.

532
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,354
Go ahead.

533
00:46:48,354 --> 00:46:49,820
Your Majesty!

534
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,800
There is something you need to ask.

535
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,713
Three days ago, the lights in Crown Prince Palace were on all night.

536
00:46:56,713 --> 00:47:00,069
Yes, I forgot.

537
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,260
All right.

538
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,560
Did something happen?

539
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,389
Do you not know?

540
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,368
He doesn't seem to know.

541
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:12,725
If he doesn't know, then who does?

542
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:18,750
Or the Crown Prince should come in person and explain it to Your Majesty.

543
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,222
I think I know the answer.

544
00:47:21,222 --> 00:47:23,386
Really?

545
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,903
Soon, there will be the palace maids' festival.

546
00:47:27,903 --> 00:47:30,702
It is something that I permitted.

547
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,710
It is a game night for the palace maids.

548
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,280
There are many people watching secretly.

549
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,720
I guess His Highness

550
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,490
watched it all night long.

551
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:46,386
I watched the night sky late into the night.

552
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:51,830
You should have watched it with me.

553
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:55,162
On that day, I will set up a place in my quarters.

554
00:47:55,162 --> 00:47:56,973
I will have you over there.

555
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:59,708
Of course.

556
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,500
His Highness

557
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,760
asked you to write a letter of apology.

558
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,590
Are you here to see His Highness?

559
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,494
Yes.

560
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:19,074
His Highness is at Jonhyeongak Hall.
(T/N: Jonhyeongak/Jonhyeon Hall: a building where the Crown Prince's educational activities took place)

561
00:48:19,074 --> 00:48:22,207
You can go straight this way.

562
00:48:22,207 --> 00:48:24,260
Thank you.

563
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,644
He just went to Kyungwondang quarters.

564
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,216
He's in Cheonhanjeong Royal Portrait Hall.

565
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:12,713
Yes.

566
00:49:12,713 --> 00:49:17,124
Have you ever lived in a pine valley with a stream?

567
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,352
Wol Hye!

568
00:49:19,352 --> 00:49:22,250
It is you, Deok Im!

569
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,966
Why do you make a fuss about that?

570
00:49:30,966 --> 00:49:33,565
Of course, he would tease a young apprentice maid.

571
00:49:33,565 --> 00:49:39,371
After you officially become a palace maid, there will be a terrible hazing ritual.

572
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:40,942
A hazing ritual?

573
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:45,309
Everyone goes through it so you don't have to be scared in advance.

574
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:48,320
Why are you here today?

575
00:49:53,601 --> 00:49:58,290
Great. You're only an apprentice maid, and you already made a bad impression.

576
00:50:00,776 --> 00:50:06,387
Your Highness, Apprentice Maid Sung Deok Im would like to see you.

577
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:11,826
He said to come in.

578
00:50:29,105 --> 00:50:31,117
I am Sung Deok Im.

579
00:50:31,117 --> 00:50:36,200
I am here to give you the apology letter you asked for.

580
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:07,720
He orders you to bring that letter.

581
00:51:12,244 --> 00:51:15,905
"The generosity of the Crown Prince His Highness"

582
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:19,055
"for forgiving me"—

583
00:51:19,055 --> 00:51:22,182
Who told you to read it? Bring it here.

584
00:51:22,183 --> 00:51:23,776
Excuse me?

585
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,970
[I will engrave in my bones the generosity of the Crown Prince His Highness for forgiving me...]

586
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:39,290
This handwriting…

587
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:44,320
[Give wages and food in a box.]

588
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,520
No way.

589
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:52,520
What? Was it you?

590
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:33,692
The first line is wrong.

591
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,151
The next one too.

592
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:40,700
And the next one.

593
00:52:46,805 --> 00:52:48,883
It is disrespectful!

594
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:51,690
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

595
00:53:11,676 --> 00:53:16,610
His Highness orders you to correct the mistakes and rewrite one.

596
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:29,050
I don't know when he will come.

597
00:53:31,092 --> 00:53:35,170
Maybe I should be honest to Lady Seo.

598
00:53:50,637 --> 00:53:54,370
It is the well water that you always drink, Sir.

599
00:54:00,544 --> 00:54:02,990
Just let me know what you need.

600
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,960
What do you need?

601
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:09,586
I cannot waste my time.

602
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:11,760
If you have something to say, say it already.

603
00:54:19,187 --> 00:54:22,610
I don't know what the mistakes are.

604
00:54:31,934 --> 00:54:35,360
I'm not sure why you don't know.

605
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:41,370
Please teach me, Sir.

606
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,287
Tiger.

607
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:49,054
Excuse me?

608
00:54:49,054 --> 00:54:53,537
Find all the books about tigers in this library.

609
00:54:53,537 --> 00:54:55,768
Tigers?

610
00:54:55,768 --> 00:54:59,907
It would take a long time to find all of them.

611
00:54:59,907 --> 00:55:03,650
Of course, I will find everything for you.

612
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:12,694
"The generosity of the Crown Prince His Highness for forgiving me—

613
00:55:12,694 --> 00:55:14,429
Wait.

614
00:55:15,419 --> 00:55:17,574
When did he ever forgive you?

615
00:55:17,574 --> 00:55:19,152
Sorry?

616
00:55:19,973 --> 00:55:22,084
The reason for the letter of apology

617
00:55:22,084 --> 00:55:26,563
is to decide whether to forgive or not based on the content.

618
00:55:26,563 --> 00:55:31,314
The reason why you fell into the pond

619
00:55:31,314 --> 00:55:35,992
why you were running around like a goby in the solemn Palace,

620
00:55:35,992 --> 00:55:38,684
those are the things you should write down in detail.

621
00:55:43,899 --> 00:55:47,933
Especially this part... Do you not value your life?

622
00:55:47,933 --> 00:55:53,785
Eternity is only for His Majesty. How dare you say it to His Highness?

623
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:55,374
I didn't know…

624
00:55:55,374 --> 00:56:00,208
I'm sure you wrote everything that sounds good.

625
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:05,431
Thank you. I know what to fix now.

626
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:10,567
Next time, I'm sure my apology letter will get a pass.

627
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,980
[I ran around the solemn Palace carelessly, and irritated the Crown Prince His Highness...]

628
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,800
[I, your humble servant,...]

629
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,020
[I, your humble servant, was floundering about, which caused Your Highness great harm...]

630
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,050
[...The Crown P]

631
00:57:44,645 --> 00:57:46,578
Your Highness.

632
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,110
[I caused you to fall in the pond. I was a foolish...]

633
00:58:08,815 --> 00:58:10,960
How dare you!

634
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:16,500
[How dare]

635
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,272
I…

636
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:34,930
[In the beautiful nature of the backcourt...]

637
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,750
[Change]

638
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,640
[Changed]

639
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,200
[Righteous]

640
00:59:01,677 --> 00:59:03,522
A hundred times.

641
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:15,113
His Highness asks that you rewrite

642
00:59:15,113 --> 00:59:18,324
the wrong words each a hundred times.

643
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:46,600
I told you to wait and see.

644
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:49,574
A pay cut would be better.

645
00:59:49,574 --> 00:59:51,693
I would prefer a whipping.

646
00:59:51,693 --> 00:59:54,594
I'm sick and tired of apology letters.

647
00:59:54,594 --> 00:59:56,713
What is wrong with a letter of apology?

648
00:59:56,713 --> 00:59:59,613
You are given a chance to realize your mistakes.

649
00:59:59,613 --> 01:00:03,436
A chance, my foot. Even a worm will turn.

650
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:07,927
Every time I think of His Highness, sleep seems to elude me.

651
01:00:07,927 --> 01:00:11,920
How will he become a good king if he irritates his inferiors like this?

652
01:00:15,114 --> 01:00:17,803
Do you dare to insult the Crown Prince?

653
01:00:17,803 --> 01:00:20,047
Just take this.

654
01:00:29,383 --> 01:00:31,638
So, this map was here all along.

655
01:00:31,638 --> 01:00:32,848
Do you recognize that?

656
01:00:32,848 --> 01:00:35,658
My father had this.

657
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:41,367
Never mind. I needed this map. I'm glad you found it.

658
01:00:48,138 --> 01:00:50,150
What kind of map is it?

659
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,464
It's Doseonjeongdo.
(T/N: Doseongjeondo - The map of the capital)

660
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:53,455
That's nothing special though.

661
01:00:53,455 --> 01:00:55,920
The area where mountain animals are often found.

662
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,599
Chakho Gapsa's hunting routes.
(T/N: Chakho Gapsa - Military specially selected for tigers)

663
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:04,101
The places of nets and chalco are all marked.
(T/N: Chalco is a tool used to catch animals)

664
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:07,638
It'll help us to catch that tiger.

665
01:01:07,638 --> 01:01:10,990
I was wondering why you were investigating tigers.

666
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:14,060
Is it because of the tiger in the city?

667
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,580
Another person died yesterday.

668
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:20,990
If the map helps, I will look for more.

669
01:01:31,256 --> 01:01:34,545
The training records of the tiger hunting soldiers will help, too, right?

670
01:01:58,013 --> 01:02:00,602
Should I thank you…?

671
01:02:10,077 --> 01:02:15,114
What I going to say is really important, so listen carefully, Lady Seo.

672
01:02:15,114 --> 01:02:16,792
Yes?

673
01:02:18,606 --> 01:02:22,683
The apprentice maid that comes to Crown Prince Palace with an apology letter, you know.

674
01:02:22,683 --> 01:02:25,349
You said she's your pupil, Lady Seo.

675
01:02:27,733 --> 01:02:29,410
Yes.

676
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:35,042
Every time she appears, His Highness's cold symptoms seem to get worse.

677
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:38,708
His sore throat gets worse and he would stutter.

678
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:40,953
He seems to be losing all his senses.

679
01:02:40,953 --> 01:02:42,142
No way!

680
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:46,686
Have you heard of the flu ghost?

681
01:02:46,686 --> 01:02:50,062
Is there such a ghost?

682
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:53,561
I think that flu ghost is attached to that apprentice maid.

683
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:58,198
Now that ghost seems to have attached itself to His Highness.

684
01:02:58,198 --> 01:03:00,245
Then…

685
01:03:00,245 --> 01:03:03,356
Should I go to the Ritual Hall and request an exorcism?

686
01:03:03,356 --> 01:03:05,990
That's a good idea.

687
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,720
Wait.

688
01:03:17,604 --> 01:03:19,204
A flu ghost?

689
01:03:19,205 --> 01:03:22,849
Do you believe in such a myth?

690
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:25,165
What do mean by the Ritual Hall?

691
01:03:25,165 --> 01:03:27,809
It's been a while since we banned exorcism among our court subjects.

692
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:30,580
But…

693
01:03:41,956 --> 01:03:45,034
You can leave now.

694
01:03:45,034 --> 01:03:47,470
Yes, Your Highness.

695
01:03:58,538 --> 01:04:01,127
- Come sit near me.
- I'm sorry, Your Highness.

696
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:05,061
I was the one who mentioned that flu ghost, but...

697
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:07,810
Don't make me say it twice.

698
01:04:20,086 --> 01:04:24,018
Isn't this the map used by the tiger hunting soldiers?

699
01:04:24,018 --> 01:04:26,362
It will be a big help.

700
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:30,150
First, I should check this route with my bodyguards.

701
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:34,055
Your Highness, what about His Majesty's permission?

702
01:04:34,055 --> 01:04:36,266
I couldn't get it.

703
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:39,982
Will that be okay?

704
01:04:39,982 --> 01:04:44,430
Twenty-seven have already died. I can't wait any longer.

705
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,409
Tell them to gather up by Haeshi.
(T/N: Haeshi: 9-11 pm)

706
01:04:47,409 --> 01:04:49,540
Yes, Your Highness.

707
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:54,132
"How could I not repent?"

708
01:04:54,132 --> 01:04:57,988
"You can cut my salary or whip me."

709
01:04:57,988 --> 01:05:05,452
"The reason why you asked me to write a letter of apology is that you wanted to give me a chance to reflect on my own mistake."

710
01:05:05,452 --> 01:05:10,560
"I'm deeply grateful for your kindness."

711
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:29,130
[How could I not repent?]

712
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:30,870
[...I'm deeply grateful for your kindness.]

713
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:33,730
Isn't she something?

714
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:32,227
Write a new letter of apology.

715
01:06:32,227 --> 01:06:34,661
The topic is…

716
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:40,307
The crime of thinking about something else on the inside while pretending not to.

717
01:06:40,307 --> 01:06:44,560
The crime of writing a fancy letter.

718
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:11,840
She's gone insane.

719
01:07:17,149 --> 01:07:19,860
Do you have another question?

720
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,117
No.

721
01:07:22,117 --> 01:07:25,663
You're having a hard time catching a tiger that kills people.

722
01:07:25,663 --> 01:07:28,388
It's not even your job.

723
01:07:28,388 --> 01:07:30,477
Who else would do it?

724
01:07:30,477 --> 01:07:31,590
Well...

725
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:34,147
Hanseong Ministry pawn off its responsibility on the Police Bureau.

726
01:07:34,147 --> 01:07:38,608
The Police Bureau is stuck on the tiger-hunting soldiers, which don't exist anymore.

727
01:07:39,418 --> 01:07:44,050
People die every day, but no one is responsible.

728
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,096
So I have no choice but to step up.

729
01:07:49,013 --> 01:07:51,324
That's very admirable!

730
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:57,918
I mean it. You're admirable.

731

W- Why are you laughing?

732
01:08:07,499 --> 01:08:09,650
Now that I think about it…

733
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:13,534
I've only seen you in the library.

734
01:08:13,534 --> 01:08:16,113
What do you usually do?

735
01:08:16,113 --> 01:08:18,612
The same.

736
01:08:18,612 --> 01:08:23,695
Transcribing books or reading them to people.

737
01:08:23,695 --> 01:08:26,975
I don't like sewing so I don't do it often.

738
01:08:26,975 --> 01:08:31,252
Are you still reading folktale novels to people?

739
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,622
I told you not to read them.

740
01:08:35,622 --> 01:08:39,125
Why do you care whether I read a book or not?

741
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,391
This is my order!

742
01:08:40,391 --> 01:08:44,228
So why should I follow that order?

743
01:08:44,228 --> 01:08:47,225
Are you my superior?

744
01:08:51,696 --> 01:08:54,640
I'm going to read a book tonight after all.

745

What?

746

Today is the festival day of the palace maids.

I'm going to gather all the maids and read a book for them.

748
01:09:10,377 --> 01:09:14,100
What? Do you want me to fill in tonight?

749
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,556
I'm sorry.

750
01:09:15,556 --> 01:09:16,768
By myself?

751
01:09:16,771 --> 01:09:19,404
Everyone else will be at the festival, but I'm the only one on duty?

752
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:22,919
What can I do? This is from His Highness.

753
01:09:22,919 --> 01:09:26,020
Why? Are you going to dispute this to him?

754
01:09:43,863 --> 01:09:45,852
Gae!
