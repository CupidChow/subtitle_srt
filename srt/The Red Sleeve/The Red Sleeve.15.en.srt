3
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:22,613
Leave the palace before the dawn breaks.

4
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,123
Get out of my sight!

5
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:31,926
I do not wish to see you again.

6
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:22,116
What are you talking about?

7
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:24,215
Do you have to leave right now?

8
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:27,520
I have deceived His Majesty.

9
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,906
His Majesty may deceive palace maids at will

10
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:34,320
but a palace maid may not deceive the King.

11
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:39,504
Let's go beg His Majesty for forgiveness.

12
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:42,528
If you beg for clemency for whatever you've done—

13
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:44,491
I don't want to do that.

14
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,431
I am still angry at him.

15
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:54,337
This may be a blessing in disguise.

16
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:58,840
Now, I will not be able to treat His Majesty as if nothing happened.

17
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,630
This is the Yeo Beom.

18
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,625
I cannot take Concubine Yeongbin's personal effects out of the palace.

19
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,511
Please take good care of it, My Lady.

20
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,695
What about your friends?

21
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:25,039
Shouldn't you say goodbye to them?

22
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,529
I don't want to cry right now.

23
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:31,145
And I'm sure I'll see them again someday.

[Episode 15]

25
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:05,015
My Lady, have you seen Deok Im?

26
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:07,534
She's gone.

27
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:10,602
- What?
- My Lady!

28
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,312
My Lady!

29
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:18,723
My Lady, I was just at the King's Palace,

30
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:21,295
and His Majesty is on his way here!

31
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:22,822
What?

32
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,719
Come down from there!

33
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:32,902
Come down!

34
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:35,312
Hurry and get in line.

35
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:41,411
Hurry up you guys!

36
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:57,534
Your Majesty, what brings you here this morning?

37
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,819
Is Sung Deok Im here?

38
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,123
Is she?

39
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:06,208
Sung Deok Im has

40
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:10,006
left the palace in accordance with your command.

41
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,820
Lead me to her room.

42
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:19,437
Yes, Your Majesty.

43
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:37,326
Your Majesty, she has already left.

44
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,619
Your Majesty…

45
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:46,617
I merely wished to see for myself.

46
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:51,789
I wanted to make sure

47
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:55,898
that she is nowhere in the palace.

48
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:05,940
That book…

49
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,310
As it belonged to the late Concubine Yeongbin,

50
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:11,589
she said that she couldn't take it with her

51
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,108
and left it here.

52
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,902
Leave me.

53
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:19,413
Yes, Your Majesty.

54
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,626
So

55
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,945
you've really left.

56
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,896
You didn't even beg to stay.

57
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:02,336
Of course.

58
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:05,719
That's how you are.

59

Thank you.

It's been a long time, Maiden.

79
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:26,008
Don't be so wary of me. It's been a year since we last saw each other.

80
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:30,089
I do not have a penny to my name now. I am powerless.

You and I are in the same situation, aren't we?

82
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:36,308
I heard that you were also thrown out of the palace.

83
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:37,401
Yes.

84
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:40,322
You made a big mistake

85
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:43,010
by trying to involve Queen Dowager.

86
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,321
Are you following me around just to tell me that?

87

I was just glad to see you.

88
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:55,137
You and I both served His Majesty with all our might

89
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:58,301
and were both abandoned by him on the same day.

90
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:01,196
It must have been fate.

91

Was involving Queen Dowager really the only way?

92
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,018
What do you mean?

93
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:17,239
You were Lord Hong, one of the most powerful men in the palace.

94
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:22,238
What else could a mere palace maid like me have done?

95
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,589
I had to risk my life.

96
00:11:30,613 --> 00:11:32,700
You did not

97
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,919
risk your life at all.

98
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:40,616

Don't you dare

think that you know my intentions.

107
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,613
You are no longer a powerful lord.

108
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:11,699
You were always in his favor.

109

And you knew that better than anyone else.

110

But now,

111
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:24,805
you are no longer in His Majesty's favor.

A royal edict has been issued.

The King is looking for a concubine.

116

A concubine?

He is going to get married again.

It's been a long time.

119
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,408
His Majesty has forgotten

00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:59,103
about you

121
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:03,533
or my sister.

122
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:44,838
I am satisfied with the training of the cavalry.

123
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:48,520
Appoint the best among them to the special guard

124
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,815
and bestow a reward to the three units of the cavalry.

00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:53,734
Yes, Your Majesty.

126
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:58,210
However, I am dissatisfied with how they shoot the arrow.

127
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,114
I will change their training method.

128
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:02,939
Good.

129
00:14:13,624 --> 00:14:18,889
Your Majesty, it is raining hard and it will be difficult for you to return to the palace.

130
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,526
Princess Cheong Yeon's residence is nearby.

131
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:27,820
Why don't you stay the night there?

132
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,314
Your Majesty?

133
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:35,036
I will do so.

134
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:38,216
Send a messenger to Princess Cheong Yeon.

135
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:40,292

Welcome, Your Majesty.

137
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,477
Have you been well?

138
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:04,028
Yes, Your Majesty.

139
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,644
What brings you here, Your Majesty?

140
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:16,538
It began to rain suddenly while I was hunting.

141
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,238
Sit down.

142
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,975
Finish your story.

143
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:28,824
He still appears at the marketplace and behaves like a madman.

144
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:32,700
Are you talking about Hong Deok Ro?

145
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,589
Does he still keep meeting my relatives?

146
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:40,600
Just three days ago, he paid a visit to Prince Euneon.
(T/N: Late Prince Sado's third son; King Jeongjo's half brother)

But now that Your Majesty is selecting a new concubine,

148
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,229
Hong Deok Ro will finally give up his ambitions.

149
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:51,908
I heard that your concubine has already been selected.

150
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:54,011
Who is she?

151
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:58,511
She's from the Soron faction. She is the niece of the Chief State Councilor.

152
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,096
Her family name is Yun—

153
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:04,214
You must be wet, Deok Im.

154
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,639
Princess, I found the book you were looking for.

155
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,282
Is this the Story of Lee Hyeon Gyeong?

156
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:16,420
Yes. You managed to find it.

157
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,205
It's very similar to the Story of Hong Gye Wol.

158
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:23,205
It's a story about a woman who goes on an adventure disguised as a man—

159
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:39,203
I forgot to tell you.

160
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:42,011
His Majesty is here.

161
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:44,502
Why don't you go greet him?

162
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,316
No.

163
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:50,977
I am no longer a royal handmaid so I may not see him unless he calls me first.

164
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:54,083
But still, it's you.

165
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,883
I was chased from the palace for an infraction.

166
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,222
Do you think my husband will like it?

167
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:19,399
I am sure he will.

168
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:23,303
Cheong Seon, you'll give it to your husband, too?

169
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,197
Yes, Sister.

170
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:28,958
How about you, Deok Im?

171
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:32,725
I haven't thought of it yet.

172
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:35,006
I guess I can use it myself.

173
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:38,002
- Why don't you present it to His Majesty?
- Pardon?

174
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:41,006
His Majesty is here right now.

175
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:43,396
You should beg for his forgiveness.

176
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,904
Maybe he'll let you return to the palace?

177
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:47,828
No, Your Highness.

178
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:52,719
I have disappointed His Majesty greatly and can never be forgiven.

179
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:56,817
I'm surprised to hear that Brother was disappointed in a palace maid.

180
00:17:56,817 --> 00:18:00,506
You need to have expectations, to begin with, to be so disappointed, you know.

181
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:04,628
His Majesty's disappointment is too great to forgive me.

182
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,122
Then why did he have you sent to my house?

183
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:19,707
She has been a palace maid all her life so she knows nothing about the outside world.

184
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:24,503
I do not wish her to be hurt in any way.

185
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:29,299
You have known her for a long time so take her in.

186
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,308
His Majesty didn't show you a special favor.

187
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:57,498
He always makes sure that

188
00:18:57,498 --> 00:19:01,380
court ladies have a place to stay when they leave the palace.

189
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:07,113
You didn't have anywhere to go.

190
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:12,817
I had no idea

191
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:16,922
that it was His Majesty who sent me to Princess Cheong Yeon.

192
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,408
On the day I left the palace,

193
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:26,811
my words to His Majesty were especially cruel on purpose.

194
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:31,111
I wanted to hurt him deeply.

195
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,908
I deserved to be beaten or made a slave for such behavior.

196
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:41,316
But even though I was discharged from the palace,

197
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:44,231
I'm doing very well as you can see.

198
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:48,416
Now that I know of the favor he granted me,

199
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,024
I feel even more wretched than before.

200
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:56,214
It's all in the past.

201
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:05,020
I'm so happy to see you again.

202
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:16,608
Even the raindrops sound pleasant because it is the rain that reunited us.

203
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:56,186
My apologies, Your Majesty.

204
00:20:56,186 --> 00:21:00,192
I was instructed to light the lamps because you are here.

205
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:04,341
I told you I didn't want to see you ever again.

206
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:05,624
My apologies, Your Majesty.

207
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:08,105
You always disobey me

208
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:11,291
without a hint of fear.

209
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:18,417
You don't fear me at all, do you?

210
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:28,971
There is something I wish to ask you.

211
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:33,125
You left the

212
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,486
Yeo Beom in your room.

213
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:40,308
I saw something strange between the pages.

214
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,824
Why was it in your possession?

215
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:49,991
Excuse me?

216
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,086
Pardon?

217
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:55,816
It's nothing.

218
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,419
Never mind. Forget it.

219
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:02,339
Both you and Hong Deok Ro are no longer

220
00:22:03,503 --> 00:22:07,411
part of my life.

221
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:13,110
I apologize for appearing in front of you

222
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,903
and disobeying your royal command.

223
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:20,425
But may I dare to make a request, Your Majesty?

224
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:23,728
A request?

225
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,808
What is it?

226
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,104
As Princess Cheong Yeon is your sister,

227
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:34,019
Your Majesty will visit from time to time.

228
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:40,834
If you happen to see me, please ignore me and pass me by.

229
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:42,850
If you treat me like a stranger—

230
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,030
How dare you tell me what to do!

231
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:51,519
Instead of any contrition for your wrongdoings,

232
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,405
you are even more arrogant

233
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:55,905
and ruder than before.

234
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:59,616
Then please punish this arrogant and rude girl once again!

235
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:04,519
Do not favor me and punish me severely for my indiscretion!

236
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,014
Then

237
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:29,814
I shall untie your blouse.

238
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:34,111
Once you have bedded the King,

239
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:39,703
you can no longer remain a mere palace maid.

240
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:46,517
If you do not accept the position of a concubine,

241
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:51,519
you will be relegated to the back rooms of the palace

242
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,352
and become the object of ridicule and derision

243
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:03,839
among the court ladies.

244
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:10,409
For you, it is a fate worse than death, is it not?

245
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:20,236
Are you scared now?

246
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:10,991
Wife, why is His Majesty already returning to the palace?

247
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:13,028
I do not know.

248
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,428
Your Majesty!

249
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:19,303
Your Majesty, it is late.

250
00:25:19,303 --> 00:25:21,693
The rain has stopped so I wish to return.

251
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:23,620
Your Majesty.

252
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:40,227
Who goes there?

253
00:25:40,227 --> 00:25:43,730
How dare you look at His Majesty without his consent?

254
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:54,328
My apologies, Your Majesty.

255
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:59,520
I committed the infraction because I am not familiar with palace protocols.

256
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,794
Who are you?

257
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:03,424
My name is Yun Yeon Ju.

258
00:26:06,304 --> 00:26:08,425
I recognize her.

259
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:14,316
I have been wondering about what kind of man Your Majesty is.

260
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:17,139
Your Majesty is much more—

261
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:19,822
- Captain.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

262
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:23,312
The hour is late for a lady to walk around alone. Escort her to her place.

263
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:24,812
Yes, Your Majesty.

264
00:26:36,204 --> 00:26:38,441
What should I do?

265
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:52,903
If you do not accept the position of a concubine,

266
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:57,420
you will be relegated

267
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,122
to the back rooms of the palace

268
00:27:06,516 --> 00:27:09,166
and become the object of ridicule and derision

269
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:12,527
among the court ladies.

270
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:18,122
For you, it is a fate worse than death, is it not?

271
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,730
That would be a scary punishment.

272
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:32,127
Deok Im! Deok Im!

273
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,144
My lady.

274
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:37,311
Will you be returning now?

275
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:41,179
No, that's not it! I just received a message from the palace.

276
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,530
You can return to the palace!

277
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,851
What do you mean?

278
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:50,036
Let's go back to the palace!

279
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:17,020
What brings you to my home?

280
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,489
Have you decided to forgive this poor Hong Deok Ro?

281
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:23,916
I came here to say goodbye.

282
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:27,791
I am returning to the palace.

283
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:36,547
So that's how it ends.

284
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:40,541
You will return to His Majesty

285
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,619
while I am discarded.

286
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:50,333
Why the gloomy face?

287
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:54,220
Do you not wish to return?

288
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,502
No.

289
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:57,052
My…

290
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:01,322
I myself am dying to return.

291
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:05,019
I would do anything

292
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:08,527
to return to the palace.

293
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:14,809
There is something I must say to you.

294
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,611
Once, I told you

295
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:23,908
that Concubine Wonbin would still be alive had she not become a concubine.

296
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:29,013
I always regretted saying that.

297
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:35,145
She could have given birth to a royal heir and lived happily.

298
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,403
But

299
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:40,630
she was unfortunate.

300
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:44,547
The heavens determine the length of a person's life.

301
00:29:44,547 --> 00:29:47,247
No one has the power to change that.

302
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:51,006
Therefore,

303
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:55,517
Her Highness's death was not your fault.

304
00:29:56,966 --> 00:30:00,927
Although I can never forgive you for what you did to my friend,

305
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:04,247
I still wanted to tell you this.

306
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:19,027
Is it true that you do not wish to return to the palace?

307
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:21,997
I can help you.

308
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:25,417
You can come with me.

309
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:30,216
We can leave together.

310
00:30:30,216 --> 00:30:33,603
I will take you wherever you wish to go.

311
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:37,302
We could go see Mount Kumgang

312
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,191
or take a boat to Tamra.
(T/N: Modern day Jeju Island)

313
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:44,241
We can freely roam the world.

314
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:49,200
What do you think? Doesn't it sound enticing?

315
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:55,051
This is something that even His Majesty cannot give you.

316
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:03,013
Do you still enjoy harassing palace maids?

317
00:31:04,016 --> 00:31:06,416
I will forget what you just said.

318
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:10,419
The sight of you always made me angry.

319
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,528
It made me even angrier

320
00:31:21,528 --> 00:31:23,801
because I knew why I was so angry.

321
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:29,513
When I saw you after you had left the palace,

322
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,492
I wasn't angry for the first time.

323
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:34,405
What are you saying?

324
00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:38,013
If I go with you, you will forget

325
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:42,097
that you have been stripped of your position and be happy?

326
00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:44,308
Of course not.

327
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:48,411
You hold yourself in far too high esteem.

328
00:31:51,484 --> 00:31:54,038
I have lost everything.

329
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,300
I must suffer until the day I die.

330
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:03,128
You would merely

331
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:08,019
comfort me enough

332
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,919
that I would not die

333
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,922
and barely manage to continue on.

334
00:32:17,597 --> 00:32:20,611
I would have the comfort of knowing

335
00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:24,316
that I could possess the one thing His Majesty could not.

336
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:31,624
So if you hear of my death,

337
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,238
don't forget

338
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:38,025
that you are

339
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,816
the cause of my death.

340
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:49,128
Why are you making a silly joke?

341
00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:10,293
So if you hear of my death,

342
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:12,822
don't forget

343
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:16,213
that you are

344
00:33:17,106 --> 00:33:19,025
the cause of my death.

345
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:24,814
He talked as if he were planning to die.

346
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:31,610
Your Majesty,

347
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,800
we have left the post of Royal Secretary unoccupied for too long.

348
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,047
Please decide on a person to fill the post.

349
00:33:43,593 --> 00:33:46,088
The Minister is right.

350
00:33:46,614 --> 00:33:51,103
The Royal Secretary has many responsibilities so we can put it off no longer.

351
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:54,685
Please, select one of the royal scribes

352
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,722
and appoint him as the Royal Secretary.

353
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:58,507
I will think about it.

354
00:33:58,507 --> 00:34:00,800
My apologies for saying this,

355
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,899
but please do not make the mistake of choosing someone as treacherous

356
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:08,997
as Hong Deok Ro ever again.

357
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:13,286
All of this happened because

358
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:17,703
His Majesty showed him special favor because he was a childhood friend.

359
00:34:17,703 --> 00:34:22,316
Assistant Counselor, watch what you say to His Majesty!

360
00:34:22,316 --> 00:34:25,417
- His Majesty…
- Assistant Counselor is right.

361
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:33,838
The treason of Lord Hong is entirely my fault.

362
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:41,903
I will decide on the Royal Secretary soon.

363
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:45,495
Thank you, Your Majesty!

364
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:32,405
Right. I won't ever make the same mistake again.

365
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:38,218
I will forget you and keep another lady by my side.

366
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:42,208
I will treat her with the utmost care

367
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:50,710
though no one can truly take your place in my heart.

368
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:08,010
His Majesty has arrived!

369
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:20,341
Welcome, Your Majesty.

370
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:24,825
I have something to say to everyone.

371
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:32,525
Hear me, court ladies of the Concubine's Palace.

372
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:37,604
Some of you may have prior experience working at the palace

373
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:41,040
and some of you must come from Concubine Hwabin's private residence.

374
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:45,647
Now that the Concubine Hwabin has become part of the royal family,

375
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:48,570
you must do your utmost to serve her well.

376
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,804
Yes, Your Majesty.

377
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:58,057
I am deeply honored that you show this humble servant such favor.

378
00:36:58,057 --> 00:37:01,439
You are not a servant but my concubine.

379
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:04,021
Yes, Your Majesty.

380
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:11,618
I merely wish that you are happy here in the palace.

381
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:15,297
I will do my best to show you my affections.

382
00:37:15,297 --> 00:37:17,693
Thank you, Your Majesty.

383
00:37:19,302 --> 00:37:21,624
Raise your heads.

384
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:27,824
The handmaids must always talk with the royal doctor.

385
00:37:27,824 --> 00:37:31,992
And you must inform me of any medicines that she is given.

386
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:33,391
Also…

387
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:45,319
Your Majesty, do you remember that maid?

388
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:49,904
I heard that she used to serve you.

389
00:37:54,777 --> 00:37:56,840
You're back.

390
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,813
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:02,430
I heard that a royal elder

392
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:07,511
put her in my service because I am unfamiliar with palace protocols.

393
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:16,304
I'm going to depend on you so please help me.

394
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:19,122
I will do my best, Your Highness.

395
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:22,791
Go into my room and prepare my bedding.

396
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,341
Yes, Your Highness.

397
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:18,290
She is a very talented girl.

398
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,040
It is no wonder she served Your Majesty for so long.

399
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,379
You are dismissed.

400
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:25,516
Yes, Your Highness.

401
00:39:37,717 --> 00:39:41,633
It's nice to see you, Maiden Sung.

402
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:28,691
My apologies, Your Majesty, but Her Highness has just awoken…

403
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:32,500
It is all right so let His Majesty in.

404
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:47,200
Welcome, Your Majesty.

405
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,187
What brings you here so early?

406
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:54,916
Why did you bring Sung Deok Im back to the palace?

407
00:40:56,302 --> 00:41:00,102
You should not have recalled a girl who was sent away by my command!

408
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:03,431
You are directing your anger at that wrong person.

409
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:07,620
It is not I who recalled her.

410
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,504
Then who is it?

411
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:13,516
If it is neither me nor you, Your Majesty,

412
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:15,916
then who else is there?

413
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:23,719
Maiden Sung, I need you to do something for me.

414
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:29,017
Please take this to His Majesty.

415
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:30,927
What is it?

416
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:34,417
It is the date of my first night with His Majesty, delivered from the Office of Astrology.

417
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:37,991
I heard that I should look at it before it is sent to His Majesty.

418
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:43,023
Yes, Your Highness. I will take this to His Majesty later.

419
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:49,123
Do it right now.

420
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:50,286
Your Highness?

421
00:41:50,286 --> 00:41:54,019
Why? Is there a reason you can't?

422
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:59,892
Tomorrow is His Majesty's visit to the royal graves so he is performing his ablutions.

423
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,575
That's why you should go.

424
00:42:02,575 --> 00:42:06,822
You served him for a long time so it will not be difficult for you.

425
00:42:07,914 --> 00:42:11,127
I cannot send those girls, can I?

426
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:23,742
You are the only one whom I can trust.

427
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:29,213
You should have come later.

428
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,805
Why did you come now?

429
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:37,006
I'll just wait for His Majesty to finish his ablutions.

430
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:41,111
He'll leave for the ancestral graves right afterward.

431
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:45,603
Let's give it to him now.

432
00:42:45,603 --> 00:42:48,931
It would be awful if we fail to deliver the date.

433
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:50,427
Yes, my lady.

434
00:42:50,427 --> 00:42:56,306
That's strange. The office of astrology has never given the date so late.

435
00:42:56,306 --> 00:43:00,430
Maybe Concubine Hwabin forgot to send it here until now.

436
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:17,385
There's no need for you to do this alone.

437
00:43:17,385 --> 00:43:21,341
You may call others in if you need.

438
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:26,504
No, Your Majesty. Court Lady Seo will return soon.

439
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:29,025
Suit yourself.

440
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:31,717
Yes, Your Majesty.

441
00:43:31,717 --> 00:43:33,064
Your Majesty,

442
00:43:33,064 --> 00:43:36,984
a maid from the Concubine Hwabin's Palace is here with the date of the first night.

443
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:42,220
If you give your permission, she will deliver it back to the office.

444
00:43:43,466 --> 00:43:47,691
Which maid from Hwabins's Palace is here?

445
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,931
It is Sung Deok Im.

446
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,580
Show Sung Deok Im inside.

447
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,044
Your Majesty?

448
00:43:59,401 --> 00:44:02,033
Yes, Your Majesty.

449
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,025
It's all right. I'll come with you.

450
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:13,801
Why did you come out?

451
00:44:13,801 --> 00:44:16,301
His Majesty commanded me to do so.

452
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:19,533
You must wait outside as well.

453
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:22,297
Go on inside.

454
00:44:43,298 --> 00:44:45,420
So you've returned?

455
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,325
Yes, Your Majesty.

456
00:44:47,325 --> 00:44:50,023
Did you come here

457
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:53,022
to show me your nonchalance?

458
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:59,611
It seems that you feel nothing.

459
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:06,339
Are you happy that you're back

460
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,405
or were you forced to return against your will?

461
00:45:10,405 --> 00:45:13,011
I was forced to return.

462
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:16,992
So ejecting you from the palace didn't serve as punishment?

463
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:21,713
Then stay here.

464
00:45:22,183 --> 00:45:25,427
Stay here as a court lady who must only look at the king!

465
00:45:25,427 --> 00:45:29,625
Waste your life serving a man you do not love!

466
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:34,027
That will be punishment enough.

467
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:42,533
Please allow me to leave, Your Majesty.

468
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,725
I am no longer a maid of the King's Palace.

469
00:45:46,725 --> 00:45:50,316
Now, my mistress is Concubine Hwabin.

470
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:53,003
So you are no longer mine?

471
00:45:54,693 --> 00:45:58,002
When have you ever been mine?

472
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:02,634
Get out of my sight!

473
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:06,073
Make that wench kneel!

474
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,227
Yes, Your Highness.

475
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:11,714
Your Highness, why are you doing this?

476
00:47:11,714 --> 00:47:14,730
Do you take me for a fool?

477
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:18,227
You were coquetting with His Majesty, weren't you?

478
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:23,878
His Majesty sent away the other court ladies so you were alone with him.

479
00:47:23,878 --> 00:47:28,306
Your Highness, how did you know what happened at the King's Palace?

480
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:30,720
Prepare the rod.

481
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:44,022
From the beginning, I knew something was fishy,

482
00:47:45,605 --> 00:47:49,420
the way His Majesty looked at you with longing.

483
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:53,892
I am glad I know what is going on.

484
00:48:02,899 --> 00:48:08,217
Now, you must have learned to fear your mistress, right?

485
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:24,406
Your Majesty, the Captain has something urgent to report.

486
00:48:24,406 --> 00:48:26,312
Show him in.

487
00:48:34,615 --> 00:48:36,823
What is it?

488
00:48:36,823 --> 00:48:40,733
Your Majesty, I must inform you that

489
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:44,936
that former royal secretary, Hong Deok Ro,

490
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:50,906
has passed away.

491
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:22,617
Your Majesty,

492
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,992
this is a letter that Hong Deok Ro left for you.

493
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:52,528
Your Majesty,

494
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:57,408
this is my final confession and farewell to you.

495
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,299
I went over in my mind a thousand times

496
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:06,720
to see where it all went wrong

497
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,437
and I have finally realized

498
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,931
that everything was wrong from the beginning.

499
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:19,728
Do you remember when

500
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:23,628
you were a little Crown Prince and I was your playmate?

501
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:26,416
The book was torn.

502
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:31,019
Did you tear the section that

503
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:34,008
Grandfather forbade me to read?

504
00:50:34,008 --> 00:50:37,228
I deceived you from the very beginning.

505
00:50:37,714 --> 00:50:41,187
Yes, it was me.

506
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:44,922
I was afraid that you would incur His Majesty's wrath.

507
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:50,303
I was not the one who tore the page from the book

508
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:53,812
and saved you.

509
00:50:57,382 --> 00:50:59,687
The person who saved you

510
00:51:00,512 --> 00:51:05,125
was a little, lowly apprentice maid

511
00:51:05,798 --> 00:51:09,222
that no one paid any attention to.

512
00:51:10,913 --> 00:51:15,711
For many years, I had forgotten about that girl.

513
00:51:17,085 --> 00:51:20,423
I began to believe that

514
00:51:22,013 --> 00:51:25,916
I was the one who saved Your Majesty

515
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:29,516
and deserved your unwavering trust.

516
00:51:32,204 --> 00:51:35,931
But the heavens always know each and every deception.

517
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,022
That little apprentice maid

518
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:44,917
will still have the forbidden page in her possession.

519
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:52,922
I have an inkling of who that little girl is.

520
00:51:54,718 --> 00:51:58,728
Now, I will leave to protect my sister.

521
00:52:00,808 --> 00:52:03,909
If I may offer you one final piece of advice,

522
00:52:06,101 --> 00:52:08,314
please do not

523
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:12,931
deceive yourself as I have.

524
00:52:25,796 --> 00:52:29,706
His family name was Hong,

525
00:52:29,706 --> 00:52:31,905
and his given name was Guk Yeong.

526
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:34,810
His official name was Deok Ro.

527
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:38,209
He was my subject,

528
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:40,408
my family,

529
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:43,400
and my only friend.

530
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:49,534
He always stayed by me

531
00:52:50,385 --> 00:52:53,623
in the lonely Crown Prince's Palace.

532
00:52:54,784 --> 00:52:59,113
What you did yesterday was very risky. Please refrain from doing that again.

533
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:03,206
If you knew how to wield the sword, I would have brought you along.

534
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:09,712
Did I do what was best for him?

535
00:53:11,007 --> 00:53:13,234
Was it not I

536
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,222
who caused his death?

537
00:53:57,051 --> 00:53:59,290
Welcome, Your Majesty.

538
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:01,589
My apologies, Hwabin,

539
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:05,122
but I must leave right away.

540
00:54:05,122 --> 00:54:07,524
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

541
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:11,802
Your Highness, His Majesty heard

542
00:54:11,802 --> 00:54:17,180
the passing of former royal secretary Hong Deok Ro just today.

543
00:54:17,866 --> 00:54:21,524
Was he not merely an official who was stripped of his title due to his sin?

544
00:54:27,707 --> 00:54:32,847
I had forgotten that he was the brother of the late Concubine Wonbin.

545
00:54:33,376 --> 00:54:37,207
I understand that Your Majesty must be deeply saddened.

546
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,584
I have heard many rumors of Hong Deok Ro

547
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:44,218
and have been curious about him.

548
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:48,705
Will you take the time to tell me about him?

549
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:51,024
I will do that later.

550
00:54:52,913 --> 00:54:55,826
Where is Sung Deok Im?

551
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:58,718
There is something I must ask her.

552
00:55:00,223 --> 00:55:05,192
I have sent her to my private residence on an errand.

553
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:08,215
She will return tomorrow morning.

554
00:55:08,215 --> 00:55:10,590
Then I will ask my question later.

555
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:15,696
Your Majesty, why don't you step inside for a moment?

556
00:55:28,097 --> 00:55:29,884
It is nothing.

557
00:55:29,884 --> 00:55:33,430
I am having a maid wash clothes.

558
00:55:34,085 --> 00:55:36,807
Why are you making her work so late?

559
00:55:36,807 --> 00:55:41,032
Clothes may only be washed during the day.

560
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,111
- Court Lady Seo.
- Yes, Your Majesty?

561
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:46,407
What is the palace protocol?

562
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:49,929
After the harvest when the weather gets cold,

563
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,712
washing clothes is forbidden at night.

564
00:55:52,712 --> 00:55:57,501
It is because the cold water could make the court ladies ill.

565
00:56:40,287 --> 00:56:46,429
Why is Sung Deok Im engaged in such lowly work?

566
00:56:48,192 --> 00:56:52,022
She is a maid specifically sent by the royal elder.

567
00:56:52,022 --> 00:56:55,610
Why is she doing such a lowly job!

568
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:02,424
Is this how you treat the maid the royal elder sent to you?

569
00:57:03,398 --> 00:57:05,127
Hwabin!

570
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:11,065
How dare you mock me and my mother?

571
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:15,632
- Forgive me, Your Majesty. I was unaware—
- How dare you!

572
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,220
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

573
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,938
Sung Deok Im serves Concubine Hwabin now.

574
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:25,320
So she can treat her however she wants?

575
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,824
That's not what I meant…

576
00:57:40,886 --> 00:57:43,202
- Hwabin.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

577
00:57:43,202 --> 00:57:46,022
She was sent by the royal elder.

578
00:57:47,293 --> 00:57:49,788
Treat her well.

579
00:57:50,503 --> 00:57:54,165
I will keep it in my mind, Your Majesty.

580
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,322
Are you returning to your palace?

581
00:58:13,709 --> 00:58:15,915
You wench, how dare you!

582
00:58:35,993 --> 00:58:39,229
I sent her away myself.

583
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:43,787
Mother, you went against a royal command.

584
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:48,626
If it were anyone else, they would not have been forgiven.

585
00:58:49,697 --> 00:58:51,790
Sung Deok Im...

586
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:55,032
Do you know what circumstances

587
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:59,241
she's been in since she returned to the palace?

588
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:04,162
I wouldn't have sent her away in the first place if I'd known she'd be treated like that.

589
00:59:04,162 --> 00:59:09,921
Your Majesty, do you know why you are angry at the girl?

590
00:59:12,378 --> 00:59:16,015
It is because she would not do what you wanted.

591
00:59:16,015 --> 00:59:18,688
That is why you are angry.

592
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:23,611
You sent her away so you would not have to see her again.

593
00:59:26,176 --> 00:59:31,641
Will you give up on the girl just because you are angry?

594
00:59:32,504 --> 00:59:36,819
That girl is your only pathway to happiness.

595
00:59:39,781 --> 00:59:42,516
To truly

596
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:45,508
love someone

597
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:48,518
and make a family with them

598
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:53,721
is the only path to happiness.

599
00:59:57,187 --> 00:59:58,810
Mother…

600
01:00:01,707 --> 01:00:08,930
No one in the world will tell you to be happy.

601
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:12,688
They will be satisfied

602
01:00:13,396 --> 01:00:16,032
if you are a good king.

603
01:00:16,797 --> 01:00:19,990
But I must tell you as your mother,

604
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:22,252
Your Majesty,

605
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:26,219
please be happy.

606
01:00:33,608 --> 01:00:35,443
San,

607
01:00:36,406 --> 01:00:38,477
please be happy.

608
01:00:57,296 --> 01:00:59,532
I wish to be by myself.

609
01:01:28,202 --> 01:01:32,641
What can I do, Mother?

610
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:35,893
She does not want me.

611
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:42,127
I have never loved you, Your Majesty.

612
01:01:42,127 --> 01:01:45,376
I have never thought of you as a man.

613
01:01:46,196 --> 01:01:51,133
And such a thing will never happen.

614
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:59,399
I've fought fiercely throughout my whole life.

615
01:01:59,399 --> 01:02:02,422
I've overcome every obstacle

616
01:02:03,902 --> 01:02:05,633
but...

617
01:02:06,885 --> 01:02:09,330
you are too difficult.

618
01:02:21,216 --> 01:02:22,854
Bok Yeon.

619
01:02:24,985 --> 01:02:27,230
Deok Im.

620
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:31,032
Why are you crying? What's the matter?

621
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:38,522
Lord Hong Deok Ro has passed away.

622
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,010
What?

623
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:47,213
But I didn't want to cry in front of Gyeong Hee. I feel so sorry for her.

624
01:02:48,013 --> 01:02:51,583
I'm going to cry in secret here.

625
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:54,111
Pretend you didn't see me.

626
01:03:28,487 --> 01:03:30,633
Why are you crying

627
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:38,533
with no one here to comfort you?

628
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:41,616
Where are your friends?

629
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:48,018
Your Majesty, what are you doing here?

630
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:50,735
Are your hands all right?

631
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,071
I am fine, Your Majesty.

632
01:03:57,474 --> 01:03:59,924
Did Concubine Hwabin harass you again?

633
01:04:00,893 --> 01:04:03,143
Is that why you are crying?

634
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:05,421
No, Your Majesty.

635
01:04:07,398 --> 01:04:10,030
I wish you'd rather cry because of me.

636
01:04:12,209 --> 01:04:14,929
Only cry when I can see you.

637
01:04:18,993 --> 01:04:21,313
Do not cry by yourself

638
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,933
when I cannot see you

639
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:27,797
or know you are crying.

640
01:04:29,475 --> 01:04:31,526
This is my command.

641
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,535
Your Majesty, it really isn't because of Concubine Hwabin.

642
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:42,026
I heard that Hong Deok Ro is dead.

643
01:04:43,906 --> 01:04:46,119
When I thought about him,

644
01:04:46,738 --> 01:04:49,190
I found myself crying.

645
01:04:49,996 --> 01:04:53,604
Everything changes so rapidly.

646
01:04:55,216 --> 01:04:59,238
And once everything changes, it can never go back.

647
01:05:00,282 --> 01:05:02,346
I don't know,

648
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:05,821
but I can't help but cry.

649
01:05:06,512 --> 01:05:09,391
So things can never go back to the way they were?

650
01:05:09,391 --> 01:05:10,993
Your Majesty?

651
01:05:10,993 --> 01:05:13,432
The dead cannot return.

652
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,807
However, if you remain alive,

653
01:05:19,003 --> 01:05:21,821
opportunities will always return.

654
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:25,221
If you

655
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:28,532
remain alive.

656
01:05:32,098 --> 01:05:34,321
I must ask you something.

657
01:05:34,991 --> 01:05:37,396
Yes, Your Majesty?

658
01:05:37,396 --> 01:05:39,432
When I was little,

659
01:05:39,432 --> 01:05:43,540
I secretly read a book that the late king had forbidden.

660
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:47,819
Someone tore out a page from the book

661
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:50,532
and saved my life.

662
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,027
Was that you?

663
01:06:01,785 --> 01:06:06,624
- Deok Im…
- So what if it was me?

664
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:11,718
Time has passed and everything has changed.

665
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,711
I am no longer a maid of the Crown Prince's Palace,

666
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:19,219
and Your Majesty is no longer a Crown Prince whose life is in danger.

667
01:06:20,391 --> 01:06:24,719
What use is there to speak of bygone days?

668
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,319
So it was you.

669
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,126
It was always you.

670
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,822
Deok Im.

671
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,332
I cannot apologize to you.

672
01:06:45,332 --> 01:06:46,846
Your Majesty?

673
01:06:46,846 --> 01:06:50,229
I did what a king must do

674
01:06:50,229 --> 01:06:52,538
so I have no regrets.

675
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:56,307
Even if I have to deceive you

676
01:06:57,191 --> 01:06:59,640
and hurt you again,

677
01:07:01,911 --> 01:07:04,324
I will do so if I must.

678
01:07:05,066 --> 01:07:08,090
I know that you will.

679
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:13,227
That does not mean that I am unaffected.

680
01:07:14,689 --> 01:07:17,026
Please don't think that.

681
01:07:20,989 --> 01:07:23,026
It pains my heart

682
01:07:24,688 --> 01:07:26,930
when you cry

683
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,135
so much so that I can't bear it.

684
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:42,650
Although

685
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:46,310
I cannot apologize to you,

686
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:50,026
there is something else I can say.

687
01:07:54,796 --> 01:07:56,611
Thank you.

688
01:08:00,999 --> 01:08:03,727
Thank you for saving me all those times.

689
01:08:06,102 --> 01:08:08,840
Thank you for saving me

690
01:08:10,429 --> 01:08:12,718
even when I did not know it.

691
01:08:16,222 --> 01:08:20,432
Thank you, Deok Im.

692
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:44,315
Is it

693
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:48,291
truly too late?

694
01:08:51,408 --> 01:08:54,008
Is there truly no way

695
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,517
to return things to the way they were?

696
01:09:48,497 --> 01:09:50,791
I've missed you so much,

697
01:09:54,385 --> 01:09:56,133
Deok Im.

698
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:07,480
♫ Your world is full of chaos ♫

699
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:14,180
♫ It's like night sky where the moon has set  ♫

700
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:21,600
♫ In your tight embrace ♫

701
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:28,680
♫ I hold back my tears  ♫

702
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:35,690
♫ You have colored my life ♫

703
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:39,560
♫ But I let go of your hand ♫

704

705
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:49,080
I'm not going to let someone steal you from me, never again. I love you.

706
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,400
Deok Im has been graced by His Majesty.

707
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,850
Why are you smiling?

708
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:58,330
So, you and I have become a real family.

709
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:02,860
"The northern wind is cold, the falling snow is thick."

710
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:07,570
Everyone we cherish keeps leaving us.

711
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:11,360
When Spring comes, the flowers will bloom again, right?

712
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:16,840
I've given my heart to you even though I had to go against the heavens' will.

713
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,330
Why did it have to be me?

714
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:23,780
Because no other woman can be you.

715
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:29,830
♫ You have colored my life ♫
