3
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:28,888
Ganggangsullae, ganggangsullae.
(T/N: A traditional Korean dance, dancing in circles)

4
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:33,157
Ganggangsullae, ganggangsullae.

5
00:01:33,158 --> 00:01:36,009
Ganggangsullae, ganggangsullae.

6
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,850
Gae!
(T/N: moving a token 2 steps across the yutnori game board)

7
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:45,893
What is it?

8
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,577
- A tiger?
- Nobody should know about this.

9
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:59,598
What do you mean? We should tell everyone right now.

10
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:02,214
What do you think will happen if we do?

11
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:05,422
Everyone will be terrified and run in the same direction.

12
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:07,313
That door.

13
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:13,694
That small door is the only exit when there are 500 palace maids here.

14
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:17,641
What do you think will happen if 500 people try to leave at once?

15
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:22,322
What do you think will happen if they step over each other to save their own lives?

16
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:26,214
If someone dies or faints, that door could get blocked.

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,560
I need all of you to help me.

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,322
I will make sure everyone gets out of here without getting hurt.

19
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:34,594
Do you have a plan?

20
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,068
I'm…

21
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:39,927
going to read a book.

22
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,727
Deok Im,

23
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:53,767
do you think we can do this?

24
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,060
I'm so scared.

25
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,363
It's not for my own life.

26
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:05,698
I can't believe the lives of so many depend on us.

27
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:08,367
I'm scared of that responsibility.

28
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,326
I'm scared, too.

29
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:23,818
I'm so fortunate to have you all with me.

30
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:43,796
Everyone! It is time for Deok Im's book reading.

31
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:46,832
Please gather around. Deok Im will read a book.

32
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:50,615
Deok Im will read a book.

33
00:03:56,007 --> 00:04:00,098
Wait, she should be on duty. What is she doing over there?

34
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,004
Everyone!

35
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:11,909
- I'm going to read a book for all of you!
- Really?

36
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:24,106
I'm going to read a novel called, "The Story of Woon Yeong."

37
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,560
It is about a court lady named Woon Yeong.

38
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,379
This court lady ends up falling in love

39
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,230
with someone she shouldn't have.

40
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,944
Oh, how foolish!

41
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:39,763
It sounds fun!

42
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,597
Before I start,

43
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,969
you need to practice something important first.

44
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:50,681
I will read you the book as soon as you finish.

45
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,652
What do you mean by practice?

46
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:56,131
All of you should line up in order

47
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:58,469
and practice exiting through the door.

48
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,520
Why are we doing that?

49
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,538
We received orders. Please hurry!

50
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:07,015
That way, I can quickly read this book for you all.

51
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,496
Please trust me on this.

52
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,401
Everyone who entered the Palace during the Year of the Ox, please stand up.

53
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,847
One by one, please!

54
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:19,511
Please line up and exit through the door.

55
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,531
You entered the Palace in the Year of the Ox.

56
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:27,102
You, too. Exit in a single file.

57
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,400
Next…

58
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,668
The apprentice maids who entered the Palace in the Year of the Rat.

59
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,948
Next, the Year of the Pig.

60
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:43,709
Deok Im! What is going on?

61
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,050
You should go out first, My Lady!

62
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,815
What?

63
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:48,524
- My Lady?
- You should go.

64
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:51,333
Please save us!

65
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,695
Please save us!

66
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:01,169
It's a tiger!

67
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,100
It's a tiger!

68
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,320
Get out.

69
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:25,941
Year of the Dog! Year of the Dog!

70
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:36,958
Year of the Dog! Year of the Dog!

71
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:41,044
Year of the Dog! Year of the Dog!

72
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,666
Year of the Dog!

73
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:49,369
I will burn you, I will burn you!
(T/N: A threat to the apprentice maids to watch their mouths and actions)

74
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:52,141
I will burn you, I will burn you!

75
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:55,060
I will burn you, I will burn you!

76
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,913
I will burn you!

77
00:06:56,913 --> 00:07:00,397
Hey, you wenches! She said those who came in the Year of the Dog go first!

78
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:01,905
Year of the Dog!

79
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:05,833
Year of the Dog! Year of the Dog!

80
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,135
Year of the Dog!

81
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:10,060
In order, please. Year of the Dog!

82
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:12,827
Year of the Rooster!

83
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:16,149
Year of the Rooster! Year of the Rooster!

84
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,134
Year of the Rooster!

85
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:21,488
Year of the Monkey! Year of the Monkey!

86
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,440
Deok Im.

87
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,900
Seo Eun Bi! Why are you here? You should leave now!

88
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,097
Deok Im! The gate is blocked!

89
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:36,789
Ah Yeong and Yeon Ju are still inside.

90
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,782
I will go and look. You should leave now!

91
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:52,894
Girls! Are you in here?

92
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,224
- Girls!
- Please save us!

93
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:12,382
Come on out. Is it just the two of you? Are there others?

94
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:15,302
I don't see Suk Geum.

95
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:17,649
You go on ahead. I will look for her.

96
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:36,247
Are you hurt?

97
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:38,872
Did you not get hurt?

98
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,355
- I didn't.
- Can you walk?

99
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:43,605
Yes.

100
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:47,021
You'll be safe if you go that way.

101
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,625
Go.

102
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:26,503
Is the trap ready?

103
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:28,864
Everything is set.

104
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:46,740
Let's start the hunt!

105
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,621
Are you okay?

106
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,185
It's Deok Im! Deok Im!

107
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:36,096
Thank you, Deok Im!

108
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:38,622
Thank you, Deok Im!

109
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:40,686
Deok Im!

110
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,664
You were amazing.

111
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:44,277
We did it!

112
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:48,637
Deok Im! Deok Im!

113
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:52,954
My Lady!

114
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:19,175
Every time Sir Preceptor comes to the Palace in the morning,

115
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:22,280
he drinks water by the well.

116
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,594
I wonder if he's coming today.

117
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,218
Are you hurt?

118
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:31,285
Did you not get hurt?

119
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,155
I wanted to thank him.

120
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,417
- Miss Young Maiden?
- He's here.

121
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:49,693
Sir, you are...

122
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:51,316
Do I know you?

123
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:55,043
Last time… Never mind.

124
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:57,937
Why did you call for me just now?

125
00:14:57,937 --> 00:15:01,706
Could I have a sip of water, Miss Maiden?

126
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,399
Thank you.

127
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,854
Sir.

128
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:16,440
May I take a look at that royal announcement?

129
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:24,030
A tiger appeared in the Palace yesterday.

130
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,474
I heard no other news other than that it was caught.

131
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:29,064
I was curious.

132
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:32,413
Did anyone get injured while they were catching that tiger?

133
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,628
Of course, you should be curious.

134
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,060
What is this?

135
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,793
The Crown Prince and his bodyguards

136
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:56,590
are being punished for hunting the tiger themselves without His Majesty's royal assent?

137
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:59,045
Is this true?

138
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:00,982
It is.

139
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:04,632
Anyone who participated in the hunt

140
00:16:05,851 --> 00:16:07,855
will be punished.

141
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:27,044
Who cares about permission when a tiger suddenly appears?

142
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:29,378
There is no time for royal assent.

143
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:32,721
Do we have to wait until all the palace maids become the tiger's food?

144
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:35,300
That seems to be the answer.

145
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,962
If dozens of people had died,

146
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:41,752
I'm sure the situation would have been deemed urgent.

147
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:47,222
If that had been the case, they would have been rewarded for catching the tiger.

148
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:51,678
If I had been there, I would have stopped the Crown Prince.

149
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:56,495
I would have told him to wait for more people to die.

150
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,497
Thank you for the water.

151
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,367
I should get going.

152
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:07,832
I'm sorry, but…

153
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:11,192
Do you have any news about Sir Preceptor?

154
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:19,224
What did you just say?

155
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:22,885
Sir Preceptor saved me yesterday.

156
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:25,862
I left by myself without helping him.

157
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:27,540
I feel bad about it.

158
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,373
I'm worried he might have gotten hurt.

159
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,374
Do you not know?

160
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:36,840
The Preceptor I know

161
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,610
might be the Preceptor you're speaking of.

162
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,426
This Preceptor…

163
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:45,189
What does he look like?

164
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,560
Well…

165
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,605
He is about this tall.

166
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,795
And his face…

167
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:56,557
He always wears a headband with jade ring buttons.

168
00:17:56,557 --> 00:18:00,552
He always wears it though he's not a senior official,

169
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:04,785
so I always thought he would get in trouble.

170
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:07,429
Wait.

171
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,129
Could it be...

172
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:20,799
I'm sorry.

173
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,352
I'm afraid I don't know the Sir Preceptor you are looking for.

174
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:27,788
I understand.

175
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:29,622
I should go now.

176
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:33,128
Thank you, Sir.

177
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:45,221
Seeing your tassel reminds me that

178
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:49,768
we once passed by each other.

179
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:55,728
If we happen to meet again next time,

180
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:59,779
please let me know your name.

181
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,094
"Please let me know your name."

182
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:23,926
I shouldn't fall for him.

183
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,816
No, no, no. I shouldn't.

184
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:34,770
Only His Majesty can hunt animals as part of military exercise.

185
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,257
Only His Majesty has the right to conduct it in this kingdom.

186
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:42,042
It doesn't matter that he is the Crown Prince!

187
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:44,914
To hunt without His Majesty's royal assent

188
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:48,847
is a show of his contempt for the throne!

189
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:51,674
He is right, Your Majesty!

190
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:56,188
The Crown Prince used the military at will in this solemn palace.

191
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:58,055
This is disastrous.

192
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:01,919
He deserves a severe punishment.

193
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:05,657
What do you think, Left State Councilor?

194
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:10,331
Catching a tiger is no easy feat, Your Majesty,

195
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:15,345
but the Crown Prince did it with ease.

196
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:21,874
I heard he got the beast with a single arrow.

197
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:26,720
That made me think.

198
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,051
If he could catch a tiger so easily…

199
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,907
couldn't he catch a dragon as well?

200
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,821
Left State Councilor!

201
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:44,807
How dare you make such a terrible remark?

202
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:48,345
The Crown Prince is the heir to the throne!

203
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:53,739
Such reckless slander won't be forgiven!

204
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,084
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

205
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:08,152
I was only giving an honest answer to Your Majesty's question!

206
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:09,878
Obviously…

207
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:14,248
Obviously, it was a reprehensible thought.

208
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:18,215
However, most people

209
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:22,752
might misunderstand, just like me.

210
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:29,356
Without receiving your royal assent,

211
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:32,331
he mobilized the military.

212
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:36,202
There is no precedent for this.

213
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:39,842
What punishment I should ask of Your Majesty

214
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:44,816
I cannot possibly figure it out.

215
00:21:58,201 --> 00:22:02,946
He should have used the sword after he unsheathed it.

216
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:07,802
The Left State Councilor's lies and deceit infuriate me.

217
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:12,178
If he was going to back off so easily, he shouldn't have reported to His Majesty at all!

218
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:17,372
But Mother, his accusation was too serious to pursue.

219
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:21,067
The one who catches a tiger can also catch a dragon.

220
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:24,539
If the Crown Prince can mobilize the well-trained army to catch a tiger,

221
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,390
he could also overthrow His Majesty. That is what it means...

222
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,620
The Crown Prince conducted the hunt.

223
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,217
He mobilized the military without His Majesty's permission.

224
00:22:34,217 --> 00:22:36,973
If this isn't treason, then what is?

225
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:41,774
But his excuse could be that he was only trying to prevent tiger-related attacks.

226
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,049
Why do you always hesitate?

227
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:48,243
If I were a man like you,

228
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:52,420
I would have petitioned for a harsh punishment.

229
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:56,695
Go and persuade the Left State Councilor.

230
00:22:56,695 --> 00:23:01,646
We must take this opportunity to definitely depose the Crown Prince.

231
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:07,237
Tell him that we shouldn't hesitate to take this opportunity from Heaven.

232
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:14,621
Did I offend the Princess?

233
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:17,864
Seeing a member of the royal household furious

234
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:21,353
sends shivers up my back.

235
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:25,063
My mother desperately wants to depose the Crown Prince, Your Excellency.

236
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:28,434
The Crown Prince is the Princess's own nephew.

237
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:32,167
How can an aunt hate her nephew so much?

238
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:37,033
All this time, I thought we were in the same boat.

239
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:38,927
Have I been wrong?

240
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:42,379
What are you trying to say?

241
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,368
Are you suggesting that my allegiance lies with the Crown Prince?

242
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:49,169
There seems to be a possibility for that.

243
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,693
Look, Second State Councilor.

244
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:54,608
If we are in the same boat, we can't doubt each other.

245
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:57,341
Such a boat is bound to sink.

246
00:23:57,341 --> 00:24:00,611
I'm saying we should be careful.

247
00:24:00,611 --> 00:24:04,195
If we rush, we might make a mistake.

248
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:05,746
Do you think

249
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:10,978
it is easy to accuse the Crown Prince of treason?

250
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,828
The truth is always subjective.

251
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:19,207
The Crown Prince has sinned by using the military without royal assent.

252
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:24,412
You could say that he did it to prevent tiger-related attacks and protect lives.

253
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:28,444
I think this instance is a bit ambiguous.

254
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:32,387
Wouldn't His Majesty think the same?

255
00:24:34,763 --> 00:24:37,197
I understand what you mean.

256
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:39,473
I will make sure my mother understands.

257
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:43,128
Yes, yes. We understand each other.

258
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:47,328
It would be nice if the Princess and I were on the same page as well.

259
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:48,872
I will be leaving now.

260
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:51,206
Take care.

261
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,595
I like him.

262
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,887
The Princess adopted a fine son.

263
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:20,618
I wondered

264
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:25,796
why she adopted a lowly fisherman's son.

265
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:31,358
I'm guessing you're the one who recommended him to the Princess?

266
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:37,579
Do you also think I tend to play too safe?

267
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:42,465
But I feel somehow reluctant

268
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:45,531
to push the Crown Prince into a corner like this.

269
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:49,531
I might lose the King's favor.

270
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:54,293
Don't just stay quiet. Give me some advice.

271
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:57,023
What do you think?

272
00:26:01,282 --> 00:26:06,871
If there's even a tiny seed of doubt in His Majesty's heart,

273
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:10,340
we have done enough.

274
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,635
The seed of doubt always grows exponentially.

275
00:26:18,923 --> 00:26:21,846
There is no need to hurry.

276
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:27,273
Let's wait and see how things unfold.

277
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:37,829
Deok Im.

278
00:26:39,227 --> 00:26:40,860
Deok Im.

279
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,735
Yes, Princess Cheong Yeon?

280
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:47,098
You look really tired. It's exhausting, isn't it?

281
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:48,379
No, I'm fine.

282
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:50,099
I'm sorry.

283
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,265
I shouldn't have hurried you so much when you were already so busy.

284
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:59,028
But Princess Cheong Seon, why are you in such a rush?

285
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:03,781
I was waiting for Grandfather's royal portrait to be completed

286
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:06,657
before giving him my transcribed book.

287
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:10,885
However, due to circumstances, I have to hurry and complete the book.

288
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:13,701
That way

289
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:18,727
I will have an excuse to see Grandfather.

290
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:22,814
His Majesty really likes this novel.

291
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:27,348
I'm going to beg him earnestly to forgive my brother.

292
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:33,327
If His Majesty forgives His Highness the Crown Prince,

293
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:36,956
will all the people who followed him on the hunt

294
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,901
also be forgiven?

295
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,273
I'm sure they will.

296
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:59,030
(T/N: She is transcribing the book, Tale of the Gwak and Jang Families)

297
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:05,616
It is harder to serve in the Crown Prince's Palace without its master.

298
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,860
Sitting there all day with nothing to do...

299
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,828
It's so boring…

300
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,726
Mother.

301
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,344
You look so tired.

302
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:32,567
What are you doing here?

303
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:35,524
Have some water first.

304
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:40,427
I haven't...

305
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:42,775
received His Majesty's forgiveness yet.

306
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:47,538
Do you think I entered the palace without His Majesty's permission?

307
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:52,164
His Majesty asked me to come to make sure that you don't fall ill.

308
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:24,185
Mother, do you also think

309
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:26,762
that I acted rashly?

310
00:30:26,762 --> 00:30:28,716
I'm not sure.

311
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:32,316
When I first heard the news…

312
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:35,651
I only had one thought.

313
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:39,594
I'm sure your father would have done the same.

314
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:43,803
He would have raised his cherished bow and arrow

315
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:46,801
and faced that frightening tiger.

316
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:51,159
It would have been better if he had been born

317
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:55,311
into the ordinary warrior class and fought with that tiger.

318
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:59,516
It is better to have died by the tiger's claws…

319
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:10,811
Old memories just bring me tears.

320
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:14,294
- Mother.
- San.

321
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:21,638
As your mother,

322
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:26,069
I will not lose you, no matter what.

323
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,450
[Tale of the Gwak and Jang Families]

324
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:51,579
Please check for any errors, Your Highness.

325
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:58,968
Did you finish all this by yourself, Deok Im?

326
00:32:01,977 --> 00:32:04,799
Did you stay up all night to complete this?

327
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,005
Why did you do it alone? I would have helped you.

328
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:10,258
Right, we would have helped you as well.

329
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:12,041
You wouldn't have been of much help anyway.

330
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:16,276
Wow... There is not even a single error.

331
00:32:16,276 --> 00:32:18,457
I can't believe you did this all by yourself.

332
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:23,354
Your Highness, can you now go see the King?

333
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:27,827
I hope the Crown Prince and all his followers

334
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:30,681
can receive forgiveness soon.

335
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:36,062
- Thank you, Deok Im.
- Thank you so much.

336
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:41,065
All right! Let's go see Grandfather right now!

337
00:32:41,065 --> 00:32:44,660
We will present these to him and ask him to forgive our brother.

338
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,938
Right, Cheong Seon?

339
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:47,571
Yes!

340
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:50,854
Deok Im, you should come with us!

341
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:53,556
Do you want me to come with you?

342
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,252
What?

343
00:32:55,252 --> 00:32:59,151
Grandfather won't see us?

344
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:03,593
Lady Kim, are you sure you're not mistaken?

345
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:07,314
I received the answer from His Majesty myself.

346
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:09,291
I am really sorry, Your Highness.

347
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:11,308
I can't believe this.

348
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:19,355
Don't be too disappointed.

349
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,932
I'm not, and I won't give up.

350
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:28,277
Everyone follow me!

351
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:32,001
- Your Highness!
- Cheong Yeon!

352
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:33,666
Cheong Yeon!

353
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:48,460
I'm glad you're here. I was feeling lonely.

354
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,917
It feels lively just by having young people like you here.

355
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:57,171
We are grateful you have welcomed us, Your Highness.

356
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:05,095
We would be much obliged to have you listen to our request.

357
00:34:05,095 --> 00:34:08,380
You're asking me to help you to see the King.

358
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,089
I'm sorry, but I can't grant your request.

359
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:16,782
We merely want to give Grandfather our transcribed books.

360
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:21,159
And also ask him to forgive the Crown Prince.

361
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:26,704
His Majesty didn't allow the two of you to enter the King's Palace.

362
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:31,691
He refused because he didn't want to hear about the Crown Prince's matter.

363
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:35,713
What His Majesty didn't allow…

364
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:39,134
even I cannot help.

365
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:43,348
Please look upon this palace maiden, Your Highness.

366
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:49,398
What would have taken six people three days to complete,

367
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:52,650
this girl transcribed this book by herself in a single day.

368
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:56,340
She did it on her own without anyone asking her to do it.

369
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,565
Are you not curious about the reason?

370
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:04,520
Raise your head.

371
00:35:08,432 --> 00:35:10,911
To finish a book in one day

372
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:14,088
couldn't have been easy, even if you had great talent.

373
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:15,738
Why did you do that?

374
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,366
Since you're inquiring, I will answer.

375
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,659
A young palace maiden died because of the tiger attack.

376
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:25,485
The court ladies collected money and held a funeral for the girl.

377
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:28,726
We sent money to her family in order to comfort them.

378
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:35,196
It is thanks to the Crown Prince that no other tragedies have occurred.

379
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:38,389
Paying back a favor to the Crown Prince

380
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:40,533
for preventing further tiger attacks.

381
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:42,597
It is a very trivial talent,

382
00:35:42,597 --> 00:35:45,481
but I hoped it would help.

383
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:50,104
Your Highness, Grandfather really likes this book.

384
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:53,038
If we give him this book, and he sees our earnestness,

385
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:56,049
he might forgive our brother.

386
00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:59,768
Princess Cheong Yeon! Princess Cheong Seon!

387
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:04,601
I can feel your earnestness. However,

388
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:08,757
I can't allow you two to have an audience with His Majesty.

389
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:11,896
His Majesty expressed his firm intention not to let you meet him.

390
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:14,406
That is a royal command.

391
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:17,660
I cannot recklessly disobey him.

392
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:22,317
But when it comes to that child, things are different.

393
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:28,617
If it were you, an audience with His Majesty could be arranged.

394
00:36:29,566 --> 00:36:34,722
His Majesty has never issued an order barring you.

395
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:38,887
What do you say?

396
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:43,195
Would you like an audience with His Majesty?

397
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:45,899
Of course, she would like to do as you propose.

398
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:50,582
Deok Im, please give the book to Grandfather for us.

399
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:51,345
Pardon?

400
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,955
Please ask forgiveness for our brother too.

401
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:57,176
I don't think I'm capable, Your Highness.

402
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:59,565
I'm a mere palace maiden, so

403
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:01,998
how dare I meet His Majesty?

404
00:37:01,998 --> 00:37:04,584
Please do it.

405
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,620
What would you do?

406
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,163
Shall I arrange the audience?

407
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:17,640
Or would you prefer to do nothing?

408
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,068
We count on you, Deok Im.

409
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:31,190
Take care, Your Highness.

410
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:41,425
So I'm supposed to see the King,

411
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:44,646
give him the book

412
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:49,737
and ask forgiveness for His Highness?

413
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:53,350
What is wrong with me?

414
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,950
Why did I agree to it?

415
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:03,426
What a surprise.

416
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:06,005
So you will see His Majesty?

417
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:09,705
I apologize I couldn't notify you first.

418
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:13,507
It happened suddenly, when would you have had the time?

419
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:16,992
I will put in a good word with the attendant lady of the King's palace.

420
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:19,057
Thank you, My Lady.

421
00:38:19,057 --> 00:38:21,928
I worry for you.

422
00:38:21,928 --> 00:38:26,132
The Crown Prince only acted in order to protect lives,

423
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:28,519
but he is now in trouble.

424
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:34,094
Even I personally want to beg for his forgiveness,

425
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:38,821
but his actions have led to factional strife at the court.

426
00:38:38,821 --> 00:38:41,233
It won't be that easy to solve.

427
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:42,788
I know, My Lady.

428
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:48,443
I admit I'm impressed by your large-mindedness,

429
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:50,643
but I'm still worried.

430
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:54,107
I will tell you one thing;

431
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:58,037
the most important thing is His Majesty's mood.

432
00:38:58,037 --> 00:39:00,171
If he seems to be in bad mood,

433
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,263
don't say a word. Simply give him the book and return.

434
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:07,844
I'm not forcing you,

435
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:12,140
but still, I wish you would give him the book,

436
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,990
observe silently,

437
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:18,048
and come back safely.

438
00:39:23,306 --> 00:39:26,728
I will announce your arrival, please wait here.

439
00:39:26,728 --> 00:39:28,859
Yes, My Lady.

440
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:37,918
Hey, Deok Im!

441
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:38,962
Bok Yeon!

442
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,385
Why are you here?

443
00:39:40,385 --> 00:39:42,682
I'm here for an audience with His Majesty.

444
00:39:42,682 --> 00:39:43,937
You are?

445
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:46,094
I will explain it later.

446
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:49,731
How is the King feeling today?

447
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,103
Hang on.

448
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:07,355
The King… He washed his ears.

449
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:09,003
What does that mean?

450
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:13,550
It means he is in a horrible mood.

451
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:21,064
Come with me.

452
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:21,879
Yes, My Lady.

453
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:25,337
Today is not the day. Just give him the book and leave.

454
00:40:25,337 --> 00:40:27,450
Nothing more.

455
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,430
It is the Crown Prince. Pretend you didn't see His Highness.

456
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,757
His Highness the Crown Prince?

457
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:59,075
I told you not to look. Put your head down.

458
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:05,370
For a moment, he looked like Sir Preceptor.

459
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:31,331
Your Majesty, a palace maiden has arrived on an errand for Princess Cheong Yeon and Princess Cheong Seon.

460
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:33,386
She awaits your call.

461
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:35,474
Send her in.

462
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:37,341
Yes, Your Majesty.

463
00:41:47,368 --> 00:41:52,945
Your Majesty, I, Sung Deok Im, a palace maiden of the Crown Prince's Palace, greet you.

464
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:56,137
Just a moment.

465
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:59,507
Let me finish this.

466
00:41:59,507 --> 00:42:01,845
Sit, sit.

467
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,068
Is this really the best?

468
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:13,035
It seems that way to me, Your Majesty.

469
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:18,536
Age must dull the tongue then.

470
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:23,559
Have her try a bit.

471
00:42:26,857 --> 00:42:31,968
On request of the King, please try a spoonful of each.

472
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:58,550
So which tastes best?

473
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,771
Oh, well…

474
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:02,345
Come sit closer to me.

475
00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:04,724
My ears don't hear well.

476
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:06,810
Hurry now.

477
00:43:10,753 --> 00:43:12,442
Good.

478
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:19,038
Lift your head a bit.

479
00:43:19,038 --> 00:43:24,841
I need to see your face to hear you well.

480
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:30,459
Which is your favorite?

481
00:43:32,064 --> 00:43:34,009
This one, Your Majesty.

482
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:41,346
The best is from the Jo family, that's no surprise!

483
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:42,970
Tell them to send more.

484
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:45,188
Yes, Your Majesty.

485
00:43:46,185 --> 00:43:49,007
Okay, so then.

486
00:43:54,822 --> 00:43:56,500
Why have you come?

487
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,655
I was sent to give Your Majesty

488
00:43:58,655 --> 00:44:01,712
the "Tale of the Gwak and Jang Families" from Princess Cheong Seon and Princess Cheong Yeon.

489
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:05,620
Oh! The Tale of Gwak and Jang Families!

490
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:09,866
That is the sequel to the Mongokssangbongyeonnok, isn't it?
(T/N: The first novel that includes the Tale of Gwak and Jang)

491
00:44:09,866 --> 00:44:14,248
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- That's a good one, isn't it!

492
00:44:14,248 --> 00:44:16,060
Let's see it.

493
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:22,681
I need my glasses.

494
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:26,960
Let's see here.

495
00:44:29,546 --> 00:44:33,924
Here, eat one of these.

496
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:35,659
Take it.

497
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:40,160
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

498
00:44:51,442 --> 00:44:56,586
Good. You performed your errand well.

499
00:44:56,586 --> 00:44:59,303
You can go now.

500
00:44:59,303 --> 00:45:01,534
Yes, Your Majesty.

501
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:08,732
Come on, all you did was eat rice cake.

502
00:45:08,732 --> 00:45:10,787
Wait, wait!

503
00:45:10,787 --> 00:45:14,390
Come back for a moment.

504
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:26,476
Sung Deok Im, yes?
[Sung Deok Im]

505
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:28,564
Yes, Your Majesty.

506
00:45:28,564 --> 00:45:31,739
You have lovely handwriting.

507
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:37,046
The portion that you copied out is the easiest to read.

508
00:45:37,046 --> 00:45:39,780
You honor me, Your Majesty.

509
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,713
Bring some money.

510
00:45:41,713 --> 00:45:43,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,874
Here.

512
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:07,413
You honor me, Your Majesty!

513
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:13,336
Looking at you, you remind me of my child.

514
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:18,740
Do you have any wishes?

515
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,038
Do you want anything?

516
00:46:21,982 --> 00:46:24,093
No need to hesitate. Tell me.

517
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:29,730
How often in life will a King grant your wish?

518
00:46:32,944 --> 00:46:35,100
If there's nothing, you can leave now.

519
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,610
Please forgive the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.

520
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:45,994
What?

521
00:46:51,014 --> 00:46:54,015
Forgive the Crown Prince?

522
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:58,124
Your Majesty asked for my wish.

523
00:46:58,124 --> 00:47:01,200
I beg of you, Your Majesty.

524
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:08,720
How long did it take you to transcribe this book?

525
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,267
Six people transcribed it over the course of three months.

526
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:14,840
Six people, over three months.

527
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:31,226
Burn it!

528
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:34,070
Yes, Your Majesty!

529
00:47:37,398 --> 00:47:41,987
There are royal guards in the palace.

530
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,396
If there is an unexpected tiger attack,

531
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:51,849
they should be the ones to deal with it.

532
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:56,052
However, the Crown Prince looked down on them and

533
00:47:57,447 --> 00:48:03,269
caught the tiger with the bodyguards he trained himself.

534
00:48:04,413 --> 00:48:07,110
Why do you think he did that?

535
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:10,590
He disdained the royal guards!

536
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:16,191
He thought them silly and incompetent, unable to deal with the trouble

537
00:48:16,191 --> 00:48:22,417
so he decided to solve it with his own prideful hand.

538
00:48:23,497 --> 00:48:26,899
He thought the royal guards were inept, and

539
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:31,454
he thought the police and the military were inept. All of them!

540
00:48:31,454 --> 00:48:36,742
If the King is inept, then his followers must be, too, right?

541
00:48:36,742 --> 00:48:41,486
He is self-righteous and proud.

542
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:48,141
However, he is not the king here! I am!

543
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:57,424
How dare some mere palace maiden asks for his forgiveness?

544
00:48:57,424 --> 00:49:01,683
Do you think I should readily forgive him?

545
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:05,629
So it's not just the Crown Prince who disrespects me around here!

546
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:07,843
What I have done deserves death, Your Majesty.

547
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:10,676
Then you should die!

548
00:49:10,676 --> 00:49:14,142
But I'm a man that keeps his promises.

549
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:18,230
Since I promised to grant you one wish,

550
00:49:18,232 --> 00:49:23,577
give me that wish before you die.

551
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:25,382
Hurry!

552
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:58,872
You honor me, Your Majesty.

553
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:01,551
What do you mean?

554
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:05,620
Are you thanking me for taking your life?

555
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,411
I will never forget your gift of this coin, Your Majesty.

556
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:17,170
It means more to me than I can describe, Your Majesty.

557
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:18,962
What does that mean?

558
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:24,078
Since I entered the palace, my mission was to save 100 nyang.

559
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:25,894
I entered the palace when I was seven.

560
00:50:25,896 --> 00:50:29,084
In the last ten or so years, I have accumulated 99 nyang.

561
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:32,758
It is thanks to Your Majesty's kindness that I reached 100.

562
00:50:32,758 --> 00:50:35,704
You do me immeasurable honor, Your Majesty.

563
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:40,376
Sung Deok Im, wait.

564
00:50:40,376 --> 00:50:43,997
Wait until His Majesty asks you about your story.

565
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:47,852
Be patient, wait.

566
00:50:47,852 --> 00:50:51,759
Why did you have to save 100 nyang?

567
00:50:52,456 --> 00:50:54,556
It's a long story, Your Majesty.

568
00:50:54,558 --> 00:50:58,732
It does not matter, go on.

569
00:51:01,214 --> 00:51:07,331
One day, after I turned seven, my mother called my brother and me.

570
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:12,076
She said that our family had become too poor for us to continue living together.

571
00:51:12,076 --> 00:51:14,707
One of you will remain living here,

572
00:51:14,707 --> 00:51:19,536
and the other will come with Mother and go where Father is.

573
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:22,555
I was afraid to be left alone.

574
00:51:22,555 --> 00:51:27,621
I pleaded with her to take me instead of my brother.

575
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:30,027
She agreed.

576
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:34,440
As leaving a young girl alone only invites trouble,

577
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,181
she agreed to take me in his place.

578
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:41,536
But my brother grew angry at my mother,

579
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:44,199
telling her that she couldn't take me.

580
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:47,545
Come what may, he refused to send me away.

581
00:51:47,545 --> 00:51:50,515
I was desperate to follow her,

582
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:53,915
but my brother wouldn't let me go.

583
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:56,967
Seeing my mother leaving alone like that,

584
00:51:56,967 --> 00:51:59,544
I bore my brother a grudge.

585
00:51:59,544 --> 00:52:03,105
I told him I would resent him forever.

586
00:52:03,783 --> 00:52:06,504
He told me he was sorry.

587
00:52:06,504 --> 00:52:11,405
He promised me that he would always take care of me.

588
00:52:11,405 --> 00:52:15,517
Soon after, I entered the palace

589
00:52:15,517 --> 00:52:18,726
and never saw him again.

590
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:21,837
Was your…

591
00:52:25,126 --> 00:52:28,004
father dead?

592
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:35,227
And your mother followed him there?

593
00:52:35,227 --> 00:52:37,486
Yes, Your Majesty.

594
00:52:37,486 --> 00:52:43,687
This story, why have you told me this?

595
00:52:43,687 --> 00:52:46,099
I don't want to die, Your Majesty!

596
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:52,700
I want to survive and give my brother the 100 nyang I saved.

597
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,471
With the money, he can take the civil service exam.

598
00:52:55,471 --> 00:53:01,006
I want to give him everything he wants in life.

599
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:04,070
I will never see my mother or father again,

600
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:10,037
but I want to let him know that I'm happy to see him again.

601
00:53:10,037 --> 00:53:12,192
Your Majesty,

602
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:17,309
please take pity on me.

603
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:18,413
Please spare my—

604
00:53:18,414 --> 00:53:22,255
Hey, hey, I'm not killing you.

605
00:53:22,255 --> 00:53:25,845
I won't kill you so settle down.

606
00:53:25,845 --> 00:53:30,415
I never had that intention.

607
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:35,328
I just wanted to scare this fearless palace maiden.

608
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:40,636
You're very much like my late daughter.

609
00:53:40,636 --> 00:53:46,259
You remind me of Princess Hwa Pyeong.

610
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:49,825
How could I ever kill you?

611
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:52,582
You honor me, Your Majesty.

612
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:57,283
Go back and tell Cheong Yeon and Cheong Seon

613
00:53:57,283 --> 00:54:02,650
that I don't want them to do this again.

614
00:54:03,919 --> 00:54:09,775
There's the right time for everything under heaven.

615
00:54:09,775 --> 00:54:14,902
And I'm looking for that right time.

616
00:54:14,902 --> 00:54:17,003
Yes, Your Majesty.

617
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,408
You must be tired, go back home now.

618
00:54:21,408 --> 00:54:23,219
Yes, Your Majesty.

619
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:23,612
Deok Im!

620
00:55:24,915 --> 00:55:26,804
Deok Im!

621
00:55:27,939 --> 00:55:29,149
Hey, Deok Im!

622
00:55:29,149 --> 00:55:30,972
Someone help!

623
00:55:30,972 --> 00:55:33,406
Deok Im!

624
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:36,040
I will carry her!

625
00:56:50,885 --> 00:56:52,741
You no-good child!

626
00:56:52,741 --> 00:56:54,571
I have wronged, Your Majesty.

627
00:56:54,571 --> 00:56:56,227
Shut it!

628
00:56:56,227 --> 00:57:00,535
They are empty words. Do you think I wouldn't know that?

629
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:06,734
In the same situation, you would do it all over again!

630
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:11,585
How dare you brashly take up your bow?

631
00:57:11,585 --> 00:57:14,585
The royal guards are here, aren't they?

632
00:57:14,585 --> 00:57:18,073
They're all good-for-nothings, right?

633
00:57:18,073 --> 00:57:20,530
So you, the true hero, stepped forward!

634
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:24,184
I thought nothing of the sort, Your Majesty!

635
00:57:24,184 --> 00:57:27,637
There was no time to think!

636
00:57:27,637 --> 00:57:31,571
Bringing in my men and catching the tiger,

637
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:33,652
it's because, at that moment, I had a bow in my hands

638
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:37,118
and my men, whom I could trust, by me.

639
00:57:37,118 --> 00:57:41,785
The tiger was there before my eyes, and your subjects required aid!

640
00:57:41,785 --> 00:57:43,009
Nothing more, Your Majesty!

641
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:46,936
Look! No word of regret at all!

642
00:57:46,936 --> 00:57:50,695
Then why ask for my forgiveness at all?

643
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:56,022
You haven't got a clue as to what you did wrong!

644
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:07,043
Do you know how frightened I was?

645
00:58:07,043 --> 00:58:11,409
What if the tiger had taken my precious grandson

646
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:14,410
and decided to eat him up?

647
00:58:16,212 --> 00:58:18,401
San!

648
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:23,325
Never do this again.

649
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:29,512
Your grandfather can't live without you.

650
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:33,739
You silly boy.

651
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:48,082
Take care, Sir!

652
00:59:09,108 --> 00:59:12,596
Were you perhaps surprised that I called you out of blue?

653
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:15,422
I cannot say that I am pleased.

654
00:59:15,422 --> 00:59:18,555
I wanted to have a drink with you.

655
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,825
Have you forgotten that drinking is forbidden?

656
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:24,407
Are you planning to rat me out?

657
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:29,192
Come now, aren't we distant family?

658
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:32,830
As an elder family member, let me pour you a drink.

659
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,382
But will you take a drink from me?

660
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:53,159
Take a guess about what I will do.

661
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,502
If you're right,

662
00:59:57,502 --> 01:00:02,530
I will answer one of your questions.

663
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:12,612
Of course, you'll take the drink.

664
01:00:12,612 --> 01:00:16,110
You're brave and not one to shy away.

665
01:00:22,128 --> 01:00:23,996
I'm right.

666
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,495
So now you answer me.

667
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,368
What do you think I will ask you?

668
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:31,716
You want to know how much I know.

669
01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:37,283
I know the source of the anonymous letter that flew into the Crown Prince's Palace.

670
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:40,311
Anonymous letter?

671
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:42,377
I didn't know about that.

672
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:46,012
Are you saying something like that happened in the Crown Prince's Palace?

673
01:00:46,012 --> 01:00:49,143
The King should have been told immediately!

674
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:54,112
Why didn't the Crown Prince do something?

675
01:00:55,643 --> 01:01:01,721
Was it perhaps that the contents would have angered the King?

676
01:01:01,721 --> 01:01:04,895
Should I guess at those contents?

677
01:01:05,565 --> 01:01:09,321
The Crown Prince who died in the Year of the Horse...

678
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:16,571
The King wants to forget all about his death.

679
01:01:16,571 --> 01:01:20,143
If anything were to remind him of the past…

680
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:24,604
who would be in the most trouble?

681
01:01:24,604 --> 01:01:26,965
Revealing the origin of that note...

682
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:30,821
Would it be beneficial to the Crown Prince?

683
01:01:32,224 --> 01:01:36,757
It's up to you to convince the Crown Prince

684
01:01:36,757 --> 01:01:41,115
to let go of the past.

685
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:44,362
Was the incident my fault or something?

686
01:01:44,362 --> 01:01:47,743
The events of that year weren't Your Excellency's fault.

687
01:01:47,743 --> 01:01:52,388
That's right! Now we understand each other!

688
01:01:54,072 --> 01:01:59,139
Your Excellency wouldn't have it in you to kill a prince.

689
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:03,550
That is unless you were acting as someone's pawn.

690
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:07,154
If you are not thinking of killing me here and now,

691
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:11,481
I think I will take my leave.

692
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:26,569
I suddenly remember your mother's face.

693
01:02:26,569 --> 01:02:30,472
After your father died, she used to go from house to house,

694
01:02:30,472 --> 01:02:34,439
looking for food for you and your younger sister.

695
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:40,087
Everyone in the Hong family would know your mother's face.

696
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:45,147
Wait, what did I do when she came to my house?

697
01:02:45,147 --> 01:02:49,758
I seem to recall giving her a bag of rice.

698
01:02:49,758 --> 01:02:53,538
You seemed to have forgotten it all since it's been a while.

699
01:02:53,538 --> 01:02:57,690
You must have been there, too, right?

700
01:03:03,232 --> 01:03:07,294
I remember that day well.

701
01:03:07,934 --> 01:03:12,401
Your Excellency looked at my sister and said…

702
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:15,941
"If you raise her for a few more years,"

703
01:03:15,941 --> 01:03:18,152
"you can send her off to marry some old man as a second wife"

704
01:03:18,153 --> 01:03:20,310
"and she won't have to starve again."

705
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,607
(T/N: Jaechi/second wife: a wife in the second marriage)

706
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:28,474
"In a few more years, I will find her a place."

707
01:03:28,474 --> 01:03:30,469
I have always wanted

708
01:03:30,469 --> 01:03:35,148
to place my sister in some honorable position.

709
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:39,677
Your words made me feel a bit sad.

710
01:03:40,564 --> 01:03:43,987
Some honorable position?

711
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:48,203
Don't tell me you want to pawn your sister off onto the Crown Prince.

712
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:51,347
My sister is still a young girl.

713
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:53,014
But...

714
01:03:53,984 --> 01:03:57,935
when a new sun rises again from the east,

715
01:03:57,935 --> 01:04:00,079
won't she be a lad then?

716
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,812
Look at this ambitious child.

717
01:04:03,812 --> 01:04:06,254
So…

718
01:04:06,254 --> 01:04:10,243
do you have no plan to join me?

719
01:04:10,243 --> 01:04:15,374
As we are both Hongs that belong to the same family?

720
01:04:15,374 --> 01:04:18,359
So if, perhaps, you're interested in following my plan,

721
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:20,903
please inform me anytime.

722
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:26,699
If you become my follower, I will look out for you.

723
01:04:31,262 --> 01:04:33,484
I will be on my way.

724
01:06:21,746 --> 01:06:24,280
My Lady!

725
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,814
My Lady!

726
01:06:26,814 --> 01:06:29,728
- Was the Crown Prince really pardoned?
- Yes.

727
01:06:29,728 --> 01:06:33,081
Then… Nevermind!

728
01:07:23,987 --> 01:07:26,742
Since the Crown Prince has been forgiven,

729
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:30,640
Sir Preceptor has most certainly been released as well.

730
01:07:48,276 --> 01:07:50,338
Deok Im!

731
01:07:51,906 --> 01:07:53,928
Your Highness—

732
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,627
I'm really sorry.

733
01:07:57,627 --> 01:07:59,958
They say we almost got you into trouble with His Majesty.

734
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:05,252
Sometimes I forget that my grandfather is the most powerful man in the nation.

735
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:08,989
To me, he's just my sweet grandfather.

736
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:13,110
I'm truly sorry. It was really scary, wasn't it?

737
01:08:16,647 --> 01:08:19,104
I'm a servant of the palace.

738
01:08:19,104 --> 01:08:23,051
It naturally falls to me to carry out your requests.

739
01:08:23,053 --> 01:08:28,098
Thank you for saying that, Deok Im!

740
01:08:28,098 --> 01:08:30,337
Still, Your Highness...

741
01:08:30,337 --> 01:08:32,849
His Majesty burned the book.

742
01:08:32,849 --> 01:08:34,627
Don't worry about the book!

743
01:08:34,628 --> 01:08:37,435
We can transcribe it again together.

744
01:08:37,435 --> 01:08:40,788
If so…

745
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:42,817
The money for copying it out…

746
01:08:42,817 --> 01:08:46,684
Right, and it's for two times…

747
01:08:48,405 --> 01:08:50,583
Will this be enough?

748
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,795
You do me honor, Your Highness.

749
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:00,952
You're becoming an official court maid soon, right?

750
01:09:00,952 --> 01:09:02,381
When is your coming-of-age ceremony?

751
01:09:02,381 --> 01:09:04,437
They haven't set a date yet,

752
01:09:04,437 --> 01:09:07,740
but the Queen's Palace will soon put out the notice.

753
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,705
It's my older brother!

754
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,122
Older Brother!

755
01:09:20,431 --> 01:09:23,087
Why, Cheong Yeon.

756
01:09:23,087 --> 01:09:25,041
Why are you in the palace so often?

757
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:29,129
Are you not happy to see your sister?

758
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,833
The palace is a place of intrigue and infighting.

759
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:37,371
Coming frequently will do you no good so try to stay away.

760
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:42,598
Oh, Brother. This girl will soon become an official court maid in your palace.

761
01:09:42,598 --> 01:09:45,310
Her name is Deok Im.

762
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:57,520
- Fa…
- I'm sorry, Your Highness, I didn't catch that.

763
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,876
- A fan.
- Oh, a fan, of course.

764
01:09:58,876 --> 01:10:00,059
Do you have a fan?

765
01:10:00,059 --> 01:10:02,415
His Highness must be hot.

766
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:07,317
Brother, are you hot?

767
01:10:13,107 --> 01:10:14,407
You can go now.

768
01:10:14,409 --> 01:10:17,230
You should greet Deok Im.

769
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:21,593
Deok Im went to Grandfather in my place

770
01:10:21,595 --> 01:10:26,238
and asked for your forgiveness.

771
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:30,600
I'm a bit busy right now so let's do it later.

I have a pile of work waiting. Anyway, don't get on my nerves from now on.

776
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,049
Liar!

777
01:11:34,049 --> 01:11:36,816
Why deceive me? That's so awful!

778
01:11:36,816 --> 01:11:40,268
How can a Crown Prince's palace maid not work in his palace? Does that make sense?

779
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:42,514
From now on you'll be serving the Crown Prince personally.

780
01:11:42,514 --> 01:11:45,340
I know I should restrict my thoughts like all other servants,

781
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:48,387
but still, why have all these wild thoughts?

782
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,955
You'll give me a full accounting of the Crown Prince's doings.

783
01:11:51,955 --> 01:11:56,202
Is that the apprentice palace maid who pleaded for his forgiveness?

784
01:11:56,202 --> 01:11:59,260
Nothing happened between you and me.

785
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:02,820
From now on I want you to stay away from me.
