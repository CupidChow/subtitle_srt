(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:35,065
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,775
(Episode 6)

4
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:48,745
Oh, dear.

5
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:51,184
- My goodness. - Gosh.

6
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,754
What happened to this fool?

7
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:03,894
Do you know him?

8
00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:07,635
He was lying on the mountain path, so I brought him here.

9
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,963
What? He should have reached Hanyang long ago.

10
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:12,334
What is he doing here?

11
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,735
He must have tumbled. He lost blood, and his pulse is weak.

12
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:17,805
Take him inside.

13
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:19,945
- Let us check his wounds first. - Yes, sir.

14
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:21,215
Lift him.

15
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:33,795
Why do you think he is back here?

16
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,825
I bet he got kicked out of the Medical Office.

17
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,023
He was sent to ruin us,

18
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:40,435
but he messed up.

19
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:42,134
They would have made him pay.

20
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,435
Do you think he holds a grudge against us?

21
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:50,034
My lady, the Medical Office fools...

22
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:53,374
become shy and cowardly once they leave those walls.

23
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,545
He will not harm us.

24
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:57,185
Even so, what was he doing here?

25
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,644
Oh, I do not know.

26
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,154
But once he wakes up,

27
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,083
I will make him cough up enough...

28
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:05,524
to cover for the food, treatment, and cleaning he made us do.

29
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:08,694
Why would you mention poop?

30
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,925
Just because I can.

31
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,965
No! We cannot let him stay!

32
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,744
We have many patients.

33
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,874
With one more physician, they can wait less.

34
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:32,515
Jang Gun, you have a great memory, but have you forgotten...

35
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:35,154
what a hard time he gave us?

36
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:40,084
Still, he is handsome for a man.

37
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,755
He will be good at his job.

38
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:45,665
You and I have such different taste in men.

39
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:47,235
There is no more room at the table.

40
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:50,934
Exactly. I think he will eat way too much...

41
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:52,635
and show off loads.

42
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:55,334
I cannot accept him.

43
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,974
What do you think, my lady?

44
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:01,515
What? Well, I do not see why we should...

45
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:03,843
He is a patient.

46
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:06,485
We can send him away once he recovers.

47
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,955
All of you, go to bed.

48
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:15,295
We must work tomorrow.

49
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,425
You have no money?

50
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:59,034
You worked at the Medical Office.

51
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:00,403
How can you be penniless?

52
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:03,334
Did you come here on purpose to leech off us?

53
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:08,874
I left in a hurry and was unable to bring anything.

54
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:16,355
His injury is too grave. He cannot go to another clinic.

55
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:19,083
I should not have let him stay.

56
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,294
He was a spiteful jerk...

57
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,493
and even if he were to end up dead,

58
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:24,864
I should have sent him to another quack.

59
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:28,394
You. For yesterday and today's treatment,

60
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:30,564
and for food and lodgings,

61
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,804
you owe me 100 nyang. Can you handle that?

62
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,605
My gosh. That is way too steep.

63
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:38,004
How is that steep?

64
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,775
This fool owes us extra for the emergency care!

65
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,985
Yes, fine. I will do whatever I can to pay you back.

66
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,814
Thank you.

67
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,884
What happened to the smart and arrogant inspector?

68
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:58,364
He has a healthy appetite as well.

69
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,835
My goodness...

70
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:07,235
Will someone come and greet me?

71
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:10,905
Shoo. Get out of my way.

72
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:14,345
You, go inside.

73
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:17,013
- Why? I have lots to do. - Just go inside already.

74
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:20,114
Why... What got into you?

75
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:27,954
What brings you here, Governor?

76
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:32,193
The village seems a little disturbed,

77
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:34,664
so I am patrolling in person.

78
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:35,735
Good for you.

79
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:41,933
As you can see, we have nothing but patients.

80
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:45,475
Exactly. You are a physician who should just treat patients,

81
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:48,374
so why do you bother me so much?

82
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:54,954
How long have you been a physician here?

83
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:57,324
Not too long.

84
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:59,024
About ten years?

85
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,655
What? Ten years?

86
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,655
Ip Bun was born over...

87
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:04,795
ten...

88
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:10,035
Let me see, so... It was...

89
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:12,165
It has been about ten years.

90
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,004
You look so familiar.

91
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:19,545
It is as if I have seen you before.

92
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:21,114
Do you...

93
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,545
know me?

94
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:33,285
How would I know you?

95
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:34,754
We never met.

96
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:38,263
He was here practically all his life.

97
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,493
You could not know him.

98
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:40,564
Yes, right.

99
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:43,394
- Is this it? - Yes.

100
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:47,134
Inspector, what are you doing here with a ladle?

101
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:55,144
Oh, dear. A man looks his best when in official attire.

102
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:58,014
Gosh, look at you. You look awful...

103
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,285
Hey, you!

104
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:04,924
Do you know how many doors broke down because of you?

105
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,323
Behave yourself, okay?

106
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:08,694
All of you! Behave yourselves. Do you understand?

107
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:11,624
I am off. Do not see me out. It makes me uncomfortable.

108
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:20,835
Get lost.

109
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:34,985
It is as if I have seen you before.

110
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:37,655
Do you know me?

111
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:42,954
That jerk.

112
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:49,295
No.

113
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:55,504
Goodness.

114
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,645
- Oh, dear. - My gosh.

115
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,013
I understand that ginseng is expensive,

116
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,774
but it is not right for you as you are suffering...

117
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,215
from heat stagnation now.

118
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,915
Ginseng will warm your body even more and cause dizziness.

119
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:10,525
I said I would pay you well. Must you be so stubborn?

120
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:12,605
Should I take my entire family...

121
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,724
to Iron Birch Clinic?

122
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:17,364
My gosh. This dunce... I mean,

123
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:19,294
this physician was simply saying that...

124
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:22,734
you need something to cool down your excessive internal heat first.

125
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,863
After that, we can use ginseng.

126
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:26,404
That is what he meant.

127
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,405
Here.

128
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:30,904
This is ginseng powder made with only the finest quality...

129
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:33,744
six-year-old ginseng harvested this year.

130
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:38,884
This physician is very good.

131
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:45,754
Thank you.

132
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:49,823
Well, we trust that you will continue to use our service.

133
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:51,594
- Get home safely! - Goodbye.

134
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:55,635
You went ahead and gave her that without even checking her pulse?

135
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,064
What are you doing?

136
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:01,074
No, that is not ginseng.

137
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,381
White atractylodes powder. It is good for the pancreas and stomach.

138
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:05,275
You know, like a placebo.

139
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,415
So you lied to the patient?

140
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,554
And did not prescribe what she actually needs?

141
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:13,184
Why bother clashing with her?

142
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:15,213
I would rather help one more patient...

143
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:17,054
than waste my time arguing with her.

144
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,724
Sorry to keep you waiting. This way, please.

145
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:32,564
Good point.

146
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,434
What? He has a point.

147
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:50,084
I do not understand why you came back.

148
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,554
I had nowhere to go...

149
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:55,954
once I left the Medical Office.

150
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:01,834
You make all of us here uncomfortable.

151
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:06,064
I simply...

152
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:09,104
did my job as an inspector.

153
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:12,905
However, I understand why you hate me.

154
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:15,515
Of course, I understand.

155
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:23,155
Please leave as soon as you recover.

156
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:26,004
They say all bad things happen at the same time.

157
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:28,454
I am surely experiencing a streak of misfortune.

158
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:31,924
I feel uncomfortable here too.

159
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,765
So do not worry.

160
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:36,694
I will leave soon.

161
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:54,554
Here.

162
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:05,764
I heard the Second State Councilor...

163
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,165
visited you again in person for you are his uncle.

164
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:09,535
I was wondering...

165
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:13,635
I was just wondering what you said to him about me.

166
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:15,275
The next time I see him,

167
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,344
I will talk to him.

168
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,574
But you see...

169
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,645
At this age,

170
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:28,984
I do not need expensive things like this.

171
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:31,224
Things like wealth and honor...

172
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:33,584
only entice you when you are young.

173
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:37,354
I will leave for Hanyang soon.

174
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:40,734
What if I die all alone and lonely?

175
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:44,265
That is my biggest concern at the moment.

176
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:50,974
Do you happen to have an illegitimate daughter?

177
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,704
Darn it! That greedy old man.

178
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:56,814
I mean...

179
00:11:57,415 --> 00:12:00,444
The government organizes banquets for those who are over 70.

180
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,655
Why did he say he was worried about dying lonely and alone?

181
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,453
Are you feigning ignorance?

182
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,125
Or do you really not know?

183
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,295
Is he an idiot?

184
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:11,964
Why? What is it?

185
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,795
He wants a concubine. That is what he meant.

186
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:16,694
A concubine?

187
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:18,304
My goodness!

188
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,675
Oh, hold on.

189
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:25,405
If someone in my family becomes his concubine,

190
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:27,804
the Second State Councilor and I will be in-laws.

191
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:31,514
Then I will have a bright future ahead of me.

192
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:33,984
That is, only if you have a young daughter.

193
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,354
You are incredibly sharp-witted.

194
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:41,525
That is true. I only have sons.

195
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:42,755
Gosh.

196
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,463
- What is this? - Goodness.

197
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,295
Look at that. You little...

198
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:53,963
It is all because you eat too much.

199
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:55,874
Why does it matter? Come this way.

200
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,875
- Gosh. - Come on!

201
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,745
Gosh, it stinks in here.

202
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:06,584
So this is where Jang Kyung Sook has been hiding.

203
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:11,625
She is dead.

204
00:13:11,684 --> 00:13:12,755
Who are you?

205
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,795
No wonder...

206
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:23,694
he looked so familiar.

207
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,204
That is good.

208
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:31,604
Physician Gye.

209
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,595
The district governor would like to see you at his office.

210
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,615
Why must he summon me when I am so busy?

211
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,213
I will go.

212
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:41,484
No, he wishes to speak to Physician Gye.

213
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:45,175
He specifically asked for me?

214
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:47,354
Why?

215
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:58,135
Stay home, and do not go anywhere. Do you understand?

216
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:01,474
Lead the way.

217
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:11,861
Both your complexion and pulse tell me that you are fine.

218
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,214
You are very healthy.

219
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:16,285
Why did you call me here?

220
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:21,054
I am trying to remember something that happened in the past.

221
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:26,295
What was it? The brain tonic? Will it help me remember it?

222
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,135
What is the matter?

223
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,834
Oh, I remember.

224
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,005
I know who you are.

225
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,344
You are good. You helped me refresh my brain without the brain tonic.

226
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:48,415
Jang Kyung Sook.

227
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:52,125
You know that filthy wench.

228
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,224
You are the physician who helped her hide when she ran away.

229
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:05,934
I do not understand what you are talking about.

230
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,405
You have forgotten Jang Kyung Sook?

231
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:12,875
Then...

232
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:15,574
you must remember the stillborn baby.

233
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:21,084
I am truly sorry, but I do not remember.

234
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,385
When you are a physician,

235
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:26,724
you see many stillborn babies and dying mothers.

236
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,895
You did not forget. You are only pretending.

237
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,334
It is all in the past.

238
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:39,934
Is that so?

239
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,573
But what if that stillborn baby...

240
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:47,104
is actually alive?

241
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:51,814
Then it is no longer the past...

242
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,484
for that child is my niece.

243
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,434
Not Ip Bun.

244
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:14,905
Her, I must protect. No matter what.

245
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:21,214
My gosh!

246
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:25,684
I told you not to go out!

247
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:30,884
Are you trying to make us go deaf? Why must you yell every day?

248
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:32,784
You are brimming with energy.

249
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:35,594
Perhaps, you should follow Court Lady Jung.

250
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,564
As of this moment, you are grounded!

251
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:43,365
Gosh, it hurts! Why do you keep telling me to stay home?

252
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:45,905
Must you keep talking back to me?

253
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,574
My goodness.

254
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,103
Physician Gye, what is the matter?

255
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:53,944
Let go! This is between me and my daughter. Stay out of it.

256
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:56,943
- Wait. Hold on. - Oh, dear.

257
00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:58,015
- Just... - Move!

258
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:05,824
Ip Bun, you are not to leave the clinic.

259
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:08,324
Cross this line,

260
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,094
and I will kick you out...

261
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:12,665
after shaving your head!

262
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:18,834
Go to your room!

263
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,675
Go on.

264
00:17:42,754 --> 00:17:43,754
No, you cannot!

265
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,395
You cannot. No!

266
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:49,335
No, you cannot!

267
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,454
Also...

268
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:13,979
Flowers of arrowroot, cortex fraxini,

269
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,210
channeled water plantain,

270
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,010
and...

271
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,879
Why are you here by yourself today?

272
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,050
Where are Jang Gun and the others?

273
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:24,560
Actually, this is for my father.

274
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,760
I wanted to brew a tonic to treat his hangover.

275
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,730
Do not mind the price and offer quality herbs.

276
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:32,000
You are the dearest!

277
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,928
All right. I will pack those for you in a jiffy.

278
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,929
- Sure, please do. - Of course.

279
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,980
She is Gye Ji Han's daughter, is she not?

280
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,710
- Ip Bun, it is you. - That is not her.

281
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:50,250
Ask Physician Gye to buy you one.

282
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,050
Come to think of it, that is her.

283
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,589
The fabric is nice and soft.

284
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,460
How much is it?

285
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,020
This much.

286
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,230
They look alike.

287
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:08,869
- She looks a lot like her. - No can do.

288
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,700
Ip Bun, you are all set.

289
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,200
- Thank you. - No problem.

290
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:18,139
Goodness.

291
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,339
- Have a good day. - Thank you.

292
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,559
Ip Bun, do not...

293
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,459
It baffles me how your father can be this stingy.

294
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,030
His one and only daughter should get to doll up.

295
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,439
Do not...

296
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,740
That reminds me.

297
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:50,839
Back at the office,

298
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,838
there is silk that was confiscated from a thief.

299
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,749
I hear it is from Qing and is of the best quality. Right?

300
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,810
Right.

301
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:01,849
Hold on. Would you like to have it?

302
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:03,189
No!

303
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,689
Pardon? Really?

304
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,829
Me? Are you sure?

305
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,230
Of course.

306
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:12,529
- Do not take it! - I have no use for it.

307
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,530
Ip Bun!

308
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:16,099
I do not have a daughter of my own.

309
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,070
Goodness.

310
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,780
I cannot get over the fact that you look so much like your mother.

311
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,109
What was her name again?

312
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,679
Do you know my mother? It is Jang Kyung Sook.

313
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,389
That is the name. Jang Kyung Sook.

314
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,060
You see,

315
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,490
we are closer than you think.

316
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,329
You and me?

317
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,639
I do not know if I should tell you this,

318
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,139
but would you like to hear a story?

319
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,689
Father, is the district governor speaking the truth?

320
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,260
Ahn Ip Bun and District Governor Ahn.

321
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:19,300
My birth father...

322
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:21,530
is District Governor Ahn's younger brother.

323
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,899
Is it true...

324
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:32,139
that you are the reason my mom is dead?

325
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,250
You...

326
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,050
How could you believe the words of a stranger?

327
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:47,060
Why did you not tell me?

328
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,790
Until when were you going to keep it from me?

329
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,000
If that is how much you trust his words,

330
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,000
then live with him at the governor's office!

331
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,000
You must be happy to be of noble blood.

332
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:00,939
Leave!

333
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:26,829
Those who cannot hold their liquor are banned.

334
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:29,200
Why did you even bother bringing drinks?

335
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,599
I figured you would be scared to be alone.

336
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:34,139
Scared? Me?

337
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,290
I have been sleeping by myself all my life,

338
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:38,339
so why would you even think that?

339
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:40,609
You have been having nightmares as of late.

340
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,790
Is this honey herbal punch?

341
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:53,760
It is not. You should be more trusting of people.

342
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,659
- Are you also going to drink? - Yes.

343
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,300
I would like to see why you enjoy it so much.

344
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,070
Unbelievable.

345
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,649
You actually emptied your glass.

346
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,050
Have you been pretending to be lightweight?

347
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:22,619
Alcohol is no big deal.

348
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:26,159
What? Goodness.

349
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,329
All right.

350
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:40,569
This is the plain water that Physician Yoo should drink.

351
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,608
Water.

352
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:43,239
This is the liquor for Physician Gye.

353
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
- Liquor, water. - Water.

354
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
- Liquor. - Liquor.

355
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,379
You cannot mix this up.

356
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,809
Of course. You never know...

357
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,379
what Young Master will do when drunk.

358
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,379
What would he do?

359
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,320
You have no idea. When he is drunk, he...

360
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,260
He becomes a different man.

361
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:08,598
My goodness. He has been playing us this whole time.

362
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,770
You cannot even tell he has had a drip of alcohol.

363
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,639
Let us have more. Here we go.

364
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:16,710
Wait.

365
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,209
I should be the one to serve my young master.

366
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,709
Allow me to do it for you.

367
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,950
No, please let me do it.

368
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,990
- Which was which? - I am just as clueless.

369
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,359
The one on the right. No, the left.

370
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,770
What has been haunting you in your dreams?

371
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,970
I am not one of your patients.

372
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,040
Maybe you can tell me about it and move on.

373
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,540
You helped me get my life back on track too.

374
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,750
Some pasts cannot be mended.

375
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,179
The past that is also one's present.

376
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,330
That is something you cannot forget and escape.

377
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:07,820
You must tough it out...

378
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,260
and keep on living.

379
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,750
I am suggesting that you be more honest.

380
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:36,950
Physician Gye,

381
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,159
you are a coward.

382
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,589
This is bad.

383
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:45,030
Brace yourselves, everyone.

384
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,099
His face is burning up like a furnace.

385
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,869
So much for being able to hold your liquor.

386
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,300
Man Bok.

387
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:56,240
Bring more liquor!

388
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:01,210
You should drink every night.

389
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,780
You become so cheerful!

390
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,780
- Do not say that. - Poong!

391
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:07,678
Dance with me.

392
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,750
Dance?

393
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,289
- Oh, dear. - No!

394
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,290
Goodness.

395
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:13,990
What the...

396
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:17,760
Oh, whatever.

397
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,369
Oh, dear.

398
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,669
What is happening?

399
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,250
The moon...

400
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:40,079
is so pretty.

401
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,820
The moon?

402
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
Where is it?

403
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,070
It is right before me.

404
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:16,089
The moon...

405
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,490
is so pretty.

406
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:27,098
Should we lay out their bedding?

407
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:29,369
He becomes so true to his feelings.

408
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:30,700
Like clear water.

409
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,439
Look after the dunce.

410
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:35,239
He told me to bare my heart,

411
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,638
and he went and got drunk.

412
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:37,839
No, Physician Gye!

413
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:40,739
You must sleep with me.

414
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,749
What got into you?

415
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,749
- Sleep with me. - Let go!

416
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,848
What on earth...

417
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:46,980
What is the matter with him?

418
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:48,848
Let him stay with you tonight.

419
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:50,618
- It is his wish. - Let go of me.

420
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:52,759
- My lady. - Sleep with me tonight.

421
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,188
- What are you doing, my lady? - My lady.

422
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:57,229
This fool is too... My lady!

423
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,159
My lady!

424
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:22,619
I cannot get over the fact that you look so much like your mother.

425
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,460
What were my mom and dad like?

426
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:12,500
Her mother is dead. She is dead!

427
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:21,379
What are you doing?

428
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,750
Did you have another nightmare?

429
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,720
No! You cannot take her.

430
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,230
Leave her.

431
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:39,300
That girl is my daughter.

432
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,929
She is yours? What about Jang Kyung Sook's?

433
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:45,000
She had a child too.

434
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
That child...

435
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,609
It was born dead.

436
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,879
I buried it already.

437
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,510
Did you?

438
00:29:58,179 --> 00:29:59,179
Let me.

439
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:06,359
I will kill you if you are lying.

440
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,030
Anyone born to my family belongs to us forever.

441
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:12,429
If you hide anything from me,

442
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
I will chase you until you die.

443
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:17,669
Come along.

444
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,810
You have come.

445
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,149
My gosh. Hello.

446
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,189
Do you know...

447
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,359
what this is?

448
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:19,828
That is Jang Kyung Sook's binyeo.

449
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:24,469
Yes, this is proof that you are Jang Kyung Sook's daughter.

450
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,570
Your father probably gave it to her. No, I am sure he did.

451
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:30,939
Is that true?

452
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,479
Yes, you are definitely my niece.

453
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,908
You are not Gye Ip Bun.

454
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,179
You are Ahn Ip Bun.

455
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,119
So it is a true fact that you are...

456
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:48,460
my uncle?

457
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,300
I will see to it that you live in luxury.

458
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:00,200
I need to discuss with my father before I...

459
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,168
Where are you going?

460
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:06,010
He is deceiving you!

461
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,079
Sorry.

462
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,020
Well, yes.

463
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,929
You must feel confused, and you will need to sort things out.

464
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,029
There is so much that I hoped to give you one day.

465
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,769
Oh, do you want to see...

466
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,938
the lovely silk from Qing?

467
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:36,740
Will someone show my niece around here, there, and everywhere?

468
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:54,419
Are you up?

469
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,230
I will tell you everything.

470
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,030
Come outside.

471
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:19,149
What...

472
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,188
Let me in! I must check something!

473
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:27,620
What is the commotion?

474
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:35,629
No, stay.

475
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,740
I know Ip Bun is here.

476
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:43,038
Did you lie and tell her I killed her mother?

477
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,140
You killed her!

478
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:47,779
Why are you calling me a liar...

479
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,550
this early in the morning?

480
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,979
Ip Bun is my daughter!

481
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:56,349
She came here voluntarily, and she is Jang Kyung Sook's daughter.

482
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,219
That makes her a member of my family.

483
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,120
Let Ip Bun come home with me!

484
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,990
Ip Bun said...

485
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:06,979
she does not want to return.

486
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:13,600
A girl of noble blood lived with you all her life.

487
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,269
Do you think that is the best for her?

488
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,239
She needs to find a husband,

489
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,979
and when she is married she will need dowry and a maid.

490
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,379
All that will cost money.

491
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,950
You cannot even buy her a silk outfit.

492
00:34:32,189 --> 00:34:34,990
Is being a physician that tough?

493
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,399
You are not related to her, so it is time you back off.

494
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:48,970
Oh, right.

495
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,038
If this is about being a man down,

496
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,609
I will send over one of my slaves.

497
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,780
Let my family look after the girl from now on.

498
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,490
It is too early for this. Drag him outside.

499
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,390
Let go.

500
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,289
My dear niece.

501
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,330
I should go home now. Let me go.

502
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:52,029
What are you talking about?

503
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,999
Why would you return to that rundown shack?

504
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,240
As your uncle, I cannot allow that.

505
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,878
My dear niece, Ahn Ip Bun.

506
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:05,249
Very soon, you will live in a huge mansion in Hanyang.

507
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,919
No, I must go home.

508
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:09,490
My father...

509
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,950
Father!

510
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,120
Ip Bun!

511
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,490
Oh, no! My gosh.

512
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,600
Goodness. Get up.

513
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,830
All right, let me see.

514
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,100
You are not hurt. Are you all right?

515
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,970
Yes, I am fine.

516
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,809
My adorable child!

517
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,608
Oh, my. How adorable.

518
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:11,109
My dear Ip Bun.

519
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:18,589
Happy birthday, Father.

520
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:25,629
- You made these? - Yes.

521
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,269
They look so pretty.

522
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:40,109
It tastes good too.

523
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,109
Do you want to try one too? Here.

524
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,850
Yes, eat up.

525
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:47,950
Good girl.

526
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,760
Here. Good girl.

527
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,030
What?

528
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,629
Ip Bun is that ugly district governor's niece?

529
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,140
My goodness. She sure got her looks from her mother.

530
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,370
So Ip Bun is from a noble family?

531
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,750
I should have been nicer to her.

532
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:47,580
Does it mean Ip Bun...

533
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:49,649
has moved to her new home?

534
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,450
Will she not come back?

535
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,689
This is too sudden. Do you not think it is strange?

536
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,760
Something feels very off.

537
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:02,830
They did not even let you see Ip Bun?

538
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:06,030
It is all my fault.

539
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,600
Had I known this would happen,

540
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,629
I would have told her the truth long ago.

541
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,240
So you will send her away to District Governor Ahn?

542
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:19,729
If she stays with me, she will suffer for the rest of her life.

543
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:22,550
All this time, I made her suffer.

544
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:27,620
But you have raised her so well.

545
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,720
District Governor Ahn is a jerk,

546
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,320
but maybe he will be nice to Ip Bun since she is his niece.

547
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,089
If he finds her a nice man to marry...

548
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,359
and helps her study the things that she wants to learn...

549
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:44,079
I never thought of her as my own child to begin with.

550
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:45,870
She has found her place.

551
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:49,339
She will be happier without me.

552
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,180
No. Perhaps,

553
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,519
she is resenting me now.

554
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,970
Physician Gye, we have a big problem.

555
00:40:10,229 --> 00:40:11,260
Ip Bun...

556
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,899
has to marry a man who is over 70 years old!

557
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,200
- What? - What?

558
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,039
What is this nonsense now?

559
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,709
Do you like her?

560
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,720
Yes, I am very satisfied.

561
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:35,379
Let us hurry up and set the date.

562
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:38,719
Sure thing. But before that, let us put things in writing first.

563
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,188
Oh, it is only for formality's sake.

564
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,189
It is not because I do not trust you.

565
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,820
This will only take a moment.

566
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:56,039
"District Governor Ahn Hak Soo..."

567
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:58,569
"will receive a core position on the junior sixth-rank..."

568
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,239
"for the work he did as my matchmaker."

569
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,410
That would do.

570
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:05,820
- All right. That sounds good. - Thank you.

571
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,359
She is not even a widow.

572
00:41:19,629 --> 00:41:21,629
You managed to find such a fine young girl for me.

573
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,129
It tells me how deeply you care for me.

574
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,850
Here. What do you think?

575
00:41:44,149 --> 00:41:47,120
Junior fifth-rank?

576
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,439
What?

577
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,850
She should be much obliged to me for including her in my family tree.

578
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,500
They say you must strike while the iron is hot.

579
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:18,019
I should hurry up and send this before anything happens.

580
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,489
Stop! Put me down, you scoundrels!

581
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,600
Hey!

582
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,370
Father!

583
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:35,240
Stop! Put me down!

584
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:53,919
Goodness.

585
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,189
Where is the wind coming from...

586
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,600
How dare you...

587
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,350
Gye Ji Han.

588
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:18,649
Let me walk away with my daughter now,

589
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:20,780
and you and I will both live.

590
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,220
If you hesitate or try anything funny,

591
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,019
this will not end here.

592
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,160
I have met the King in person, you see.

593
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,499
You ought to be punished...

594
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,930
for selling off my daughter.

595
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,169
You crazy rat!

596
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,640
How dare you try to threaten the district governor?

597
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:46,740
Where is Ip Bun?

598
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,209
I already married her off, in a palanquin.

599
00:43:56,289 --> 00:43:57,550
If...

600
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:01,289
something bad has happened to Ip Bun,

601
00:44:02,629 --> 00:44:04,089
I will be sure...

602
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,830
to cut your head off.

603
00:44:19,379 --> 00:44:21,109
Physician Gye, where is Ip Bun?

604
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:24,280
He sent her off in a palanquin. She could not have gone too far.

605
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,919
We must find her before she leaves Mount Sorak.

606
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,250
It is dangerous. Stay out of this.

607
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:35,660
No, I will come with you. You will need my help.

608
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:45,100
Lower the palanquin!

609
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,690
I told you to lower the palanquin!

610
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:48,800
- Gosh. - My goodness.

611
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:49,910
Hey!

612
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:52,950
We will take a break here.

613
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,749
That little brat is so loud.

614
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,180
Be quiet if you want a rice ball.

615
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:02,889
If you are done, we will get going again!

616
00:45:03,649 --> 00:45:05,720
What? I am not done yet.

617
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:07,559
Darn it.

618
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,629
What is that?

619
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,209
Hand over the palanquin,

620
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,420
and I will let you walk away in one piece.

621
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,350
Who are you?

622
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,979
I am her father.

623
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,490
I am getting teary-eyed.

624
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,089
Her father is here!

625
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:47,330
Do not waste your energy.

626
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:49,200
Just hand her over!

627
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,800
Step aside!

628
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:54,039
Get him!

629
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,419
Wait. Is he one of yours?

630
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,759
You came packing a lot of heat...

631
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,559
despite being a physician who cannot wield a weapon.

632
00:46:19,129 --> 00:46:20,129
I do not need it.

633
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:21,330
What the...

634
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,169
What makes you this confident?

635
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,140
Boys, let us end them quietly.

636
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,780
One.

637
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:36,850
Two.

638
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:39,950
Three.

639
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,370
What is wrong with them?

640
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,450
You will only get a rice ball if you are quiet.

641
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,470
The little birdie will peck at it.

642
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:07,539
Is she heavy?

643
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,479
That is for you to carry.

644
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,780
I guess.

645
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,780
A laxative.

646
00:47:15,781 --> 00:47:16,789
(Padu: A laxative)

647
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:17,850
That is what I used.

648
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:22,389
If that was your plan, you should have given them more.

649
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:23,889
That was close.

650
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,559
I gave them just the right amount.

651
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:27,859
It will clean their colons.

652
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,300
Let us go.

653
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,240
This one already crapped his pants.

654
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,780
Ip Bun.

655
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,950
Father? Father!

656
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,780
Father!

657
00:47:47,149 --> 00:47:48,149
Father...

658
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:54,120
It is all right. You are all right.

659
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:01,260
Arrest them all this instant!

660
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,410
Sheathe your swords.

661
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,580
Did I not make myself clear earlier?

662
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:20,820
My daughter must be unharmed...

663
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,550
for you to keep your head.

664
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:27,059
She is my niece, not your daughter.

665
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,689
That thing belongs to my family!

666
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,030
My daughter is not a commodity!

667
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,999
How dare you.

668
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:40,539
I am a district governor.

669
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:44,709
Get Ip Bun out of here.

670
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:47,209
- Father. - Now!

671
00:49:09,629 --> 00:49:10,629
Father!

672
00:49:24,741 --> 00:49:26,071
We found the contract.

673
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:32,341
That is enough!

674
00:49:36,051 --> 00:49:37,650
You were selling another man's daughter...

675
00:49:37,651 --> 00:49:39,158
in exchange for a higher rank and title.

676
00:49:39,182 --> 00:49:40,721
Let us see who is in the wrong.

677
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:44,291
Deciding on what is right and wrong is actually my job.

678
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:45,292
Have you forgotten...

679
00:49:45,293 --> 00:49:47,253
that I am the district governor of Sorak Village?

680
00:49:47,832 --> 00:49:51,301
Bribing a government position, kidnapping, and human trafficking.

681
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,571
The proof is all here.

682
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:58,372
This is enough...

683
00:49:58,741 --> 00:50:00,272
to strip you of your position.

684
00:50:12,651 --> 00:50:14,591
A life in Hanyang is what you dream of.

685
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:16,782
Maybe you can fight your case at the Palace.

686
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:22,461
You! If this case is brought to light,

687
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:24,061
you will be found guilty too.

688
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,231
She is Jang Kyung Sook's daughter, not yours.

689
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:29,300
This will only prove that she is my blood,

690
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:33,271
and you will be found guilty of kidnapping.

691
00:50:33,272 --> 00:50:34,412
Should we see who wins?

692
00:50:37,082 --> 00:50:38,582
Live with a clear conscience.

693
00:50:39,011 --> 00:50:40,252
If not,

694
00:50:40,682 --> 00:50:42,912
His Majesty will be reading that document.

695
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:46,381
From this moment on,

696
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:49,991
you are to stay away from my daughter.

697
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:52,022
You fool.

698
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:55,761
Let us go.

699
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:58,002
- Father. - I am all right.

700
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:03,202
You!

701
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:16,881
It was a long day, Ip Bun.

702
00:51:19,381 --> 00:51:21,352
You all...

703
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:23,622
Thank you so much.

704
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:24,861
Gosh.

705
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:28,562
Ip Bun, this is where you must be.

706
00:51:28,932 --> 00:51:32,661
That is right. You learned how nothing good comes out of...

707
00:51:32,662 --> 00:51:34,331
leaving your home.

708
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:35,332
That is right.

709
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:51,921
I was able to at least save Ip Bun.

710
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:54,321
For decades to come,

711
00:51:55,252 --> 00:51:58,562
I will keep protecting her, so don't worry.

712
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:03,062
You shouldn't worry about me either.

713
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:07,971
Father, what are you up to?

714
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:28,691
You must marry someone decent.

715
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:31,261
An old man like him does not deserve you.

716
00:52:33,392 --> 00:52:35,191
How about someone like you?

717
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,931
I was touched by how you preserved...

718
00:52:38,932 --> 00:52:40,202
my mom's wooden binyeo.

719
00:52:40,301 --> 00:52:42,470
Watching you wield that sword...

720
00:52:42,471 --> 00:52:43,511
made my heart skip a beat.

721
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:45,241
No way.

722
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:51,712
In the past, I was a pathetic loser.

723
00:52:52,741 --> 00:52:55,582
I hated how I could only afford a wooden binyeo...

724
00:52:56,352 --> 00:52:57,752
that I hoped...

725
00:52:59,182 --> 00:53:01,622
to make a name for myself for your mother's sake.

726
00:53:02,452 --> 00:53:03,491
When I returned home,

727
00:53:05,122 --> 00:53:06,991
I learned she had married another man.

728
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:09,361
Was the binyeo from you?

729
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:12,432
District Governor Ahn said otherwise.

730
00:53:13,772 --> 00:53:15,631
I see that he lied to you.

731
00:53:16,272 --> 00:53:17,272
That...

732
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:20,611
I carved it myself.

733
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:23,841
My gosh.

734
00:53:24,582 --> 00:53:28,111
Mom must have only kept it...

735
00:53:28,312 --> 00:53:29,982
because she cared about you a lot.

736
00:53:30,881 --> 00:53:31,921
What good did that do...

737
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:34,551
when I could not do anything for her?

738
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:37,991
I could not protect her.

739
00:53:46,202 --> 00:53:47,202
Father,

740
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:51,241
I am grateful.

741
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:54,391
Thank you for coming back for me.

742
00:53:55,812 --> 00:53:56,982
You protected me, at least.

743
00:54:02,651 --> 00:54:04,281
I chose you,

744
00:54:05,352 --> 00:54:06,482
and I am grateful.

745
00:54:37,852 --> 00:54:39,622
What brings you by at this late hour?

746
00:54:50,091 --> 00:54:51,102
I must ask, though.

747
00:54:51,562 --> 00:54:54,301
Why were you accompanied by Jeon Kang Il?

748
00:54:55,502 --> 00:54:59,301
Oh, he helped me out.

749
00:55:00,142 --> 00:55:01,241
It is possible...

750
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,241
I misunderstood him.

751
00:55:12,952 --> 00:55:15,091
What are you doing here, Inspector?

752
00:55:16,221 --> 00:55:18,221
You left alone at night, so I followed you.

753
00:55:19,122 --> 00:55:20,991
The clinic is so unsettled.

754
00:55:21,432 --> 00:55:22,631
What is going on?

755
00:55:23,261 --> 00:55:25,631
You know where the governor's office is, right?

756
00:55:31,301 --> 00:55:32,900
You are looking for a contract?

757
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:35,212
Yes. It is a single sheet of paper.

758
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:39,741
Are you not afraid?

759
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:43,011
Of what?

760
00:55:43,651 --> 00:55:46,682
Of making an enemy of the governor and going against the world.

761
00:55:47,221 --> 00:55:48,551
You are up to no good.

762
00:55:49,151 --> 00:55:51,122
I do not fear that at all.

763
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:53,531
What I do fear...

764
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:56,462
is losing myself.

765
00:56:13,551 --> 00:56:14,651
When a man...

766
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:19,022
has an official uniform,

767
00:56:25,261 --> 00:56:28,591
they tend to have a hidden pocket to keep secrets in.

768
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:55,691
The governor is no exception.

769
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:11,272
Wait, just a moment.

770
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:14,241
In the dark night, you were alone...

771
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:17,241
with him...

772
00:57:18,111 --> 00:57:20,142
when you found the contract.

773
00:57:25,082 --> 00:57:28,292
I guess you could say that?

774
00:57:32,522 --> 00:57:35,861
But earlier, you said you trusted me.

775
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:37,502
That you knew how I felt.

776
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:40,571
I trust you completely.

777
00:57:41,732 --> 00:57:42,901
But him.

778
00:57:43,471 --> 00:57:46,941
The man with the nasty smirk whose mind I cannot read.

779
00:57:47,341 --> 00:57:49,471
The man who is back when I cannot figure out why.

780
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:53,011
The ex-inspector who is always lurking around you.

781
00:57:55,252 --> 00:57:56,352
I do not like him.

782
00:57:57,551 --> 00:57:59,482
- What? - I do not like him.

783
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:02,952
I will ask Physician Gye to send him away tomorrow.

784
00:58:06,962 --> 00:58:10,702
I believe you said something like this the day before.

785
00:58:11,102 --> 00:58:12,761
"He is a patient."

786
00:58:13,002 --> 00:58:15,671
"We can send him away once he recovers."

787
00:58:15,732 --> 00:58:18,201
Exactly. He has recovered,

788
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:19,671
and his limbs are all fine.

789
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:22,272
We did our duty as physicians.

790
00:58:38,091 --> 00:58:39,162
Sobu.

791
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:44,662
How do you feel now?

792
00:58:45,232 --> 00:58:46,932
Calm and relaxed?

793
00:58:53,102 --> 00:58:54,111
No.

794
00:58:55,471 --> 00:58:56,941
I do not feel calm at all.

795
00:58:58,642 --> 00:58:59,682
Really?

796
00:59:01,111 --> 00:59:02,650
Then Naegwan...

797
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:03,721
No, my hand...

798
00:59:15,662 --> 00:59:17,202
You found Sobu just fine.

799
00:59:22,332 --> 00:59:23,502
But it did not...

800
00:59:24,571 --> 00:59:26,341
work for me at all.

801
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:28,941
Why not?

802
00:59:29,642 --> 00:59:31,042
I do not feel calmer at all.

803
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:38,482
Do you feel it?

804
00:59:39,682 --> 00:59:40,952
My heart races...

805
00:59:41,551 --> 00:59:42,952
as if I am sick.

806
00:59:44,522 --> 00:59:46,261
It feels like it will explode.

807
00:59:51,502 --> 00:59:54,071
Gosh. You are right.

808
00:59:55,171 --> 00:59:57,401
Your face looks flushed as well.

809
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:00,712
Shall I administer acupuncture?

810
01:00:01,171 --> 01:00:02,171
No.

811
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:11,881
I think this will help.

812
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:24,432
Physician Yoo Se Yeob was up to no good...

813
01:00:24,832 --> 01:00:28,571
and Sorak Village's governor himself wrote a petition.

814
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:32,391
He bragged about his ties to the royal family...

815
01:00:33,002 --> 01:00:35,142
and abducted a mourning widow...

816
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:40,011
offering to make her a physician?

817
01:00:41,381 --> 01:00:42,781
Write a petition.

818
01:00:43,452 --> 01:00:46,252
There is a weakness that will make even the King turn against him.

819
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:50,421
This scandal will touch on morals and law and order.

820
01:00:51,062 --> 01:00:52,162
Use that.

821
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:53,721
Then we can...

822
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:57,232
get rid of Yoo Se Yeob in one go?

823
01:00:59,162 --> 01:01:00,162
Yes.

824
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:03,401
And you will get noticed by His Majesty the King.

825
01:01:05,971 --> 01:01:08,441
That is a great idea.

826
01:01:09,142 --> 01:01:11,341
I must get to it right now.

827
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:17,852
(Petition)

828
01:01:24,962 --> 01:01:27,021
All at the Medical Office heard,

829
01:01:27,022 --> 01:01:29,361
and we are greatly disturbed.

830
01:01:29,761 --> 01:01:31,701
How could a man you befriended and trusted...

831
01:01:31,702 --> 01:01:34,332
do such a dreadful thing?

832
01:01:35,202 --> 01:01:36,401
This is impossible.

833
01:01:37,002 --> 01:01:38,471
Such a man...

834
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:41,441
should not be allowed to practice medicine.

835
01:01:43,212 --> 01:01:44,440
Please command Yoo Se Yeob...

836
01:01:44,441 --> 01:01:47,952
be stripped of his office and all his records be annulled.

837
01:01:48,212 --> 01:01:51,221
- Command they be annulled. - Command they be annulled.

838
01:01:53,122 --> 01:01:55,952
- Command they be annulled. - Command they be annulled.

839
01:01:56,491 --> 01:01:59,462
- Command they be annulled. - Command they be annulled.

840
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:37,161
Keep a close eye on both the man and the woman...

841
01:02:37,162 --> 01:02:39,631
and write down everything they get up to.

842
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:41,170
The royal court...

843
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:43,771
is flooded with petitions that Yoo Se Yeob's title...

844
01:02:43,772 --> 01:02:45,341
and records be annulled.

845
01:02:45,702 --> 01:02:47,541
All we worked for...

846
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:49,211
will be in vain.

847
01:02:49,212 --> 01:02:50,412
Me and Lady Eun Woo.

848
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:52,711
We did nothing to be ashamed of,

849
01:02:52,712 --> 01:02:54,682
so do not speak so flippantly.

850
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:57,752
This time, because of me, your records could be annulled,

851
01:02:58,122 --> 01:03:00,522
and you could lose everything.

852
01:03:00,921 --> 01:03:02,522
Even if I were to lose everything,

853
01:03:03,221 --> 01:03:05,022
I cannot lose you.
