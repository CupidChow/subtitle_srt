(Episode 8)

4
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:05,915
What are you doing here, Physician Jeon?

5
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:07,955
What about yourself?

6
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,724
Oh, I am...

7
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,025
visiting my parents after a long while.

8
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:15,625
I see.

9
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:17,625
The long trip will not be too lonely, then.

10
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:19,964
I am going to Heuksan Island too.

11
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:22,365
You are going to Heuksan Island?

12
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,464
What for?

13
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:27,805
Someone I owe a favor to is ailing.

14
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:33,305
You are traveling that far to see a patient?

15
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,514
Because I am a physician.

16
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:44,425
We are setting sail. Board quickly.

17
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:47,854
We should board.

18
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:04,104
Young Master, this is yakgwa, Lady Eun Woo's favorite.

19
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,574
You can share it in secret.

20
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:08,074
Breakfast will be ready soon.

21
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:16,385
Young Master.

22
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:19,454
Goodness.

23
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:23,124
Look at that gloomy gaze.

24
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:25,425
Is something wrong?

25
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:28,094
I have a bad feeling about this.

26
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:46,485
Will the problem just go away if you leave as well?

27
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,814
Let us sort out...

28
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:50,355
You knew?

29
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:56,855
What other option did she have?

30
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:00,564
The petitions that are pending...

31
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:02,395
might take years to get through.

32
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:04,305
I will bring Lady Eun Woo back,

33
00:03:04,404 --> 00:03:06,265
then explain myself in time.

34
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:09,205
Do you not see why she left?

35
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:10,305
I do.

36
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:13,605
She left because of me and because of what could happen.

37
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,814
If the Medical Office punks attack you,

38
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,444
they will cause trouble for her as well.

39
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,154
To a woman,

40
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:24,085
even a small scandal leaves a huge wound.

41
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:26,585
For now, it is best to let her be.

42
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:30,495
- Come on. - No.

43
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:33,064
There is a time to let go and a time to fight back.

44
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:35,064
Now is the time to fight back.

45
00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:38,365
Will you at least wait until your head...

46
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,064
that was bust open heals?

47
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:42,874
I need to ask you for a favor.

48
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:44,545
What?

49
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:28,515
I will protect him in court.

50
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:31,284
I need you to protect him where he is.

51
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:34,555
It is pretty obvious...

52
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:37,394
it got to the point where not even the King can help.

53
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:41,634
I heard you and Se Yeob used to work in the Medical Office together.

54
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:45,764
There are enemies everywhere.

55
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:48,004
Where must I begin?

56
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,274
I must go to Hanyang and do something.

57
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,144
My gosh...

58
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,944
- Did you just wake up? - Move it.

59
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:00,314
- Your head? - It is his head.

60
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:03,555
Gye Ji Han is trying to slack off again!

61
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:06,824
What? Father! No! How could you?

62
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:10,194
What is this? Why do we have so many patients today?

63
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,624
Is Iron Birch Clinic closed?

64
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,235
I have no idea.

65
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,365
It might be the stomach bug.

66
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,004
We have a mix of symptoms.

67
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,134
Is something going on?

68
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:23,504
Lady Eun Woo and the inspector are out,

69
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:26,274
and I am sure I saw Physician Yoo earlier,

70
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:27,675
so where did he go?

71
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:29,444
Forget about them.

72
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:32,944
Jang Gun, brew some hyangsosan.

73
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:33,985
Yes, Physician Gye.

74
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:37,624
Darn it.

75
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,735
Gosh. It is lovely here.

76
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:50,394
Yes, it is beautiful.

77
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:52,305
Goodbye, then.

78
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:54,475
Wait.

79
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,345
May I stop by and see you later?

80
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,514
I do not know this place well.

81
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:42,355
Mother!

82
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:44,254
Dan.

83
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:46,425
Lady Eun Woo!

84
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:47,425
Eun Woo!

85
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,824
Gosh, Eun Woo! Welcome back.

86
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:53,194
Why did you come here unannounced?

87
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:55,764
I came to see you. I missed you, Mother.

88
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:58,165
What about Sorak Village?

89
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:00,465
You said they were in need of a female physician.

90
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:02,704
Well...

91
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:06,605
I do not think I need to return to Sorak Village.

92
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,175
Father wrote in his letter...

93
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:11,144
that a physician here passed away.

94
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:14,514
Right. We have been making do without a physician.

95
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:16,884
I am glad you are back. Perfect timing.

96
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,624
You look so skinny.

97
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:24,024
We should catch a chicken for you.

98
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:27,064
Yes, we should. Right! I am boiling some water anyway.

99
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:29,595
You are lucky, my lady.

100
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:32,204
Go inside and unpack.

101
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:33,704
- Get some rest. - Okay.

102
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,504
Let us go inside.

103
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:06,965
Physician Yoo!

104
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:31,764
I am doing this for Physician Yoo's sake.

105
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:15,335
Eun Woo! Come out at once.

106
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,274
If we suddenly show up,

107
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:23,845
Physician Seo's mother will be very surprised.

108
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:28,014
That is a nice excuse. I thought you were a thief.

109
00:09:28,955 --> 00:09:32,455
A man of virtue would never slyly hover around someone's house.

110
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:35,254
What? "Sly?" Do you even know what that word means?

111
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:37,195
Should I show you what it means to be sly?

112
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:45,304
I have seen enough of your sly antics.

113
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:47,804
How dare you follow Lady Eun Woo to Heuksan Island in secret?

114
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:51,105
How dare you! I am here to treat patients.

115
00:09:51,705 --> 00:09:53,874
I suggest you stop being so clingy.

116
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,774
She left to get away from you. How could you follow her here?

117
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,345
I am ill!

118
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:01,355
How could you do this when you are a physician?

119
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:03,254
You are hurting a patient!

120
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:06,884
Physician Yoo? Physician Jeon?

121
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:15,794
What are you two doing here right now?

122
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:20,904
No, more importantly...

123
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:24,445
Physician Yoo, you cannot be here now.

124
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,710
I am Jeon Kang Il.

125
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,281
I am a physician from the Medical Office.

126
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,121
I am here to visit Interpreter Jung,

127
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:59,190
who I met while studying in Qing.

128
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,060
I see. I heard his wife was very ill.

129
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:04,261
They moved here so she could recuperate.

130
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
That is correct.

131
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,891
They said they needed me and asked me to visit them,

132
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:08,901
so I am here.

133
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,330
I, too,

134
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,031
worked in the Medical Office as the Head Acupuncturist.

135
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:16,570
Of course, I know who you are, Physician Yoo.

136
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Yes.

137
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,440
My gosh. You must be famished after your long journey here.

138
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,881
Dan, we should catch the brood hen.

139
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,980
Yes, my lady.

140
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,710
What?

141
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,421
It has been a long time since I last had a feast like this.

142
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,431
Mother, you are the best.

143
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
"Mother?"

144
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,100
How dare you call her "Mother?"

145
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,070
It is written in "Dongui Bogam" that one should boil...

146
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,411
scallion roots with chicken and eat it when one's face turns yellow...

147
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,810
due to weakened pancreas and stomach.

148
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:55,681
Pardon me?

149
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,281
You are the weakest one here at the moment.

150
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:03,921
Please eat.

151
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,891
Where did...

152
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,060
Father go?

153
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,431
He had to travel inland to take care of something.

154
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,801
Oh, no. I was hoping I could have a drink with Father.

155
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:19,871
Too bad.

156
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,940
I know. You should have come sooner.

157
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,671
Physician Jeon, the interpreter who reached out to you...

158
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:27,371
kept bothering us to find him a physician.

159
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,080
He has been on your father's case about it.

160
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Here.

161
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,090
I will take that, Mother.

162
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,970
Oh, my.

163
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,070
- Mother. - Yes?

164
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,911
I took all the bones out.

165
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,580
Why are you giving me this?

166
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,310
You should eat this.

167
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,381
You worked very hard to cook for us.

168
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:10,751
You should eat the best part.

169
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,590
I have received so much help from Physician Seo.

170
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,360
I wish to repay her while I am staying here.

171
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:16,791
I see.

172
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,131
Do you like abalone?

173
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,161
Of course, I do. I wish I could eat it more often.

174
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:22,761
Thank you.

175
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,001
- You too, Eun Woo. - Thank you.

176
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,001
I like abalone too.

177
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,850
Lady Eun Woo.

178
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:48,521
Physician Yoo.

179
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:52,431
What are you doing here?

180
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,230
What were you thinking, coming all the way here?

181
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,330
What is the matter?

182
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,041
I came here to be treated. Take a look.

183
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,041
Jeon Kang Il, that jerk, hit me earlier.

184
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,911
I think the wound has opened up.

185
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,450
Let me see.

186
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,190
Your patient has not fully recovered yet.

187
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:22,791
How could you desert him and run away?

188
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,521
A physician should not do that.

189
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,531
You could have asked Physician Gye to treat you.

190
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,301
I cannot believe you took a boat and came all the way here.

191
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:39,340
This will worsen your condition, if anything.

192
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,141
You see, I am very sensitive.

193
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:44,310
I am picky with my physicians.

194
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:48,450
I wanted you to treat me because no one else knows more...

195
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,080
about my wound than you do. What is wrong with that?

196
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,460
Physician Yoo.

197
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,131
We cannot...

198
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,371
be together.

199
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,251
Goodness.

200
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,210
Physician Gye, it was a long day for you.

201
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:23,950
Look at how you have been drained of energy.

202
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,320
His cheeks are hollow as well.

203
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,990
A total of 222 patient logs...

204
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:32,891
and 85 prescriptions.

205
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,301
We have never had this many patients before.

206
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,730
Goodness.

207
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,031
We did not have this many patients...

208
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:39,371
even when all the physicians were here.

209
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,541
It really was a long day for you today.

210
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,641
No can do.

211
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,340
Starting tomorrow,

212
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:53,810
we will be closed.

213
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:55,080
- What? - What?

214
00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:58,450
Hold on. Was it that hard for you today?

215
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,190
Enough to want to close the clinic for a day?

216
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,761
If we want the dunce back as a physician,

217
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,360
we must take action.

218
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,761
So starting tomorrow,

219
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:09,401
we will collect petitions from families...

220
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,801
that were hurt by District Governor Ahn's ban.

221
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:14,200
We will write our own petition for the government office.

222
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,801
District Governor Ahn would never allow it.

223
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:17,871
Not when it involves him.

224
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,610
I will have it go over his head,

225
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,011
so do not worry.

226
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:27,050
I see. You had an idea in mind.

227
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Lady Eun Woo!

228
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:40,891
Lady Eun Woo.

229
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:44,831
Lady Eun Woo.

230
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,341
Lady Eun Woo, allow me to come with.

231
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,571
I would rather you stay back.

232
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:55,381
But you are going on a house call.

233
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,651
- If I accompany you... - You came here to be treated.

234
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,950
Get some rest and head back to Sorak Village tomorrow.

235
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,921
You have your title to defend.

236
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:06,591
This is an important time for you.

237
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:15,161
I cannot leave until my injury heals.

238
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,270
You get hurt...

239
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,530
when you are with me.

240
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,980
If I am not with you,

241
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,510
the heart will suffer.

242
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:35,581
Both mine and yours.

243
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,220
I do not want to see someone I care for in pain.

244
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,760
I will find a way...

245
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,361
to handle the issue regarding my title.

246
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,030
There is no problem with you coming here to rest.

247
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:52,631
But if you only came here to avoid me,

248
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:56,641
then we should go back together.

249
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:05,911
Physicians!

250
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:10,250
My goodness. You must come with me.

251
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,621
Hurry!

252
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,050
I only stepped away briefly...

253
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,851
Luckily, I came back soon enough.

254
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:47,151
You did good. Thankfully, she will pull through.

255
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:50,790
Exactly. She will get better once treated.

256
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,990
Right.

257
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,010
May I speak to you outside?

258
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,250
Sure.

259
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:19,490
She hung herself. For what reason?

260
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,960
Lady Seol Ah will soon be forced...

261
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,190
as a concubine to Interpreter Jung.

262
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:25,990
But he came by...

263
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,431
yelling at her about a ring.

264
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,300
Goodness.

265
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:32,700
Is he not from the family with the sick wife?

266
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,131
The one that invited Physician Jeon to this island.

267
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:35,970
That is right.

268
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,440
Why did he want to take the ring from her?

269
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,710
From what I heard, it was what he had given her.

270
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:44,440
You know how noblemen are.

271
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:46,411
He must have given her his wife's ring...

272
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,581
and received an earful for it.

273
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:52,851
Madam.

274
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:10,800
Is she inside?

275
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:14,341
Yes.

276
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:21,821
My lady, you are awake.

277
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:44,470
I know this was deliberate.

278
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,071
Do better if it is attention you seek.

279
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,510
Why do you live this way?

280
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,780
You are denying who you are.

281
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:55,681
Watch your words.

282
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,651
Do not speak all that you think.

283
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,790
What is the matter?

284
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,321
Are you afraid I might steal your position as the wife?

285
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:05,631
You cannot be out and about yet.

286
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,230
- Escort her inside. - Sure.

287
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,061
Please go back inside.

288
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,081
That girl. Will she die?

289
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,220
Is that what you want?

290
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,550
Because she is to be your husband's concubine?

291
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,421
She will not die. She will be fine.

292
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,431
Dying would have been a better option.

293
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:12,290
We are closed for the day.

294
00:22:14,631 --> 00:22:16,831
Urgent patients should seek Iron Birch Clinic.

(Iron Birch Clinic)

296
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,871
Do you know why I particularly chose you...

to come with me to Hanyang?

298

I do not know. What are you hoping to do there?

299
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,240
You are scaring me a little.

300
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,421
A background check.

301
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:40,651
- A background check? - That is right.

302
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,520
I was hoping to run background checks...

303

on all those who are harassing your master.

304

But not in a foolish way like District Governor Ahn.

305
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:49,200
My goal is to be thorough and meticulous.

306
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,300
Hold on a second.

307
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,831
Will this background check...

308
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,171
help save my master's title and records?

309
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,841
That is why the others will collect petitions here...

while we find out more about these goons.

What do you say?

312
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:04,841
Are you completely out of the business?

Or do you still have some power on the streets?

What are you talking about?

315

One's dark past may see the light...

as long as it will bring us a brighter future.

Trying to keep your past hidden...

318

is not always the best option.

319

320

I bet Granny told you.

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,650
My writing is clearly better.

333
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:14,190
No kidding.

334
00:24:16,231 --> 00:24:17,831
Tell me. What happened?

335
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:21,301
Recently, I was finally able to get a job at the market.

336
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,531
I had to quit because I could not get home before the curfew.

337
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,301
I am clueless as to how I can put food on the table.

338
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,041
I feel like I deserve more.

339
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:43,051
I heard so much about you, but it took us a while to meet.

340
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,360
Where is the female physician? That is who I asked you to bring.

341
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,821
I came with one.

342
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,091
She was escorted to your wife's chamber.

343
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,531
She had better be skilled.

344
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,731
She is very skilled.

345
00:24:57,301 --> 00:25:00,071
I have a favor to ask.

346
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,440
Go and look after Seol Ah.

347
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:07,241
"Seol Ah?"

348
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,751
Why do you live this way?

349
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,150
You are denying who you are.

350
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:15,281
I am here anyway, so let me check your health.

351
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:19,190
Female physicians are a rarity on islands such as this.

352
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,291
I do not need to see a physician.

353
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,640
(We are closed for the day.)

354
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:41,940
My gosh. Will you look at this?

355
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,620
Are they that carefree? What clinic closes when they want?

356
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:50,051
Chil Sung, how about you go in and get that?

357
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,420
That is called stealing.

358
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
Stealing?

359
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,491
They could be plotting a serious crime...

360
00:25:58,491 --> 00:25:59,660
so I need to see...

361
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,130
Stop talking back at me and just go and get it!

362
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,541
Darn it. When will he ever change his ways?

363
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,140
Here.

364
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,410
(Please do not harass Physician Yoo.)

365
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,850
You cannot tear that! We should put it back!

366
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,620
They are writing complaints for the common folk?

367
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,091
How dare the arrogant halfwits try to ruin my future?

368
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:33,061
I think they are all trying to help Physician Yoo.

369
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:36,071
You knew all about it, then.

370
00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:38,700
Where did Gye Ji Han go?

371
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,200
I heard he went to Hanyang.

372
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,440
I wonder if he will see the King.

373
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,610
Really?

374
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,281
What about the inspector physician?

375
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,081
I heard he went to Heuksan Island to see a patient.

376
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,390
I hate you extra today.

377
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,501
The interpreter's wife and the gisaeng.

378
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,971
Could they already know each other?

379
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:11,971
Why do you think so?

380
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,071
The interpreter's wife refused to let me check her pulse...

381
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:19,341
and told me to look after Seol Ah.

382
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:22,551
She spoke as if she knew her.

383
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,450
Do you think she got acquainted...

384
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,450
while looking into the future concubine's past?

385
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,690
How would you know about things like that?

386
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:36,291
I know because a familiar name popped up. Jeon...

387
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Never mind.

388
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:50,571
Hey, is that not her? District Governor Seo's daughter.

389
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:54,410
Oh, the widow who frolicked with a physician?

390
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:57,081
I thought she had gone back to be with her in-laws.

391
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,721
How can a noble woman know no shame?

392
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,420
She is in public with a young man.

393
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,660
Let us just keep going. There is a quieter path.

394
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:20,241
Last year,

395
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:23,271
when I first came here with my father,

396
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:25,781
I saw fireworks here.

397
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,350
The locals believe if you write a wish and burn it on a string,

398
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,051
the wish comes true.

399
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,920
What wish will you write?

400
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:45,801
Right now, I do not have one yet.

401
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:49,301
The first one I had written came true.

402
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:51,501
What was it?

403
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,610
I wished...

404
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:59,380
to see you again.

405
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,120
Seeing you at Sorak Village was good enough for me.

406
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:12,261
- So... - I understand.

407
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,331
Once the patient is cured,

408
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,660
I will return to Sorak Village.

409
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:36,180
This is about the ban.

410
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:37,751
This is Physician Yoo's praise.

411
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:42,751
So many people say Physician Yoo helped them.

412
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,591
Yes. My Poong would stay upright even if we had no laws.

413
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:50,430
He has a lot of supporters.

414
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,660
There is one person...

415
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,831
he would really want to have on his side.

416
00:29:55,831 --> 00:29:57,930
That is why he went after her.

417
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,041
He went all the way to the island,

418
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:05,910
so he had better deal the final blow.

419
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:14,021
You know what islands are like.

420
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,791
If you are on an island...

421
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:17,821
and nothing happens to a couple,

422
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:19,120
then they are stupid.

423
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:22,531
Everything is set up, and all they must do is flip a card.

424
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,630
I was counting these, and I forgot where I was at.

425
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,600
For yin and yang to become one is harder than you think.

426
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,140
Why would you talk about yin and yang?

427
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,170
You should know about it too!

428
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,180
Since you are using such scandalous rumors to get him,

429
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,950
why not generate something even more scandalous?

430
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:48,321
Scandalous rumors.

431
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:52,390
The best kind of all are sexual.

432
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,390
That darn inspector is so irresponsible!

433
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,831
He brought it up only to go to Heuksan Island.

434
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:05,531
Does he think I cannot do it without him?

435
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:18,850
You will change your mind once you open it.

436
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,731
What is this doing in here?

437
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:40,170
Is it not identical to the ring you love so much?

438
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,710
I took it back from the gisaeng.

439
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:45,541
How dare a concubine...

440
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,511
have the same ring as the wife?

441
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:52,850
Do not make her your concubine, then.

442
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,521
But I must.

443
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,791
Taking in a poor wench like her...

444
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,061
is a duty of sorts to us nobles who live in comfort.

445
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,301
What is it?

446
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,271
Does the idea that...

447
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:14,700
I might bed Seol Ah make you so very jealous?

448
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,100
Darn it.

449
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:50,140
Send in just the female physician.

450
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:53,281
My wife is raving mad,

451
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,850
so do your best to calm her.

452
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,380
Whether she is crazy or not is for the physician to decide.

453
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:01,251
I will check her pulse first.

454
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:13,360
I will check on the sick gisaeng.

455
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,331
Okay. See you later.

456
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:25,511
Please leave.

457
00:33:26,141 --> 00:33:27,980
I do not wish you to see me like this.

458
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,801
Why did he take the ring from her?

459
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:50,270
You know how noblemen are.

460
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,770
Is this not the concubine's ring?

461
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:57,841
Was it a set with yours?

462
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:02,551
What is that to you?

463
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:06,020
Are you...

464
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:08,420
Please leave. I do not need treatment.

465
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,630
That woman.

466
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:29,101
Is she very sick?

467
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,141
Enough to die?

468
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Why do you both...

469
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,821
wish each other dead?

470
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:45,020
You should just tell Interpreter Jung...

471
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:46,821
that you do not want to marry him.

472
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:49,860
Do you think I have a choice?

473
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,130
If I could leave and move far away...

474
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,371
That would be nice.

475
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:03,341
Your pulse tells me that there is nothing wrong with you.

476
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,310
So I do not understand why you are so ill. It is strange.

477
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:30,315
You saw the jade ring the interpreter's wife had, right?

478
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:33,914
Yes. He took that from the gisaeng and gave it to her, did he not?

479
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,755
But that ring on his wife's finger...

480
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:38,855
There is not only one. It is a pair.

481
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,994
The design was pretty unique.

482
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:44,664
How come they both had the same ring?

483
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:49,905
What if they knew each other?

484
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:52,264
She even mentioned Seol Ah's name the other day.

485
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:02,445
Physician Seo used to wear these?

486
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:04,414
How adorable.

487
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:07,554
Right? She was even more adorable when she was little.

488
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:10,625
She is so beautiful because she takes after you.

489
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:14,755
She does take after me indeed.

490
00:36:16,664 --> 00:36:18,094
What took you so long?

491
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:20,164
We have been waiting for you.

492
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:28,905
The fireworks will take place soon.

493
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:32,204
Write down your wish here and hang it.

494
00:36:32,545 --> 00:36:33,715
Then your wish will come true.

495
00:36:33,914 --> 00:36:35,315
This is fun.

496
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:37,784
What will you write, Mother?

497
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:42,355
It is a secret.

498
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:52,164
Why not study more in depth and master your medical skills?

499
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:57,835
If you would like,

500
00:36:57,835 --> 00:36:59,875
I can help you study more in Qing.

501
00:37:00,905 --> 00:37:02,375
Qing, all of a sudden?

502
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:04,645
What are you saying?

503
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:08,114
Do not be so surprised.

504
00:37:08,945 --> 00:37:10,914
I am simply telling her that I can help her go to Qing.

505
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:15,014
Only if it is something she wishes to do, of course.

506
00:37:17,054 --> 00:37:18,155
Physician Jeon.

507
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:22,025
You seem to deeply care for Eun Woo.

508
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:48,985
If you would like,

509
00:37:49,114 --> 00:37:51,384
I can help you study more in Qing.

510
00:37:54,494 --> 00:37:56,264
Perhaps, studying in Qing...

511
00:37:58,895 --> 00:38:01,434
will be a good thing for Lady Eun Woo.

512
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:05,364
I have been too selfish.

513
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:15,474
Lady Eun Woo, the two of us...

514
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:19,045
No, I...

515
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:23,954
What should I do?

516
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,704
What? Is that so? Tell me more.

517
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,675
The thing is,

518
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:50,614
I was running an errand.

519
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:53,414
I heard some people murmuring, so I looked up and...

520
00:38:53,485 --> 00:38:55,284
- Thank you, Physician Gye. - Thank you.

521
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:59,585
Wait. Did you find out anything?

522
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:02,554
Yes, you bet. A big one!

523
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:05,395
Those who have something to hide...

524
00:39:05,395 --> 00:39:07,735
always use it to attack others.

525
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:10,304
He has secret concubines.

526
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:16,545
Oh, dear.

527
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,605
Oh, my. Then that is what we should look into.

528
00:39:19,645 --> 00:39:22,344
We should choose one area and focus, you know?

529
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:24,884
Who do you need to look into this time?

530
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,914
You have finished doing a background check on this one.

531
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:28,684
Oh, there is someone else.

532
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:30,855
The most important one.

533
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:32,925
When you are done,

534
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:35,724
come to the courtesan house in the corner over there.

535
00:39:35,724 --> 00:39:37,164
Everyone will be there.

536
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:40,065
Take your boys and find out...

537
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:43,764
everything you can about those Medical Office jerks.

538
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:45,434
- Okay, see you. - See you.

539
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:06,054
I managed to steal this.

540
00:40:12,664 --> 00:40:14,634
Darn it. It's in Chinese characters.

541
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:19,905
(Senior third-rank...)

542
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,634
- Are you not falling behind? - No. Do not worry.

543
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:26,675
Next. The junior fourth-rank in the Medical Office.

544
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,844
Senior Officer Noh Yoon Duk.

545
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:32,344
Noh Yoon Duk? Noh...

546
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:35,755
You see, this scoundrel has done many bad things.

547
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:38,384
Had we never run background checks on these people,

548
00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:41,094
we would have never known there were so many thieves in this country.

549
00:40:41,324 --> 00:40:43,494
Both my young master and I would have remained...

550
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:46,465
naive fools for the rest of our lives.

551
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:48,934
Hey, thugs come and bow to you,

552
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:51,065
calling you "Boss."

553
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:53,405
"Naive?" As if.

554
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,175
I would never do what those thieves have done.

555
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:06,215
Qing, all of a sudden? What are you saying?

556
00:41:26,675 --> 00:41:27,704
Physician Yoo.

557
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:33,175
Physician Yoo?

558
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:37,014
Physician Yoo.

559
00:41:42,485 --> 00:41:43,525
Physician Yoo?

560
00:41:50,164 --> 00:41:51,195
Physician Yoo.

561
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:19,855
Lady Eun Woo...

562
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:24,425
I am okay.

563
00:42:26,494 --> 00:42:27,594
Physician Yoo.

564
00:42:32,735 --> 00:42:34,605
How come your fever will not break?

565
00:42:43,315 --> 00:42:44,815
I am truly concerned.

566
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:49,255
You cannot seem to recover.

567
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:53,324
What should I do?

568
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:09,235
Lady Eun Woo.

569
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:12,344
Physician Yoo.

570
00:43:17,844 --> 00:43:18,914
Are you all right?

571
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:21,384
I felt ill all night.

572
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:24,525
This is embarrassing for I am a physician myself.

573
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:27,494
How are you feeling?

574
00:43:28,454 --> 00:43:29,855
Let me get you some porridge...

575
00:43:32,295 --> 00:43:33,664
Do not go.

576
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,204
While feeling sick all night,

577
00:43:40,605 --> 00:43:42,704
I kept seeing you in my dreams.

578
00:43:45,574 --> 00:43:46,844
You see,

579
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:50,545
we have done so many things together.

580
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:53,815
In my dream,

581
00:43:54,614 --> 00:43:55,985
you were a vivid image...

582
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:57,355
like a scene from a romantic story...

583
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:00,855
which was nice.

584
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:05,425
It was sweet enough...

585
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:09,634
to want me to stay in my dream.

586
00:44:15,335 --> 00:44:16,335
Physician Yoo.

587
00:44:24,114 --> 00:44:25,985
"I must let you go."

588
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:30,655
"I will not get to see you again."

589
00:44:34,695 --> 00:44:36,324
Those thoughts...

590
00:44:38,324 --> 00:44:39,895
squeeze my heart,

591
00:44:41,335 --> 00:44:42,764
block my airway,

592
00:44:44,965 --> 00:44:46,534
and run a fever in my heart.

593
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:51,005
I am certainly sick at heart.

594
00:44:57,014 --> 00:44:58,014
Right.

595
00:44:59,545 --> 00:45:01,514
A psychiatrist is suffering from an illness of the heart.

596
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:05,655
So who could possibly treat me?

597
00:45:29,244 --> 00:45:30,284
What is this?

598
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:32,384
See for yourself if you are curious.

599
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:47,795
You scoundrel. What game are you playing?

600
00:45:48,134 --> 00:45:49,695
I am playing the same game you played,

601
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,235
so why are you feigning ignorance?

602
00:45:51,664 --> 00:45:54,804
Your conduct is more unbecoming when it comes to women,

603
00:45:54,804 --> 00:45:57,344
but you dared to speak of a scandal.

604
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:00,414
The concubine you stole from another man.

605
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:02,775
I bet you thought you had kept her hidden well.

606
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:06,445
What would His Majesty do when he finds out?

607
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,724
Could your title and records also be annulled and deleted?

608
00:46:11,755 --> 00:46:12,824
Why you...

609
00:46:16,395 --> 00:46:17,494
What is it that you want?

610
00:46:18,324 --> 00:46:20,534
You talk big for someone who has zilch.

611
00:46:20,934 --> 00:46:22,065
I did not ask you to do anything.

612
00:46:24,105 --> 00:46:25,105
Then...

613
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:34,375
Just keep your mouth shut.

614
00:46:34,675 --> 00:46:36,675
I will handle the rest.

615
00:46:37,184 --> 00:46:39,045
In this ledger...

616
00:46:39,545 --> 00:46:42,315
are also names of those at the Medical Office.

617
00:46:42,954 --> 00:46:45,025
Make sure they keep their mouths shut as well.

618
00:46:45,485 --> 00:46:49,195
If they do not comply, your title and your people...

619
00:46:51,295 --> 00:46:52,295
will not be saved.

620
00:46:56,594 --> 00:47:00,175
What good will it do to keep his mouth shut...

621
00:47:00,335 --> 00:47:02,434
when the investigation will still be run?

622
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:05,474
As long as they do not add wood to the flame,

623
00:47:05,744 --> 00:47:07,875
His Majesty will uncover the truth.

624
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,344
The petitions we submit...

625
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:10,945
will give him a reason to stop the inquiry.

626
00:47:12,284 --> 00:47:14,315
That is why you are collecting petitions.

627
00:47:15,684 --> 00:47:17,824
You are the best.

628
00:47:17,824 --> 00:47:19,324
You would give the greatest tactician...

629
00:47:19,324 --> 00:47:20,824
a run for his money.

630
00:47:20,824 --> 00:47:23,054
- Allow me to... - That is all right.

631
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:25,395
You doing this...

632
00:47:26,224 --> 00:47:28,634
only makes me uncomfortable.

633
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,505
Talk about being uncomfortable.

634
00:47:38,545 --> 00:47:41,344
Physician Yoo, are you all right?

635
00:47:41,414 --> 00:47:43,914
I doubt you are in the best of shape.

636
00:47:44,585 --> 00:47:47,284
Actually, I must go.

637
00:47:48,255 --> 00:47:51,184
I must go with you.

638
00:47:52,355 --> 00:47:53,425
How so?

639
00:47:54,824 --> 00:47:55,824
Because...

640
00:47:57,525 --> 00:47:59,125
I think I have found a way.

641
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:02,395
But...

642
00:48:03,264 --> 00:48:04,534
you are ill.

643
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:07,105
I am not.

644
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:09,375
It is actually quite odd.

645
00:48:10,574 --> 00:48:14,074
When I am with you, I am not short of breath,

646
00:48:15,014 --> 00:48:16,514
and my heart is not squeezed.

647
00:48:37,405 --> 00:48:38,434
Your ring.

648
00:48:40,235 --> 00:48:41,804
You and Seol Ah each have a pair.

649
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:43,744
They signify your love.

650
00:48:49,744 --> 00:48:51,215
Seol Ah is gravely ill,

651
00:48:52,315 --> 00:48:54,914
but there is no cure.

652
00:48:56,655 --> 00:48:57,655
How sick is she?

653
00:48:58,554 --> 00:48:59,684
You said she was all right.

654
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,954
Rather than finding a way,

655
00:49:02,395 --> 00:49:05,125
you let yourselves succumb to a heartache.

656
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:08,934
It is not as easy as you think.

657
00:49:10,134 --> 00:49:11,235
Not even you two...

658
00:49:12,335 --> 00:49:15,375
could leave everything behind and relocate anywhere you wanted.

659
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:22,574
Check my pulse.

660
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:42,335
Your illness is severe.

661
00:49:49,474 --> 00:49:50,974
Is it why you gave up?

662
00:49:53,175 --> 00:49:54,514
Now you know.

663
00:49:55,474 --> 00:49:56,514
I cannot...

664
00:49:57,485 --> 00:50:00,045
go back to Seol Ah.

665
00:50:01,514 --> 00:50:02,514
That day,

666
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:05,824
I was mean to her because she had try to die...

667
00:50:05,824 --> 00:50:07,454
after finding out about my illness.

668
00:50:09,054 --> 00:50:11,895
Rather than being caught in a despicable scandal,

669
00:50:12,295 --> 00:50:14,295
she is better off forgetting about me.

670
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:18,204
Because you are running out of time, you must make a better decision.

671
00:50:21,905 --> 00:50:23,405
How is it for you?

672
00:50:25,545 --> 00:50:27,545
I obviously have less time left,

673
00:50:28,474 --> 00:50:29,775
but how much time...

674
00:50:30,884 --> 00:50:32,684
do you think you have left on your clock?

675
00:50:46,994 --> 00:50:48,164
If I find a way,

676
00:50:49,735 --> 00:50:50,835
will you follow?

677
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:55,005
No.

678
00:50:55,605 --> 00:50:57,175
I will die shortly.

679
00:50:58,145 --> 00:51:00,244
For Seol Ah above all,

680
00:51:02,914 --> 00:51:04,384
I like it better this way.

681
00:51:05,215 --> 00:51:06,215
Would Seol Ah...

682
00:51:07,215 --> 00:51:08,215
truly...

683
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:10,755
want that as well?

684
00:51:13,255 --> 00:51:14,255
Whether you run away,

685
00:51:14,895 --> 00:51:16,395
take on the challenge, or scream,

686
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:18,664
being together while you breathe...

687
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:20,864
What is precious is the time you spend together.

688
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:26,965
It will be over once you are gone,

689
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:30,375
so why will you not muster up the courage?

690
00:51:33,105 --> 00:51:34,445
The courage...

691
00:51:35,474 --> 00:51:37,184
to be with the one you love.

692
00:51:40,145 --> 00:51:41,684
Are you sure...

693
00:51:43,855 --> 00:51:45,684
you will not regret it at the last second?

694
00:52:56,824 --> 00:52:58,295
The two...

695
00:52:59,264 --> 00:53:00,895
do not have much time left.

696
00:53:02,164 --> 00:53:03,804
And during that time,

697
00:53:04,835 --> 00:53:06,704
one will physically be sick...

698
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:09,505
while one suffers from a heartache.

699
00:53:11,574 --> 00:53:12,574
Still,

700
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:15,614
they will be happy until that last second.

701
00:53:17,145 --> 00:53:18,145
Because they will be together.

702
00:53:21,485 --> 00:53:22,485
Right.

703
00:53:24,525 --> 00:53:26,784
Are you all set?

704
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:32,094
You found a path for us and gave us courage.

705
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:34,565
For that, I am grateful, Physician Seo.

706
00:53:36,134 --> 00:53:39,134
I only hope for your happiness.

707
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:41,804
I had better get going.

708
00:53:43,905 --> 00:53:44,974
Physician Seo,

709
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:49,945
do not go out of your way to hide your true feelings.

710
00:53:50,715 --> 00:53:52,315
Do not be afraid.

711
00:53:52,985 --> 00:53:54,855
Do your best to be true to your heart.

712
00:53:55,585 --> 00:53:57,014
So you have no regrets.

713
00:54:05,664 --> 00:54:07,235
What is it, Lady Eun Woo?

714
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:12,864
I do not know.

715
00:54:14,235 --> 00:54:16,005
My heart breaks too.

716
00:54:38,795 --> 00:54:40,125
My feverish night...

717
00:54:42,864 --> 00:54:44,565
was a revelation to me.

718
00:54:47,134 --> 00:54:48,675
Seol Ah's symptoms...

719
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:52,675
were oddly similar to mine.

720
00:54:56,715 --> 00:54:58,585
With all my heart,

721
00:54:59,344 --> 00:55:01,114
I love the person standing before me,

722
00:55:03,114 --> 00:55:04,554
but I cannot reach out.

723
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:09,824
Because the world tells me not to,

724
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,364
that it is wrong,

725
00:55:14,434 --> 00:55:16,094
that I must let you go.

726
00:55:18,505 --> 00:55:20,565
You left me to return to this place,

727
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:23,905
and then...

728
00:55:25,045 --> 00:55:26,744
when I accepted...

729
00:55:28,974 --> 00:55:31,014
that your going to Qing to study...

730
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:34,315
might be best for you,

731
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:39,454
I became sick with a fever.

732
00:55:49,494 --> 00:55:50,704
It is not an illness.

733
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:55,905
I am not in pain.

734
00:55:58,675 --> 00:55:59,875
I just love you...

735
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:04,284
to death.

736
00:56:12,525 --> 00:56:14,525
Hurry, we must hang our strings.

737
00:56:14,525 --> 00:56:16,355
- We should run. - This should be fun.

738
00:56:16,824 --> 00:56:18,295
Wait for me!

739
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:21,195
Before it is too late,

740
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:23,594
we should write our wishes too.

741
00:56:26,204 --> 00:56:27,235
Okay.

742
00:56:57,065 --> 00:56:58,304
I hope...

743
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:02,534
my wish comes true right away like yours did.

744
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:07,514
What did you write?

745
00:57:09,574 --> 00:57:11,014
Is it not obvious?

746
00:57:12,914 --> 00:57:14,514
"May we be together forever."

747
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:34,074
Should I ask you to run away with me?

748
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:38,344
Or should I ask you to bear with it with me...

749
00:57:39,204 --> 00:57:41,215
even if it means jumping into a fire?

750
00:57:42,744 --> 00:57:44,914
I thought in agony for so long.

751
00:57:50,715 --> 00:57:51,824
As yet,

752
00:57:52,824 --> 00:57:54,525
we have not found our path.

753
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:59,625
But one thing I will not do...

754
00:58:00,364 --> 00:58:03,034
is hide my feelings and let you go.

755
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,005
Even if I am a bad person who thinks only of myself,

756
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,474
and if you can forgive me,

757
00:58:18,284 --> 00:58:20,014
would you grant my wish...

758
00:58:23,585 --> 00:58:25,355
so we can be together?

759
00:58:35,634 --> 00:58:36,864
I do not...

760
00:58:38,934 --> 00:58:40,005
want to hide...

761
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:43,074
how I feel any longer.

762
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,545
Lady Eun Woo. I like you.

763
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:26,605
My heart is racing.

764
01:00:27,445 --> 01:00:29,414
I will block the wind and rain.

765
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:31,684
Jeon Kang Il might find this...

766
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:33,784
in my room very soon.

767
01:00:33,914 --> 01:00:35,914
I will destroy that secret ledger for you.

768
01:00:38,655 --> 01:00:39,855
Have you seen Lady Eun Woo?

769
01:00:39,855 --> 01:00:41,355
I have not seen her for a while.

770
01:00:41,355 --> 01:00:42,795
Do you have a death wish?

771
01:00:42,795 --> 01:00:43,855
My lady!

772
01:00:43,855 --> 01:00:45,295
Where did she go?

773
01:00:45,594 --> 01:00:47,094
How could a governor...

774
01:00:47,425 --> 01:00:48,864
hurt one of his people?

775
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:51,905
I just need you to be silent forever.

776
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:53,233
Lady Eun Woo.
