Books he does not want and will not read are pressure.

00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:57,112
Yes.

171
00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:59,751
I will think of you, every breath I take.

172
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,582
I truly...

173
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:40,551
Truly...

174
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:45,661
I truly miss you.

175
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:23,962
Have you snapped out of it?

176
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:25,791
Are you all right?

177
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:30,801
What is the matter?

178
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:36,501
A ghost...

179
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:38,572
A ghost.

180
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:40,271
The butterfly...

181
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,541
What are you saying?

182
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:49,452
The late Second State Councillor...

183
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:52,421
Cho Tae Hak!

184
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:59,431
How dare you utter the name of such a traitor?

185
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:01,702
The truth is,

186
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:05,301
the court maids have been saying...

187
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,641
that some of them spotted a ghost in the palace.

188
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:12,671
Cho Tae Hak?

189
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:14,842
Pardon me?

190
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:18,511
Did she just say that the ghost she saw was Cho Tae Hak?

191
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:22,552
The ghost was wearing...

192
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:26,221
a jade butterfly ornament, the symbol of the Cho family.

193
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:28,022
That is what I heard.

194
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,872
I am solely to blame for this.

195
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:45,941
What are you waiting for? Go get a physician at once!

196
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:47,112
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,130
My goodness.

198
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:56,989
Oh, Lady Namhae.

199
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,409
I need more paper. How come this is all we have?

200
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,705
I recently went to the paper store and bought some for you.

201
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:03,028
Look carefully.

202
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:05,739
- You are becoming forgetful. - Goodness.

203
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,110
Ip Bun, what are you doing? You are wasting my precious paper!

204
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:19,179
Father, do you not want to buy a nice house in Hanyang?

205
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,850
What is this nonsense about?

206
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,089
There are so many successful fabric stores in Hanyang.

207
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,220
They make a lot more money than physicians do.

208
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,989
I shall go assist a seamstress in the palace.

209
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,360
Then I will open a fancy fabric store...

210
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:34,049
so that you can live comfortably.

211
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:36,970
- Ip Bun. - Yes?

212
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:40,339
They say the sparrow near a school sings the primer.

213
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,238
Your father is a physician, yet you still cannot...

214
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,978
identify a single acupuncture point.

215
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,078
You will go assist a seamstress?

216
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,249
You cannot buy a house even in thousands of years!

217
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,450
Do not talk down to Ip Bun.

218
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,989
Ip Bun is not an idiot!

219
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:58,420
Hey! That is even more insulting.

220
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:01,759
She is saying that...

221
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,190
because she has no idea...

222
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,298
how scary Hanyang can be.

223
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,299
You are right.

224
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,370
Boar, you know because you have been stabbed.

225
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:15,069
Come on, Granny.

226
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,539
It is not like you know me that well.

227
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
I know everything.

228
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,279
You and your unrealistic ideas.

229
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,819
Waste any more paper,

230
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,650
I will throw everything out including that brush.

231
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,690
By the way, where did the dunce go when it is time to eat?

232
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:36,960
Leave him be.

233
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,400
Physician Yoo will not be needing any food.

234
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,058
Did he have a spiritual awakening?

235
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,470
Why will he not need any food?

236
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,559
Physician Yoo, I hope you are well.

237
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,860
I appreciate the letter you sent me.

238
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,339
I have been keeping busy here.

239
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,640
I found something I could do.

240
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,139
Many herbs here are not like ones you would find in inland areas...

241
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,710
which has me intrigued.

242
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,549
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

243
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:49,430
But she knows better, so why...

244
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,579
I made the mistake of tasting creeping beach ixeris,

245
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,110
and it almost numbed my tongue.

246
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:24,829
Young Master, are you not going to eat?

247
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,870
Young Master.

248
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:40,180
I am coming, you fool!

249
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,390
There.

250
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:48,660
Is it not the 15th soon?

251
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:51,700
Make sure to shop for what she likes in advance.

252
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,528
Buy some meat as well.

253
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:56,970
Thanks to her, we will be having a feast.

254
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,279
Is someone visiting on the 15th?

255
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:18,660
I will be visiting Hanyang on the 15th this month.

256
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,160
Lady Seo. Did she not write to you as well?

257
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:25,999
He did receive her letter.

258
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,099
But he thought she had only written to her...

259
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,529
and read it in secret.

260
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,416
Why did you not know she was visiting though?

261
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,369
She will be in Hanyang on the 15th.

262
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,440
Maybe she forgot to inform the dunce of her visit.

263
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,548
How do you describe this type of situation again?

264
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:44,509
She could not care less.

265
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:47,779
Lady Seo could not care about you any less.

266
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,919
That is what you wanted to say.

267
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,289
That is right.

268
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:55,729
I was still in the middle of reading it, but I knew.

269
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,759
I doubt she only left me out.

270
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,929
I think she did.

271
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,299
You are the only one she did not bother to tell.

272
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,239
Is Poong's wife coming to the city?

273
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:08,859
It will be their first night together.

274
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,979
Gosh, Granny. It is not like that.

275
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,590
Is it not their first night together?

276
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,409
How many nights have you spent together?

277
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,279
Goodness me.

278
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,049
Jang Gun, dig in.

279
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:37,630
How are you the only one here?

280
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:44,369
Everyone else was afraid of the epidemic.

281
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,850
They should be ashamed of themselves.

282
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:48,309
What about you?

283
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,380
How could a physician...

284
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,549
fear an illness?

285
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,130
How are you feeling?

286
00:24:03,489 --> 00:24:04,529
Physician Jeon,

287
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,759
am I going to die as well?

288
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,129
Apparently, death finds those who saw the ghost.

289
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,299
That is nonsense.

290
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,769
A patient of mine will never die.

291
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,609
Overnight, there has been a surge of court maids...

292
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,050
who experienced nausea and seizures.

293
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:22,650
Are the symptoms alike?

294
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,049
What could this illness be?

295
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:27,220
Seeing how all the maids are from the Queen's chambers,

296
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,850
food poisoning is most likely.

297
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,120
This could be the sign of an epidemic.

298
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:38,430
- What? - An epidemic?

299
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:40,709
- How can that be? - That is preposterous.

300
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,630
Is it the same story?

301
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,539
Are you about to blame my incompetence again?

302
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:53,039
Have Yoo Se Yeob brought in.

303
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,210
Right this instant.

304
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,479
But summoning Physician Yoo...

305
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,049
is against the statutes of this court.

306
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,019
What could be of greater importance?

307
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,190
The statute or human lives?

308
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:13,700
(Gyesoo Clinic, Hanyang Branch)

309
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,529
That darn Yoo Se Yeob!

310
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:49,498
If he is to be summoned to care for court maids,

311
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:51,829
what is the purpose of the Medical Office?

312
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,039
Did you say Yoo Se Yeob?

313
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:03,009
They suspect food poisoning?

314
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,120
That is the diagnosis of the Medical Office.

315
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:09,509
It does not seem like food poisoning though.

316
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:12,920
I agree. It is something else.

317
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:16,160
Oh, dear.

318
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,660
We thoroughly inspected what the court maids ate,

319
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,630
but nothing was out of the ordinary.

320
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:23,869
Has there been an increase of patients?

321
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,838
Was there anything that they normally did not eat?

322
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:28,298
- I am afraid not. - Just today,

323
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:30,940
over ten court maids were taken ill.

324
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,409
We will discover the root of their illness,

325
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,880
so please keep helping them.

326
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,300
It is not food poisoning, nor is it an epidemic.

327
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,190
That is why I am in search of another diagnosis.

328
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,259
A ghost.

329
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,059
She mentioned a ghost.

330
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,670
Se Yeob, Cho Tae Hak's vindictive spirit...

331
00:26:57,829 --> 00:26:59,469
is said to be roaming within these walls.

332
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:02,110
My gosh.

333
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:05,110
We both know how absurd it is.

334
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,549
Uncover the cause of this illness,

335
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:13,680
and you will be greatly rewarded.

336
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,519
Is there anything you desire?

337
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,360
We are seeing a surge of patients due to famine and natural disasters.

338
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:24,959
To prevent the people from dying,

339
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,499
medicinal herbs of great quality...

340
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,299
Your Majesty's wholehearted support...

341
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,768
and the funding Gyesoo Clinic...

342
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:36,269
will help us treat and cure the people more efficiently.

343
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,009
I hear you.

344
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:45,309
But first, make sure you save the lives of the court maids.

345
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,450
I am humbled by your boundless generosity.

346
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:50,989
Allow me to serve you gamiondamtang for your symptoms.

347
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:54,160
You must not allow it, Your Majesty!

348
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,759
Who dares to cause a commotion?

349
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:02,069
The Medical Office is here to recommend your treatment.

350
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,229
What exactly are you against?

351
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:13,839
The ondamtang is not appropriate for your weakened heart and gall.

352
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,309
You must take the cheongshimtang brewed by the Medical Office.

353
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:22,190
You are not well enough to stomach cheongshimtang.

354
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:24,219
Your Majesty's well-being cannot be cared for...

355
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,140
by someone who is not a physician of this court.

356
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:30,430
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty. - Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

357
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,470
I see that nothing has changed here.

358
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:38,229
How many of you here...

359
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:42,309
have actually checked his pulse and diagnosed his condition?

360
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,239
Your Majesty has been jumpy and has heart palpitations.

361
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:49,279
Can you not see that you are doing more harm...

362
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,249
by raising your voices?

363
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:54,779
And yet, you decided to only trouble him.

364
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,190
That is enough.

365
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,990
I will heed the instructions of the Medical Office.

366
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:00,819
You are all dismissed.

367
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,930
- Thank you for your grace. - Thank you for your grace.

368
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:06,360
The court maids' unidentified illness...

369
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,299
has been responding well to the Medical Office's treatment.

370
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:10,869
Please allow the Medical Office...

371
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,700
to have full authority over their well-being.

372
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,470
What on earth...

373
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:18,670
More court maids are falling ill each day.

374
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:22,610
Either you, the royal physician, are sorely mistaken or...

375
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,650
you are conning His Majesty.

376
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,289
I summoned these two...

377
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:32,559
so they could assist the Medical Office.

378
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,390
Work together...

379
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,930
and identify the cause of this illness.

380
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:39,829
Do your job as the royal physician.

381
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,558
Your Majesty!

382
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,769
Leave me now.

383
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,720
What is he giving me that look for?

384
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Physician Gye.

385
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:15,869
If you were sent to the countryside,

386
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,899
you should have stayed and lived quietly.

387
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,399
How dare you come here whenever you please?

388
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,069
I did not come to see you.

389
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,808
Do you Medical Office people still not study...

390
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:29,180
and instead build up your arrogance?

391
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,420
The court maids do not have food poisoning.

392
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,679
How dare you comment on our diagnosis...

393
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,950
when you were exiled for your lack of skill?

394
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,889
I was not sent away for my lack of skill.

395
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,660
I left on my own accord because I got sick of this place.

396
00:30:43,729 --> 00:30:46,029
Does the Medical Office not value...

397
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:47,960
some lives more than others?

398
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,528
You are unable to distinguish between...

399
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:51,170
what to say and what not to say.

400
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,170
You had better be careful.

401
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:57,370
Oh, did you pay that court lady a visit?

402
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:02,450
I wonder if she is aware you got kicked out that very day.

403
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:10,949
Why that darn...

404
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,789
Physician Gye, there are too many ears.

405
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:15,889
This is exactly why I hate this place.

406
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,160
They only care about justifying their actions.

407
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,130
I cannot stand him.

408
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,930
Darn it.

409
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,470
I would like to go somewhere while you meet Uncle.

410
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
Go where?

411
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:00,539
Our relatives wish to see you.

412
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,140
I told you. Gyesoo Clinic is...

413
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,880
Watch where you are going.

414
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,610
I apologize.

415
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:12,819
(Cold sweat)

416
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:14,819
(Blue-tinted iris)

417
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:15,989
(Chapped lips)

418
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,519
(Shaky hands)

419
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,860
He got drunk this early in the day?

420
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,809
- Oh, dear. - Hey.

421
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,268
Get up.

422
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:39,610
Are you all right?

423
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,078
- Hey. - Excuse me.

424
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,140
Give me space.

425
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,839
One, two,

426
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,910
three.

427
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,180
He is alive.

428
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,049
Are you okay?

429
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,819
- Well done. - You saved him.

430
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,880
- Get up. - Well done.

431
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,950
You must take him to a physician.

432
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Okay.

433
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:27,089
- Come along. - Thank you.

434
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,628
- You have skill. - You saved his life.

435
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:32,899
- Good for her. - That was quite something.

436
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:35,629
Father.

437
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,870
Oh, yes.

438
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,770
What if something went wrong?

439
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:45,310
He could have died had I not helped him.

440
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,839
You should be wary of what people may say.

441
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,070
Be more cautious from now on.

442
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,080
I will. I am aware of your concern.

443
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,470
What are you doing?

444
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:18,270
This smells disgusting.

445
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,339
She definitely ingested something...

446
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,480
We need help!

447
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:26,699
- Help us. - Bring her over here.

448
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:27,819
Perfect.

449
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,220
Sit down.

450
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,120
Keep this in your mouth for a while.

451
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,359
Here.

452
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:37,989
That is it.

453
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,060
No, do not eat it. Do not swallow.

454
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,770
Look at this! It is definitely a misdiagnosis.

455
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,209
It is not food poisoning.

456
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:56,680
Is it poison?

457
00:34:57,009 --> 00:34:59,480
Yes. They ingested a poison.

458
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:01,080
We must change the herbal tonic.

459
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:03,989
Who is the fool who dares to...

460
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:10,290
mention poison?

461
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,930
This is the Palace.

462
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,160
Have you forgotten what Cho Tae Hak did?

463
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,568
How are you so sure it is not poison?

464
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:17,870
Shut your mouth.

465
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,540
I know you are exaggerating just to score points.

466
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:23,739
So what?

467
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,839
You will not let us see the medicinal herbs?

468
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:28,739
Do you want everyone to die first?

469
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:31,310
Stop being so insistent and leave.

470
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:33,080
Before I inform His Majesty.

471
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:36,088
You load of idiots.

472
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:38,048
Look up the medical texts.

473
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:39,890
How is this food poisoning?

474
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:46,999
We must make all the court maids vomit,

475
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,628
then serve a cleansing pill or Mangcho.

476
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:52,770
How dare you try to give orders to those who work for me?

477
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,369
Are you some common thug?

478
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,668
You are picking sides when people are suffering?

479
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:59,910
There is no time. At least give us some mung beans and gamcho.

480
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,310
Forget it.

481
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:03,949
We shall run in there and get it ourselves.

482
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,419
I cannot spare any herbs for the crazy likes of you.

483
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,589
Move it! Block them!

484
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:16,589
My goodness... You lot have gotten even more childish.

485
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,500
Goodness.

486
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:32,709
How can they not give us any medicinal herbs?

487
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:59,299
Ghosts...

488
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Ghosts.

489
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,439
Ghosts!

490
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Physician!

491
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:10,279
Physician!

492
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,350
Set her down.

493
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:17,450
I saw them.

494
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,060
Ghosts. I saw them.

495
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,399
Blue eyes...

496
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:35,739
What are you doing?

497
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,239
Treat with acupuncture.

498
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
Move.

499
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,189
It is glaucoma.

500
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:56,689
What?

501
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,210
(Nokpoongnaejang: A glaucoma of sorts)

502
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:00,129
Let me take a look.

503
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:05,129
Glaucoma.

504
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
You misdiagnosed.

505
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,370
Will you still insist it is food poisoning?

506
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,049
No.

507
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:20,149
The Medical Office was not wrong.

508
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,049
What the...

509
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,359
How do I look? Beautiful, no?

510
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,930
Maiden ghost.

511
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,270
Will you go out looking like that?

512
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,140
Ip Bun made them herself.

513
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,910
Pretty.

514
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,080
Jang Gun, you have the taste of a Hanyang man.

515
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,009
You have great taste. Very modern.

516
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,480
Modern? As if.

517
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,680
If you were to go out at night looking like that,

518
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:57,390
something dreadful could befall you.

519
00:38:57,689 --> 00:38:59,660
This is the latest fashion.

520
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,289
What?

521
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,359
Gather round.

522
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,060
Will you gather round?

523
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,259
What for?

524
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,769
I am off to meet the owners of the hottest fabric stores.

525
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,770
What?

526
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:15,099
You see, those ladies want...

527
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,609
to turn my drawings into dresses. They said they would pay me.

528
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,609
Goodness. Have you signed a contract?

529
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,979
Must you be such a downer?

530
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,909
When you start out, you just have to trust people.

531
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,479
Hey. The more dresses they sell,

532
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,720
the more money they will lose.

533
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,020
No.

534
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,489
We would have to wait 500 years for this to become a trend.

535
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:38,459
Gosh, you people know nothing about this industry.

536
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:41,859
After selling 1 or 2, you know how well it will do.

537
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:44,399
They said they made good money selling my drawings.

538
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:45,568
Money?

539
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:48,500
They have sold a few, so they know your drawings can bring in money?

540
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:49,669
Yes.

541
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,609
People in Hanyang have such bizarre tastes.

542
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,878
I can draw well, you know.

543
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:57,949
Who has such awful business acumen skills?

544
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,209
Who is this store owner?

545
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,850
Why, you...

546
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,020
Ip Bun!

547
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,660
I have to go.

548
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,730
Hi, ladies. I am coming.

549
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,759
Hey, Ip Bun! What?

550
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,640
Goodness. Is she a ghost or what?

551
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,169
- What? - Oh, no!

552
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:24,140
What happened to you?

553
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:26,378
I ran into some jerk,

554
00:40:26,379 --> 00:40:27,809
so I taught him a lesson.

555
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,355
Jang Gun, let us go check the medicinal ingredients that are left.

556
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:31,878
- Okay! - Why?

557
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,895
Is someone coming to steal the medicinal ingredients?

558
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:37,048
Oh, the Medical Office will not give us any.

559
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:40,390
So you will take our ingredients to the palace?

560
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:43,660
It is the only way we can treat the court maids.

561
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:47,330
How exciting! We are going to the palace!

562
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,930
The truth is, I am the Queen.

563
00:40:52,939 --> 00:40:54,769
- Goodness. - Sure, whatever.

564
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,839
Okay, all right.

565
00:40:58,169 --> 00:40:59,169
- Oh, boy. - Let her be.

566
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:05,209
We are coming!

567
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,319
No. No way!

568
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,390
I refuse. No way!

569
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,159
I heard the rumours about the ghost. The ghost keeps showing up.

570
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,958
How could you tell me to stay here?

571
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:19,858
That is what the court maids in the Queen's chambers say.

572
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,929
You are safe here, Your Highness.

573
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,230
We are not far from the Queen's chambers at all.

574
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,099
Look at these dark circles under my eyes.

575
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,838
I am so anxious that I cannot even sleep at night.

576
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,640
I will die and become a ghost at this rate.

577
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:30,810
You called off...

578
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,239
your wedding like that. No wonder you cannot sleep.

579
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,580
Shut your mouth, Court Lady Jung.

580
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,120
I shall ask His Majesty to move me someplace else.

581
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,520
All right. Come along!

582
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,989
But His Majesty...

583
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,819
told us not to let anyone in.

584
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,129
He will not turn me away.

585
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,999
I must ask him in person myself.

586
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,629
No, you cannot.

587
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:59,100
How will you face His Majesty after what you did?

588
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,020
Square your shoulders, all of you!

589
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,619
Look at those lowly fools.

590
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,620
Hello!

591
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:23,290
Goodness.

592
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,140
You are wasting your time if His Majesty does turn you away.

593
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:37,639
His Majesty has a lot on his mind.

594
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,438
You should not add to his stress, Your Highness.

595
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,980
That is precisely why I must comfort His Majesty.

596
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:46,819
His Majesty needs some alone time...

597
00:43:11,169 --> 00:43:13,779
I am a princess.

598
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:16,279
How dare you!

599
00:43:18,149 --> 00:43:20,249
Please forgive me!

600
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,819
Your Highness, please calm down.

601
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,619
You suddenly stopped, so she...

602
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,220
Court Lady Jung, are you saying this is my fault?

603
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:31,790
No, that is not what I meant.

604
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:33,829
I must seek an audience with His Majesty,

605
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,229
but my beautiful shoes have become filthy!

606
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,430
I cannot wear them. Throw them away at once!

607
00:43:53,879 --> 00:43:55,350
A flower shoe!

608
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,319
I used to wear this when I was a princess.

609
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,060
My goodness. Let go.

610
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,430
Gosh, how dare they.

611
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:08,959
Oh?

612
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,509
Meet my friend, Se Yeob.

613
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:40,129
What is he doing here?

614
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,299
I wonder too.

615
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,930
Why is he here?

616
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,129
Oh, my.

617
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:58,609
What are you waiting for? Bring it to me.

618
00:45:01,149 --> 00:45:02,750
Go. Hurry.

619
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,088
- Okay, come on. - Hurry, quick.

620
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:06,988
- Come on. - Come along.

621
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:08,389
- Why would you throw it? - Oh, no!

622
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,529
No!

623
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,189
- Get back here. - Wait!

624
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:15,830
Hurry, let us go.

625
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,569
Oh, boy.

626
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,149
Court Lady Jung!

627
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,219
Goodness. What is happening here?

628
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,359
What happened?

629
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:45,588
More court maids have fallen ill.

630
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:47,258
What is the Medical Office doing?

631
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:49,099
They will not come.

632
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,200
What?

633
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,069
- My lady! - Yes.

634
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:56,269
I heard the royal physician dragged Deok Gae away.

635
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,339
What?

636
00:46:03,149 --> 00:46:06,250
That court maid fed everyone something.

637
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,919
Pardon me? What do you mean...

638
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,988
Sir, is that truly necessary?

639
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:17,390
Then what? Must we admit that the Medical Office was wrong?

640
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:22,659
What did you feed the court maids?

641
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,200
You ought to tell us the truth!

642
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:27,739
Nothing! I am telling you the truth.

643
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,270
What are you doing?

644
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:36,339
Threatening the ill? Is that how the Medical Office does things?

645
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:37,809
Using His Majesty...

646
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:40,720
to override the customs of the palace. Is that how you do things?

647
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:43,918
Whether you are a mere physician or a royal medical officer,

648
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:46,520
you must treat and help the ill. That does not change.

649
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,689
Such insolence.

650
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,700
This court maid is my patient, so I will take her with me.

651
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:04,970
Leave him be.

652
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:08,140
He is just like Gye Ji Han.

653
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:10,609
He, too, will be banished from the palace very soon.

654
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,350
I saw you saw a ghost.

655
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:22,499
I heard he looked like Cho Tae Hak who is now dead.

656
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:25,389
Yes. The spirit of the late Second State Councillor...

657
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,000
is roaming the palace grounds.

658
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,970
They say a curse is put on you when you see a ghost.

659
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:34,470
The Queen's chambers have been shut down for years. Why were you there?

660
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:40,279
I was just passing by.

661
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,680
Why were you passing by the Queen's chambers in the middle of the night?

662
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,700
I believe Physician Yoo's residence was somewhere around here.

Physician Gye.

667
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:34,560
Did everyone go out?

(Psychiatrist Yoo Se Poong)

669
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:41,808
How can you be this arrogant?

670
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:49,478
The one who is arrogant is you,

671
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:51,879
since you will not admit your misdiagnosis.

672
00:49:52,649 --> 00:49:55,448
I will neutralize the poison with properly-made haedokdan.

673
00:50:25,948 --> 00:50:28,019
Who are these people?

674
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:31,019
Weird, is it not?

675
00:50:32,689 --> 00:50:35,358
A bunch of weirdos have properly identified the illness...

676
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,827
and are making the antidote.

677
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:38,758
But on top of that, they are quite skilled.

678
00:50:40,198 --> 00:50:41,198
- Physician Gye. - Right.

679
00:50:43,198 --> 00:50:46,669
Do you know my nickname for the Medical Office?

680
00:50:48,138 --> 00:50:49,138
A well.

681
00:50:49,638 --> 00:50:54,308
You are nothing but a frog who is trapped in a well.

682
00:50:56,279 --> 00:50:59,049
Froggy, what could be your name?

683
00:51:02,919 --> 00:51:04,019
It is Jeon Kang Il.

684
00:51:05,558 --> 00:51:06,758
Jeon Kang Il...

685
00:51:11,658 --> 00:51:12,658
Jeon Kang Il?

686
00:51:18,669 --> 00:51:20,868
You seem talented enough,

687
00:51:21,569 --> 00:51:23,238
but you were taught to be wicked.

688
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:26,678
It is time for your medicine.

689
00:51:30,718 --> 00:51:32,779
He does not know me.

690
00:51:34,118 --> 00:51:37,388
He does not remember me at all.

691
00:51:45,158 --> 00:51:47,568
Good job, everyone. Go and get some rest.

692
00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:48,868
Go on.

693
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:51,967
Have a pleasant evening, and thank you for today.

694
00:51:51,968 --> 00:51:53,538
- Bye, Ip Bun. - Bye!

695
00:51:54,908 --> 00:51:56,669
- Gye Ip Bun. - Yes?

696
00:51:57,178 --> 00:51:58,938
Do you have any idea how busy we were today?

697
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:01,649
Where were you all day long?

698
00:52:02,979 --> 00:52:04,718
Look at you all labouring away.

699
00:52:05,118 --> 00:52:06,118
Just you wait and see.

700
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:08,448
I will soon have you all wearing silk.

701
00:52:09,819 --> 00:52:11,717
Why is it that you only keep dreaming...

702
00:52:11,718 --> 00:52:13,589
of the most preposterous things?

703
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:17,458
That little brat. You should knock some sense into her.

704
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:21,428
She has been frolicking around with the troublemakers of Hanyang.

705
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:23,838
Who are you calling troublemakers?

706
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,637
Those ladies are the major players in town.

707
00:52:25,638 --> 00:52:26,638
As if.

708
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:28,839
She knows what she is talking about, you boar.

709
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:31,178
Everyone knows them.

710
00:52:32,308 --> 00:52:34,347
They are the girls from the fabric store.

711
00:52:34,348 --> 00:52:36,447
While they may not seem very ladylike,

712
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,618
their clothes are of great quality.

713
00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:41,589
Dad, look.

714
00:52:41,948 --> 00:52:44,459
This is how much they profited from my designs.

715
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:47,529
As long as I keep drawing, I will be making heaps of money.

716
00:52:50,288 --> 00:52:51,999
This is real money.

717
00:52:52,058 --> 00:52:53,058
What?

718
00:52:54,229 --> 00:52:55,528
Of course it is real money.

719
00:52:55,529 --> 00:52:58,637
Ip Bun, will you be making a name for yourself?

720
00:52:58,638 --> 00:53:00,238
She will probably bring the family down.

721
00:53:01,638 --> 00:53:03,068
Look at how rough and dry your hands are...

722
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:04,737
from treating patients all the time.

723
00:53:04,738 --> 00:53:06,279
My heart aches.

724
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:10,548
Then stop slacking off and study medicine...

725
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:12,618
Gosh. Just be done with it all.

726
00:53:13,078 --> 00:53:14,419
With my clothing designs,

727
00:53:14,988 --> 00:53:16,428
I will bring fortune to this family.

728
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:21,629
Unbelievable.

729
00:53:22,189 --> 00:53:23,959
She has finally lost her mind.

730
00:53:25,229 --> 00:53:26,258
Why does she scare me?

731
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:28,239
This will be embarrassing later.

732
00:53:48,848 --> 00:53:50,658
I should brew myself some ondamtang.

733
00:53:52,919 --> 00:53:54,529
My hallucinations seem too real.

734
00:54:18,078 --> 00:54:19,479
Have you been well, Physician Yoo?

735
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:28,029
Lady Eun Woo?

736
00:54:28,828 --> 00:54:30,158
- Yes. - Lady Eun Woo!

737
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:36,068
How are you here when it is not the 15th?

738
00:54:36,529 --> 00:54:37,999
Is this not a dream?

739
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:39,769
It is not.

740
00:54:48,808 --> 00:54:50,519
What is the matter, Physician Yoo?

741
00:54:51,218 --> 00:54:53,458
You have been a figment of my imagination for so long...

742
00:54:53,578 --> 00:54:54,589
that I wanted to check.

743
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:01,058
You are really standing before me.

744
00:55:02,558 --> 00:55:05,058
That is right. And I missed you dearly as well.

745
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:52,479
Young Master, you should eat before the meat gets cold.

746
00:55:52,908 --> 00:55:54,149
My goodness.

747
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:01,549
Lady Eun Woo?

748
00:56:03,049 --> 00:56:04,409
- Gosh. - Yes, it is Lady Eun Woo.

749
00:56:04,658 --> 00:56:05,658
Have you been well?

750
00:56:05,659 --> 00:56:08,058
My gosh!

751
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:10,557
It really is you, Lady Eun Woo.

752
00:56:10,558 --> 00:56:12,098
Hold on a second.

753
00:56:12,629 --> 00:56:14,928
Lady Eun Woo is here!

754
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:17,069
Well...

755
00:56:17,439 --> 00:56:18,439
Careful.

756
00:56:18,868 --> 00:56:19,868
Come quickly.

757
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:33,717
Lady Eun Woo, please have your fill.

758
00:56:33,718 --> 00:56:35,887
I know the trip here was quite long.

759
00:56:35,888 --> 00:56:37,958
Thank goodness we stocked up on groceries in advance.

760
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:40,519
I could have had to serve you porridge with dried radish greens.

761
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:43,488
Lady Namhae, you have no idea how much I missed your food.

762
00:56:45,428 --> 00:56:46,729
All right.

763
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:49,828
There.

764
00:56:53,269 --> 00:56:54,269
There you go.

765
00:56:54,709 --> 00:56:56,939
Please dig in.

766
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:02,109
My gosh. Talk about a sickening sight.

767
00:57:02,448 --> 00:57:04,279
I will go ahead...

768
00:57:04,649 --> 00:57:06,148
and serve myself a drumstick.

769
00:57:06,149 --> 00:57:07,149
Sure.

770
00:57:07,149 --> 00:57:08,149
Goodness.

771
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:14,958
You have no trouble taking care of yourself.

772
00:57:14,959 --> 00:57:16,159
I do not need to worry at all.

773
00:57:16,928 --> 00:57:18,529
- Right. - Lady Eun Woo,

774
00:57:18,899 --> 00:57:20,327
the island must have been good to you.

775
00:57:20,328 --> 00:57:21,729
You look even prettier than before.

776
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:25,568
And Hanyang must be good to the young man next to her.

777
00:57:25,569 --> 00:57:27,438
How he is grinning from ear to ear...

778
00:57:27,439 --> 00:57:28,808
makes him look even more stupid.

779
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:31,737
Please try this too.

780
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:33,238
The layer of Taffy makes it sweet.

781
00:57:34,078 --> 00:57:35,149
Thank you, Jang Gun.

782
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:38,419
Am I allowed to have something so precious though?

783
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:40,319
I could offer you one every day.

784
00:57:42,618 --> 00:57:45,358
Granny, what is the matter?

785
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,118
Are you not happy to see Lady Eun Woo?

786
00:57:51,058 --> 00:57:52,058
What the...

787
00:57:53,629 --> 00:57:56,269
Granny, it has been so long.

788
00:57:56,468 --> 00:57:57,569
Have you been well?

789
00:58:01,939 --> 00:58:02,939
Granny?

790
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:06,339
She was thrilled to hear you were coming,

791
00:58:06,738 --> 00:58:08,709
but I guess the excitement wore off.

792
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:10,879
It has been bitter-sweet for her lately.

793
00:58:13,678 --> 00:58:14,888
Promise.

794
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:19,919
You will not leave my Poong ever again, will you?

795
00:58:23,729 --> 00:58:25,698
Will you stay by his side?

796
00:58:27,098 --> 00:58:30,198
What are you talking about, Granny? She did not leave him.

797
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:32,769
To Granny, Lady Eun Woo...

798
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:35,408
will forever be Physician Yoo's wife.

799
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:54,589
There. She promised.

800
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:58,229
- Great. - Let us all eat.

801
00:58:59,299 --> 00:59:00,729
Eat all you want, Lady Eun Woo.

802
00:59:04,738 --> 00:59:06,339
Eat your fill.

803
00:59:07,808 --> 00:59:08,839
I am done.

804
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:13,807
Why did you only eat two bowls of rice?

805
00:59:13,808 --> 00:59:14,948
Did you lose your appetite?

806
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:17,169
Where are you going this late at night?

807
00:59:19,279 --> 00:59:23,019
Everyone has a personal life, okay?

808
00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:27,459
I have to look into something.

809
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,328
Goodbye.

810
00:59:33,658 --> 00:59:34,928
What was that about?

811
01:00:05,058 --> 01:00:06,629
I can imagine it so clearly.

812
01:00:08,428 --> 01:00:09,499
Imagine what?

813
01:00:10,299 --> 01:00:13,839
How you must have played in this stream as a child.

814
01:00:15,269 --> 01:00:18,908
Did you do nothing but read even as a child?

815
01:00:20,308 --> 01:00:21,348
No.

816
01:00:22,408 --> 01:00:25,519
Once I went out to play, I rarely returned the same day.

817
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:27,848
My mother was always concerned.

818
01:00:29,718 --> 01:00:31,218
Oh, really?

819
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:33,488
That sounds so odd.

820
01:00:40,899 --> 01:00:42,269
How beautiful.

821
01:00:46,138 --> 01:00:49,269
Yes. It is a beautiful place.

822
01:00:49,638 --> 01:00:50,709
No.

823
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:54,209
I mean you.

824
01:01:29,578 --> 01:01:30,649
I also...

825
01:01:31,718 --> 01:01:33,379
kept it with me at all times.

826
01:01:47,129 --> 01:01:48,269
Just as...

827
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:51,738
you held my heart closely.

828
01:02:21,328 --> 01:02:22,729
His Majesty kept us apart,

829
01:02:24,738 --> 01:02:27,138
and I wished to do this for a whole year long.

830
01:02:31,578 --> 01:02:35,379
Is the situation still so bad that you must...

831
01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:37,008
stay by His Majesty's side?

832
01:02:38,149 --> 01:02:39,218
Yes.

833
01:02:41,488 --> 01:02:45,019
He believes Cho Tae Hak's ghost haunts the Palace.

834
01:02:47,828 --> 01:02:49,129
What does that mean?

835
01:02:49,258 --> 01:02:51,358
Court maids who claim they saw ghosts...

836
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,729
vomit and convulse, then pass out.

837
01:02:54,598 --> 01:02:56,198
I believe they were poisoned.

838
01:02:58,939 --> 01:03:02,538
Those who saw ghosts were poisoned?

839
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:04,979
What did the ghost look like?

840
01:03:06,979 --> 01:03:09,878
It wore white, like the dead.

841
01:03:09,879 --> 01:03:11,519
I was too afraid to look any longer.

842
01:03:11,618 --> 01:03:14,589
I could see it even when I closed my eyes.

843
01:03:17,049 --> 01:03:18,959
They saw it even when their eyes were closed?

844
01:03:19,258 --> 01:03:23,089
Yet another court maid fainted after seeing a ghost today.

845
01:03:23,558 --> 01:03:25,499
She showed signs of glaucoma.

846
01:03:26,658 --> 01:03:29,669
I must see that ghost for myself.

847
01:03:33,138 --> 01:03:34,169
Right now?

848
01:03:35,408 --> 01:03:37,367
I must see the ghost for myself...

849
01:03:37,368 --> 01:03:39,308
to identify the cause of the outbreak.

850
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:42,178
That will help improve His Majesty's condition...

851
01:03:42,308 --> 01:03:43,878
and only then can you...

852
01:03:43,879 --> 01:03:45,779
Move to be closer to you.

853
01:03:48,419 --> 01:03:49,448
Yes.

854
01:03:55,828 --> 01:03:58,258
Come with me. To catch a ghost.

855
01:04:18,678 --> 01:04:19,979
It is a curse.

856
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:24,459
Cho Tae Hak's curse.

857
01:04:59,589 --> 01:05:02,788
This is where the court maids say they saw the ghost.

858
01:05:03,288 --> 01:05:05,898
Okay. If we look around, we might get to...

859
01:05:05,899 --> 01:05:07,928
see the ghost for ourselves.

860
01:05:11,069 --> 01:05:14,269
Is this not the smell of lilies?

861
01:05:15,908 --> 01:05:18,979
A lilies planted close to wells in the Palace?

862
01:05:19,238 --> 01:05:21,249
There really is a faint smell of lilies.

863
01:05:21,749 --> 01:05:24,419
I was too distracted to notice it earlier in the day.

864
01:05:27,149 --> 01:05:29,919
Where are the flowers?

865
01:05:47,538 --> 01:05:49,608
Your Highness!

866
01:05:49,609 --> 01:05:51,109
What is the matter?

867
01:05:53,738 --> 01:05:56,149
- Are you all right? - A ghost.

868
01:05:58,919 --> 01:06:00,518
What took you so long?

869
01:06:00,519 --> 01:06:02,589
You should have protected me!

870
01:06:07,689 --> 01:06:10,428
It went that way. The ghost.

871
01:06:21,138 --> 01:06:22,209
Your Highness.

872
01:06:30,308 --> 01:06:31,319
Your Highness.

873
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:02,279
Are you all right?

874
01:07:16,489 --> 01:07:19,159
How rude of you. What were you doing?

875
01:07:21,729 --> 01:07:23,498
You are the one who is being rude.

876
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:30,508
What?

877
01:07:50,088 --> 01:07:53,458
You and Her Highness the princess must be very close.

878
01:07:53,899 --> 01:07:55,369
Did Yoo Se Yeob bring you here?

879
01:07:55,729 --> 01:07:57,498
Did something happen between you two?

880
01:07:57,628 --> 01:07:59,998
Do you think the poison is spreading beyond the Palace?

881
01:08:00,468 --> 01:08:02,508
His Majesty's condition has worsened.

882
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:06,678
I will execute all who are plotting treason!

883
01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:11,718
The widow with terrible character.

884
01:08:12,178 --> 01:08:13,878
Will you return to Heuksan Island?

885
01:08:14,348 --> 01:08:15,418
Do not leave.

886
01:08:15,619 --> 01:08:17,149
I cannot part ways with you again.
