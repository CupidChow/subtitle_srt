00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:54,196
Why? You cannot do it?

5
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,965
You used to be called Divine Needle.

6
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:06,476
If you cannot administer acupuncture, you are no physician.

7
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:09,745
I...

8
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:13,315
no longer administer acupuncture.

9
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:19,384
Your laziness and misdiagnosis worsened a patient's condition,

10
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:20,816
leading her to suicide.

11
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:23,885
That alone is enough cause to investigate you.

12
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:25,625
It was not his fault.

13
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:31,195
Is it truly not a fault...

14
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:33,696
to blame everything on the heart and treat with words?

15

Do you really think so?

I...

17
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,816
no longer administer acupuncture.

18
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,056
You no longer do it?

19
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:00,565
The truth is, you cannot do it.

20

Your fine face is not looking good.

21

Hurry up and have some.

22
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:36,055
I am okay.

23
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:40,036
Why must you suffer like this in this small country town?

24
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:41,915
Let us go back to the Palace together.

25
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,566
That is where you belong.

26
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:45,635
Your Highness.

27
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:49,135
I do not wish to marry you.

28
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,716
Suit yourself.

29
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,816
We shall take this all the way and see who wins.

suicide note.

33
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:14,466
This is a suicide note?

34
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,805
You were dragged here because of this?

35
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:19,536
Yes.

36
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,045
You are awfully stubborn.

37
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:27,574
Just change your mind,

38
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,816
and I will make the inspectors leave at once.

39
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:31,445
Do not be so stubborn.

40
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:33,015
Come with me to Hanyang.

41
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,055
The investigation is not the problem.

42
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:37,656
My patient is on the verge of dying.

43
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:41,026
Hence, I cannot go anywhere.

44
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,264
You truly are...

45
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,436
Your Highness, we must get going.

46
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:50,166
You are such an upright, faithful man.

47
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,335
Just the right kind of man to marry a princess.

48
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:56,175
Do you not agree?

49
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:57,906
Yes, Your Highness.

50
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:02,216
Eat everything here and cheer up.

51
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:06,256
I will save you, so do not worry.

52
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,325
Eat up.

53
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:12,996
Your Highness!

54
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,864
Look, the sun is up now. They kept him here all night...

55
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:23,365
Oh, there he is. Hey!

56
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:27,805
My goodness. He looks haggard.

57
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:29,876
Physician Yoo.

58
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:33,675
You were only here for one night, but you look so weary.

59
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,346
Eat this.

60
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:38,286
Here.

61
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:41,315
I heard you were harshly interrogated by that inspector.

62
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:44,286
Gosh, that scoundrel. He is wrongfully accusing you.

63
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,355
Eat up.

64
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,826
You can clear your name once So Cheon wakes up.

65
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:51,565
Eat up, so you have the energy to fight.

66
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,935
I do not have time. I must hurry back to the clinic.

67
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,275
Goodness. Just eat it first, will you?

68
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:02,235
You can eat it as you are walking.

69
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:05,125
They kept him here all night. That scoundrel must pay for this!

70
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:11,315
Physician Gye.

71
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,855
Yes, she is doing much better.

72
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,815
We shall wait for her to wake up.

73
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:19,355
Perhaps, we should be glad...

74
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:21,155
that she is so deep asleep for she cannot scratch.

75
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,716
Finally, her skin is beginning to heal.

76
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,365
I wonder what happened to her.

77
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:30,706
Wake up soon and tell me what happened.

78
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:38,976
Here, drink up.

79
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:42,175
You look ill now.

80
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:44,985
No, I do not want this.

81
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:47,156
I cannot drink alcohol, and I am working now.

82
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:49,515
How could you tell the ill to drink alcohol?

83
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:52,055
I fooled you. It is honey herbal punch.

84
00:05:58,295 --> 00:05:59,295
You are right.

85
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:04,365
So Cheon will wake up soon.

86
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:07,906
You do not need to guard her like that all by yourself.

87
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:15,416
You came to the governor's office to pick me up this morning.

88
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:17,945
Are you that worried about me?

89
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,575
I suppose you feel like you cannot do anything without me.

90

What?

91
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:26,285

while I am running around to get things sorted out,

93
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:30,336
and it annoys me so much. Are we good now?

(Lady Eun Woo, Princess Seo Yi)

168
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,601
(Lady Eun Woo, Princess Seo Yi)

169
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,440
(Lady Eun Woo)

170
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,440
Go on.

171
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,280
- There you go. - Yes, there you go.

172
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,591
Let me think about it.

173
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:43,570
Do you truly have no intention of marrying me?

174
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,471
Just as you saved me, I wish to save you as well.

175
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:02,780
Lady Eun Woo.

176
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,491
Physician Yoo.

177
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,721
Take a look at this.

178
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,270
It is what Princess Seo Yi came to pass along.

179
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,761
Why did she want you to have this?

180
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:18,930
It is a romance novel she often reads.

181
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:20,641
Here.

182
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,780
What we thought was So Cheon's suicide note...

183
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,771
is, in fact, a paragraph from this story.

184
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,679
(An agonizing disease...)

185
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,450
"An agonizing disease where one feels bugs crawling over the skin."

186
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,751
"An illness that has physicians shun me."

187
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,780
An agonizing disease where one feels bugs crawling over the skin.

188
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,721
An illness that has physicians shun me.

189
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,660
If I cannot live as one with my love,

190
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:46,891
the illness will take over and I will live because I cannot die.

191
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:50,400
I will become one with the river and die because I cannot live.

192
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:54,940
These are the words of a lovesick person.

193
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,310
But someone deliberately...

194
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,381
The front half was cut off to make it seem like a suicide note.

195
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,481
You are right.

196
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:04,491
The suicide note was fabricated.

197
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,950
Who would do such a thing?

198
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,790
Could it be the inspector from the Medical Office?

199
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:15,591
("The Tale of Hong Soon")

200
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,101
It is not a suicide note.

201
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,670
It is a paragraph from "The Tale of Hong Soon."

202
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,600
So Cheon had transcribed a piece of it,

203
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,640
and someone cut off the first half to make it look like a suicide note.

204
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,680
Are you accusing an inspector of fabricating evidence?

205
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:37,711
I never implied such a thing.

206
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:39,721
Could it be your guilt talking?

207
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:44,166
The district governor already concluded his investigation.

208
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,449
When Lee So Cheon would have fallen into the water,

209
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,720
no one was around.

210
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,991
How could one know that?

211
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,789
Even though I brought you definitive evidence,

212
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,491
you choose to ignore the truth.

213
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,601
Even if it was not a suicide attempt,

214
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:57,971
the matter at hand is the same.

215
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:00,200
You did not treat her illness,

216
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,070
and that is the issue.

217
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,971
You are all talk.

218
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:08,180
A true physician...

219
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,680
would know how absurd...

220
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:12,351
his words sound.

221
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:14,721
If you did not fabricate the evidence,

222
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,150
then the next course of action should be to find who did.

223
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,830
Arrogant and negligent.

224
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,400
You are not a true physician...

225
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,300
nor a competent inspector.

226
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,309
Put it down.

227
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,971
This concerns the wellness of my patient,

228
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,940
so I will tend to her personally.

229
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,080
Is So Cheon feeling better?

230
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,450
Is she awake?

231
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,451
She soon will, so do not worry.

232
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:28,890
How was it for So Cheon at the paper mill?

233
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,231
Did the work take a toll on her?

234
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,231
The work is hard for anyone here.

235
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,661
It is why we look out for each other like family.

236
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,401
So Cheon was cherished by everyone.

237
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,941
We were fond of her as well.

238
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:45,511
Absolutely. She is a sweetheart.

239
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,441
She is an angel who always lends a hand.

240
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,510
Who here...

241
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:56,221
found her suicide note?

242
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:58,790
I took it to the governor's office.

243
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,290
That morning, after she left the paper mill,

244
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,630
I found it on So Cheon's desk.

245
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,701
I see.

246
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,530
She often mentioned how she wanted to go into the river.

247
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:15,671
The river?

248
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:18,011
Yes.

249
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,411
Bathing in cold water helped soothe her itchy skin.

250
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,451
She said...

251
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,451
she wanted to stay there.

252
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,570
Yoo Se Yeob, I am present.

253
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,151
Princess Seo Yi, the book you brought over...

254
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:02,221
I know.

255
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:04,921
The gratitude has rendered you speechless.

256
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,991
Yes. I am sure So Cheon will also be grateful.

257
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:12,559
Of course. In return, what will you...

258
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,130
Please enjoy your visit, then.

259
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,530
I have more patients to see.

260
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Kid, do that over there.

261
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,991
But this is Jang Gun's spot.

262
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:46,590
Physician Gye said I could work here.

263
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:50,060
Did you disobey a princess' order?

264
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:54,400
Your Highness, why did you choose to sit here...

265
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:55,970
when it is crowded?

266
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,710
Are you not aware of how important I am?

267
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:01,540
Your Highness, how about you read this instead?

268
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,050
Maybe I should.

269
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,951
Boy, reading books like this...

270
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,721
is how you learn of the intricate emotions of love.

271
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:14,790
Love?

272
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:22,130
I will return it after reading it thoroughly.

273
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:25,100
Goodness. Can you actually read?

274
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,740
Your Highness, Jang Gun is a genius.

275
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:28,839
He can even read medical texts.

276
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,470
Goodness, is that so? You sweet boy.

277
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,470
Get over here. You are an adorable one.

278
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:35,180
These look delicious.

279
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,941
Jang Gun, here you go.

280
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,880
Here.

281
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,850
What do you think?

282
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,360
To quote Physician Gye,

283
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,600
it tastes like paradise.

284
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:03,001
That is what Father says when he drinks.

285
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,870
As if it would come close.

286
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:09,340
What do you say? Would you like one?

287
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
Crispy on the outside...

288
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,451
but chewy on the inside.

289
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,951
It was grilled to perfection.

290
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,691
I am a noble princess.

291
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,360
I do not eat snacks enjoyed by lowborns.

292
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,161
Unbelievable.

293
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,501
Then,

294
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,471
may I have one instead?

295
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,671
Go ahead. Here you go.

296
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,570
- Here is the dip. - All right.

297
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,820
(Paradise)

298
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,461
This is just...

299
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:01,330
It is sweet, salty,

300
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:03,461
and doubly savory.

301
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,730
It is so delicious.

302
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:07,741
Right?

303
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,840
Well, if you insist,

304
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,640
I will taste it for you.

305
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,170
Will you?

306
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,711
Your Highness, you must eat this.

307
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:20,451
Fresh garlic will make you human.

308
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,550
Granny.

309
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,350
What was that about?

310
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:27,491
Was she saying I am a bear?

311
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,460
Court Lady Jung. Throw this all out immediately!

312
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,290
Yes, Your Highness.

313
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,100
- This? - Yes.

314
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,761
Do not be so angry.

315
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
What do you think?

316
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,171
Should I still throw it all away?

317
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,379
- I guess we must. - Throw it all away.

318
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,380
No.

319
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,080
If you throw it all away, what about the rice cakes?

320
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,820
Dip it in this.

321
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,430
You can eat just fine.

322
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:08,501
It is not too bad.

323
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,911
Why did she paint all the pages?

324
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,441
Why would she cover up all she had written?

325
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:26,310
You are still up.

326
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
Yes.

327
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,050
Eat this. It is warm.

328
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,221
It is warm.

329
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,599
You have a lot on your mind.

330
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
What is it?

331
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Is it about me?

332
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:50,441
Yes.

333
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:53,941
So Cheon, your patient.

334
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,441
I just do not get it.

335
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,580
Why would she paint over what she had written?

336
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,951
Did she not like what she had written?

337
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,231
Oh, that could be possible. She is a writer.

338
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,161
She was such a good, hard-working girl.

339
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:16,701
Yes.

340
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,770
All her friends I met at the paper mill earlier today...

341
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:21,869
liked her a lot...

342
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,701
and were worried about her.

343
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:29,040
So Cheon said she would write for herself.

344
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,651
That she would pluck up the courage.

345
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,521
I have no idea why she had a change of heart.

346
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,491
Something only she can see.

347
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,330
She wrote for herself.

348
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:51,771
A diary.

349
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
This is a diary.

350
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,250
How can we see what she wrote...

351
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:08,620
when she covered it all?

352
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,059
What is it, Jang Gun?

353
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,271
Did you have a bad dream?

354
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,771
Her Highness...

355
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,570
Her Highness...

356
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
Her Highness?

357
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,340
Did she scold you too?

358
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,780
"They came to the house today."

359
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,050
"I am so afraid."

360
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,690
"Such hatred for someone."

361
00:24:47,691 --> 00:24:49,589
Such hatred for someone.

362
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,059
"Where does it come from?"

363
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,290
Where does it come from?

364
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,530
"I am afraid."

365
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,060
I am afraid.

366
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:06,610
"Reading books like this..."

367
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:09,640
"is how you learn of the intricate emotions of love."

368
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:12,911
She said that to me so sweetly...

369
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,350
and gave me this scary book.

370
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,251
The contents are so scary.

371
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:22,820
It... It is haunting me.

372
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,630
It is okay.

373
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:34,370
I will help you go to sleep.

374
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,569
(Even in the water I brought to drink...)

375
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,300
(They tormented me...)

376
00:26:10,441 --> 00:26:12,870
Physician Yoo, it is So Cheon's writing.

377
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:17,241
The cover is the same as the one she painted over.

378
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,550
They are both her diaries.

379
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,850
Someone painted over the pages to hide the contents.

380
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:29,890
Why did the person not do that to this one?

381
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,691
What is even stranger is...

382
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,100
why did the Princess have this intact diary?

383
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,130
I wonder as well.

384
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:40,300
I cannot ask her.

385
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:45,710
Oh, do not worry. I will do that.

386
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:47,911
No. I will ask her.

387
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:58,050
It is not because I wish to see the Princess.

388
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:01,161
She might be rude to you...

389
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,431
No, you cannot go.

390
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,231
I would rather suffer that than let you see her.

391
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:11,830
Do not stop me.

392
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
I will ask her.

393
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,460
Darn it. Why did she call me out to the countryside?

394
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,201
Please calm down, Your Highness.

395
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,901
Your Highness.

396
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:48,370
You are here already?

397
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,470
You dared not only to bring me out here,

398
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,511
but you made me wait?

399
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:21,171
- You moved on purpose! - Your Highness.

400
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,200
I apologize, my lady.

401
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,139
She slipped by mistake and...

402
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,309
What are you saying?

403
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,280
A princess does not make mistakes.

404
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:31,550
You were late.

405
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,120
I was not late. You got here early.

406
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:39,521
You were not here before me, and that makes you late.

407
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:42,360
Anyway, why did you want to see me?

408
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,060
It is as I said in the letter.

409
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,431
I want to ask you something.

410
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,971
You know this book, right?

411
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,140
Yes. So what?

412
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:59,340
I would like to know how you came to have it.

413
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,011
Why should I be kind enough to tell you that?

414
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:07,580
Because you care for...

415
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:09,850
Physician Yoo.

416
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,349
If you tell us about this book,

417
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,790
it will help avoid the inspection that is troubling him.

418
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,261
I will be the one to help him, not you!

419
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:24,401
I could send the inspector right back immediately.

420
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,839
I bet you heard I got him a copy of "The Tale of Hong Soon"...

421
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,960
to explain the suicide note.

422
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,610
Yes. So please, tell me what you know.

423
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,140
- It is simply... - Court Lady Jung!

424
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,120
If I tell you that,

425
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:45,550
what will you do for me?

426
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:56,630
Make me a promise.

427
00:29:58,201 --> 00:29:59,701
What that promise is,

428
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:01,570
I will tell you later.

429
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,210
Lady Eun Woo, what did the Princess say?

430
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,451
Come with me. You will find out.

431
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:25,661
Well... So Cheon refused to give me the next book.

432
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,000
Book seven of "The Story of So Cheon?"

433
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,060
The newest one?

434
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Yes, my lady.

435
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,530
But no one was at home.

436
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:38,040
So many people were hounding me for the next book.

437
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:42,911
So I took whatever I could find to copy to hand out instead.

438
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,481
When was that?

439
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:47,511
A few days ago?

440
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,951
That means the book you had put aside to copy...

441
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,620
ended up in the Princess' hands when she was borrowing other books.

442
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:59,691
Yes, that is correct!

443
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,600
What So Cheon wanted to say...

444
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,810
Finally, we can hear her story.

445
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,780
So Cheon woke up!

446
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,021
So Cheon, you woke up.

447
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:26,090
Physician Yoo.

448
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:29,060
Be careful.

449
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,261
I am sorry.

450
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,731
What do you mean?

451
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,901
You went through so much.

452
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,040
Here, you wrote "they."

453
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,280
Who are "they?"

454
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,961

No!

- How filthy. - Look at that.

463

Physician Yoo.

464
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,401
Could you please just turn a blind eye to this?

465
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:47,431
I am so scared.

466
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:52,570
If I tell people about this, they will make me suffer even more.

467
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:03,820
I will help you.

Let me...

471
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:28,510
do something for you too.

472
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:33,850
To tell you the truth,

473
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:36,220
I, too, went through a lot...

474
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:38,521
in the past year or so.

("The Story of So Cheon," Volume 2)

476
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:52,031
The story you wrote...

477
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,140
deeply comforted me.

478
00:33:57,341 --> 00:34:00,870
This time, I wish to help you.

479
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,560
We will protect you until the end.

480
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:19,830
So trust us...

481
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,830
No.

482
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,231
Can you try to trust yourself?

483
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,450
You, quit the inspection and go back to Hanyang at once!

484
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,720
Then what about your goal, Your Highness?

485
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,890
I believe I can achieve it on my own.

486
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,290
I will figure out a way to win Yoo Se Yeob's heart.

487
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,159
So do not mistreat him!

488
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,071
Who are you to give him a score?

489
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,460
I am afraid I cannot return to Hanyang now, Your Highness.

490
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:09,211
What? Have you forgotten our promise?

491
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:11,580
No, it seems like you have forgotten all about it.

492
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:14,051
We are already in the same boat.

493
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:17,551
And I have already told His Majesty that I was inspecting Gyesoo Clinic.

494
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,821
We cannot take this back.

495
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:22,191
And I refuse to return to Hanyang like this.

496
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,671
So you will go against my orders and carry out the inspection?

497
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,600
Yes,

for I ought to obey His Majesty's orders.

499
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:02,131
So Cheon did not try to take her own life.

500
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:13,470
I will summon Lee So Cheon and ask her directly.

501
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:14,771
Step aside.

502
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,051
You will drag her away when she just regained her consciousness?

503
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:25,350
You are no different from those who made her like this.

504
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,460
Did you not come here to carry out a fair, transparent investigation?

505
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:31,861
That is why I wish to summon and question her.

506
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,830
No, you cannot take her.

507
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:39,031
As a psychiatrist,

508
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,000
I will help So Cheon so she can recover on her own.

509
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,271
If I fail,

510
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,571
I will give up everything.

511
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,010
What?

512
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,481
Then will you quit being a physician too?

513
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,191
If that is the case, sure.

514
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,390
If that is necessary...

515
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:06,461
Fine.

516
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:09,631
I am more than willing to do that.

So trust us...

520

Can you try to trust yourself?

There.

00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,660
Stop stealing the fritters.

We will have nothing left!

- My goodness. - You fool.

Look, how could anyone resist this delicious smell?

526
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:24,401
Even straw shoes would be delicious when deep-fried.

527
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,710
- Crispy and crunchy. - You will eat shoes at this rate.

00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:28,781
Here.

529

Oh, dear.

530

Hey, straw shoes would taste better.

531

532
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,990
Gosh.

533
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:42,920
Anyway, what is Physician Yoo planning?

534
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,190
Why did he tell us to cook a feast so early?

535
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:46,489
No idea.

536
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:52,071
He and Lady Seo have been whispering to each other all day.

537

- What? - Really?

538
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:08,281
I found Gye Ji Han's treasure!

539
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:20,490
It is ginseng wine.

540
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,060
Gye Ji Han has been saving this for almost 30 years.

They are everywhere. They truly get on my nerves.

545

And that... What was his name?

546
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,559
You know, that obnoxious jerk.

547
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,720
That man... That inspector.

548
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,989
He followed the Princess here...

549
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,789
to snoop around, calling himself an inspector.

550
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,360
How could a man do such a thing?

551

- Do you not agree with me? - I do, sir.

In any case,

556
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,810
I heard you had to reinvestigate the case.

557
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:16,349
Just for formality's sake.

Is there a lady here who can read?

00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,228
No...

666
00:46:18,628 --> 00:46:19,628
Oh, no.

667
00:46:20,398 --> 00:46:21,398
No.

668
00:46:22,228 --> 00:46:23,228
Look at her.

669
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:30,409
No.

670
00:46:37,648 --> 00:46:38,648
No...

671
00:46:44,188 --> 00:46:45,188
What a joke.

672
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:54,829
"Help!"

673
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:56,469
"Help me."

674
00:46:56,869 --> 00:46:57,869
"Help me!"

675
00:46:58,469 --> 00:46:59,798
"Help!"

676
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:02,508
My goodness.

677
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:05,509
It is a cruel beast in disguise!

678
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:09,107
Not even the wrath of the sky is enough punishment for her.

679
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:10,108
You wicked witch!

680
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:11,708
- It is her. - Yes, her!

681
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:14,648
- How dare she. - How wicked of her.

682
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:17,989
She should be punished!

683
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:21,788
It is only because your storytelling was compelling.

684
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:22,989
- Do not fret. - Unbelievable.

685
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:28,829
All right, let us all calm down.

686
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,369
These are only made-up stories.

687
00:47:34,898 --> 00:47:36,337
Come on!

688
00:47:36,338 --> 00:47:39,777
Why would you stop telling it when it was just getting fun?

689
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:42,348
You even had us pay, did you not?

690
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:45,547
A story-reader should come up with a way to tell the story better!

691
00:47:45,548 --> 00:47:46,777
- Exactly. - Of course.

692
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:47,778
That is it.

693
00:47:48,478 --> 00:47:50,849
There is a way to make the story more appealing.

694
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:53,317
- What? - How?

695
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:54,318
Who wishes to join me?

696
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:55,928
- Here. - Me.

697
00:47:55,929 --> 00:47:57,288
- Me. - Me!

698
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:58,929
Come on over.

699
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:00,159
All right.

700
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:02,429
- Here you go. - What is going on?

701
00:48:03,398 --> 00:48:04,398
Goodness.

702
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:08,038
How about we reenact the story?

703
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:09,837
- What? - What a great idea!

704
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:12,708
That sounds like fun.

705
00:48:15,378 --> 00:48:16,378
Here.

706
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:17,648
Once you do this,

707
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,119
it will be over.

708
00:48:37,398 --> 00:48:38,398
Fill it up.

709
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,108
- Hey. - As if you are good enough.

710
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:52,818
Why are you doing this?

711
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:55,448
Please stop. Whatever it is, I am sorry.

712
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:56,619
Scatter it over her.

713
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:00,917
- You now look pretty. - There you go.

714
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:02,428
- You should become pretty. - Let this cleanse you.

715
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:03,688
This is the look for you.

716
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:05,558
Please stop.

717
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:07,457
- Look. - Oh, dear.

718
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:09,628
- How funny is that? - Please stop.

719
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,179
Look!

720
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:47,099
Now,

721
00:49:48,269 --> 00:49:49,608
it's your turn.

722
00:49:51,668 --> 00:49:54,438
My gosh. You will rot for that.

723
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:58,777
You are a beast parading as a human!

724

- Darn you! - Goodness.

725
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:02,019
I did not do that!

726
00:50:02,148 --> 00:50:04,489
It is all a lie! They are lies!

727
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:09,389
- What is she doing? - What is the matter?

728
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:18,728
What is it?

729
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,398
It is just a story.

730
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,318
I will help you. All of us will help you.

731
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:41,489
We will be by your side.

732
00:50:59,338 --> 00:51:00,679
Could you believe us?

733
00:51:01,909 --> 00:51:02,909
No.

734
00:51:03,748 --> 00:51:05,708
Could you believe yourself?

735
00:51:26,068 --> 00:51:27,269
It is not just a story.

736
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:29,739
This actually happened.

737
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:33,639
- What is she saying? - What is going on?

738
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,748
I did not try to kill myself.

739
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,278
Jung Soon...

740
00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:46,159
pushed me into the river.

741
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:49,429
- My goodness. - Oh, dear.

742
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:51,759
Is that true?

743
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:54,228
You are lying.

744
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,168
You said you found the suicide note that morning.

745
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:06,988
I took it to the governor's office that morning.

746
00:52:07,378 --> 00:52:10,748
That morning, after she left the paper mill,

747
00:52:12,878 --> 00:52:14,579
I found it on So Cheon's desk.

748
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:18,219
The official said they got the suicide note in the evening.

749
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:22,728
You waited until So Cheon was found in the river.

750
00:52:23,528 --> 00:52:25,358
Because you had work to do in the meanwhile.

751

(I have become one with my illness and live because I cannot die.)

753
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:45,849
You cut out part of a book So Cheon had copied...

754
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:47,849
to make the suicide note.

755
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:57,259
Your Highness, you did a great deed.

756
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:02,798
Put her in a cell immediately.

757
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:10,469
This is a misunderstanding!

758
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:13,108
- My gosh. - This is unfair!

759
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:16,247
- Good riddance. - You had it coming.

760

Oh, dear...

761
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:54,318
It is okay.

762
00:53:58,489 --> 00:53:59,519
It is okay.

763
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,358
I am sorry.

764
00:54:22,338 --> 00:54:23,409
It is okay.

765
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:27,019
You will be okay now.

Goodness.

You call this a treatment?

So Cheon will recover.

any method or antic can help.

773
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:04,648
That is my diagnosis and treatment.

774
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,239
Will that pose a problem with the inspection as well?

775

You, Frog.

776
00:55:14,628 --> 00:55:17,329
Are you wondering what to complain about now?

777
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:21,469
Have you ever had a patient thank you sincerely?

778
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:23,369
Well?

779

Sure.

- Hello. - It is good to see you.

784
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:37,219

00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,028
- I enjoyed that. - Let us go.

789
00:55:52,898 --> 00:55:54,739
You are summoned back to Hanyang.

799

I have already heard...

800
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:44,748
what a stupid thing you did.

But if it were to bring me the prey,

How many people did you say are willing to copy the books?

821

00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:45,138
You are too slow.

832
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:46,977
I will pull that for you.

833
00:58:46,978 --> 00:58:49,539
Gosh, can you be any slower?

834
00:58:50,548 --> 00:58:52,409
Wow, look at all that rice.

835
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:55,878
There is so much.

(Gyesoo Clinic, Palace-affiliated)

837
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:07,798
Why did no one offer to catch me?

838
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:14,838
Gosh, this is what it means to be affiliated.

839
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:17,838
It looks so fancy.

840
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:21,309
Physician Gye must be so proud.

841
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:23,079
A bit?

842
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,747
I will make some clothes with the silk we got.

843
00:59:27,748 --> 00:59:29,095
Granny, I will make you something.

844
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,289
No way.

845
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:32,748
In your wildest dreams.

846
00:59:33,088 --> 00:59:36,288
I will exchange all that silk for medicinal herbs.

847
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:37,659
No, why?

848
00:59:40,298 --> 00:59:42,858
They owe this to me, and they left me out?

849
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:54,509
What? She is a widow, is she not?

850
00:59:55,378 --> 00:59:56,748
What is she doing?

851
00:59:57,849 --> 00:59:59,809
What kind of relationship do you think they have?

852
01:00:00,918 --> 01:00:01,918
Well...

853
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:04,789
The way they are looking at each other...

854
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:06,958
They seem to fancy each other.

("The Story of So Cheon," Volume 1)

856
01:00:59,878 --> 01:01:03,039
The past year was difficult for me to endure as well...

857
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:09,579
for I terribly missed someone.

858
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:17,858
You said this book comforted you...

859
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:20,659
and promised to tell me the story in your voice,

860
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:24,329
so I patiently waited without starting the book at all.

861
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:28,798
Well...

862
01:01:29,369 --> 01:01:31,089
Would you like me to start with Volume One?

863
01:01:31,509 --> 01:01:34,409
Of course. Take your time and read the entire series to me.

864
01:01:36,338 --> 01:01:38,048
There are seven more books in the series.

865
01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:40,148
The day is too short.

866
01:01:40,978 --> 01:01:42,119
Why is that a problem?

867
01:01:42,378 --> 01:01:43,688
We have many days ahead of us.

868
01:01:44,019 --> 01:01:45,889
If you could read them to me every evening...

869
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:50,059
It would be nice.

870
01:01:56,869 --> 01:02:00,338
You will be a little embarrassed.

871
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:02,769
Why is that?

872
01:02:03,509 --> 01:02:04,608
One of the characters...

873
01:02:05,438 --> 01:02:07,679
is a man who shares the same name as you.

874
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:10,148
Okay, so?

875
01:02:10,648 --> 01:02:11,648
Well...

876
01:02:13,418 --> 01:02:14,548
He is like...

877
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:16,378
the epitome of romance.

878
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:20,019
It is a love story that will make your heart flutter.

879
01:02:21,259 --> 01:02:22,259
I see.

880
01:02:23,389 --> 01:02:24,389
Even better.

881
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,159
Then go ahead and read the story to me.

882
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:31,798
Okay.

883
01:03:31,088 --> 01:03:32,088
Gosh!

884
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,599
She is here again. I wish I could kick her.

885
01:03:36,929 --> 01:03:38,969
What? What did you say?

886
01:03:39,228 --> 01:03:42,168
I said I had several new doors waiting to be used, Your Highness.

887
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:45,938
Do you not think you should govern your district better?

888
01:03:46,438 --> 01:03:47,509
Pardon? What do you mean?

889
01:03:47,938 --> 01:03:50,978
A widow is out and about, going everywhere she wants to!

890
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,547
While I am here,

891
01:03:53,548 --> 01:03:56,818
you ought to make sure every villager obeys the rules.

892
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:00,489
Yes, Your Highness. I wholeheartedly agree...

893
01:04:03,429 --> 01:04:04,429
All right.

894
01:04:04,528 --> 01:04:05,528
Bye.

895
01:04:29,778 --> 01:04:30,789
My gosh.

896
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,748
What is the matter, Your Highness?

897
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:35,318
What...

898
01:04:35,759 --> 01:04:36,759
Your Highness.

899
01:04:41,228 --> 01:04:42,358
Your Highness.

900
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:48,937
Lady Eun Woo is not here.

901
01:04:48,938 --> 01:04:51,168
Court Lady Jung came and took her.

902
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:53,539
Court Lady Jung? Where did they go?

903
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:55,239
I do not know.

904
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:04,519
Why did Your Highness wish to see me at this late hour?

905
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:09,318
As you know, you and I have some unfinished business.

906
01:05:11,588 --> 01:05:13,708
Unfinished business? What do you mean, Your Highness?

907
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:22,639
That promise you made. I will now tell you what I want.

908
01:05:23,539 --> 01:05:24,539
Promise?

909
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,608
Make me a promise.

910
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:29,679
Oh, right.

911
01:05:30,349 --> 01:05:31,349
Yes.

912
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:34,278
Sure, what is it that you want?

913
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:39,248
What I want is...

914
01:05:41,219 --> 01:05:42,219
the heart.

915
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:44,458
Yoo Se Yeob's... No.

916
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:47,159
Yoo Se Poong's heart.

917
01:05:51,568 --> 01:05:52,628
I want...

918
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:54,739
his heart.

919
01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:30,707
Do you think that the Princess has a psychiatric condition?

920
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:33,069
Excessive anger.

921
01:06:33,538 --> 01:06:36,258
She must be crazy, or she would not break down the doors every time.

922
01:06:37,009 --> 01:06:39,309
I am here to protect Her Highness the Princess.

923
01:06:39,609 --> 01:06:41,289
I would never lay a glance on such a jerk.

924
01:06:42,219 --> 01:06:43,418
I am not sick.

925
01:06:43,618 --> 01:06:45,488
So you were using me all this time?

926
01:06:45,788 --> 01:06:46,788
We need some kind of...

927
01:06:47,658 --> 01:06:49,189
special training.

928
01:06:49,889 --> 01:06:51,529
Is everyone ready?

929
01:06:52,029 --> 01:06:53,029
Yes, I am ready.

930
01:06:53,729 --> 01:06:54,969
- We are ready. - We are ready.
