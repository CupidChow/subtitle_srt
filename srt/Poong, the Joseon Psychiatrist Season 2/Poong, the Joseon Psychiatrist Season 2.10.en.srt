I still tremble at the thought.

Yes.

you ousted such a competent physician...

get in the way of me looking after the people.

Yes, Your Majesty.

The governor of the village, Ahn Hak Soo,

134
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:12,448
submitted an appeal, making a false accusation against Yoo Se Yeob.

135
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:14,958
Then to deceive everyone into believing it was true,

136
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,529
he threatened a woman to seduce Yoo Se Yeob.

137
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,759
But things did not go according to his plan,

138
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:23,198
so he murdered that woman.

139
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:30,708
How come...

140
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,438
you know so much about this incident?

00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,649
I am...

142
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,678
ashamed to say this, but I helped him submit the fake appeal.

143
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:44,989
Such lowborn rats deserve to die.

144
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:47,119
She died because she deserved it.

145
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:48,389
Because of us,

146
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:50,188
someone died.

147
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,659
We should keep pretending not to know about it.

148
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:54,928
You see, it is always the weaklings...

149
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:57,169
who end up getting punished.

150
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,399
And frankly, I did not do anything wrong.

151
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,269
That woman lost her life. We must atone for our sins.

152
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:03,169
I will confess everything to His Majesty...

153
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,639
and gladly accept my punishment.

154
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:08,539
Ahn Hak Soo shall be beheaded for the murder he committed.

155
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,708
As for the former physician, Jeon Kang Il...

156
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,519
Since he contributed to the investigation,

157

00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:35,799
I can count on you now that I have you by my side.

172
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:38,568
I know you have been under a lot of stress.

173
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:41,369
I apologize for always causing you concern.

174
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:45,608
This is all because you are not married yet.

175
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:50,009
No, do not just chuckle.

176
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,549
You need to start taking this matter seriously.

177
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:54,818
I will find an eligible young lady for you.

178
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:56,718
There is...

179
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,588
someone I love.

180
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:02,159
No, not her.

181
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,759
You know what you had to go through.

182
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:08,029
You still wish to marry a widow?

183
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:10,698
I cannot let it happen.

184
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,299
Your Majesty.

185
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,698
I have a favor to ask of you.

186
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:18,108
- Se Yeob. - Your Majesty.

187
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,608
She is a talented physician.

188
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,549
Please allow the Medical Office to benefit from her skills.

189
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:25,379
I implore Your Majesty...

190
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,678
to hire her and protect her.

191
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:29,848
What do you mean?

192
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,389
If you and that female physician are seen together,

193
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,058
those in the royal court will attack the two of you again.

194
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:37,659
As soon as the restructuring of the Medical Office is completed,

195
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:40,228
I will return to Sorak Village.

196
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,769
You say you love her.

197
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:47,098
Yet you will be okay even if you two are not together?

198
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:49,098
Yes.

199
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,909
As long as she is safe,

200
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:53,639
happy,

201
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:55,938
and can grow as a physician.

202
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,848
It will be my biggest joy.

203
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,428
Lady Eun Woo.

204
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:14,399
- Physician Yoo. - My gosh, Young Master!

205
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:15,399
Physician Yoo!

206
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,129
How long has it been?

207
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,039
You look even more handsome now.

208
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,039
Yes.

209
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:29,578
What are these?

210
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,648
I made them myself...

211
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:34,118
while preparing for the medical exam.

212
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,289
You organized everything so perfectly.

213
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:48,158
You should open an exam-prep school in Hanyang.

214
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,628
Be my first student to pass the exam.

215
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:57,269
Learning from me is not enough for you.

216
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,009
You should go out into the bigger world...

217
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:02,479
and learn more advanced skills.

218
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:05,848
Take the medical exam.

219
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:09,279
I have completely left the Medical Office.

220
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,489
It is your turn to work there.

221
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,489
Physician Yoo.

222
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,429
Am I...

223
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:19,259
burdening you?

224
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,229
No, it is not that.

225
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,098
Leaving you...

226
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,269
and learning advanced skills in a bigger world...

227
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,539
It is surely fascinating.

228
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:32,939
However...

229
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:38,148
My heart feels empty for some reason.

230
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:43,549
Lady Eun Woo, you are very special.

231
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:48,259
And you are special as a physician too.

232
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:52,358
You saved me before you became a physician.

233
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:54,158
And you will go on...

234
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,499
to save more lives.

235
00:18:57,328 --> 00:18:58,328
Is that why...

236
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:03,209
you always throw such difficult challenges at me?

237
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:07,408
Because you are the only one who can do it.

238
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,019
The emptiness you feel in your heart at the moment...

239
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:16,449
will be filled...

240
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:19,348
with warmth with time.

241
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:21,719
That is...

242
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:24,558
what I hope for.

243
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,229
(Geunjeongjeon)

244
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:00,199
You have been appointed as a physician of the Medical Office...

245
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,269
who will provide service at the Royal Maternity Directorate.

246
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:10,969
You received a full score on the screening test.

247
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:14,338
Her Majesty the Queen is pregnant,

248
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,348
but the Medical Office suspects gestosis.

249
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:18,449
(Jaganjeung: Gestosis)

250
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:20,749
Take good care of the Queen...

251
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:22,949
until the baby is born.

252
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:24,888
Yes, Your Majesty.

253
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,558
I will serve her with all my might.

254
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:34,658
Lady Eun Woo!

255
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:41,439
Physician Yoo.

256
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:45,509
I do not understand what is happening.

257
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,539
His Majesty summoned me in urgency.

258
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,078
Do you know what for?

259
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:52,378
Her Majesty the Queen is pregnant.

260
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:55,779
That is a blessing within the royal court.

261
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:57,818
Could there be a problem?

262
00:20:58,418 --> 00:21:01,558
The Medical Office suspects gestosis.

263
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,189
One must be careful during their first pregnancy.

264
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:07,658
You should head to him.

265
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:09,299
His Majesty is obviously concerned.

266
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:12,729
Okay. I should probably stay at the Medical Office...

267
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,199
until the baby is born.

268
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,469
Of course. I will also be of aid.

269
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:21,878
Right.

270
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:27,249
His Majesty has another fever which was caused by an infection.

271
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:30,318
Him frequently falling ill has me worried.

272
00:21:30,318 --> 00:21:32,249
Why not brew deer antlers to protect his body...

273
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:34,358
and prescribe sinyisan for his symptoms?

274
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:35,759
Sinyisan?

275
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,789
(Sinyisan: Sinus cold medicine made from magnolia buds)

276
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:38,588
His Majesty often suffers...

277
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,058
from the occlusion of the nares,

278
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:43,029
and the infection then progresses to a fever.

279
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,029
His fever should be treated,

280
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:47,838
but his energy must also be restored.

281
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:51,269
Then let us treat him per Physician Seo's suggestion.

282
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:55,078
I also believe we must go above and beyond a fever remedy.

283
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:14,158
I am worried since this is my first pregnancy,

284
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:16,358
and the talk of gestosis concerns me even more.

285
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,568
And then they are saying that my baby could be upside down.

286
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:20,568
(Yeoksan: Breech position)

287
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:23,068
All day long, all I do is worry.

288
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:26,108
Your Highness, please do not be concerned.

289
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:28,338
Worrying is not good for the baby.

290
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:31,979
Have you seen a baby in this position before?

291
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,088
Yes.

292
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,719
There was a patient who suffered all night...

293
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:45,058
not being able to give birth to a baby in breech position.

294
00:22:45,158 --> 00:22:48,429
She was half a day late to receive medical care.

295
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,898
So, what happened to her?

296
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:53,269
Did the baby and mother both live?

297
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:56,338
Yes, she gave birth to a healthy baby,

298
00:22:56,338 --> 00:22:59,039
and they are still doing well.

299
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:02,039
It is why I ask that you be less scared.

300
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:05,709
Someone I know once said...

301
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,818
that worrying...

302
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,618
leads to success.

303
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,719
Failures...

304
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:14,918
stem from not worrying about your situation.

305
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:16,989
Are those the words of Physician Yoo Se Yeob?

306
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:19,729
How did you know that?

307
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:22,598
You two are clearly compatible...

308
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:25,868
which makes it even sadder.

309
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,368
It is all right, Your Highness.

310
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:32,408
Life led me down the road...

311
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:34,679
of a heartbroken young widow,

312
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,779
but it also led me to great people...

313
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,878
who helped me become a life-saving physician.

314
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:43,648
And here I am, helping those in need.

315
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:47,558
It would be a blessing to be a mother,

316
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:50,789
but treating patients by being able to consider them...

317
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:53,558
as my own children and family...

318
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,328
is also a blessing as a physician.

319
00:23:57,898 --> 00:24:00,439
I will also care for you...

320
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,838
as if you were my family, so please do not worry.

321
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,608
I am grateful.

322
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:45,709
What are you doing in here all by yourself?

323
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:48,949
I was hoping to sneak away after leaving it behind.

324
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:51,749
But I would have known who left it.

325
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,759
Please open it after I leave.

326
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:03,429
I...

327
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:07,638
I would like to open it right now.

328
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:17,249
This...

329
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:20,019
This is a clock.

330
00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:24,648
I am curious as to why you gave it to me.

331
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,789
Right.

332
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,259
Well, I received my first salary.

333
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,358
Your first salary?

334
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:35,158
Yes.

335
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:39,429
I wanted to get you something meaningful.

336
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:46,308
It is still hard to see where life will take us,

337
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,539
but I wish for us to find our way someday.

338
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:54,019
Also, I wished for us to always be together.

339
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:57,318
It is why I am giving you a clock that symbolizes time.

340
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,999
I will cherish it forever.

341
00:26:09,358 --> 00:26:10,898
My time with you...

342
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:13,338
and also this clock.

343
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,495
What? Her Majesty the Queen?

344
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:12,235
Labor dystocia?

345
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:14,535
I must see how she is.

346
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,825
Edema suggested that the baby would be in breech position...

347
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:36,384
and gestosis was of concern.

348
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:38,424
Moxibustion was performed on pressure points...

349
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,854
and medication was prescribed.

350
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:42,894
You were right.

351
00:27:43,124 --> 00:27:45,065
The breech position of the baby has brought on protracted labor.

352
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,904
Give her choisengsungyieum and heukseomtang.

353
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:49,134
- Hurry. - Yes, Physician Yoo.

354
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,805
Your Highness, please hang in there.

00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:49,025

Your Highness. Are you all right?

370
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:58,095
- Is that choisengsungyieum? - Yes.

371
00:29:58,295 --> 00:29:59,295
Pass it to Physician Seo.

372
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:01,164
Thank you.

Your Highness. Stay strong and push.

375

You can do it, Your Highness.

376

A bit more.

Your Highness. You have a son.

379
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:08,434
Good.

380
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,255
You did well.

381
00:31:34,964 --> 00:31:36,394
You did very well.

382
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:55,985
Your Highness. You will be just fine...

383
00:31:55,985 --> 00:31:57,414
if you look after yourself.

384
00:31:57,954 --> 00:31:59,154
You did very well.

385
00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:00,884
As a woman,

386
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:03,454
how did you master such great medicine?

387
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:07,495
I learned everything from the Head Royal Physician.

388
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:10,464
She learned everything on her own.

389
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:14,164
All I did was watch and encourage.

390
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:17,835
Your Majesty.

391
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:20,444
Physician Seo is a widow,

392
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:23,444
so she can never have a child of her own.

393
00:32:24,015 --> 00:32:26,214
So she thought of her patients as her children...

394
00:32:26,214 --> 00:32:29,684
and focused on mastering obstetrics and pediatrics.

395
00:32:30,345 --> 00:32:32,515
That is how she was able to save both me and our son.

396
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:35,555
Is that not heartbreaking?

397
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:37,394
So I would...

398
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:39,154
like to ask a favor.

399
00:32:43,265 --> 00:32:46,835
If you were to restore Physician Seo's status to that...

400
00:32:47,535 --> 00:32:49,864
of an unwed woman and give her an appropriate title,

401
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,775
we could show our appreciation for saving our lives.

402
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:55,444
But that is...

403
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:05,884
Did you know this would happen?

404
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:09,854
You have...

405
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:12,854
saved your own self.

406
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:16,124
Not only did you save yourself,

407
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:20,704
you will go on to save my people.

408
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:23,535
So...

409
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:25,805
I will grant my queen's wish.

410
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:32,374
From now on, you must look after not only the royal family...

411
00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:34,415
but the rest of my people as well.

412

do not forget that...

414

00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:40,004
Look at that!

504
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:44,575
Hey! The chestnuts are ready.

505
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,274
Come on over!

506
00:40:52,114 --> 00:40:53,214
Here.

507
00:40:54,424 --> 00:40:56,185
- Gosh. - Oh, my!

508
00:40:57,424 --> 00:40:58,855
Here, Jang Gun!

509
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,694
Here, Castor Bean.

510
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:16,904
Young Master!

511
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,174
Poong!

512
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:21,114
- Lady Seo! - Poong!

513
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,314
Hi.

514
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:25,955
My goodness.

515
00:41:27,355 --> 00:41:28,754
Granny.

516
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:31,325
Poong.

517
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:38,535
You have been keeping healthy and happy, right?

518
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:39,864
Yes, of course!

519
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:47,105
- Hey! You little... - You rascal!

520
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:49,645
- Stop right there! - Goodness.

521
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:51,044
You brat.

522
00:41:51,274 --> 00:41:52,314
Let us go inside.

523
00:41:54,384 --> 00:41:56,114
Wait, hold on!

524
00:41:56,245 --> 00:41:57,484
Hey, Jang Gun!

525
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:01,855
You must be exhausted from the long journey.

526
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:03,384
No, I feel fine.

527
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:15,035
Tonight, we should all sleep next to each other...

528
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:19,075
because it is snowing.

529
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:35,825
Come here!

530
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:04,214
- Ip Bun. - Yes?

531
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:08,185
Do not...

532
00:43:09,855 --> 00:43:12,095
give up on your dreams.

533
00:43:12,754 --> 00:43:13,754
Okay.

534
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:17,024
But I have new dreams now, Granny.

535
00:43:20,694 --> 00:43:23,864
Jang Gun, my adorable sweetheart.

536
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:29,075
Here.

537
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:32,375
You should study everything you wish to learn.

538
00:43:32,814 --> 00:43:33,814
Okay!

539
00:43:38,384 --> 00:43:39,455
Oh, my.

540
00:43:39,614 --> 00:43:42,254
Granny, hurry up and give me something too.

541
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,194
Man Bok.

542
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:50,595
What?

543
00:43:57,464 --> 00:43:59,075
Beans? Castor beans?

544
00:43:59,774 --> 00:44:01,174
You, Castor Bean.

545
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,004
I know we can always count on you.

546
00:44:03,575 --> 00:44:05,714
Keep them safe.

547
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:07,415
What?

548
00:44:09,345 --> 00:44:10,515
Lady Namhae.

549
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:14,185
My goodness.

550
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,424
You are the coolest one.

551
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:26,234
Thanks to you, I ate well...

552
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:27,794
and had a great time.

553
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:31,035
Do you have a craving for something?

554
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:33,975
Shall I make rice cakes tomorrow?

555
00:44:34,575 --> 00:44:35,605
Yes, I would love that!

556
00:44:39,114 --> 00:44:42,614
- Gosh. - Stop it, will you?

557
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:46,185
Se Poong, Eun Woo.

558
00:44:49,225 --> 00:44:51,955
Are you not glad that you are alive?

559
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:08,904
You did the right thing.

560
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:11,845
Do you not agree?

561
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:14,075
Yes.

562
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:16,785
You taught me...

563
00:45:17,444 --> 00:45:20,484
that I should stay alive and wait.

564
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,424
For I am alive,

565
00:45:25,194 --> 00:45:26,495
I can save lives.

566
00:45:45,314 --> 00:45:47,515
Gosh, stop it.

567
00:45:48,544 --> 00:45:49,685
Here, Jang Gun.

568
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,084
Do not be sad.

569
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:01,895
When the first snow falls,

570
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,834
just think that the snowflakes are me.

571
00:46:08,004 --> 00:46:09,564
I do not want a memorial ceremony.

572
00:46:10,464 --> 00:46:11,734
Come here.

573
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:14,105
Gosh. Stop it, seriously.

574
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,214
If you wish to do something for me,

575
00:46:20,915 --> 00:46:24,584
throw a banquet for me on my death anniversary.

576
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:40,595
Granny.

577
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:44,205
Be sure...

578
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:47,004
to play some cheerful music so that we will not be sad.

579
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:12,535
Granny.

580
00:47:54,928 --> 00:47:56,567
Be careful. Watch your step.

581
00:48:02,837 --> 00:48:04,438
As I push you from behind,

582
00:48:05,248 --> 00:48:08,408
you should pull me from up ahead.

583
00:48:08,408 --> 00:48:10,078
- Exactly. - Pull him.

584
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:12,147
I am pushing while getting nothing in return.

585
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,917
- We are here. - Pull me along.

586
00:48:14,147 --> 00:48:15,158
Goodness.

587
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,420
Have you been well?

588
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,030
Granny, it is us.

589
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:30,610
There must be a beggar sitting in his stomach.

590
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:33,610
He is always hungry.

591
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:26,999
- Lady Eun Woo. - Physician Yoo.

592
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,179
Goodness.

593
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,710
You should have ginger tea.

594
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,550
Let me pour you some water for now.

595
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,920
Lady Eun Woo, this is liquor.

596
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,789
Oh, no. Please do not drink that.

597
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:54,490
Goodness.

598
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:15,320
Are you all right?

599
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:16,650
I am fine.

600
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,590
It is said in Bonchogangmok...

601
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,550
that low temperature of the stomach causes hiccups.

602
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,559
Rubbing clove oil on the Joongwan...

603
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,760
Clove oil?

604
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:29,329
I am sure we have some clove oil.

605
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:40,170
On the Joongwan?

606
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:45,749
(Joongwan)

607
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:46,749
That...

608
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,079
No...

609
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:51,749
Maybe not. Could there be another way?

610
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:54,519
Other medical texts suggest...

611
00:51:54,889 --> 00:51:55,960
that in order to stop hiccups,

612
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,360
you may warm up the Gimoon or use moxibustion...

613
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,760
The Gimoon near the liver...

614
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:07,030
of the Gimoon up the nasal speculum?

615
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,240
The Gimoon near the liver...

616
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,570
should be kept warm.

617
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,210
With one's hands.

618
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:22,150
(Gimoon)

619
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,329
No can do, Physician Yoo.

620
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:46,970
My goodness.

621
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:52,010
When he quoted from the Bonchogangmok,

622
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,679
I thought it would take them all night.

623
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:55,780
That was not the most disastrous moment though.

624
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,349
What if he had sipped the liquor?

625
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:59,650
We should have kept the liquor off the table.

626
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,789
I agree.

627
00:53:00,789 --> 00:53:02,190
One can die from constant hiccups.

628
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,860
We must gather the materials for moxibustion.

629
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,059
Do not worry, Jang Gun.

630
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:06,990
He is with the Head Female Physician.

631
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,030
I doubt she would let him die.

632
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,030
You never know.

633
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:11,970
She might drain his energy.

634
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:15,269
Jang Gun, do not listen to her. Come on.

635
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:21,240
Gosh. The candle was blown out...

636
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:22,710
which puts me at ease.

637
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,210
- Right. Let us go. - Sure.

638
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,050
- Come on. - Here comes...

639
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,679
the wedding night special late-night snack!

640
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,990
("Poong-Woo's Journal")

641
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,840
Dad, someone is outside.

642
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:00,550
Dad!

643
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,079
It is rice.

644
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:04,880
And medicinal herbs.

645
00:54:05,749 --> 00:54:06,889
It must be for Grandma.

646
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:10,490
The Night Goblin must have stopped by.

647
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,030
The Mysterious Physician?

648
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,929
I want to see him.

649
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:20,070
The Mysterious Physician came by.

650
00:54:20,269 --> 00:54:21,900
The Mysterious Physician!

651
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,900
Thank you.

652
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,909
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

653
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:30,079
The rumors are true about you being a talented physician.

654
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,050
- Goodness. - We are lucky, are we not?

655
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,650
You will feel better after a few good meals.

656
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,079
Do not worry too much.

657
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,780
- You may go home. - Thank you.

658
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,949
- Thank you. - Next.

659
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:41,050
Where does it hurt?

660
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,559
My stomach is killing me.

661
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:43,720
Is that so?

662
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:47,860
Come by again if you need more.

663
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,960
Thank you so much.

664
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:50,559
What can I get you?

665
00:54:50,729 --> 00:54:52,329
I will give you some ilmultang,

666
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:53,829
so please wait over there.

667
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:56,670
Is he not the best?

668
00:54:58,269 --> 00:54:59,269
Physician Gye!

669
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,409
You little rat. Who said you could copy me?

670
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:08,650
Still, I am glad I saved your life.

671
