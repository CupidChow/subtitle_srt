the heart.

00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:42,124
Yoo Se Yeob's... No.

00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:44,694
Yoo Se Poong's heart.

7
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:48,624
I want his heart.

00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:00,304
I cannot...

00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:02,444
give it to you.

10
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,114
His heart belongs to him.

Your love...

How dare a widow love...

14
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:19,654
the Minister of Personnel's son?

15
00:01:20,963 --> 00:01:22,224
I am a princess,

and even I cannot have all I want.

17
00:01:29,504 --> 00:01:30,534
It is...

18
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:33,504
not love.

19
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:39,644
I just assist Physician Yoo and act as his hands.

20
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,243
Do you mean that?

21
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:46,954
Then leave this place.

22
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:50,394
And I will believe you.

00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:52,493
No.

24
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:55,963
I will remain by his side until he can practice acupuncture again.

25
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:58,133
I will not leave.

26
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:27,993
Your love...

28
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:34,003
How dare a widow love the Minister of Personnel's son?

29
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:38,104
If it is not love,

30
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:40,804
then it will be okay.

31
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:52,683
Physician Yoo.

32
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:57,554
Why are you out here?

33
00:02:58,054 --> 00:02:59,593
Were you with a patient for this long?

34
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,264
No.

35
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:04,234
I came looking for you.

36
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:07,634
I got worried.

37
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,334
Then did you...

38
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:17,243
Yes, from the bookstore.

39
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:21,213
Did you hear it all?

40
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:26,884
Yes, I happened to.

41
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:34,123
Lady Eun Woo.

42
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:38,693
Will you leave me when I am able to administer acupuncture?

43
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:47,204
What about you?

44
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:50,413
Will you not marry the princess?

45
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:55,084
Can I stay by your side as long as I wish?

46
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:58,484
I also...

47
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:01,054
am not in love.

48
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,993
My feelings for the princess are not love.

49
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:12,593
And I will not marry her.

50
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,174
But you are...

51
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:21,074
His Majesty's friend.

52
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:24,843
You will have no choice if His Majesty were to command it.

53
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:27,413
Lady Eun Woo, my heart...

beats for someone else.

55
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:36,124
Nothing in the world can change that.

56
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,324

- I apologize. - I apologize.

60
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,824
Must I teach you how to set a table too?

61
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:12,324
Set it all out for me again.

63

just do not get instructions.

Fools of low birth.

The food from this place...

66
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:33,074
does not suit me at all, darn it.

You lowly...

68
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:48,293
Your Highness.

69
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:53,363
You must be of such lofty birth...

70
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:55,933
if you are able to speak in such a manner...

71
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,934
in front of a member of the royal family.

72
00:05:58,134 --> 00:05:59,603
Not at all.

73
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,973
Your Highness.

74
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:06,313
Why... Your Highness.

75
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:09,283
There is blood on your fair hand.

76
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:10,954
- How come... - Your Highness!

77
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:14,184
Oh, dear. Your Highness.

78
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:15,954
Call a physician!

79
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:17,493
Walk faster.

80
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:19,494
Can you walk faster?

81
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:24,394
Your Highness, I will call a physician for you right away.

82
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:27,403
Come and serve us!

83
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:30,102
Her Highness is injured!

84
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,073
Come and serve us quick!

85
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:33,744
Is no one in?

86
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:36,472
- Go back to sleep. - Why? I want to watch.

87
00:06:36,473 --> 00:06:37,574
Go back inside.

88
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:40,483
Be very careful.

89
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,583
- You, Gye Ji Han. - Governor Ahn.

90
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:47,152
Treat Her Highness immediately.

91
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,482
What is the matter?

92
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:49,584
Get to it now.

93
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:00,834
Your Highness.

94
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,064
What is the matter?

95
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:05,673
She got angry...

96
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:08,504
and hurt the back of her fair hand.

97
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,644
What did you do in fury that...

98
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,483
Let me have a look.

99
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:18,983
I want Yoo Se Yeob to treat me.

100
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:21,254
Pardon?

101
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:23,584
But...

102
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:29,824
Dunce.

103
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,293
Physician Yoo.

104
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:36,564
The Princess is looking for you.

105
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:00,463
You see, the Princess...

106
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:02,093
She is losing her mind.

107
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:05,583
She must be crazy, or she would not break down the doors every time.

108
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,603
She is just young...

109
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,004
and has too much energy. That is why she is like that.

110
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,813
My goodness. How could a physician say such a thing?

111
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,302
Do you not see this pale, panicked face of mine?

112
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:18,043
How dare...

113
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:21,613
How dare a woman raise her voice at the district governor?

114
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:23,644
Such insolence.

115
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:26,653
They say people never change.

116
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:29,524
You surely have not changed one bit.

117
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:37,863
I will marry you no matter what.

118
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:44,274
Why me,

119
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:46,274
all of a sudden?

120
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:51,173
That is because you are my first love.

121
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:56,083
I heard you were engaged to the Chief State Councillor’s son.

122
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:58,283
His Majesty told me so.

123
00:08:58,553 --> 00:08:59,583
That is not true!

124
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:01,593
I would never lay a glance on such a jerk.

125
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,923
Do you know the Chief State Councillor’s son well?

126
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:07,494
No, I do not know him at all.

127
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,964
Anyway, you are to marry me. No matter what.

128
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:17,634
You do not even know what kind of person I really am.

129
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:20,903
You are a good person. Am I wrong?

130
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:24,673
That is the kind of man I need.

131
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,844
I am not a good person.

132
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,643
I am just someone who lost everything...

133
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:35,153
and wanted to give up on his own life, like a fool.

134
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:38,524
You mean, you tried to take your own life?

135
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:41,494
Yes.

136
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,964
I was going to jump off a cliff,

137
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:47,134
but someone saved me.

138
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:54,943
You will save many, so stay alive, okay?

139
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,413
That person told me...

140
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,634
that I would go on to save many lives.

141
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:07,884
It must be that brazen girl. The person who saved you.

142
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:13,423
So please, stop saying that you wish to marry me.

143
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:15,724
I do not wish to betray my feelings for her.

144
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,293
But she told me that she did not love you.

145
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:23,974
So you will fancy her and stay single, like a fool?

146
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:30,403
Gosh, I am so annoyed. Look at this dunce!

147
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,813
Darn, why must I marry that jerk, of all men?

148
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,053
My gosh!

149
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:43,994
Why do you keep breaking all the doors?

150
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:45,724
Your Highness.

151
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:05,714
Lady Eun Woo, my heart...

152
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,083
beats for someone else.

153
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:12,014
Nothing in the world...

154
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:14,524
can change that.

155
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:17,293
Not even the King's command.

156
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:27,964
Physician Yoo.

157
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:40,813
Lady Eun Woo.

158
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:43,083
I will go meet His Majesty.

159
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:45,313
All of a sudden?

160
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:48,683
I believe I can treat the Princess' heart.

161
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:56,563
Do you think that the Princess has a psychiatric condition?

162
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:57,663
Yes.

163
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:01,063
Her obsession with wanting to marry me.

164
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,734
I will marry you.

165
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:07,573
Excessive anger.

166
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:08,943
My gosh!

167
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,513
She gets extremely worked up when anyone brings up her ex-fiancé,

168
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:15,789
the Chief State Councillor’s son.

169
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:18,614
Darn, why must I marry that jerk, of all men?

170
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:21,884
If that is not a psychiatric condition, what is?

171
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:23,683
Most importantly,

172
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:25,894
I am not her first love.

173
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:28,423
You are not?

174
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:31,563
She said you were.

175
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:34,702
If simply brushing past someone...

176
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,633
means they are your first love and that you must marry them,

177
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:39,033
you and I should already be married.

178
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:53,913
Her anger must be connected to...

179
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:56,273
- the Chief State Councillor’s son. - I see.

180
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:59,123
- Yes. - So you are...

181
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:01,293
going to the palace to ask His Majesty in person?

182
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:02,693
Yes, that is correct.

183
00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:09,032
I understand His Majesty considers you a friend,

184
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,172
but this concerns a royal marriage,

185
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:13,454
so you have to be very careful about how you bring it up.

186
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,344
Do not worry, Lady Eun Woo.

187
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:19,543
Please carefully observe the Princess while I am gone.

188
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:23,614
Try to find out what she is hiding deep in her heart.

189
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:51,913
How is the Princess?

190
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:55,984
She has been reading a lot...

191
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:58,384
and eating well.

192
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:00,053
She is doing well.

193
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:02,653
She must be bothering you a lot too.

194
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:04,994
No, Your Majesty.

195
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,894
She is my only sibling...

196
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:10,663
of low birth.

197
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:14,504
Growing up, she was lonely and sad.

198
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,004
She was always alone.

199
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:20,303
Se Yeob.

200
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,714
My late father adored her very much.

201
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:26,244
I adore her too.

202
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:30,443
I truly wish to help her find happiness.

203
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:33,813
Your Majesty.

204
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:36,653
Do you wish...

205
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:39,524
to see her happy?

206
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:41,323
Yes.

207
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:44,894
I would like to help her find happiness.

208
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:48,464
So I must ask you this question.

209
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:52,703
What happened to Her Highness the Princess?

210
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:57,104
Please tell me honestly,

211
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,714
so I can find a way to help her, Your Majesty.

212
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,543
The truth is...

213
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:37,953
Your Highness.

214
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,124
There are many handsome men in Hanyang, right?

215
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:44,623
Well, Physician Yoo is pretty good-looking too.

216
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:48,094
No. The Chief State Councillor’s son is much more handsome.

217
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:51,193
- What? - Hey.

218
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:53,533
She is a princess.

219
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,033
Oh, right.

220
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:58,333
Your Highness, then...

221
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:03,073
So you dumped that handsome man...

222
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:06,214
and are obsessed with my young master now. Why...

223
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:09,144
What is the reason?

224
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:13,514
A beautiful heart is more important than a handsome face.

225
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:16,624
Those who say nice things look more beautiful.

226
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:23,224
Your Highness, you are like the protagonist of a romance novel.

227
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:24,864
You dumped your handsome fiancé...

228
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:27,654
for your beautiful-hearted first love and came all the way here.

229
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:31,134
You are very smart.

230
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:32,803
Pardon me?

231
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:35,644
Yes.

232
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:37,573
Exactly.

233
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:39,943
This was the picture I wanted.

234
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:42,114
What?

235
00:16:42,913 --> 00:16:44,714
It is okay. Do not be scared. Keep on eating.

236
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:49,024
So she likes the Chief State Councillor’s son, not Physician Yoo.

237
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:53,494
What on earth happened?

238
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:02,203
I am here to see your young master.

239
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:07,403
Who are you to visit the Chief State Councillor’s family without notice?

240
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:09,144
I am...

241
00:17:11,144 --> 00:17:13,144
We worked in the Office of Royal Decrees together.

242
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:18,714
Oh, my! My young master is not here. He had to go somewhere far.

243
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:20,883
- Somewhere far? - Yes.

244
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:22,454
How far?

245
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:28,164
Your Highness.

246
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:31,734
You may come in.

247
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:45,424
I do not wish to be treated by you though.

248
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:46,944
Bring me Yoo Se Yeob.

249
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:50,414
Physician Yoo went to meet His Majesty.

250
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:52,583
Without informing me?

251
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:58,254
Please let me know if this stings.

252
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:02,563
That hurts!

253
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:06,033
Bear with me.

254
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:07,633
Gosh.

255
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:16,244
Why did a noble lady like you...

256
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:19,073
choose to be a lowly physician?

257
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,613
Was being a widow not enough?

258
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:25,484
Do you highly value...

259
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:27,984
one's social status?

260
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:30,684
Of course. Nothing is more important.

261
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:36,363
I became a physician to find happiness.

262
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:38,363
Did you not come here...

263
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:41,333
in search of happiness yourself?

264
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,843
If it is social status that you value most,

265
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:56,282
why did you not accept the proposal...

266
00:18:56,283 --> 00:18:58,514
from the Chief State Councillor’s son?

267
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:04,224
How dare you! As if you know any better.

268
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,803
I am a noble princess of this nation.

269
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,674
Unlike you people, I am of high status.

270
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:31,684
Gosh.

271
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,024
Is she always this short-tempered?

272
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,684
How do you manage to stay beside her?

273
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:39,593
She is not always like this.

274
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:42,164
Recent events have upset her these days.

275
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:46,764
Lady Eun Woo is a valued physician at this clinic.

276
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:49,463
Her being the Princess...

277
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:51,803
does not give her the right to go on a rampage.

278
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:54,602
That is out of line.

279
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:57,573
Are you comparing the Princess to a thug?

280
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:59,842
Look at the door.

281
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:01,944
Not even thugs act that way at clinics.

282
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,143
Hold on.

283
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:06,253
Could she have pulled Lady Eun Woo by the hair?

284
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:07,283
Physician Gye!

285
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,352
Of course that is not the case.

286
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:12,293
But I only say it since she is short-tempered.

287
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:15,862
Being generous and patient...

288
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:17,963
is how you were able to serve her for so long.

289
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:20,893
Anyone else would have given up a long time ago.

290
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,934
I guess you are right about that.

291
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:29,243
She must have been a handful back at the Palace...

292
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,873
judging by how she is out here.

293
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:40,883
Dad, come on. Your patients are waiting!

294
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,323
I will be right there.

295
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:48,424
I will get back to work, then.

296
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:56,375
You. How dare you run off to Hanyang all the time.

297
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:58,245
Do you know how exhausting my day has been?

298
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,444
Me being this talented...

299
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:01,365
is the only reason I took in someone so useless.

300
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:05,056
Were you not the one who said that my good looks did the work?

301
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:09,086
When did you get this brazen?

302
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:11,224
They say the closest people rub off you.

303
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:14,155
It is actually quite easy to pick up bad habits.

304
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:18,265
So tell me, Physician Yoo. What is the deal with the Princess?

305
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:20,096
His Majesty told me everything.

306
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:24,736
Right before the wedding,

307
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:28,076
the Princess disappeared.

308
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:29,246
Your Highness!

309
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,115
- Your Highness! - Princess Seo Yi!

310
00:21:33,145 --> 00:21:34,145
Your Highness!

311
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:35,246
Pardon?

312
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,556
What about the ceremony, then?

313
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:42,355
I had to call it off blaming an illness.

314
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:43,855
(Chingbyeong: Blaming an illness)

315
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:47,155
The Chief State Councillor wishes to honour this engagement.

316
00:21:47,895 --> 00:21:49,365
Once she is better,

317
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,366
he wishes for the wedding to take place.

318
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:53,465
Even now...

319
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:55,135
Even now?

320
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,935
Does he still want his son to marry the Princess?

321
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:06,215
Why did the Princess...

322
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:09,786
refuse to get married and run from her chambers?

323
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:11,385
That has me puzzled.

324
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:13,215
I do not know what she is thinking.

325
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:17,026
Even with all the brotherly love, she refuses to tell me,

326
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:18,496
so how can I know what she wants?

327
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:22,295
That is not true!

328
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:23,976
I would never lay a glance on such a jerk.

329
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:29,705
Se Yeob, you are a psychiatrist who treats illnesses of the heart.

330
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:34,076
I ask that you get to the root of her issues.

331
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,346
She ran off the night before the wedding?

332
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:44,756
The whole Palace would have been in shambles.

333
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:47,985
I do not care how wayward one is.

334
00:22:47,986 --> 00:22:49,625
One does not run from a wedding.

335
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,225
His Majesty is a saint to have let her get away with it.

336
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:55,995
Anyway, I am sure...

337
00:22:55,996 --> 00:22:57,996
something transpired between those two that night.

338
00:22:58,096 --> 00:22:59,135
Right.

339
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:02,306
Before the incident, she was obviously fond of him.

340
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:03,905
Even more than you...

341
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,346
She said he was better looking than you.

342
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:14,846
Is that true?

343
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,115
All this time, she has been using me.

344
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:21,424
Someone she was fond of...

345
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:22,785
was involved in a troubling incident...

346
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:24,185
before the wedding?

347
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:25,655
Then,

348
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,296
her disappointment would have been greater.

349
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:32,035
I am curious though. Why is it that...

350
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,965
she loathes what is lowly...

351
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:36,306
and is obsessed with what is noble?

352
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,175
Earlier...

353
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:41,746
I am a noble princess of this nation.

354
00:23:42,405 --> 00:23:44,445
Unlike you people, I am of high status.

355
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:47,375
She is my only sibling...

356
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,945
of low birth.

357
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,955
Growing up, she was lonely and sad.

358
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:02,465
What could be the matter?

359
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:05,236
What do you mean?

360
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:07,965
You are very aware that I am trying my best...

361
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:09,766
not to pry.

362
00:24:12,435 --> 00:24:13,435
What...

363
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,846
You were head over heels for the Chief State Councillor’s son,

364
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:20,115
but then you suddenly called off the engagement.

365
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:22,715
And now you are giving Physician Yoo a hard time.

366
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,256
Because he is a jerk.

367
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:30,086
I bought some on my way home from Hanyang.

368
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:31,356
Please enjoy.

369
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:33,995
Why are you not thanking my young master?

370
00:24:33,996 --> 00:24:35,964
- Thank you. - I will enjoy this.

371
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,365
- Thank you. - Good.

372
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:41,176
Who goes by the name of Yoo Se Yeob?

373
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:01,655
Judging by your good looks,

374
00:25:02,155 --> 00:25:05,125
you must be him.

375
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:09,526
I hear you are quite the womaniser.

376
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,265
Rumour has it that you frolic with widows.

377
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:17,935
I am here...

378
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:21,036

380

386
00:25:37,556 --> 00:25:38,596
Somewhere far?

387
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:46,266
I am Her Majesty the Queen.

I am master cook Lady Namhae.

391

That is enough.

392
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,375
- Take your seats. - That we should.

393
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:04,885
Physician Yoo!

394

Over there!

395
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:14,495
Let us go inside.

396

What is the meaning of this?

397

- What is going on? - Come on.

398
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:20,365
Princess Seo Yi is coming this way.

- Goodness. - What is that over there?

403
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:34,475
I have a few questions.

404
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:38,816
You must answer truthfully if we are to solve this issue.

405

We have work tomorrow. Go to sleep.

- No. - I cannot hear, Father.

407

We can ask the dunce to explain tomorrow.

- Go to sleep. - Come on.

You too. Go, Granny.

I cannot hear a thing.

My young master will play the Chief State Councillor’s son.

Lady Seo will play the Princess.

416

Applause.

417
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,335
Now re-enact the story you heard.

418

I am dead curious.

What happened between them?

I cannot do it.

421

You are so frustrating.

00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:45,654
You are the only person who heard the story.

423

Are you trying to trick us because you played a story-reader once?

He wants money.

425

I do not have any.

What I will say now...

429
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:57,924
is not what I thought or said.

430
00:27:57,925 --> 00:27:59,996
It is all what he said.

431
00:28:01,465 --> 00:28:02,465
Okay.

432
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:07,506
Go on.

433
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,816
As the Chief State Councillor son...

and eldest of a noble family everyone admires,

435
00:28:19,185 --> 00:28:21,255
the lowly princess' birth...

436
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:24,326
was something I could overlook in my desire to marry her.

437
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:27,826
What...

438
00:28:31,165 --> 00:28:33,036
As we prepared for the wedding,

439
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:35,835
relatives commented on the Princess' lowly birth...

440
00:28:35,836 --> 00:28:37,736
and voiced their concern with criticism.

441
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,374
Despite that and my friends' mockery,

442
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:43,076
I could not give up on my feelings for her.

443
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:49,115
From the moment I saw her at the late king's birthday,

444
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:53,685
my feelings for her bloomed within my heart.

445
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:56,856
When we marry tomorrow,

446
00:28:57,556 --> 00:29:01,026
I feel we can finally overcome the misery and be happy.

447
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,035
Was that out of love or abuse?

448
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:17,704
Was that not him picking on her?

449
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:19,445
- Very much. - Yes.

450
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:22,586
Master Yoon does not know what he did wrong.

451
00:29:22,915 --> 00:29:26,315
He does love the princess with all his heart,

452
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:28,155
but he speaks his mind as it is.

453
00:29:28,455 --> 00:29:31,326
We need some kind of special training.

00:32:50,725 --> 00:32:53,855
You bruise a woman's soul if you talk like that!

501
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:56,195
Why would they feel hurt by the truth?

502
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,864
Look at this.

503
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:01,296
This drawing shows she is sad.

504
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:03,635
He has no future.

505
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:07,106
I cannot do this.

506
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:09,645
Do not give up just yet.

507
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:12,915
Tell him to just memorize a script.

508
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:14,516
If that does not work,

509
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:15,885
then...

510
00:33:16,986 --> 00:33:18,414
beat it into him.

511
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:20,816
No, Granny, Jang Gun can hear you.

512
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:23,385
Memorize it?

513
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:25,756
Memorize?

514
00:33:32,435 --> 00:33:34,895
Why are you so low on energy?

515
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:40,205
It is so hard to get through to someone.

516
00:33:41,975 --> 00:33:44,805
Are you upset Physician Yoo will not even come to treat you?

517
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,546
How do you know everything?

518
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:49,415
It is obvious.

519
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,685
I had such a clear plan when I first came here.

520
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,586
You cannot force love.

521
00:33:59,095 --> 00:34:02,195
I will ditch Yoon Ji Ho who gossips about people not just...

522
00:34:02,196 --> 00:34:04,994
behind their backs but to their faces too...

523
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:06,665
and marry my first love.

524
00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:08,566
Is that not a perfect outcome?

525
00:34:10,406 --> 00:34:15,106
That sounds like something that only happens in a romance novel.

526
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,185
(May His Love Come Swift)

527
00:34:27,256 --> 00:34:30,185
A novel is the best way to escape reality.

528
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:33,335
I should have read this sooner.

529
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:37,026
(Today, I Wish to Know Love)

530
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:40,236
Yes, it is a fact.

531
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,765
The one who loves more loses out.

532

(Our 100th Day Anniversary)

(I Am Happy Now That We Met)

534
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:53,575
Why must the timing always be off?

535
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:01,055
- Your Highness. - What?

536
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:03,256
You are reading way too fast.

537
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:05,594
New novels are hard to come by.

538
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:07,124
Why are they hard to come by?

539
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,395
Write one yourself if you must.

540
00:35:20,776 --> 00:35:21,776
Your Highness.

541
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:25,975
What do you want?

542
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:29,886
Can you...

543
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:35,685
recommend something nice and sweet?

544
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:39,296
For you to read?

545
00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:44,566
For you,

546
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:47,735
I would recommend a story of a strong woman...

547
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:49,535
like "The Chronicles of Lady Park."

548
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:51,435
No.

549
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:53,176
What I want to read...

550
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:56,575
is a romance novel that is sickly sweet...

551
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,266
with lots of confessions of love.

552
00:35:58,845 --> 00:35:59,915
A romance novel?

553
00:36:09,455 --> 00:36:10,455
(The Goblin)

554
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:11,455
"The Goblin."

555
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,765
She read this already.

556
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,066
And this too.

557
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:02,345
(Boon's Brother Is Cheating)

558

Oh, why is this here?

559
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:09,245
Do not be embarrassed. I totally understand.

560
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,955
What? What do you understand?

561
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:17,986
Why did you follow me here?

562
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,995
I was in the area to buy some medicinal herbs and stopped by.

563
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:24,624
Court Lady Jung, your taste is a little...

564
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:25,636
I am here...

565
00:37:26,095 --> 00:37:29,066
to find some books for the Princess.

566
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,236
Has she read these new novels?

567
00:37:37,946 --> 00:37:39,716
You look so beautiful when you smile.

568
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,946
How come you always look angry?

569
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:46,915
Hold on.

570
00:37:56,395 --> 00:37:57,566
Do not be silly.

571
00:38:01,165 --> 00:38:02,765
He does not even remember what happened.

(Descendants of the Sun, The Secret Garden, Lovers in Hanyang)

574
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:26,526
Lady Eun Woo.

575
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:29,466
Who wrote this?

576
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:31,595
Why?

577
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:36,836
"Do I have feelings for you?"

578
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:42,546
"Every moment I spent with you..."

"shined."

580
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,615
"Because the weather was good,"

581

"because the weather was bad,"

582
00:38:52,856 --> 00:38:54,536
"and because the weather was good enough."

583
00:38:57,026 --> 00:38:58,356
"I loved every moment of it."

584
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,975
Oh, my! How... How did the writer come up with this?

585
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:18,276
Well...

586
00:39:19,515 --> 00:39:20,676
That part.

587
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:23,085
I will be sure to include it.

588
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:25,316
It totally made my heart flutter.

589
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:27,586
Truly?

590
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:32,395
I learned many things through this experience, Lady Eun Woo.

591
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:35,426
I tend to be quite blunt, you know.

592
00:39:35,995 --> 00:39:38,995
I have learned to speak sweetly.

593
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:43,366
But unlike him,

594
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:45,736
you never say mean things.

595
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:49,106
You are very sweet.

596
00:39:50,506 --> 00:39:51,546
You truly think so?

597
00:39:58,415 --> 00:40:00,055
Writing that must not be easy.

598
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,125
Let me read it.

599
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:05,625
You cannot read it yet.

Yes.

- Is it that good? - Yes!

611
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:41,256
I really think you are a genius.

612
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:46,866
Okay, great.

613
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:53,276

You see, I...

00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:09,261
I am not sure if this is the right thing to do.

617

It is! Trust me.

Fine, I shall trust you this once for I have no choice.

620
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:21,466
If you try anything funny...

621
00:41:22,395 --> 00:41:23,805
I will teach you a lesson.

622
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:24,966
Okay.

623
00:41:43,555 --> 00:41:45,685
Oh, my. How beautiful.

624
00:41:46,156 --> 00:41:47,196
There, it is done.

625

Why must I get all dolled up like this?

Am I with them?

628
00:42:00,636 --> 00:42:03,375
Gosh, no. I am with you, Your Highness.

629
00:42:07,245 --> 00:42:09,316
Even if I cannot marry Yoo Se Yeob,

630
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:13,285
I will never marry that arrogant jerk.

631
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:15,386
Never say never.

632
00:42:15,656 --> 00:42:17,025
Just try to find happiness...

633
00:42:17,026 --> 00:42:19,825
I can never be happy. I was born to be miserable.

634
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:23,796
You sound like you are 100 years old.

No, I do not wish to go anywhere.

If you do not go out for a walk after eating all this,

you will become a pig, Your Highness!

A pig?

640
00:42:40,745 --> 00:42:42,316
Did you just call me a pig?

You little...

642
00:42:56,595 --> 00:42:58,725
All right. Is everyone ready?

Yes, I am ready.

00:43:05,136 --> 00:43:06,376
- We are ready. - We are ready.

I repeat. Sprint!

650
00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:29,995
Physician Yoo, the Princess is only eight steps away.

651
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,696
Get ready.

652
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:38,705
Just say this? Do you truly think it will work?

653
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,276
Yes, this is the best strategy.

654
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:42,136
You can do it.

00:45:11,095 --> 00:45:12,095
Should I...

667
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,395
apologize...

668
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:17,435
or profess my love?

669
00:45:20,906 --> 00:45:22,636
Step aside, or I will kill you!

670
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:26,176
(Lovers in Hanyang)

671
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:27,946
(Lovers in Hanyang)

672
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:30,046
You are...

673
00:45:34,955 --> 00:45:35,955
in my heart.

674
00:45:39,595 --> 00:45:40,725
(Lovers in Hanyang)

675
00:45:53,006 --> 00:45:54,906
The moment we first met...

676
00:45:58,975 --> 00:46:00,616
It was such a beautiful moment.

677
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:04,546
The late King's birthday celebration.

678
00:46:06,455 --> 00:46:07,986
Those petals and that beautiful scent.

679
00:46:09,825 --> 00:46:11,225
Do you remember?

680
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,305
Come in, Castor Bean.

681
00:46:26,535 --> 00:46:27,636
Go all out.

682
00:46:27,805 --> 00:46:29,805
I repeat. Go all out.

683
00:46:58,665 --> 00:46:59,676
Come on.

684
00:47:45,216 --> 00:47:48,086
You ruined all those fond memories!

685
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:50,725
You have your admirable family name and lineage,

686
00:47:50,926 --> 00:47:52,426
so enjoy a good life!

687
00:47:52,526 --> 00:47:53,624
You are mistaken, Princess.

688
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,856
Quiet. I have had enough!

689
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,145
- Oh, dear. - My gosh.

690
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,116
Bees!

691
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,035
Oh, no.

692
00:48:49,078 --> 00:48:50,547
Mint goes in next.

693
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:51,848
Right.

694
00:48:52,917 --> 00:48:54,147
There you go.

695
00:48:58,788 --> 00:48:59,817
I think it is done.

696
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:04,027
All right.

697
00:49:06,598 --> 00:49:08,396
Sweet Annie and mint have been crushed together.

698
00:49:08,397 --> 00:49:09,797
This will sting a little.

699
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:13,167
It hurts!

700
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:16,167
It hurts.

701
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:23,046
This will reduce the swelling,

702
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,277
so bear with us.

703
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:34,998
Being the incompetent man I am,

704
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:37,357
I failed to show her how I feel.

705
00:49:39,758 --> 00:49:41,098
I guess it is over for me.

706
00:49:42,658 --> 00:49:43,667
No.

707
00:49:44,268 --> 00:49:46,768
You showed her your true feelings with your actions.

708
00:49:50,368 --> 00:49:53,977
Princess Seo Yi did not even hear me out.

709
00:49:54,207 --> 00:49:57,207
You saved her though which is commendable.

710
00:50:00,547 --> 00:50:01,547
Right.

711
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:04,547
Your condition has been treated...

712
00:50:05,187 --> 00:50:06,957
although your body is yet to heal.

713
00:50:08,488 --> 00:50:09,988
You were admirable today.

714
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:13,698
Thank you.

715
00:50:26,008 --> 00:50:27,078
You are a fool.

716
00:50:28,337 --> 00:50:29,337
Your Highness.

717
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:34,218
No matter how hard you try, nothing will change.

718
00:50:35,948 --> 00:50:38,488
You do not know better, and this was all in vain.

719
00:50:40,888 --> 00:50:41,888
Your Highness.

720
00:50:45,457 --> 00:50:46,457
Your Highness!

721
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:50,397
Your Highness.

722
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:55,598
I am not hurting.

723
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:02,078
That is what everyone thinks.

724
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:03,908
That...

725
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:05,808
they are not hurting.

726
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:08,977
But...

727
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:13,058
even a physician like me hurt from within as well.

728
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:22,357
Take a look at this.

729
00:51:42,747 --> 00:51:44,288
While fixated on one thing,

730
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,587
you will miss what is good...

731
00:51:48,618 --> 00:51:50,138
even when it is right in front of you.

732
00:51:52,687 --> 00:51:53,797
How pretty.

733
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:04,667
What had you...

734
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:07,277
in so much pain?

735
00:52:09,848 --> 00:52:10,848
All my life,

736
00:52:12,348 --> 00:52:15,678
I have stood tall and stayed on my toes.

737
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:20,857
Because I am of lowly birth.

738
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:26,027
It was to prevent being censured by my elders.

739
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:29,897
To hear someone I liked call me a lowly birth...

740
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:31,768
cut deeply.

741
00:52:35,538 --> 00:52:38,908
My birth mother is a lowly dancer.

742
00:52:40,538 --> 00:52:41,578
After having me,

743
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:44,488
she was not even granted the status of a royal concubine.

744
00:52:52,518 --> 00:52:54,018
Someone I know...

745
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:58,558
became a young widow overnight...

746
00:52:59,828 --> 00:53:01,727
and overcame many imminent deaths.

747
00:53:03,897 --> 00:53:04,968
She told me...

748
00:53:05,997 --> 00:53:07,837
that she would like to live...

749
00:53:09,038 --> 00:53:10,138
as who she is.

750
00:53:11,437 --> 00:53:12,837
Her strong will...

751
00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:18,047
made me see how silly I was to be devastated by all my losses.

752
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,777
Is that why you fell for her?

753
00:53:22,078 --> 00:53:23,518
Is this you writing a romance novel?

754
00:53:27,218 --> 00:53:28,218
Your Highness,

755
00:53:29,388 --> 00:53:30,957
forget about what you do not have...

756
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:33,428
and cherish what you have.

757
00:53:34,098 --> 00:53:37,598
You are someone who can do whatever you wish.

758
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:41,167
Someone who lights up the space she occupies.

759
00:53:42,397 --> 00:53:43,468
No one in the Palace...

760
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,607
has said that about me.

761
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,408
You must cherish yourself...

762
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:51,707
for others to follow suit.

763
00:54:00,457 --> 00:54:03,258
I apologize for using you...

764
00:54:03,788 --> 00:54:05,188
just because you are my first love.

765
00:54:05,988 --> 00:54:08,328
But as a psychiatrist, it is the least you can do.

766
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:10,997
Of course.

767
00:54:11,968 --> 00:54:13,167
I am more than all right.

768
00:54:13,937 --> 00:54:15,897
Just promise me that you will not run away...

769
00:54:16,238 --> 00:54:18,368
from your wedding again.

770
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:33,147
Your Highness.

771
00:54:36,518 --> 00:54:37,627
How...

772
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:40,497
How reckless can you be?

773
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:42,397
Do you not value your own self?

774
00:54:43,598 --> 00:54:46,198
It is far better than seeing you hurt.

775
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:52,008
I am sorry.

776
00:54:54,578 --> 00:54:57,408
The guilt is eating away at me.

777
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,758
I obviously misjudged you.

778
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:11,087
Please do not cry.

779
00:55:13,797 --> 00:55:14,797
Because you...

780
00:55:16,457 --> 00:55:17,627
are the most precious one...

781
00:55:18,768 --> 00:55:19,868
in this entire world.

782
00:55:35,218 --> 00:55:38,547
You healed two people at once this time.

783
00:55:39,247 --> 00:55:40,857
You get better each day.

784
00:55:41,687 --> 00:55:44,287
You should put two entries in your journal today.

785
00:55:44,288 --> 00:55:45,357
I healed three.

786
00:55:50,797 --> 00:55:52,828
The heart I truly wished to heal...

787
00:55:53,698 --> 00:55:55,098
was yours.

788
00:55:57,368 --> 00:55:59,067
Ever since the Princess came here,

789
00:55:59,638 --> 00:56:01,107
I felt bothered.

790
00:56:02,107 --> 00:56:03,678
For fear you would get hurt.

791
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,508
That the Princess' harsh words...

792
00:56:07,317 --> 00:56:08,678
would cut you deep.

793
00:56:14,817 --> 00:56:17,357
But I could do nothing for you.

794
00:56:18,428 --> 00:56:21,258
Which is why I focused on healing those two.

795
00:56:22,328 --> 00:56:25,198
As a person, not just a physician.

796
00:56:36,848 --> 00:56:38,477
When I administer acupuncture again,

797
00:56:41,547 --> 00:56:43,388
will you really leave me?

798
00:56:52,187 --> 00:56:53,227
No.

799
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:56,397
I do not wish to.

800
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:54,558
This litter is for me.

801
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:56,658
My gosh, no, Granny.

802
00:57:57,027 --> 00:57:58,187
What?

803
00:57:58,758 --> 00:57:59,788
Stay back.

804
00:58:02,397 --> 00:58:04,127
I do not see Her Highness.

805
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:07,468
She wishes to sort something out first.

806
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,868
Will she smash another of our doors?

807
00:58:13,437 --> 00:58:14,578
No.

808
00:58:16,078 --> 00:58:19,107
You are great at treating ailments of the heart.

809
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:24,618
The Princess has become a changed person.

810
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,288
Can we...

811
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:36,098
What?

812
00:58:41,598 --> 00:58:42,798
What is going on between them?

813
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:45,968
- Shall we find out? - What?

814
00:58:46,337 --> 00:58:47,877
Why not, young master?

815
00:58:48,377 --> 00:58:49,607
- Granny. - Granny?

816
00:58:53,777 --> 00:58:56,377
You did very well this time.

817
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:07,397
I have too much to take with me, so you can have it.

818
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:11,727
Okay. You should not be weighed down.

819
00:59:11,997 --> 00:59:13,098
Leave it with me.

820
00:59:19,008 --> 00:59:21,808
All the bad things I said to you.

821
00:59:23,078 --> 00:59:26,207
I am sorry. Do not let it get to you.

822
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:30,047
Okay.

823
00:59:30,348 --> 00:59:32,817
You should not forget either.

824
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:37,627
Focus on the good things about yourself...

825
00:59:38,087 --> 00:59:39,328
and praise them.

826
00:59:41,797 --> 00:59:44,897
Wait. Did you two rehearse this?

827
00:59:46,768 --> 00:59:47,768
Pardon?

828
00:59:58,008 --> 01:00:01,647
Why do you want to speak with me in this shaded room?

829
01:00:03,277 --> 01:00:05,218
I have something to give you.

830
01:00:06,388 --> 01:00:07,388
What is it?

831
01:00:15,727 --> 01:00:16,797
I was...

832
01:00:17,997 --> 01:00:19,127
that court maid.

833
01:00:22,638 --> 01:00:25,508
You saved me instead of heading straight to the Queen's chambers.

834
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:28,167
That is why you left the Medical Office.

835
01:00:29,477 --> 01:00:30,477
I am...

836
01:00:31,308 --> 01:00:33,277
the court maid you saved that day.

837
01:00:34,448 --> 01:00:35,448
I see.

838
01:00:37,587 --> 01:00:38,917
I found out later on...

839
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:42,187
and lived with the guilt until now.

840
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,928
A person's life should always come first.

841
01:00:47,328 --> 01:00:49,397
You need not feel guilty.

842
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:55,468
I heard physicians can easily get sick because...

843
01:00:55,738 --> 01:00:56,898
they touch almost everything.

844
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,638
Keep that on you at all times.

845
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:05,678
Thank you.

846
01:01:06,477 --> 01:01:07,747
For surviving.

847
01:01:10,247 --> 01:01:12,317
I feel good about myself.

848
01:01:13,988 --> 01:01:16,558
Why are you telling me this now?

849
01:01:17,158 --> 01:01:19,258
You were so mean to me,

850
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:23,397
so I thought I had wronged you tremendously in the past.

851
01:01:24,127 --> 01:01:26,828
You saved my life and did not recognize me.

852
01:01:27,297 --> 01:01:28,667
That really hurt.

853
01:01:30,038 --> 01:01:31,138
I had always wondered...

854
01:01:32,707 --> 01:01:34,477
what to say...

855
01:01:35,437 --> 01:01:36,908
if we ever met again.

856
01:01:39,848 --> 01:01:41,917
We should stay in touch, then.

857
01:01:42,718 --> 01:01:43,747
What?

858
01:01:44,087 --> 01:01:45,317
On paper,

859
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,758
we can talk about anything.

860
01:01:48,388 --> 01:01:51,126
I will buy some expensive paper...

861
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:54,328
and write to you first, so you had better reply.

862
01:01:55,997 --> 01:01:57,227
I will do that.

863
01:02:00,297 --> 01:02:01,337
What?

864
01:02:14,618 --> 01:02:16,247
- We promised. - Yes.

865
01:02:17,288 --> 01:02:19,848
- Goodbye. - Do not cry!

866
01:03:10,638 --> 01:03:11,667
Drink this.

867
01:03:12,238 --> 01:03:13,268
What is going on?

868
01:03:14,008 --> 01:03:16,578
Why are you bringing me alcohol?

869
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,388
Try some honey herbal punch.

870
01:03:30,957 --> 01:03:32,887
You can drink it all.

871
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:34,897
You have no taste for wine, dunce.

872
01:03:34,928 --> 01:03:36,527
That just ruined my palate.

873
01:03:37,268 --> 01:03:38,297
Darn it.

874
01:03:38,797 --> 01:03:41,037
Most medical texts go into great detail...

875
01:03:41,038 --> 01:03:43,037
about what happens if you drink wine like water.

876
01:03:43,038 --> 01:03:44,138
Well,

877
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:46,908
I believe it will keep me healthy forever.

878
01:03:48,977 --> 01:03:50,238
Physician!

879
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:53,877
A man is dying out here!

880
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:57,747
Physician!

881
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:03,788
This is...

882
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:46,368
How long have you been a physician here?

883
01:04:46,698 --> 01:04:47,997
I told you not to leave!

884
01:04:48,797 --> 01:04:49,897
No!

885
01:04:49,937 --> 01:04:51,538
Did you have another nightmare?

886
01:04:51,837 --> 01:04:53,907
Father, is what the governor said true?

887
01:04:53,908 --> 01:04:56,206
How long were you going to lie to me for?

888
01:04:56,207 --> 01:04:58,247
She might resent me.

889
01:04:58,408 --> 01:05:00,677
You are the one who raised her so well.

890
01:05:00,678 --> 01:05:02,018
Physician, I have bad news.

891
01:05:03,477 --> 01:05:04,887
A deadly herb.

892
01:05:04,888 --> 01:05:07,388
That is a very good idea.

893
01:05:07,718 --> 01:05:08,758
Father!

894
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:11,357
Not Ip Bun.

895
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,328
Her, I must protect.
