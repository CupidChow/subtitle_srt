- Move aside! - What is this...

7
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:03,638
Step aside!

8
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:05,068
What is this about?

9
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,467
Can you not see that we are treating patients?

10
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,867
Stay out of this!

11
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:13,077
You little... What is wrong with you?

12
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:15,748
Be quiet.

13
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:17,348

15

By now, your neck should be okay...

16
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:42,067
What happened? Why did it all come back?

17
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:44,538
Did you not follow the instructions I gave you?

18
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:48,148
No. I was very busy, and it was so itchy.

19
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:51,017
But it is much better than before, thanks to you.

20
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:55,317
I thought it would have all gone away by now.

21
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:59,258
Do you have worries that you are keeping all to yourself?

22
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:05,428
This is all my fault.

23
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:07,466
Without even asking you beforehand,

24
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:08,868
I applied salt water on it.

25
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:10,998
I am sorry.

26
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:13,936
You did it because it was unbearably itchy.

27
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:14,937
Do not beat yourself up.

28
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:18,538
Is your job at the paper mill too stressful?

29
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:21,148
Being overworked can aggravate skin problems.

30
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,177
No. No matter how stressful it gets,

31
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,917
I enjoy working there because I can get paper for my personal use.

32
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,657
I did hear that you wrote some novels.

33
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,187
I heard they were very engaging.

34
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:35,627
How come you never once showed them to me?

35
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,757
Oh, that is because...

36
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:42,828
I was afraid you would be angry if you read them.

37
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:45,967
I would be angry?

38
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:47,808
Why?

39
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,407
In any case, you do not need to know.

40
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,208
Please excuse me for a moment.

41
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,217

00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,287
Everyone cannot wait to read the next volume.

45
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,958
I am showing it to you first, my lady.

46
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,298
I am sure I will enjoy it. I will tell everyone about it.

47

Get back safely.

Lady Eun Woo, you read novels too?

50
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:30,476
While I was in Heuksan Island,

51
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,577
I started reading the ones that Ip Bun sent...

52
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:33,817
and got completely immersed in them.

53
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:50,127
Perhaps, the story will help me figure out So Cheon's situation.

54
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,036
Let me read it first. It may help me treat...

55
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:54,708
No, you cannot read this.

Why not?

00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:04,118
Well, you are...

58
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:06,618
You are very busy.

59
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:09,347
There are six volumes that precede this.

60
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,317
I will read it and tell you the story.

61
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:20,257
So I will hear the story in your voice?

62
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,937
I would love that.

63
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:43,757
Excuse me. Let me through.

64
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,118
Excuse me.

65
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,218
What is going on?

66
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:53,327
Her Highness the Princess?

67

What are you doing here?

68
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:03,207
What do you think I am doing?

69
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,308
Your Highness.

70
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:08,407
Compared to what you did to me,

71
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,777
this is nothing.

72
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:14,218
You dared to taint me, the Princess of this kingdom!

73
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,687
You ought to pay for what you did!

74
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,428
What? He tainted...

75

What do you mean, Your Highness?

79

Everyone is getting the wrong idea.

80
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:40,908
Have you forgotten what you did to me that day?

81
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:44,348
I will marry you.

82
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,817
I believe I have misheard you.

83
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:52,187
That was...

84
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,387
I clearly told you how I felt about it.

85
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,928
Does His Majesty know that you are here?

86
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,228
His Majesty sent me here.

88
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:15,808
Well done, Your Highness.

89
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:17,748
I will handle the rest.

90
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:19,178
I will see you back in the governor's office.

91

Hey! You are not the one giving us money.

103
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,706
The money comes from His Majesty's privy purse.

104
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:21,507
Why is the Medical Office evaluating us? On what grounds?

105
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:24,048
I will give you an example.

106

I heard you were a drunkard.

Then by any chance...

I hope you do not drink when you are treating your patients.

00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,988
By the looks of it, she is only being this way...

169
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,458
because of a grudge she holds.

170
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:05,098
What on earth did you and Princess Seo Yi do?

171
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:10,136
It is not like that. I truly feel misunderstood.

172
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,338
I will keep your secret.

173
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:15,277
Are you sure nothing happened between you two?

174
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:18,617
I first met her when she was young...

175
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:19,977
and have just recently reunited with her.

176
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,348
But she is here along with an inspector.

177
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:24,588
It means there is a connection.

178
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,156
Either the Princess gave the order,

179
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:27,958
or they are in it together.

180
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:29,286
Think long and hard...

181
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,358
before Gyesoo Clinic shuts down forever.

182
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,156
Princess Seo Yi, you, and the inspector.

183
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:37,198
The three of you must be connected somehow.

184
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:53,876
I do not wish to stay even less than ten minutes...

185
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:54,948
in a filthy room like this.

186
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:58,687
Hand over the money from the privy purse...

187
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:00,057
and bring me Yoo Se Yeob.

188
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:01,987
That is a royal asset...

189
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,198
which should be spent on what is appropriate.

190
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:08,198
Something like a magnificent royal wedding ceremony.

191
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:12,938
I see you know what is important.

192
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:17,068
However, I am concerned about anyone getting wind of our deal.

193
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:18,938
If word gets out,

194
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,907
you will not be able to win Yoo Se Yeob's heart.

195
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,078
Are you threatening me?

196
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:28,588
I would not even dream of it.

197
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:31,488
It was just to remind you in case you forgot.

198
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:34,688
Speak for yourself.

199
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,256
You are the one who promised me with certainty...

200
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,728
that I could return to Hanyang with Se Yeob.

201
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:42,198
If you fail to deliver, I will have your head.

202
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:55,708
A royal medical department in a tattered country village?

203
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:57,248
He aims...

204
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,988
to fill the Medical Office with his own people.

205
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:05,088
Not just Se Yeob, but also that Gye Ji Han.

206
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,587
We will have to make sure...

207
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:10,426
that they do not step foot in the Palace again.

208
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:11,627
Allow me to take on the task.

209
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:17,796
Do you have a plan in mind?

210
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,267
Before I take on the task, please give me your word.

211
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,637
If I am successful,

212
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,907
you will relinquish your position to me.

213
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:34,287
You dare to replace me?

214
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:36,688
No.

215
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,557
I wish to follow in your footsteps...

216
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,657
for you will have moved on to a much higher position.

217
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:54,767
Let me first hear about this plan of yours.

218
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:59,107
Your Majesty, in order to designate a clinic...

219
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:00,307
as a regional medical department,

220
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:03,177
it must meet the requirements.

221
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:06,817
Send Physician Jeon Kang Il to the village...

222
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:10,147
and have him run a fair and thorough investigation.

223
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,257
- Please accept our plea. - Please accept our plea.

224

(Governor's Office)

225
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:36,507
Inspectors from the Medical Office are here to audit Gyesoo Clinic?

226
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:41,587
It being a royal medical department means His Majesty favours the clinic,

227
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:42,988
so why is it under inspection?

228
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:47,387
And why did Princess Seo Yi have to accompany them?

229
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:49,688
I get it.

230
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:53,857
They got on the bad side of the higher-ups.

231
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:57,098
Being stationed here is only going to give me a headache.

232
00:14:57,738 --> 00:14:58,896
Do you not agree?

233
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,868
This will not help advance my career.

234
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:04,578
I would not know, my lord.

235
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,637
- You do not know? - No.

236

What is it that you know, then?

237
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,577
Does Gyesoo Clinic have many issues?

238
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,087
I highly doubt it.

239
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,287
It is the village's most sought-out clinic.

240
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:18,787
Is that so?

241
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:22,728
Inspectors of the Medical Office and Princess Seo Yi?

242

I am beginning my new post with two unwanted guests in my yard.

243
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:44,517
Unwanted?

244
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:46,417
Your Highness.

245
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:49,087
You just spoke ill of me. "Unwanted," did you say?

246
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:50,647
Pardon?

247
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:55,527
Oh, that? What I meant...

248
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:58,396
is that I am touched with unwanted humbleness...

249
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:01,267
by your decision to move to such a shabby village.

250

That is all I meant.

251
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,438
Court Lady Jung, maybe I should have him discarded.

252

If you discard the man in charge,

253

who will govern the village?

How are we to cope?

Whether we die from being untreated...

or from disobeying an order is the same.

I will not go home, so step aside!

The order comes from my superior.

266
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:12,337
Head on home.

267
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,867

He is a medicinal herb prodigy...

Do you have any idea how meticulous Lady Namhae is?

Not even the Medical Office would be this clean.

Who are you to judge me?

I have been running this clinic fair and square...

there is a huge disparity in the payment you receive.

For the same common cold,

you had Lord Choi pay you with a golden toad,

293

but Chun Sam received free treatment.

294

Is this what you mean by a fair and square...

operation?

Since Lord Choi could afford it,

his medicine was brewed...

00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:39,387
with expensive ingredients such as antler velvet.

Meanwhile, other patients were given ilmultang.

00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:28,968
How dare they.

333
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:33,198
Hurry along.

334
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,438
Continue.

335
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:41,478
Actually...

336
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:44,507
This woman is a problem too.

337
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,678
Her husband died, she cut ties with his family,

338
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:49,187
and as a widow...

339
00:20:49,188 --> 00:20:50,847
What does that have to do with the inspection?

340
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,227
How dare a widow go around pretending to be a physician?

341
00:20:56,228 --> 00:20:57,527
She does not pretend.

342
00:20:58,297 --> 00:20:59,297
She is a physician.

343
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,067
No man or woman...

344
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,337
wishes to lose a spouse.

345
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:08,208
We are not here...

346
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,468
to nitpick for personal reasons.

347
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,537
We are here to inspect to see if they are worthy...

348
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,878
to uphold His Majesty's command.

349
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:19,648
I apologize.

350
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:22,587
Bring this patient.

351
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,597
Skilled female practitioners are hard to find even in the Palace.

352
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,928
You are perfect in every way.

353
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:40,537
I am still very lacking.

354
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:44,107
(Excellent)

355
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:47,837

00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:49,478
Rice.

357
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:51,418
Rice.

358
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,346
You are doing a great job.

359
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,047
Do the whole yard for us.

360
00:21:57,218 --> 00:21:58,218
Oh, dear.

361
00:21:58,557 --> 00:22:00,158
I wish this were over.

362
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:08,327
My lady. Are you all right?

363
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:10,527
I am fine.

(Female, aged 46)

365
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:24,748
What are you doing?

366
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:26,678
I have other things to do.

367
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,218
(Female, aged 19)

368
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,418
There are patients who wish to see me.

369
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,027
I was not aware of that.

370
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,096
(Female, aged 19)

371
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:44,567
Sir, I brought the patient you wished to see.

372
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:47,238
At last.

373
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,567
Lee So Cheon.

374
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:00,448
So Cheon.

375
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:01,888
Physician Yoo.

376
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,857
Show your neck and arm.

377
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:17,267
My gosh.

378
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:21,908
What a dreadful sight.

379
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:25,307
How did this physician treat you?

380
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:26,908
Pardon?

381
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:28,807
Well...

382
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:31,177
He gave me good medicinal herbs and...

383
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:33,918
You are too squeamish to be able to drink a tonic.

384
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:37,948
I am asking if he treated you...

385
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,888
in any way before your condition worsened.

386
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:45,898
Well...

387
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:50,067
Once the pus dries,

388
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:51,898
I will prescribe an ointment.

389
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:54,498
The rash and heat should have died down by now.

390
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:05,517
You cannot get rid of your shadow.

391
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:08,547
As long as the sun rises,

392
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:11,117
your shadow will follow you around.

393
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:12,557
As long as you live,

394
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,428
your body will be attached to your soul.

395
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:21,527
If your heart aches,

396
00:24:22,297 --> 00:24:23,867
your body aches as well.

397
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:28,097
Why not use what is inside as ink...

398
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:30,307
and let it all out on paper?

399
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,978
You need not show it to anyone.

400
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,178
You can keep it to and for yourself.

401
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:39,117
How about you write your story?

402
00:24:43,388 --> 00:24:46,718
I am always ready to hear your story.

403
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:51,228
I do not know what inside is hurting you,

404
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:52,757
but that must come out...

405
00:24:53,257 --> 00:24:56,998
if the rash and pus are to disappear.

406
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:00,267
All the ex-Medical Office physician...

407
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:02,067
could suggest you do...

408
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,208
was write?

409
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,177
Well-known authors...

410
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:08,378
wrote and recited poems to control their emotions.

411
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:11,648
Also, her skin condition is not merely a skin condition.

412
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:14,347
How pathetic.

413
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,918
You wish to treat a skin condition with words, not medicine?

414
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,357
The late king also suffered from an itchy skin condition.

415
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:22,128
It got worse during a famine.

416
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:23,958
Why do you think that was so?

417
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,957
It was because of his agony.

418
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,128
(Simhwa: Agony, stress)

419
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:28,468
"Simhwa?"

420
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:33,337
How can the agony of a king compare to that of a mere commoner?

421
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:35,738
Her skin condition is caused by stress?

422
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,177
Have you been misleading people with nonsensical diagnoses...

423
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:40,408
such as these?

424
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:44,847
(Female, aged 19)

425
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:54,817
A tonic like Senghyulyoonbueum would have cured her right away.

426
00:25:58,797 --> 00:26:00,998
We tried that medicine long ago.

427
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:04,698
You should read the records more thoroughly.

428
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:09,066
Fine, if you were correct and this is a sickness of the soul,

429
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,138
you should have cured it too.

430
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,208
Do you call this cured?

431
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:15,378
You must learn to wait when treating an illness that takes time.

432
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:19,046
What physician always rushes to diagnose and treat?

433
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:20,248
Let go immediately!

434
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:24,317
You dare try to lecture a Medical Office inspector?

435
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:29,857
- Oh, no. - So Cheon.

436
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:38,867
Move aside.

437
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,367
What are you doing?

438
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:42,007
- Move them! - Sir.

439
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:08,998
Are you all right?

440
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,267
Yes. I am fine.

441
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,438
Wow. Just like my young master when he was in his prime.

442
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:19,837
Do you call yourself a physician?

443
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,948
While you hesitated instead of administering acupuncture,

444
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,317
she almost died.

445
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:38,479
They are cooked.

446
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:41,478
First come, first served.

447
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:44,148
We cooked a lot, so take your time.

448
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:48,088
This is much more fun than when we were at the clinic.

449
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:50,428
You should do this here every day.

450
00:27:51,158 --> 00:27:53,798
Shall we? Tomorrow, shall we cook Jeon?

451
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,627
- Yes! - Sounds good!

452
00:27:55,628 --> 00:27:56,968
Are you all here to eat?

453
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:57,969
We might go bankrupt!

454
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:00,799
We will not go bankrupt. We will become rich.

455
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:04,108
I said we have nothing to worry.

456
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:05,979
Even without the clinic,

457
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,648
we will all find a way to go on.

458
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:11,979
It is like seeing my love while picking berries.

459
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:16,388
So sour.

460
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,959
Go along with your dad.

461
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,928
I really do not think you should do this.

462
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,199
Darn you.

463
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,567
You have not met the new district governor, have you?

464
00:28:33,568 --> 00:28:36,238
He is ugly, and his temper is just as nasty.

465
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:39,878
Plus, he is extra interested in you because of the inspection.

466
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,108
Would he be any different from the last one?

467
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:44,549
They are all the same.

468
00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:48,848
Physician Gye. This one is different, okay?

469
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:50,917
His ancestors were all ministers,

470
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:52,959
and he hails from a rich family in Suncheon.

471
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,759
Also...

472
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:57,528
He had a younger brother...

473
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,228
who was caught eloping with his love.

474
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:01,828
There is talk he beat his own brother to death.

475
00:29:06,098 --> 00:29:08,499
What is the new district governor's name?

476
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:11,309
It is Ahn Hak Soo.

477
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,039
Ahn Hak Soo?

478
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,809
Is that really his name?

479
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:19,749
Do you know him?

480
00:29:21,148 --> 00:29:22,249
How would I know him?

481
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,289
Thank you.

482
00:29:28,118 --> 00:29:29,128
Here you go.

483
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:32,258
Sure. What do you need treated?

484
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:33,259
My sore knees.

485
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,938
- Oh, boy. - You are back.

486
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:43,337
Gosh, my back.

487
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:46,738
Those scoundrels made such a scene, saying they had to inspect us.

488
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:48,209
They will not even let us treat our patients!

489
00:29:48,408 --> 00:29:49,608
Those scoundrels!

490
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:54,148
It is your fault for mentioning the money from the King's privy purse.

491
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:58,049
You certainly have a knack for causing problems.

492
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:01,689
Ip Bun, you must watch your mouth from now on.

493
00:30:01,818 --> 00:30:03,289
And do not go out by yourself.

494
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,098
If anyone asks you what your mother's name is...

495
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:13,868
Forget it. Who would ask you?

496
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,809
What? So I am not to speak or to go out?

497
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:19,709
What will happen if I do? Will I die?

498
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:23,279
You brat. Do not forget what I said.

499
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:26,019
You did a foolish thing in Hanyang too.

500
00:30:26,078 --> 00:30:28,678
I heard even Lady Namhae nearly lost all her money because of you.

501
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:30,949
Why would you bring that up now?

502
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,358
Hey!

503
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:37,489
Behave yourself first! Gye Ji Han, you dunderhead.

504
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:39,298
Granny, you are the best!

505
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,299
Do not call me that. Say that to him!

506
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,367
How is So Cheon?

507
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:46,098
Do not worry. She is asleep now.

508
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:47,338
You!

509
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:51,009
Do you now remember what you did to the Princess?

510
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,838
Goodness. I thought you were a dunce.

511
00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:56,509
But you have got some nerve.

512
00:30:57,148 --> 00:31:01,019
They say it is always the quiet ones you have to watch out for.

513
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:03,648
Clearly, he knows that he is good-looking.

514
00:31:03,848 --> 00:31:05,189
- Womaniser. - Womaniser.

515
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:07,289
Physician Yoo is a womaniser.

516
00:31:08,828 --> 00:31:11,558
What? I told you.

517
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:14,799
In Hanyang, women were all over...

518
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:17,428
Right. In the palace,

519
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:19,969
court maids from that corner to all the way over here...

520
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:23,138
would faint at the sight of him.

521
00:31:24,368 --> 00:31:25,608
Hey, when did I...

522
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:27,979
Lady Eun Woo.

523
00:31:28,908 --> 00:31:29,949
You know that my heart is...

524
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:40,189
She is upset. Gosh, you fool.

525
00:31:42,888 --> 00:31:44,088
- Womaniser. - Womaniser.

526
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:45,798
(Hot New Release, Volume 6 of "The Story of So Cheon")

527
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,097
All right!

528
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:51,128
Get a taste of everything that could happen between a man and a woman.

529
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:54,568
The protagonist of the story, Poong,

530
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:57,309
causes the whirlwind of love.

531
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:01,638
This one book can easily beat every novel in the world.

532
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:04,978
It is the greatest romance novel in Joseon!

533
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:05,979
("The Story of So Cheon")

534
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:06,979
Come and get it!

535
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,748
- Run! - I must get this.

536
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:12,358
- Here. - I want a copy too.

537
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:19,799
Your Highness.

538
00:32:22,668 --> 00:32:24,568
How much longer will you stay here?

539
00:32:25,229 --> 00:32:27,338
It has already been four hours.

540
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:31,269
You were worried that you would be spanked for reading such a book.

541
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,479
No!

542
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:35,279
Pardon me? What is the matter?

543
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:38,449
"I will teach you a lesson."

544
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:43,789
What did I do this time?

545
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:47,489
"I will teach your heart a lesson."

546
00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:49,729
"Or will you accept my love?"

547
00:32:54,628 --> 00:32:56,598
My gosh, this is so much fun!

548
00:32:57,199 --> 00:33:00,368
This is so engaging. Why did not discover this sooner?

549
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,239
Court Lady Jung, what have you been doing?

550
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:06,039
Right, it is all my fault.

551
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:10,678
In the palace, I only read conduct books for ladies.

552
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:12,519
It is fun to spend some time outside the palace walls.

553
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:16,388
Especially Poong, the main character.

554
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:19,158
He makes my heart flutter.

555
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:24,028
I suppose you have no idea how that feels.

556
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:25,158
What do you mean I have no idea?

557
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:28,798
For a long time, I have had romantic feelings for...

558
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:33,368
Actually, you are right. I have no idea.

559
00:33:36,508 --> 00:33:39,738
This will not do. I must buy every book here.

560
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:41,908
Every single book here?

561
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:44,479
Especially this series. I love it so much.

562
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:47,249
Hold on. Who wrote this?

563
00:33:47,548 --> 00:33:48,988
("The Story of So Cheon," Volume 1)

564
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,387
I see. Lee So Cheon.

565
00:33:51,388 --> 00:33:53,419
I like you, Lee So Cheon.

566
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:58,328
Now, I shall go see Yoo Se Yeob.

567
00:33:58,928 --> 00:33:59,999
All of a sudden?

568
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:03,698
I came all the way here. I cannot believe he has not visited me once.

569
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,439
But I want to see him.

570
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,238
I shall visit him since I wish to see him.

571
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:12,138
Your Highness, I am afraid someone will hear you.

572
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:16,109
Physician Jeon.

573
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:21,149
Please spare me a moment.

574
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:27,218
I did not know I would meet you again here.

575
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:30,859
And I did not imagine you would be such a skilled physician.

576
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:35,729
I, too, had no idea we would meet again under these circumstances.

577
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:38,928
Are you referring to the inspection?

578
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:41,439
Who are you...

579
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:44,238
Who are you, really?

580
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:46,339
Pardon me?

581
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,209
I...

582
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:50,448
really am not sure.

583
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:53,979
I am not on his side.

584
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:55,919
I am a nice person.

585
00:34:56,948 --> 00:34:58,347
You seem nice, but...

586
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:02,019
We are not here to nitpick for personal reasons.

587
00:35:02,258 --> 00:35:04,058
You seem like a fair, just person, but...

588
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:07,098
You dare try to lecture a Medical Office inspector?

589
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:09,098
You can be very harsh and cold.

590
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:11,899
Especially to Physician Yoo.

591
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:16,508
May I ask you why?

592
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:20,508
You always surprise me by being so unpredictable.

593
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:25,078
I thought you would be excited to see me again as well.

594
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:29,749
I am a physician too, before I am an inspector.

595
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:32,958
I, too, hope that the patients can receive the treatment they need...

596
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,758
and recover soon.

597
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:38,589
I truly hope you know that.

598
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,899
What do you mean by that?

599
00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:46,269
I am telling you that I will carry out the inspection fairly.

600
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:48,999
That is what you wanted to hear. Am I wrong?

601
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,439
The records tell me that you are an incredibly talented physician.

602
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:58,008
You will save many lives.

603
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:05,488
I owe it all to Physician Yoo.

604
00:36:05,988 --> 00:36:07,789
He taught me all the medical skills that I know.

605
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:16,868
What are those two talking about?

606
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:20,138
Was she not glued to Yoo Se Yeob earlier?

607
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:24,169
Your Highness, about Jeon Kang Il...

608
00:36:24,368 --> 00:36:25,939
Can we really trust him?

609
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:31,448
He truly gets on my nerves.

610
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:33,618
Shall I tell him?

611
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:39,689
Oh, Your Highness the Princess!

612
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:41,319
What a coincidence.

613
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:44,258
Who are you? Do I know you?

614
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:47,629
I used to work in the Medical Office.

615
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:50,569
I was one of the most handsome men in the palace.

616
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,598
Once you see my face, you can never forget me.

617
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,339
He is a mere physician.

618
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,609
He visited the palace with Physician Yoo.

619
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:04,649
Well, you look familiar for some reason.

620
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:06,678
Have we met before?

621
00:37:10,848 --> 00:37:12,319
Do you know each other?

622
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:14,589
How would I know...

623
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,658
a physician working in the boondocks?

624
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:18,927
Boondocks? Come on.

625
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:20,758
It is much better than working in the Medical Office.

626
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:23,769
What did that dunce...

627
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:25,967
do to you, Your Highness?

628
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:28,269
I will teach him a serious lesson.

629
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:29,638
Dunce?

630
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,709
Why are you calling Yoo Se Yeob like that?

631
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:36,609
Oh, by any chance...

632
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:39,918
Do you have a crush on him?

633
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,589
He had a crush on me first.

634
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:46,519
I am Yoo Se Yeob's first love.

635
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:49,658
I knew it! That dunce...

636
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:51,328
I totally knew it.

637
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:53,827
Your Highness, do not worry about a thing now.

638
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:56,899
I will make sure you win his heart.

639
00:37:57,169 --> 00:38:00,297
First, return to the palace...

640
00:38:00,298 --> 00:38:02,838
with those inspector jerks. Then...

641
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,908
He is all talk, Your Highness.

642
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:06,879
Do not listen to him.

643
00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:10,979
Goodness. How rude.

644
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:13,019
You do not even know me well.

645
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:15,447
Kind words...

646
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:17,689
express the warmth of your heart.

647
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:20,919
That is how you can win someone's heart.

648
00:38:21,158 --> 00:38:24,027
Kind words? That is rich coming from you.

649
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:25,459
Everyone will laugh at you.

650
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:28,859
Kind words? What is that?

651
00:38:31,968 --> 00:38:33,798
It is such a beautiful day, right?

652
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:35,569
Whatever.

653
00:38:37,508 --> 00:38:39,069
You said you used to work in the Medical Office.

654
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:41,638
Did you wrong Court Lady Jung in the past or something?

655
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:43,709
Why does she hate you so much?

656
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:46,117
Is it because you work in the boondocks?

657
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:48,149
Use kind words, please.

658
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:50,847
Well, I am not sure.

659
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:54,059
I suppose she gets shy when she sees a handsome man.

660
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,758
I said I would escort her to the governor's office by myself.

661
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:03,698
Why are you following us?

662
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:04,928
I was just...

663
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:10,468
Wait, did I make some kind of mistake in the past?

664
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:12,208
Did I borrow money from you?

665
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:13,379
What is going on?

666
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:16,109
I feel like it is something I would read about in a romance novel.

667
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:34,629
You woke up.

668
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:38,298
Physician Yoo,

669
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:41,439
I have put you in a tight spot.

670
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,109
I apologize.

671
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:53,919
Anyone bound for greatness will accept the hardships...

672
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:57,649
and use what is learned to become a better person.

673
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:01,189
For that reason, you do not have to worry about me.

674
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:06,059
But only if you see me as someone bound for greatness.

675
00:40:07,598 --> 00:40:08,598
Physician Yoo...

676
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:11,169
Are you saying...

677
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:13,039
you do not?

678
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:15,439
Do you see me as someone petty?

679
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:18,638
Of course not.

680
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:21,078
Because you are a great man,

681
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:23,809
I get to rest in your shadows.

682
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:29,749
You really have a way with words.

683
00:40:30,348 --> 00:40:31,888
Writing is what you must do.

684
00:40:33,488 --> 00:40:34,959
I am sorry, Physician Yoo.

685
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:37,689
But I...

686
00:40:45,468 --> 00:40:48,569
I will try to muster up the courage.

687
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:52,439
Sure.

688
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,709
Have you decided what to write about?

689
00:40:57,408 --> 00:40:59,749
Just like you suggested,

690
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,149
I have been writing about my life.

691
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:04,988
A piece that is only for my eyes to see.

692
00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:09,658
Good. And you will soon be free of your illness.

693
00:41:29,408 --> 00:41:31,478
What could be the reason...

694
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:32,749
behind the slow progress of her skin condition?

695
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:36,218
Well...

696
00:41:37,488 --> 00:41:40,658
Tomorrow, we should visit the paper mill she works at.

697
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:42,589
Why?

698
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:45,589
Because there is no reason for her condition to worsen.

699
00:41:47,528 --> 00:41:49,098
Could she be working too hard?

700
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:51,298
Or could there be another reason?

701
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:52,968
We should check.

702
00:41:53,798 --> 00:41:56,908
Right. That sounds like a good idea.

703
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:11,249
Wait.

704
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:19,129
Physician Yoo.

705
00:42:20,198 --> 00:42:21,198
Physician Yoo!

706
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:23,028
Physician Yoo, please come out.

707
00:42:23,298 --> 00:42:24,629
Where are you?

708
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:30,468
Hurry!

709
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:34,709
What is the matter?

710
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:40,178
Physician Yoo, is So Cheon not here?

711
00:42:40,678 --> 00:42:41,948
What is the matter?

712
00:42:42,218 --> 00:42:43,818
She is Jung Soon,

713
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:44,819
So Cheon's colleague at the paper mill.

714
00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:46,718
So Cheon is gone.

715
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:51,089
Hold on.

716
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:03,939
Calm yourself down and tell me what happened.

717
00:43:05,968 --> 00:43:07,309
It was going to be a busy day at the paper mill,

718
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:09,578
so I went to work at the crack of dawn.

719
00:43:10,209 --> 00:43:13,249
I could not shake the image of So Cheon leaving without a word.

720
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:17,289
She seemed determined to do something.

721
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:25,859
So...

722
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:33,039
Did she not head home?

723
00:43:33,499 --> 00:43:35,698
We are coming from her house...

724
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:38,169
and anywhere else she could have gone.

725
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:41,609
For a few days now,

726
00:43:41,908 --> 00:43:43,979
she has been saying that life is taking a toll on her.

727
00:43:48,618 --> 00:43:52,019
Could she be thinking of doing the unimaginable?

728
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:58,689
She is someone we think of as family.

729
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,229
If something were to happen to her,

730
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,729
I could not live with the guilt...

731
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:07,499
Goodness.

732
00:44:07,698 --> 00:44:09,098
- Lay her down inside. - Sure.

733
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,459
Lady Eun Woo.

734
00:44:36,598 --> 00:44:37,598
I...

735
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:41,098
I could not tell her that it would not happen.

736
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:46,508
Could she be thinking of doing the unimaginable?

737
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:48,809
I know I should not have,

738
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:51,109
but dark thoughts clouded my mind,

739
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:54,019
and I could not give her an answer.

740
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:00,689
It was pathetic of me.

741
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:05,658
It is not pathetic at all.

742
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:07,399
You were also...

743
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:09,928
just as worried.

744
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:13,399
Rather than blaming yourself,

745
00:45:13,899 --> 00:45:16,039
we should do what must be done.

746
00:45:23,078 --> 00:45:25,379
I will head to So Cheon's house.

747
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:28,019
She might have come back.

748
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:30,519
And you...

749
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:33,658
You should care for her friend.

750
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:36,988
Do not overexert yourself though.

751
00:45:39,488 --> 00:45:40,828
Can I play with you?

752
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:42,059
- Of course. - Sure.

753
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,069
Sure.

754
00:45:44,669 --> 00:45:46,737
I will make it stand strong.

755
00:45:46,738 --> 00:45:47,738
Here.

756
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:48,999
What...

757
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:52,439
Mother!

758
00:45:53,678 --> 00:45:54,979
Mother.

759
00:45:56,678 --> 00:45:57,879
Father!

760
00:46:08,988 --> 00:46:09,988
You there.

761
00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:12,189
Are you all right?

762
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:29,948
Physician Yoo.

763
00:46:31,048 --> 00:46:32,348
Where is So Cheon?

764
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,249
Everyone is looking for her,

765
00:46:34,848 --> 00:46:37,149
so please gather your strength.

766
00:46:40,419 --> 00:46:41,488
I should have...

767
00:46:42,419 --> 00:46:44,289
treated her more thoroughly.

768
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:46,229
Please do not say that.

769
00:46:47,229 --> 00:46:49,698
I heard that you and the people at this clinic...

770
00:46:49,899 --> 00:46:51,769
took great care of her.

771
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:57,709
Here is some food for you.

772
00:46:58,238 --> 00:46:59,238
Thank you.

773
00:47:01,408 --> 00:47:03,177
Come on. I will walk you home.

774
00:47:03,178 --> 00:47:04,178
Of course.

775
00:47:04,548 --> 00:47:05,548
Hurry along.

776
00:47:06,048 --> 00:47:07,118
Let us go.

777
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:10,919
So Cheon has a strong soul,

778
00:47:11,348 --> 00:47:13,789
so nothing will happen to her.

779
00:47:22,428 --> 00:47:25,297
Get some more rest and leave us to find So Cheon.

780
00:47:25,298 --> 00:47:26,439
Also, do not worry too much.

781
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:30,808
These were So Cheon's.

782
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:33,379
I brought them with me hoping that they could help us.

783
00:47:33,939 --> 00:47:36,278
They would. I am glad you brought them.

784
00:47:42,118 --> 00:47:43,448
(The Story of So Cheon)

785
00:47:56,098 --> 00:47:58,899
The pages have been painted over.

786
00:47:59,468 --> 00:48:00,468
I wonder why.

787
00:48:03,738 --> 00:48:06,439
Lately, she started to passionately write in her notebook,

788
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:10,008
but then she painted over the pages with ink.

789
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:12,109
Maybe that was when...

790
00:48:13,578 --> 00:48:15,649
she decided to end her life.

791
00:48:18,618 --> 00:48:20,419
I should have asked once more.

792
00:48:21,718 --> 00:48:22,718
If only I had asked her...

793
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:25,089
why she was doing this.

794
00:48:26,229 --> 00:48:27,229
I do not deserve...

795
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:29,658
to be her friend.

796
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:33,539
Please do not think that way.

797
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,069
Young Master!

798
00:48:42,908 --> 00:48:43,908
So Cheon!

799
00:48:44,348 --> 00:48:45,608
What happened to her?

800
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:46,649
Lay her down over here.

801
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:54,559
What happened?

802
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:57,158
Children found her washed up on a river bank.

803
00:48:57,789 --> 00:48:59,588
She had a pulse although weak,

804
00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:01,899
so I brought her here instead of the governor's office.

805
00:49:02,928 --> 00:49:04,569
We do not have any first-aid medicine.

806
00:49:05,428 --> 00:49:07,197
I have some haedokdan on hand.

807
00:49:07,198 --> 00:49:08,738
Bring me that and some ginger water.

808
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:09,968
Got it.

809
00:49:10,939 --> 00:49:12,669
Should I carry her inside?

810
00:49:13,008 --> 00:49:14,678
Not when the flow of her energy and blood is unstable.

811
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:18,378
Lady Namhae, bring me warm water. Ip Bun, a cotton comforter.

812
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:20,118
Granny, a dry cloth.

813
00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:30,028
Halt!

814
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,129
Remove that man.

815
00:49:38,368 --> 00:49:39,428
Step back!

816
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:47,638
Good. Her pulse is returning.

817
00:49:51,548 --> 00:49:53,749
Do not just stand there! Stop them.

818
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:00,118
What did I do wrong?

819
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:03,059
Why are you stopping us from treating a gravely ill patient?

820
00:50:04,089 --> 00:50:05,189
That patient...

821
00:50:06,158 --> 00:50:07,298
tried to kill herself.

822
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,439
I will look into this case carefully.

823
00:50:16,738 --> 00:50:18,008
Suicide?

824
00:50:18,408 --> 00:50:20,479
There is no way So Cheon would do that.

825
00:50:22,138 --> 00:50:25,448
You could have cured her sooner with acupuncture.

826
00:50:26,048 --> 00:50:27,749
You missed out on the timing...

827
00:50:28,048 --> 00:50:30,048
and that caused your patient to try to commit suicide.

828
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:33,258
Acupuncture is not the only treatment.

829
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:34,858
Physician Yoo tried other...

830
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:37,789
Other treatments? By trying to heal the heart?

831
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:40,328
Was leaving her until her condition got this bad...

832
00:50:41,028 --> 00:50:42,298
really a treatment?

833
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:47,238
Take him to the governor's office immediately!

834
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:50,238
I will investigate him there in person and in private.

835
00:50:52,769 --> 00:50:54,677
- What does that mean? - No, wait. Young master.

836
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:56,979
Young master. Wait a minute.

837
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,750
A special private investigation?

838
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,290
Yes. He yelled so ferociously and dragged Physician Yoo off.

839
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:08,059
With you not here,

840
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,261
we could not complain or fight back!

841
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,930
I worked hard on a special patient to make sure...

842
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:15,329
our clinic did not get shut down.

843
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:16,971
We must go and save him.

844
00:51:18,401 --> 00:51:21,971
I think he has a personal grudge with Physician Yoo.

845
00:51:23,071 --> 00:51:25,040
This investigator fool.

846
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:27,381
I played along because I thought it was for show.

847
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,611
He keeps going further and further.

848
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,810
We should go to the governor's office.

849
00:51:31,951 --> 00:51:34,950
Physician Yoo tends to get fired up when he is alone...

850
00:51:34,951 --> 00:51:36,281
with the investigator.

851
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:39,120
- Yes, My lady. We should go. - Yes.

852
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,960
- Go. - Come along.

853
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:46,431
(Governor's Office)

854
00:51:47,701 --> 00:51:50,870
Jeon Kang Il, that fool. What? "A lavish wedding ceremony?"

855
00:51:51,031 --> 00:51:52,370
What a joke.

856
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:54,670
He dare treat my future husband like a criminal?

857
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,051
There is no way...

858
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:11,390
So Cheon considered suicide.

859
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:16,591
How long will you make your patients suffer for your arrogance?

860
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:23,131
(I have become...)

861
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:27,670
I have become...

862
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,040
one with my illness and live because I cannot die.

863
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,511
Now...

864
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,980
I will become one with the river and die because I cannot live.

865
00:52:38,551 --> 00:52:41,281
(Live because I cannot die, die because I cannot live)

866
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:43,920
It is a suicide note.

867
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,790
It was found on her.

868
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:52,330
You cannot, my lady.

869
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,870
I have something to tell you. Please let me in!

870
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,870
Get out of the way. Move.

871
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:01,741
- You punk. - How dare you?

872
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:04,840
What woman dares to enter...

873
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:07,980
the governor's office this late and raise her voice?

874
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:11,510
Why have you not dragged them out yet?

875
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:13,111
She is the daughter of the previous governor.

876
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,681
What?

877
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:17,821
The previous governor's daughter.

878
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,261
Oh, goodness, I see.

879
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:23,361
If that is the case,

880
00:53:23,531 --> 00:53:27,201
that is even more reason for you to remain in your room.

881
00:53:27,801 --> 00:53:30,701
I heard she was a widow, but her hair is braided like a virgin's.

882
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,170
That is not at all ladylike.

883
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:38,540
An innocent physician was brought in.

884
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,181
Since when have investigations been done this willy-nilly?

885
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:43,411
Who are you...

886
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:46,849
Me? Were you saying that about me?

887
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:48,480
She said that about you!

888
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:54,390
What the...

889
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,591
Oh, dear.

890
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,991
You must be the new district governor.

891
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:03,701
My eyes have gotten dim with age, and I did not recognize you.

892
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:06,301
You are Governor Ahn Hak Soo, yes?

893
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:11,539
Oh, you must be the people from that darn Gyesoo Clinic...

894
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,281
that cause unrest with your stupid antics.

895
00:54:17,181 --> 00:54:19,881
You are a fellow physician, so I will hear what you have to say.

896
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:23,390
Come in.

897
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:07,361
You stand to benefit the most once this investigation ends.

898
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,830
Turning the man I like into a criminal will benefit me?

899
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:13,971
What Yoo Se Yeob last said to you in the Palace.

900
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,670
Do you remember what it was?

901
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,480
I will marry you.

902
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,810
My home is at Sorak Village.

903
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:27,580
And I have much to do at the clinic there.

904
00:55:27,651 --> 00:55:30,420
So please rescind your command.

905
00:55:36,721 --> 00:55:38,491
You saw us?

906
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,761
Yoo Se Yeob considers this village clinic his home...

907
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,700
- and the people his family. - What?

908
00:55:45,701 --> 00:55:47,971
What would happen if you forced him to stay away?

909
00:55:49,341 --> 00:55:51,241
He would fight even harder to stay.

910
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:53,880
You must destroy what he cherishes...

911
00:55:53,881 --> 00:55:55,480
to make him leave voluntarily.

912
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,911
- Voluntarily? - Yes, voluntarily.

913
00:56:00,221 --> 00:56:02,580
Yoo Se Yeob will become yours and yours alone.

914
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:06,861
You have no need for anything that keeps him from caring for you.

915
00:56:07,491 --> 00:56:11,531
Are you saying you will see to it he will have nothing left but me?

916
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,870
Is that not how far you are willing to go to get him?

917
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:19,800
You could find another way.

918
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:21,170
Did you have to lock him up?

919
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,011
You must release him as soon as the investigation is over.

920
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,210
Do you understand?

921
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,420
Physician Yoo.

922
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:39,920
Lady Eun Woo.

923
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:42,960
Cheer up.

924
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,790
You did your best to treat So Cheon.

925
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,201
Everyone who knows you knows that.

926
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:54,401
The investigator has to be mistaken.

927
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,710
He is berating me, saying he found a suicide note.

928
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,380
Now...

929
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,651
I will become one with the river and die because I cannot live.

930
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:14,420
Could So Cheon really have tried to kill herself?

931
00:57:15,321 --> 00:57:17,361
I cannot believe it.

932
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:19,531
Right before, we cracked jokes...

933
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:22,000
and even laughed.

934
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:28,201
This suicide note.

935
00:57:28,971 --> 00:57:30,611
Do you not find it strange?

936
00:57:42,681 --> 00:57:46,390
You delayed the treatment of a suffering patient.

937
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:49,790
You only talked about treating and curing her.

938
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,431
Do you admit to masquerading...

939
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,901
as a physician when you lack the ability?

940
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,200
He did his best to...

941
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:58,230
Physician Yoo was the one who treated Lee So Cheon.

942
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,640
I will hear from him.

943
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:09,080
Treating So Cheon's illness from the root cause...

944
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:11,411
takes time.

945
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:12,580
No.

946
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:15,520
Your arrogance caused a patient's death.

947
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,650
Did you not put the value of your treatment...

948
00:58:18,651 --> 00:58:20,919
over the suffering of your patient?

949
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,221
That is preposterous.

950
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,531
Does a physician who cannot save a patient...

951
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,060
deserve to be a physician?

952
00:58:32,071 --> 00:58:33,471
Can you truly...

953
00:58:34,201 --> 00:58:35,440
call yourself a physician?

954
00:58:43,911 --> 00:58:44,980
Then show me.

955
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,420
Administer acupuncture...

956
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,451
right here and now.

957
00:58:58,631 --> 00:58:59,631
Why?

958
00:59:01,401 --> 00:59:02,401
You cannot do it?

959
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,130
I no longer administer acupuncture.

960
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:33,290
You no longer do it? The truth is, you cannot do it.

961
00:59:33,761 --> 00:59:35,730
It is So Cheon's handwriting.

962
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:37,200
(I have become...)

963
00:59:37,201 --> 00:59:40,499
As a psychiatrist, I will help So Cheon so she can recover on her own.

964
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,841
If I fail, I will give up everything.

965
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,210
So I can...

966
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,210
do something for you too.

967
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,139
What is Physician Yoo planning?

968
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,911
Why did he tell us to cook a feast so early?

969
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:53,209
I bet you are so grateful to me...

970
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:54,221
that you are at a loss for words.

971
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:56,920
All of us will help you.

972
00:59:57,591 --> 00:59:59,321
Will you do me a favour?
