I must deal the final blow.

00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:17,360
To do that, I need to get leverage.

Chil Sung.

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,100
Do something for me.

I have a lot to do, but these two do not.

Chil Sung. Your face is an odd colour.

You must have indigestion.

26

Lady Eun Woo can cure that with a few needles, no problem.

Right.

District Governor Ahn...

00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,370
Then you can play hooky...

37
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,570
and claim you got medical treatment.

38
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,570
What do you think of my prescription?

39

are you two constantly in this situation?

Get some rest.

45

Lady Eun Woo, how about a stroll after work?

46
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:17,810
Sounds good.

47
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:22,780
Oh, dear...

48
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,649
Are they not being too blatant?

49
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,949
If some other constables were here,

50
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,860
they would have been caught right away.

51

Forget it.

There we go.

53
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,079
A letter from His Majesty the King.

54
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,449
Shall I pass it on to Physician Yoo?

55
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,490
It is for you, Physician Gye.

56
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,240
The royal court...

57
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:31,079
is flooded with petitions that Yoo Se Yeob's title...

58
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,680
and records be annulled.

59
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,180
Sorak Village's governor wrote...

60
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,050
Se Yeob used his ties to my family...

61
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:40,560
to take a mourning widow.

62
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,190
Even if he is blameless,

63
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,860
everyone here believes the dirty rumour...

64
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,159
and is speaking of it freely, and it is a great concern.

65
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,500
That scumbag.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,529
Ahn Hak Soo...

67
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,539
I will do what I can to control it,

68
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,839
but neither you nor Se Yeob should do anything...

69
00:05:58,269 --> 00:05:59,709
to give them cause or reason.

70
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,709
I am still in desperate need of Yoo Se Yeob the physician.

71
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,849
I will protect him in court.

72
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,649
I need you to protect him where he is.

73
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,159
They want his records annulled?

74
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Physician Gye.

75
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:21,599
Is something the matter?

76
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:25,469
Well, no, not yet.

77
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,480
Physician Gye. What does it mean to have...

78
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:43,320
your records annulled?

79
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,089
All we worked for...

80
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,389
will be in vain.

81
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:57,070
He came first in the Liberal Arts and Medical Exams...

82
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,370
and then became Head Acupuncturist.

83
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,170
His achievements alone are many times greater than most,

84
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,440
and this means all that could be erased from the record.

85
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,980
Can it never be reversed?

86
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,079
That will be hard.

87
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,279
One thing is for sure.

88
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,690
He will not be able to enter the palace again.

89
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,589
He and His Majesty may be friends,

90
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,360
but he cannot be reinstated once all the records are annulled.

91
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,199
Then what should we do?

92
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,969
What if that truly happens to Physician Yoo?

93
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:39,139
They received one petition.

94
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,909
We will make sure it does not happen. It can be done.

95
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,420
Gosh, this darn bug.

96
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,099
Hey, Jang Gun.

97
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
What is the matter?

98
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:05,699
- Ta-Da. - Oh, my.

99
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,409
Hey, Chil Sung.

100
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,380
You seem worried. What is the matter?

101
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,279
I bet he is confused, having to switching sides.

102
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I feel bad for him.

103
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:25,019
That is why I made this spicy chicken dish for you.

104
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,190
Eat this and forget about everything.

105
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,219
When you are worried about something,

106
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,360
spicy food is the best remedy.

107
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,360
Exactly. It can cure all sorts of psychiatric ailments.

108
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,630
Lady Namhae makes the best spicy chicken in Joseon!

109
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,070
Come on. Everything she makes tastes the best.

110
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,940
It is spicy and delicious.

111
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,639
Have this drumstick. Here.

112
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:46,339
Eat up.

113
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,909
Well, go ahead and eat. I cannot eat this.

114
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,980
Hey, do not worry.

115
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:54,720
You must remain faithful.

116
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,620
Your boss will not be there forever.

117
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,590
That position changes all the time,

118
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,260
but you will always be a constable working for Sorak Village.

119
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,000
Gosh, my tongue!

120
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,260
It is so spicy.

121
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,330
This is too spicy.

122
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,429
Oh, Lady Eun Woo. Come and have some spicy chicken.

123
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,139
I will pass. I do not have much of an appetite.

124
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,809
- Lady Eun Woo. - Try this...

125
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,380
Is she not feeling well?

126
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,450
I know what is happening.

127
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,360
District Governor Ahn is holding a grudge because of Ip Bun.

128
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,299
I bet he submitted this petition to get you in trouble.

129
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,299
If you are not careful, you could end up in deep trouble.

130
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
You think so?

131
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
"You think so?"

132
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,439
Snap out of it!

133
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,179
The royal court takes moral and ethical misconduct very seriously.

134
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:57,510
If things go south,

135
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,049
you will have to quit being a physician.

136
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,179
Why should I be worried when what they are insisting on is untrue?

137
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,419
If I explain everything, all will be fine.

138
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:10,330
Oh, dear. This is the problem with bookworms like you.

139
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,960
You know nothing about politics.

140
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:14,929
Destroying you and your career will be a piece of cake.

141
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,659
Stigmatizing you...

142
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:19,330
as a scoundrel who seduces a widow.

143
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,299
For them, it is a piece of cake.

144
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,610
Even if you are okay with it,

145
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,480
what about Lady Eun Woo?

146
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,549
Are you not even thinking about what she might have to go through?

147
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,149
For the time being,

148
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,360
you should only treat male patients just in case.

149
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,990
Are you telling me to just accept the shackles they threw at me?

150
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,799
Shackles are much better than the guillotine.

151
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,100
Just for the time being. Do as I say.

152
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,600
Lady Eun Woo will only treat female patients for the time being.

153
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,139
Right, the two of you should not make house calls together.

154
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:58,939
Then who will administer acupuncture?

155
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,409
You can take Frog.

156
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,350
Make sure you are at least three steps away from her at all times.

157
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,850
Never walk next to her.

158
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:09,880
Do not do anything...

159
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,250
District Governor Ahn could use against you. Do you understand?

160
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Looking for this?

161
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:32,439
Oh, yes. I thought I lost it.

162
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:34,909
Thank you.

163
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:36,779
Physician Seo.

164
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,620
I know that you are worried about Physician Yoo.

165
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,549
How did you find out?

166
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,289
I must return to the palace someday,

167
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:49,860
so I stay up-to-date with the latest news.

168
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,700
How about you leave this place for the time being?

169
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,500
Go stay with your father on Heuksan Island or...

170
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,840
Well...

171
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,909
Such rumours always affect women more than men.

172
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,080
A physician from the Medical Office...

173
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,480
had a love affair with a widow he lives with.

174
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,210
People would love to gossip about it.

175
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,919
We...

176
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,789
did nothing wrong.

177
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,919
I know that.

178
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,460
But among everyone who has been impeached from the royal court...

179
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,159
and had to face public criticism,

180
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,860
how many people do you think actually did something wrong?

181
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,669
Then do you think his title and records...

182
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,769
could be annulled when he did nothing wrong?

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,139
You never know what could happen.

184
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,409
Things in the royal court...

185
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,480
They are as fickle as the weather.

186
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,549
When there is a sudden shower, you should take shelter.

187
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,590
No.

188
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,429
I do not want to hide...

189
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,299
as if we actually did something wrong.

190
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,000
I will not run away.

191
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,539
Okay, if you insist so...

192
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,769
Then keep your distance from him for the time being,

193
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,480
or people will suspect you.

194
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,159
For the time being,

195
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,529
you should only treat male patients just in case.

196
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:33,389
Make sure you are at least three steps away from her at all times.

197
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,700
Do not do anything...

198
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,230
District Governor Ahn could use against you.

199
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:45,809
There is no going back...

200
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,519
All we worked for...

201
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,230
will be in vain.

202
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,230
Then keep your distance from him for the time being,

203
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:15,139
or people will suspect you.

204
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,039
Where is Lady Eun Woo?

205
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:57,480
She got up early to make breakfast...

206
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,210
and went out to visit her patients.

207
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,779
Lady Seo made breakfast today?

208
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,950
It looked like she barely got any sleep last night.

209
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,850
When I stepped out for a moment in the wee hours,

210
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,220
she was still awake.

211
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,889
That handsome inspector went with her.

212
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,289
Why did he go with her?

213
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,830
What?

214
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,860
"It is still dark out. I shall tag along."

215
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
That is what he said.

216
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,769
He just tagged along because it was still dark out.

217
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,639
What is he, a lamp?

218
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,210
Even when he was here to conduct the inspection,

219
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,309
he was very sweet to her. As sweet as the spring breeze.

220
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,450
Just eat your breakfast and treat your patients.

221
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,149
Why look so worried?

222
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,059
From now on, you are to send all female patients to Lady Seo...

223
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,189
and all male patients to the two of us.

224
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,830
Do not even show him the female patients' charts.

225
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,260
Why? What about when we are really busy?

226
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,630
This dunce's life depends on this, so all of you must do as I say.

227
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,340
District Governor Ahn is vying for the chance...

228
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,740
to get him and Lady Seo in trouble.

229
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,639
That scoundrel is cooking up another ruse?

230
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:03,809
Gosh, you coughed all over my food. My goodness.

231
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,909
What is District Governor Ahn up to?

232
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:06,950
Here, have some rice tea.

233
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,279
- Here. - Thank you.

234
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,120
Physician Gye, Chil Sung cannot eat anything these days.

235
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,519
Please examine him.

236
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:19,659
No need. I am fine.

237
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,929
Hey, Chil Sung.

238
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,330
Your mother is counting on you.

239
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,539
Do not be such a weakling. Pull yourself together, will you?

240
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,470
Yes.

241
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:32,909
Eat up.

242
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,340
Eat.

243
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:37,909
(Gyesoo Clinic, Palace-affiliated)

244
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:38,909
You are back.

245
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,590
Give me a moment.

246
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,760
You are doing much better.

247
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Physician Yoo.

248
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,409
I need acupuncture at once.

249
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:06,340
I will collapse at this rate.

250
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:08,710
I will have Physician Seo...

251
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:15,850
Could you wait? Physician Gye will be back soon.

252
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,750
I will treat you with moxibustion while you wait.

253
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,650
Would it kill you to stop frowning?

254
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:23,680
You are usually grinning...

255
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,990
when you make house calls with Physician Seo.

256
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:29,089
You being this way is why such a complaint was lodged.

257
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:30,190
I am being wrongfully accused.

258
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,730
Lady Eun Woo and I...

259
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,629
did nothing to be frowned upon,

260
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:37,629
so I urge you to watch your words.

261
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,069
The royal court is already discussing...

262
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:44,410
the annulment of your title and records.

263
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,109
But you are still taking it lightly.

264
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,039
You must resolve the matter...

265
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,579
by leaving yourself or having Physician Seo leave.

266
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,480
No, we do not run from our problems.

267
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,180
That is what she also said.

268
00:18:57,819 --> 00:18:59,190
Did you dare...

269
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,490
ask Lady Eun Woo to leave?

270
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,559
I only offered my opinion.

271
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:07,559
Anyone would have said the same thing.

272
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,430
Do not act like you care.

273
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,000
If you involve yourself in our lives again,

274
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,629
I will make you pay...

275
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,039
because you are the one who should leave.

276
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,210
Do not be emotional about this.

277
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:24,609
Let me ask you this, then.

278
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:30,019
The ring on Physician Seo's finger. Was it from you?

279
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,359
Before you claim that the complaint is groundless,

280
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,059
look back on your actions. Got it?

281
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,279
"They ate breakfast separately."

282
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,089
"They did not go on house calls together."

283
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:08,089
"They did not even look at one another."

284
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,720
"Physician Yoo treated the male patients,"

285
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,129
"and Physician Seo treated the female patients."

286
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,599
This is proper behaviour. I bet you agree, you fool.

287
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,599
I told you to get me something juicy,

288
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,730
but you came back empty-handed!

289
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,039
Darn it.

290
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,269
Whose side are you on?

291
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:26,809
You were to monitor them, not be their advocate.

292
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,910
Whose side are you on, you idiot?

293
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,279
Lead the way.

294
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,950
How dare he come down here.

295
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:41,819
What did I tell you about staying away from the clinic?

296
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,920
Get searching.

297
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,260
What is this?

298
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,900
What is the meaning of this?

299
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,869
We are collecting evidence.

300
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,039
I found something.

301
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,049
See? Just look at this.

302
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,760
It did not even take us 15 minutes to find proof.

303
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,000
Must I take action...

304
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,029
to get things done around here?

305
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,400
Are you even allowed to take one's private letters?

306
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,170
I came down here myself...

307
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,670
to collect such private letters.

308
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,140
You have clearly been exchanging love letters,

309
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,779
but those high up...

310
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,750
still cannot see that you are guilty.

311
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:40,849
Give that back.

312
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,220
This will be confiscated.

313
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,829
What is the meaning of this?

314
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,900
You are right on time.

315
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,670
If I hand in...

316
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,069
this heart-wrenching letter as evidence,

317
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,940
your title and records will be annulled,

318
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,099
and that will be the end of you.

319
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,170
It is on you though.

320
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,510
You put yourself in trouble by getting involved with a widow.

321
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,950
Take all of this evidence to the office.

322
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,049
We did nothing wrong.

323
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,950
Not even the district governor...

324
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,990
can unlawfully confiscate private letters.

325
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,260
You should just give it back.

326
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,809
How about I suggest an irresistible deal?

327
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:42,740
What would that be?

328
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,250
The memorandum you wrote.

329
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,490
What do you say to burning both that memorandum...

330
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,089
and these letters?

331
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,960
What are you saying?

332
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,629
How is one document worth a box full of letters?

333
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:09,240
Selling and buying government posts, kidnapping, and human trafficking.

334
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:11,109
The document proves all those crimes.

335
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,170
I am not sure if simple letters...

336
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:16,039
have the same weight...

337
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,210
as that single document.

338
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:22,279
These are private letters...

339
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,250
that prove absolutely nothing.

340
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:29,359
What do you say?

341
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,289
- If you are not intrigued... - Fine, I will...

342
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:36,559
I will agree to your terms.

344
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:59,750
(Marriage Arrangement)

345
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,150
I bet this was District Governor Ahn's doing.

346
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:32,390
I am fine.

347
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,559
It is nothing.

348
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:41,359
Lady Eun Woo.

349
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,900
I feel like...

350
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:51,440
I am making things worse for you,

351
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:53,440
and it worries me.

352
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,279
That is preposterous.

353
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,279
You are the one who saved my life.

354
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,819
No.

355
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,650
This time around, I could be the reason...

356
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,390
you lose everything including your title and honour.

357
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:18,029
Rather than being here, go to His Majesty.

358
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:20,569
Prove your innocence in front of him.

359
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,980
Sure. I will do so when that must be done.

360
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,789
But Lady Eun Woo,

361
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:42,089
know that this is not a big deal.

362
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,559
It can be rectified.

363
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,629
I will make sure this does not lead to a scandal,

364
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,700
so do not worry.

365
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,039
But...

366
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,799
what if your title and records as Yoo Se Yeob...

367
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:00,640
are annulled and deleted?

368
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:04,680
Then, I will live my life...

369
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:07,410
as Yoo Se Poong.

370
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,220
What is there to worry about?

371
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,121
My dear Chil Sung.

372
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,250
I will give you just one more opportunity.

373
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,490
I will issue a ban.

374
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:55,631
Starting today, you are to watch them day and night.

375
00:26:55,901 --> 00:26:56,901
Sleep...

376
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,031
You will have no time for that, will you?

377
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,651
"Woman and children cannot go out after 4pm, the Hour of the Monkey."

378
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,680
"If they must go somewhere,"

379
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,220
"they must obtain a pass issued by the government office."

380
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:25,430
What? The Hour of the Monkey is way before sundown.

381
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,190
Are you out of your mind?

382
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,160
Exactly. How are we to make a living if we cannot go anywhere?

383
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,871
You have lost your sanity.

384
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,401
Wake up.

385
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:39,041
"For a while, to reinstate moral standards,"

386
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,781
"widows are banned from doing anything other than..."

387
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:44,281
"sewing for pay or weaving."

388
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:47,081
"Female physicians are especially banned..."

389
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:49,321
"from visiting patients."

390
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,260
This is way too obvious and transparent.

391
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,591
He is fishing for an excuse to punish us.

392
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,930
Wait. You punk, are you...

393
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:12,940
You are sick because the governor gave you a hard time.

394
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,710
That must be it.

395
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,980
I see.

396
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,041
This...

397
00:28:17,811 --> 00:28:19,680
should be torn to shreds...

398
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,520
and forgotten completely...

399
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,920
if you are to get well.

400
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:27,091
- Well done. - I liked that.

401
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Physician!

402
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:31,861
Yes?

403
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,230
Please come with me. My lady is hurt.

404
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,460
The young lady at the jujube tree mansion?

405
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,071
Is she so badly hurt that she cannot even come to us?

406
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:42,670
No. It is...

407
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:44,801
the darn ban.

408
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:46,670
It is passed 4pm.

409
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,710
What the heck?

410
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:52,950
Women really are banned from leaving the house?

411
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,811
The governor has lost his mind.

412
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:57,551
Are all sick women to die at home, then?

413
00:28:58,121 --> 00:28:59,851
I will go. Wait here.

414
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,220
My goodness...

415
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,490
Oh, dear.

416
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,561
He is crazy.

417
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:07,361
Why do I feel like this?

418
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,781
Is something wrong?

419
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:25,151
Yes.

420
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,510
Come and sit down.

421
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:35,160
So...

422
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:37,091
Physician Yoo.

423
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:39,361
Can this be cured as well?

424
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,700
I cannot sleep at all.

425
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,301
My hair falls out in clumps,

426
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
and just now...

427
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,740
my heart was racing.

428
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,270
I could not breathe...

429
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,041
and I was sweaty.

430
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,180
I am embarrassed to say I cry as well.

431
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,591
I am sorry, Physician Yoo.

432
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:15,031
I apologize.

433
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:18,730
It is okay.

434
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,430
Your job is a tough one.

435
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,041
Yes.

436
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,970
You must do things you do not want to do.

437
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,041
Yes.

438
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,180
You are right.

439
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,220
When faced with something they do not want to do,

440
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,631
most people would rather turn and run.

441
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:49,901
You are a very brave constable.

442
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:52,901
I am?

443
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:55,401
Am I?

444
00:30:56,341 --> 00:30:57,341
Yes.

445
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,041
What do you write so carefully in your notebook?

446
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,811
Can I have a look?

447
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,180
You cannot.

448
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:11,151
A constable...

449
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:13,420
Whose side are you on?

450
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,621
You were to monitor them, not be their advocate.

451
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:17,591
Whose side are you on, you idiot?

452
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:20,861
should be brave and righteous.

453
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,730
But...

454
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,631
I am timid.

455
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,901
Starting today, you are to watch them day and night.

456
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:28,940
Sleep...

457
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,710
You will have no time for that, will you?

458
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,170
And cowardly.

459
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:38,750
All people...

460
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:41,611
become timid when they value something.

461
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:43,480
That is not bad.

462
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Now that I think about it,

463
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:51,730
I believe I have just the right cure for you.

464
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:54,490
Would you like to see if it works?

465
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:57,601
Is it...

466
00:32:00,031 --> 00:32:01,200
very expensive?

467
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,081
Forget everything else completely.

468
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:19,591
Focus only on your emotions.

469
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:24,821
Write down...

470
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:27,760
just what you feel.

I wondered if...

she felt the same.

Now get up and walk.

501
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:07,620
Gosh, it does not hurt.

502
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:09,120
It stopped hurting.

503
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:12,560
Physician Gye, you are the best.

504
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:15,600
Why did you sprain your ankle and make me come here?

505
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,370
I know. I must be getting old.

506
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:23,741
Why did you come in person?

507
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:27,040
What were the cute younger physicians doing?

508
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:29,810
It is the darn ban.

509
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:32,111
Right.

510
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:37,051
Are gisaeng like you also banned from going out after 4pm?

511
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,350
What ban are you on about?

512
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,890
I knew it!

513
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,591
The darn District Governor Ahn made up that ban...

514
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:45,960
to harass us!

515
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,060
He said no women or children could go out.

516
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:52,971
What? We can badmouth anyone if they are not present.

517
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:55,940
He is present.

518
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,770
He is over there,

519
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:00,111
in the room across.

520
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:02,310
- He is here? - Yes.

521
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,420
I feel so anxious.

522
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:18,221
Please say something.

523
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,830
You must have advised me to do such a thing because you had a plan.

524
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,100
If His Majesty decides to punish me for falsely accusing Physician Yoo,

525
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:27,770
you will not be safe either.

526
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:31,701
I never told you to add such things...

527
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:33,940
to the petition I wrote.

528
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:35,681
Had we stuck to what I wrote and only targeted him,

529
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,381
his records must have been deleted by now.

530
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,411
You would have already joined hands with the Second State Councillor.

531
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,051
For a petition to be effective,

532
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,120
it has to target just one person.

533
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,250
Who told you to get that female physician roped into it too?

534
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:51,261
I just wanted...

535
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:54,690
to finish Yoo Se Yeob off in one blow.

536
00:36:56,861 --> 00:36:59,230
His Majesty has ordered a thorough investigation,

537
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,830
so we shall wait and see.

538
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,140
Since you are using such scandalous rumours to get him,

539
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,881
why not generate something even more scandalous?

540
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,620
Physician Yoo.

541
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,091
Lady Eun Woo.

542
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,201
I missed you.

543
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:14,841
We are always...

544
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:17,911
in the same space, like this.

545
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,411
I cannot believe...

546
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,721
I did not know.

547
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:31,020
The two of us...

548
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:34,431
treating and visiting patients together.

549
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:37,960
You administering acupuncture instead of me.

550
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,431
Every moment we spent together was truly meaningful,

551
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,040
but I had forgotten all about it.

552
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:08,531
If we must keep our distance from each other like this...

553
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:11,701
And if...

554
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,370
you can no longer be my hand because of that...

555
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:20,640
I feel like I cannot even breathe.

556
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,710
I hope...

557
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:30,951
you feel the same way as I do.

558
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,221
Even so,

559
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:38,790
we must overcome this crisis.

560
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:41,890
We have to.

561
00:40:01,281 --> 00:40:03,051
Even if I were to lose everything,

562
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,420
I cannot lose you.

563
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,620
Where have you been? It is getting late.

564
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,290
What about you, Physician Gye?

565
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:49,060
I had to visit a patient.

566
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:50,960
At Mohwagak.

567
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,971
Chun Wol sprained her ankle.

568
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,600
This late?

569
00:40:57,241 --> 00:40:59,241
My gosh. I should have taken care of that for you.

570
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:07,681
How many lives do you think one physician can save?

571
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,980
Well, I believe it all depends on the physician's ability.

572
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,250
You might think it would be nice to treat...

573
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,821
a few high-ranking officials in the palace and climb the ladder.

574
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,931
After all, that is what everyone in the Medical Office wants.

575
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,161
But you see,

576
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:27,401
try doing good deeds by saving lives and helping those truly in need.

577
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:29,440
You will never want to lose that joy.

578
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,411
A physician...

579
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,911
can save more lives...

580
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,741
when he works in a small town like this.

581
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:45,350
Destroying one small-town physician's future...

582
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:48,420
is like killing off all the lives...

583
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,661
that he could have saved.

584
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:56,560
Why are you telling me this?

585
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:58,230
You...

586
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:02,770
I heard you and Se Yeob used to work in the Medical Office together.

587
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,810
You two were not even close. You could not have met...

588
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,411
with District Governor Ahn to help him.

589
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:15,381
What...

590
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:18,250
are you thinking?

591
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,000
(Governor's Office)

592
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:38,140
"Generate something even more scandalous."

593
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:45,040
Darn it!

594
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,350
How dare you barge into the district governor's room?

595
00:42:48,611 --> 00:42:50,980
What? What now?

596
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,221
Will you unsheathe a sword and swing it at me like this?

597
00:42:53,221 --> 00:42:55,321
Will you choke me like this and make me faint...

598
00:42:55,321 --> 00:42:56,361
when you are a physician?

599
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,661
Leave my kids alone.

600
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:05,131
How dare you make up rumours about such a love affair...

601
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:07,701
and submit a petition? How petty.

602
00:43:08,531 --> 00:43:10,040
Oh, that?

603
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,640
Nothing will come of it if that physician did nothing wrong.

604
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,870
Do not worry as if you were guilty.

605
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,810
You are using Chil Sung to find fault with him,

606
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:21,480
and you issued the ban to restrict women.

607
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,381
I can see what you are trying to do.

608
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:27,551
Will you keep on denying it?

609
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:29,790
How dare you speak to the district governor in this manner?

610
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,361
Then act like one! As the district governor,

611
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:33,690
you must care for the people and help them.

612
00:43:34,431 --> 00:43:36,201
Are you serving as the district governor...

613
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,701
just to land a better position in the government?

614
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:42,600
Cancel that ridiculous ban at once.

615
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:44,301
If not,

616
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,471
I will have to do something about it.

617
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,140
Woof-woof!

618
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,381
Stop barking nonsense.

619
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,651
Get lost before I put you behind bars.

620
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,051
I will not change my mind no matter what you say.

621
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,250
I will do whatever it takes to make sure you fools cannot bark again,

622
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,020
so brace yourselves and wait for what is coming.

623
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,401
Oh, wait.

624
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,431
Wait, stop.

625
00:44:19,611 --> 00:44:22,370
You are ignoring my helpful advice. All you do...

626
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,511
is cook up ruses at the courtesan house.

627
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:26,151
Very soon,

628
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,881
you will end up like this.

629
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:37,491
Light the candle before you leave!

630
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,920
Hey, get back here!

631
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,091
I shall... I will teach you a lesson.

632
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:42,431
Get back here!

633
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,261
Darn it! That little...

634
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:15,060
Help...

635
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,000
Help me.

636
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:23,401
What happened? What is the matter?

637
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:29,040
My mother has been in labour all night but has not given birth yet.

638
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,480
My gosh.

639
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:33,411
She has lost a lot of blood.

640
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,381
So this is your mother's blood?

641
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:38,980
Why did you not come sooner?

642
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:40,620
I could not, because of the ban.

643
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,491
That darned ban...

644
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,931
Give me a moment. I will get ready quickly.

645
00:45:49,931 --> 00:45:52,261
Jang Gun, get me some jihyeolsan and bulsusan.

646
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,531
Okay!

647
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,631
You are going to visit her now?

648
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,801
District Governor Ahn is keeping tabs on you.

649
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:01,640
If it is not too urgent, I suggest you wait.

650
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,841
It is a difficult delivery. We cannot wait.

651
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,151
Where are the other physicians?

652
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:09,821
Physician Gye left at the crack of dawn...

653
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:12,281
to check on those in the village who were sick.

654
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:14,721
The other physicians left early in the morning as well...

655
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:15,960
to buy more herbs.

656
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:18,221
That darn prohibition.

657
00:46:19,631 --> 00:46:20,631
Just go.

658
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,431
Two lives are on the line.

659
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:25,801
But Granny, what if she gets caught?

660
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:28,401
Come on. Let us go.

661
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,511
Be careful.

662
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:45,080
"The sky was clear today."

663
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,520
"Purple is a wild chrysanthemum."

664
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,721
"Wild flowers that blossomed..."

665
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,531
Have you lost it?

666
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,761
Who on earth are you?

667
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,100
Are you a poet or Chil Sung?

668
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,140
Look here. We have ourselves a true poet!

669
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,971
Give him a beating!

670
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:10,681
I will strip you of your title...

671
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:12,181
and hurt you badly...

672
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:13,881
so that you cannot even carry water buckets.

673
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:15,881
Do you hear me, you fool?

674
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:23,821
You are...

675
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,161
a very brave constable.

676
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:27,890
I am...

677
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:29,861
a brave...

678
00:47:31,161 --> 00:47:32,161
constable.

679
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:34,431
Just you wait and see.

680
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,670
Enough!

681
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,721
Why you... You did not startle me,

682
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:53,451
but you threw your fist at a superior's face.

683
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:55,321
Are you glaring at me?

684
00:47:55,321 --> 00:47:57,190
I wrote everything down like you ordered,

685
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:58,661
so take a look.

686
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,770
If you strip me of my title,

687
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,230
I will make sure you lose yours as well.

688
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:11,401
What?

689
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,741
It is all written down here.

690
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,370
How you had Gyesoo Clinic monitored,

691
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:17,940
how you harassed women,

692
00:48:18,411 --> 00:48:19,881
and how you disturbed the clinic's operation!

693
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,451
I will make sure His Majesty knows.

694
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:27,350
Chil Sung, you seem to be worked up today.

695
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,290
Fine. Do as you wish.

696
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,560
Tell His Majesty everything.

697
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,390
Today will be your last day.

698
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:35,730
I will tell him.

699
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:38,201
The Sinmungo!

700
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:42,631
I am off to pound the drum.

701
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:49,040
Lady Eun Woo by herself?

702
00:48:49,411 --> 00:48:50,411
When? Where did she go?

703
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,580
Yang Soon from the other village came by.

704
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:55,850
All night, her mother could not give birth.

705
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,420
Gosh, Young Master!

706
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,770
A pretty physician came by, did she not?

707
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,111
She is a very talented physician...

708
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,810
who will help your mother and your younger sibling.

709
00:49:26,781 --> 00:49:27,980
Really?

710
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:30,051
Of course.

711
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:31,951
Do you know how to boil water?

712
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:36,890
Then, please have some boiled water ready.

713
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:42,290
All right.

714
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,000
Please stay strong a while longer.

715
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,210
Physician Yoo.

716
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,540
How is the patient?

717
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,181
She is a patient who came by the clinic.

718
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:04,020
Due to the edema, I assumed a breech delivery.

719
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,920
Contractions began last night,

720
00:50:06,051 --> 00:50:08,890
but she was too scared of the ban to visit the clinic.

721
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:11,821
I see. Please continue with your acupuncture.

722
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,560
Right.

723
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,401
You must push. Stay with us.

724
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,440
Do not give up.

725
00:50:31,741 --> 00:50:33,951
If we work hard, we will be able to help her.

726
00:50:36,011 --> 00:50:37,020
Sure.

727
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:13,051
- One. - One.

728
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:14,850
- Two. - Two.

729
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,920
- Three. - Three.

730
00:51:28,031 --> 00:51:30,341
Once more. Push once more.

731
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:38,810
A little more.

732
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,281
Push once more.

733
00:52:17,951 --> 00:52:18,980
How is my baby?

734
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:21,591
It is healthy.

735
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,161
You gave birth to a beautiful girl.

736
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,790
You bled a lot, so let me prescribe you some medicine.

737
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,631
Thank you, Physician Seo,

738
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:32,901
for saving our lives.

739
00:52:36,301 --> 00:52:38,870
What do you mean you do not know? Where is your mother?

740
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,341
What is going on?

741
00:52:42,341 --> 00:52:43,911
- Please stay here. - Mom!

742
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:44,911
Where is your mother?

743
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:46,710
Stop crying!

744
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:47,911
Enough!

745
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,451
- We take children who cry. - Enough!

746
00:52:56,113 --> 00:52:57,982
- Quiet! - Unbelievable.

747
00:53:00,312 --> 00:53:01,982
- Quiet! - What is the meaning of this?

748
00:53:03,982 --> 00:53:04,982
Gosh.

749
00:53:13,832 --> 00:53:15,132
Head on inside.

750
00:53:15,763 --> 00:53:16,763
Okay.

751
00:53:22,172 --> 00:53:23,243
What is with this ruckus?

752
00:53:24,203 --> 00:53:25,843
A sick patient is on the brink of death.

753
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,873
I do not know what this is about,

754
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:28,873
but come back some other time.

755
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:31,743
I am afraid we cannot.

756
00:53:32,482 --> 00:53:33,953
Because we are not here for the patient.

757
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:36,553
- We are here for the physicians. - That is right.

758
00:53:37,352 --> 00:53:39,352
We are here to show you what will happen...

759
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:42,053
to anyone who violates the government ban.

760
00:53:43,192 --> 00:53:44,192
Yes, us.

761
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:45,723
I said this was an emergency.

762
00:53:46,562 --> 00:53:48,363
What is most urgent...

763
00:53:49,132 --> 00:53:52,203
is that you violated a government-issued ban.

764
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:55,873
The national law precedes any government-issued rule.

765
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:58,102
You must be aware...

766
00:53:58,102 --> 00:54:00,042
that obstructing medical treatment can be punished by law.

767
00:54:01,473 --> 00:54:02,473
What did he say?

768
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,683
Physician Yoo, what...

769
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:06,482
Lady Eun Woo, please stay inside.

770
00:54:07,652 --> 00:54:08,652
Goodness.

771
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:12,183
But it is past the Hour of the Monkey.

772
00:54:12,823 --> 00:54:13,823
What do we do?

773
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:15,792
You violated the ban...

774
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:17,792
and should be punished for it.

775
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,132
A physician cannot be punished after saving a patient's life.

776
00:54:21,933 --> 00:54:24,832
Goodness, you scare me, my lady.

777
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:27,573
Anyone who violates the ban...

778
00:54:28,902 --> 00:54:30,643
can be dealt with through violence.

779
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:32,473
It is why we are here to stretch our legs.

780
00:54:32,473 --> 00:54:34,513
We are thugs who do not know better.

781
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:36,712
But we do know how to beat up women.

782
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:42,382
Step aside.

783
00:54:44,683 --> 00:54:46,553
We just saved a person's life...

784
00:54:46,823 --> 00:54:48,453
and would rather not hurt you.

785
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:49,922
So please step aside.

786
00:54:50,093 --> 00:54:51,093
Step aside?

787
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:54,593
Let us show you what that means to us.

788
00:54:55,962 --> 00:54:58,163
- Break it down! - What do you think you are doing?

789
00:54:58,163 --> 00:54:59,163
That is enough!

790
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:00,473
Why you...

791
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:11,882
Physician Yoo.

792
00:55:17,723 --> 00:55:20,493
Lady Eun Woo. Step aside for a while.

793
00:55:27,263 --> 00:55:28,433
I am sure...

794
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:31,632
I warned you.

795
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,942
- What... - What the...

796
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:42,073
You startled me.

797
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,183
- What is that? - I thought he was getting a dagger.

798
00:55:57,292 --> 00:55:58,323
Why you...

799
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:05,863
I will show you what happens if you disobey a physician.

800
00:56:08,473 --> 00:56:09,473
Listen carefully.

801
00:56:09,672 --> 00:56:11,873
If they do not wash their eyes as soon as possible,

802
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:13,613
they will never see for the rest of their lives.

803
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:15,772
Do you want a taste of it too?

804
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,712
Or would you save your friends?

805
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,252
Come with me. Are you all right?

806
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,752
- Get up. - Help me!

807
00:56:32,562 --> 00:56:33,562
Physician Yoo.

808
00:56:34,462 --> 00:56:35,732
Your injury...

809
00:56:41,303 --> 00:56:43,843
It did not hurt at all. I did not know I was hurt.

810
00:56:45,473 --> 00:56:47,113
Are you all right?

811
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:49,073
Yes.

812
00:56:51,482 --> 00:56:53,082
I will tend to your wounds when we get back.

813
00:57:04,223 --> 00:57:05,263
Lady Eun Woo.

814
00:57:07,033 --> 00:57:08,093
If we were...

815
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:10,803
to keep on walking,

816
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:13,902
where would we end up?

817
00:57:47,073 --> 00:57:48,332
If I were to leave,

818
00:57:50,502 --> 00:57:51,803
perhaps everything...

819
00:57:54,712 --> 00:57:56,882
would go back to normal?

820
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:12,462
The wound is bigger than we thought.

821
00:58:14,132 --> 00:58:15,663
It must have hurt badly.

822
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:19,033
It really did not, which is why I did not notice.

823
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:22,632
I am so upset.

824
00:58:25,073 --> 00:58:26,102
It hurts.

825
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:29,672
I am reassured...

826
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:31,582
to have you with me.

827
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,413
Still, you got hurt because of me.

828
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,582
It was not you.

829
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,123
I was angry about the stupid ban...

830
00:58:40,493 --> 00:58:43,462
and the ruffians taking advantage of the weak.

831
00:58:45,562 --> 00:58:46,832
If I had not fought back,

832
00:58:47,263 --> 00:58:49,462
another powerless person would have gotten hurt.

833
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,263
I have you to treat me.

834
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,373
I would rather get hurt myself.

835
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:07,513
I am done.

836
00:59:46,893 --> 00:59:48,652
You had a long day...

837
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,562
and you look gaunt.

838
00:59:51,363 --> 00:59:52,922
You should have a huge breakfast.

839
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:29,433
Before something even worse happens...

840
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:52,852
If we had...

841
01:00:53,553 --> 01:00:56,493
continued on the relationship that began on the cliff that day...

However much you regret the past,

844
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:04,863
you cannot go back in time.

845
01:01:26,522 --> 01:01:27,593
We must...

846
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,363
choose the better path...

847
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:33,533
and not give in.

848
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:15,132
All the time I spent learning from you...

849
01:02:15,973 --> 01:02:17,073
was a pleasure.

850
01:02:18,602 --> 01:02:20,973
Remembering the moment when we saved each other...

851
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:23,613
and remaining in each other's debt.

852
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,783
And leaving in order to do that...

853
01:02:26,783 --> 01:02:27,812
Lady Eun Woo.

854
01:02:30,422 --> 01:02:32,582
is the best choice I can make.

Lady Eun Woo.

857
01:03:21,232 --> 01:03:23,232
I cannot let you go like this.

858
01:03:27,873 --> 01:03:29,172
Do not leave.

859
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:06,113
There is a time to let go and a time to fight back.

860
01:04:06,413 --> 01:04:07,852
Now is the time to fight back.

861
01:04:08,783 --> 01:04:10,082
Give it to me, Mother.

862
01:04:10,453 --> 01:04:12,382
Who do you dare call "Mother?"

863
01:04:13,723 --> 01:04:15,893
You secretly followed Lady Eun Woo to Heuksan Island?

864
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,823
You should stop being so clingy.

865
01:04:18,223 --> 01:04:20,062
What are you going to do in Hanyang?

866
01:04:20,093 --> 01:04:21,192
Look into someone.

867
01:04:21,393 --> 01:04:23,363
Very thoroughly.

868
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,303
If you wish,

869
01:04:25,303 --> 01:04:27,402
you can study medicine in Qing.

Physician Yoo?

871
01:04:28,902 --> 01:04:30,602
You keep getting hurt...

872
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:32,373
when you are around me.

873
01:04:32,573 --> 01:04:34,113
I am never in pain.

I just love you to death.
