(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,034
Are you all right?

4
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,144
How rude of you. What were you doing?

5
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:54,885
You are the one who is being rude.

6
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:56,385
What?

7
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:00,524
You might be hurting her.

8
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,164
Are you all right?

9
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:08,435
Yes, I am fine.

10
00:01:09,764 --> 00:01:12,505
What are you doing outdoors with a young lady this late?

11
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,164
What about you?

12
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:16,404
What were you doing here at this time of night?

13
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:19,274
I work at the Medical Office, so this is practically my home.

14
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:21,244
Outsiders should leave the Palace.

15
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:37,625
I should not have moved.

16
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,794
I saw a ghost as soon as I moved chambers.

17
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,835
What did it look like?

18
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:46,705
It wore burial clothes.

19
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:50,304
I am so scared.

20
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:55,544
Will you stay and care for me tonight?

21
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:06,054
You were merely startled. I shall bring a herbal tonic.

22
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:07,854
One that will make you sleep well.

23
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:11,925
Is that it?

24
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,794
I hurt here.

25
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,994
And here too.

26
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:20,934
Massage her well.

27
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:23,375
Okay...

28
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:34,744
He got so cold.

29
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,754
Is this where it hurts?

30
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:40,885
Hands off!

31
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:44,154
Where...

32
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:47,395
(Episode 2)

33
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:55,274
You and Her Highness the princess must be very close.

34
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:59,474
She fell into your arms as if she were very used to it.

35
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:01,575
What about you?

36
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,615
You fell right into that medical officer's arms.

37
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:07,184
That is different.

38
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,385
Her Highness the Princess did it intentionally,

39
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,355
whereas I accidentally bumped into him...

40
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:17,654
Are you and the Princess...

41
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:21,994
No.

42
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:25,334
We do not have the kind of relationship you are thinking of.

43
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:26,835
I see.

44
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:29,205
Womanizer?

45
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:34,075
Using your handsome face?

46
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:37,445
This is unfair.

47
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:40,144
His Majesty and I studied together growing up,

48
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:42,145
so I saw the Princess often when she was little...

49
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:46,683
Listen. I have never been with a woman and...

50
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,684
Okay.

51
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:49,254
I heard you.

52
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,425
You need not explain.

53
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:55,135
Well, I just...

54
00:03:55,964 --> 00:03:58,365
I did not want you to get the wrong idea.

55
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:04,004
I know. This is where your heart belongs.

56
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:11,175
That is exactly right.

57
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,354
By the way, why did that court maid...

58
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:21,554
go to that well? It was sealed off long ago.

59
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,524
She said she was just passing by.

60
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:26,124
Odd, is it not?

61
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:34,365
All right. There.

62
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:40,075
Oh, hold on. My goodness.

63
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,044
All right. Lie down.

64
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:50,654
Careful.

65
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:54,154
Vomiting and dizziness.

66
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:56,564
The same symptoms as those of the court maids.

67
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:02,204
I saw someone else exhibiting the same symptoms earlier in the day.

68
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:04,964
Did that person see the ghost too?

69
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,704
That, I did not hear.

70
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:08,505
He vomited and passed out.

71
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:10,425
I administered acupuncture, and he woke up.

72
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:13,544
They all have one thing in common.

73
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:14,774
Check his eyes.

74
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:20,544
Glaucoma.

75
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:23,274
The court maids are exhibiting the exact same symptom.

76
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,354
Then...

77
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:27,825
do you think the poison is spreading beyond the Palace?

78
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,524
We must find out at once and stop the spread,

79
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:33,464
or things will get very complicated.

80
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:39,265
Make way. Coming through.

81
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,835
Make way. Coming through.

82
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,974
Excuse me. Step aside.

83
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:47,505
Excuse me. Coming through. Please step aside.

84
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:51,144
If you are in critical condition, stand over here.

85
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:53,284
If you are just experiencing dizziness,

86
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:54,815
- wait over here. - This way!

87
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:56,515
Those who are just dizzy...

88
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,824
Gosh, when will I be seen?

89
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,324
- This way! - Does she have a headache?

90
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:01,354
She has a fever too?

91
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:02,794
Hey.

92
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,115
I will make some herbal tonic for you. Be sure to take it.

93
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:09,204
This mysterious disease is spreading outside the palace walls.

94
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:14,234
So...

95
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:17,974
it is spreading among the people too?

96
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:21,505
His curse...

97
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:30,353
- Goodness. - What is happening?

98
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:31,923
- What a disaster. - Oh, dear.

99
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,325
Is His Majesty aware?

100
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:39,564
What is going on?

101
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,524
- What? - What is this?

102
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,305
His Majesty has canceled today's meetings.

103
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:47,634
- What? - What is happening?

104
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:49,204
- Oh, dear. - My goodness.

105
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,904
Is His Majesty aware of the disease spreading outside the palace?

106
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,075
Yes, he has heard about the situation.

107
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:02,555
I knew this would happen.

108
00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:06,724
He should have never trusted Yoo Se Yeob and those quacks.

109
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:08,554
Clearly, they have failed to quell the outbreak.

110
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:10,355
Now, it is spreading beyond the palace walls.

111
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:12,924
If those quacks cannot sort out this mess,

112
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,664
they will pay for it.

113
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:19,364
Those of us in the Medical Office will do our best.

114
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:21,005
Please let us handle this matter.

115
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:30,413
We are using haedokdan to remove the poison in the court maids' bodies,

116
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:31,714
so please do not worry.

117
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:34,445
Again?

118
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:36,914
Poison, again?

119
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:42,995
The truth is,

120
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:45,864
I saw him too.

121
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:49,964
I saw him.

122
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:57,005
What if...

123
00:07:57,604 --> 00:07:59,684
someone poisons me, just like they did to my father?

124
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,685
No.

125
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:10,114
I will not let that happen!

126
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,325
Your Majesty.

127
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:16,325
I will not die.

128
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,895
I will not let anyone take my life!

129
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:22,234
I trust...

130
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,765
that you will save me,

131
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:27,734
no matter what.

132
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,945
The ghost you saw. What did he look like?

133
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:39,445
He was clad in burial clothes.

134
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:43,354
He was covered in blood.

135
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:45,054
So was the butterfly ornament.

136
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,325
How did you know that it was Cho Tae Hak's spirit?

137
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:53,084
Rumors are already running rampant within the palace walls.

138
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,195
That his vindictive spirit is roaming the palace grounds.

139
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:02,134
You said you just happened to be passing by the well.

140
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:12,285
She must have come here for a reason.

141
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:14,484
She came to this sealed well?

142
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:17,354
In the middle of the night? Why?

143
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:20,804
I am certain that she came here to do something.

144
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:25,795
I smell lilies.

145
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,364
Where is this coming from?

146
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:30,264
No!

147
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,734
A ghost.

148
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:36,335
He believes Cho Tae Hak's ghost haunts the Palace.

149
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:42,915
How dare you. Who told you that you could roam around the palace?

150
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:47,185
I am here with Gyesoo Clinic as per His Majesty's orders.

151
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,915
Oh, I know who you are.

152
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:53,854
The widow with terrible character.

153
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:58,325
You went against your ethics and morals and destroyed your in-laws.

154
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:01,724
Become a decent person before you work as a physician.

155
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,835
Why?

156
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:08,205
Were you roaming around, hoping to seduce His Majesty?

157
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:12,275
How could you insult me like this?

158
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:15,045
How dare you raise your voice at me?

159
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:18,113
You think you can talk back to me since His Majesty...

160
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:19,514
is siding with you sly quacks?

161
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:26,124
Sir, the Second State Councilor is looking for you.

162
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:27,925
Why?

163
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:29,525
Where is he?

164
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:32,775
He dropped by the Medical Office, but I am not sure where he is now.

165
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:34,925
He dropped by when I was not there?

166
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:37,144
The Second State Councilor, of all people?

167
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:38,295
Goodness.

168
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:48,474
We met last night.

169
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:52,585
Oh, I am not on his side.

170
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:54,585
I am a nice person.

171
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:01,483
I am a widower too.

172
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:02,824
(Hwanbu: A widower)

173
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:04,195
My wife passed away years ago.

174
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,224
We are in the same boat.

175
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,035
I happened to overhear everything.

176
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,335
I am Jeon Kang Il, a physician in the Medical Office.

177
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,675
I see. I am a physician too.

178
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:24,144
I know.

179
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:26,384
You are here with Yoo Se Yeob.

180
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:29,884
May I ask you your name?

181
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,655
Seo Eun Woo.

182
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:36,425
What a pretty name.

183
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:40,665
The royal physician insulted you.

184
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:44,125
I would like to make you a cup of tea to apologize on his behalf.

185
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:48,535
Oh, that is okay. I am in a rush to look into something.

186
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:57,675
Look into what?

187
00:11:58,244 --> 00:11:59,844
May I help you?

188
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:06,254
Then do you know if there is a place inside the palace where lilies grow?

189
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:09,455
Lilies?

190
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:13,124
No, as far as I know.

191
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,594
We buy the ones we use for medicinal purposes.

192
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,734
That is odd.

193
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:20,234
I am certain I smelled them.

194
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:26,604
I am sorry. I do not think I can have tea with you today.

195
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:47,065
Lady Eun Woo.

196
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,335
Did he do something?

197
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:53,205
Oh, no.

198
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:55,974
He helped me, so we just exchanged names.

199
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:57,374
You exchanged names?

200
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:00,275
What did he help you with?

201
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:02,945
Well...

202
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:07,244
It is nothing you need to concern yourself with.

203
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:13,584
That physician seems to know the details,

204
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,025
so why should I not bother?

205
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,425
No can do. I wish to be concerned as well.

206
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,764
Please inform me of the facts.

207
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:28,804
How could she accept my heart...

208
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:30,535
but harbor secrets with another man?

209
00:13:37,945 --> 00:13:39,914
Jang Gun, how many haedokdans do we have left?

210
00:13:39,915 --> 00:13:42,045
- Please take care of yourself. - Not many.

211
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:46,353
What on earth is going on?

212
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:48,624
Why are we not seeing a decline in patients?

213
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:50,455
Goodness.

214
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,724
Dad...

215
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:56,094
You see, I...

216
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:58,364
Pull your weight around here, will you?

217
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:00,794
Why are you out and about when we need the extra help?

218
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:03,444
Get changed and hurry back out here!

219
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:12,714
Goodness me.

220
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:39,244
What is this about?

221
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:44,675
You look like you were duped...

222
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:48,844
and were rummaging through your father's drawers for money.

223
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,285
All while in Physician Gye's room!

224
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:59,864
Do not tell me you actually lost your money.

225
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:10,104
The older girls...

226
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:23,354
You lost your money? All of it?

227
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:25,113
How?

228
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:27,185
How much did they take from you?

229
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:33,364
I think I lost...

230
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:35,893
everything I had.

231
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:36,994
My gosh.

232
00:15:37,864 --> 00:15:38,864
What?

233
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,405
Why were you hesitant to tell her?

234
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:46,374
Lady Namhae, did you invest your money into her business?

235
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:51,244
You promised that the fabric store would at least double it.

236
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,444
Unbelievable.

237
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,513
They say that fortune tellers do not know when they will die.

238
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,314
Did you not see this coming?

239
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,654
- Shut it! - My gosh.

240
00:15:59,655 --> 00:16:02,555
Did they rob you of everything you had?

241
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,525
Can you not get it back?

242
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:08,624
I do not think I can.

243
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:13,905
The girls are scary, you see.

244
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:17,435
Sogyeok-dong Burning Firewood?

245
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:20,974
They hit me while threatening to feed me to his goons.

246
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:24,643
If I make a fuss, they are going to...

247
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:26,484
light the clinic on fire.

248
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,244
My gosh!

249
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:32,455
Goodness.

250
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,025
I should have known those girls would be as vicious as they seemed.

251
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:41,525
Consider it an expensive lesson.

252
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:43,565
Those darn brats!

253
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,905
Why must she pay money for a lousy lesson?

254
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,045
I see that I vacated the capital for too long.

255
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:01,685
Sogyeok-dong Burning Firewood, did you say?

256
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:14,425
I heard something else that was peculiar.

257
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:16,363
Like what?

258
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:19,094
That liquor crocks have been going missing.

259
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:22,103
Who would take what is in the Palace?

260
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:23,405
Exactly.

261
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:28,675
Could it be related to the illness?

262
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:31,874
That was my theory too,

263
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:33,945
and the first court maid who presented symptoms...

264
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:37,034
turned out to be in charge of the liquor crocks.

265
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:38,954
Then...

266
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,325
Why were you passing by the Queen's chambers in the middle of the night?

267
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:47,025
She is hiding something.

268
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:50,694
We must see her in person.

269
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,064
It does not seem like she went anywhere too far.

270
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,025
She could be on duty at the storehouse.

271
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:14,854
We must find her.

272
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:22,033
What the... How dare you.

273
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:27,674
You are Palpan-dong Castor Bean.

274
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:31,683
Castor Bean is back in Hanyang!

275
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:33,253
It is Castor Bean!

276
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:52,904
Look at you, Sogyeok-dong Burning Firewood.

277
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:58,904
Show some respect to your elder.

278
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:03,884
Step aside.

279
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:16,664
Adorable. I see you have fattened up.

280
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:23,564
(Sogyeok-dong Burning Firewood)

281
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:24,904
Forget it.

282
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:30,074
(Palpan-dong Castor Bean)

283
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,213
I apologize.

284
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:37,013
I am sorry.

285
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:41,154
My boys did not know any better due to your long absence.

286
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,003
- It was our mistake. - It was our mistake.

287
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:49,624
Why did you slip up, then?

288
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:56,533
But as you know,

289
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:59,973
mistakes are meant to be corrected.

290
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,773
Goodness. My bad.

291
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:20,094
Just quietly give the money back...

292
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:22,394
and do not speak of Palpan-dong Castor Bean.

293
00:21:22,554 --> 00:21:23,763
Sure.

294
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,293
Of course. It is triple the amount.

295
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:27,493
How much?

296
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,134
- Triple. - Triple.

297
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:33,432
You seem to have made a lot of money,

298
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:36,104
but you still put in a lot of effort...

299
00:21:37,074 --> 00:21:38,304
to steal some more.

300
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:39,943
Of course not.

301
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:42,043
I came into free liquor...

302
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:44,144
which had me lose my money.

303
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,914
Is that so?

304
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:47,453
Get up.

305
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:49,953
- Get up on your feet. - Should I?

306
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:51,924
Goodness.

307
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:53,654
Oh, boy.

308
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:56,263
Who on earth would give out...

309
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:58,023
free liquor?

310
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:00,733
But it is true.

311
00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:02,164
Listen.

312
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:05,763
Just because I was stuck in the countryside,

313
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:07,503
you think I'm a pushover?

314
00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:09,533
It is the truth.

315
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:12,174
It is from...

316
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:13,874
the Palace of all places.

317
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:33,033
A court maid brings out liquor?

318
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,693
Where did you hear that story?

319
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,033
Exactly.

320
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,604
Who would give you free liquor? And Palace liquor too.

321
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:41,973
I overheard people talk while getting Physician Gye's supply.

322
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:43,543
Will you just wait?

323
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:46,373
You give Ip Bun your hard-earned money,

324
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:47,614
but you cannot believe me?

325
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,983
Is it a total lie that you can see the future?

326
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,344
Darn you.

327
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:54,314
Stop it.

328
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:57,223
You are just as naive as I am.

329
00:22:57,654 --> 00:23:00,594
That money will come back a few times over.

330
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:03,624
Do not stay too upset over it.

331
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:11,364
- Look. - Gosh.

332
00:23:15,273 --> 00:23:16,273
Hey.

333
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:33,354
Lady Eun Woo, it is that court maid.

334
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:37,493
Yes. But what is she doing?

335
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:04,943
Why did you do this?

336
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,154
You are not even selling it.

337
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,023
To live.

338
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:17,263
I did it to preserve my own life.

339
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,164
What do you mean?

340
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:23,763
The letter.

341
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:31,773
I received...

342
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,644
I received a letter from Cho Tae Hak's ghost.

343
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:44,424
It said if I wished to live,

344
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:46,523
I must drink from the Queen's well,

345
00:25:46,654 --> 00:25:49,693
make liquor with that water, and bring it outside the Palace.

346
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:53,864
After I delivered the liquor,

347
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:56,564
I was to pray to the moon for my life.

348
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:16,054
Let us drink.

349
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:18,824
Lovely.

350
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:20,594
Pour us a round.

351
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:26,324
Say you did that because the letter told you to.

352
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:30,233
Why did the other maids drink from the Queen's well?

353
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,374
Because of the rumor.

354
00:26:34,203 --> 00:26:36,203
The curse of Cho Tae Hak's ghost.

355
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:38,273
To cheat death,

356
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,174
they must drink from the well?

357
00:26:40,414 --> 00:26:41,414
Yes.

358
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:44,283
All who heard the rumor would have sipped the water.

359
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:47,213
But then they all got sick.

360
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:52,424
In the end, there is no way to avoid the curse.

361
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:58,193
The water from the well.

362
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,493
The smell of lilies.

363
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:05,033
But it is not the season for lilies to bloom.

364
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:12,673
"Smells similar to lilies but is poisonous."

365
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:13,713
"Must take caution."

366
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:16,513
Physician Yoo.

367
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:26,894
What do you think?

368
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:28,824
It definitely smells of lilies, yes?

369
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:32,493
Yes, but lilies do not bloom underwater.

370
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:34,792
It is not a lily...

371
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:36,433
but another plant with a similar smell.

372
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,374
Is it the fairy daisy?

373
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:42,174
Yes.

374
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:44,603
Most poisonous herbs emit a foul odor,

375
00:27:44,604 --> 00:27:46,713
but the fairy daisy smells of lilies.

376
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:49,874
That is why no one found this water repulsive.

377
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:52,043
The fairy daisy causes...

378
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:56,414
vomiting and dizziness.

379
00:27:57,783 --> 00:27:59,584
And also glaucoma.

380
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,164
Someone poisoned this well...

381
00:28:05,324 --> 00:28:07,193
and made the court maids sick.

382
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:09,933
The villagers got sick...

383
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:12,134
because they drank liquor made with this water.

384
00:28:13,304 --> 00:28:15,233
I must have the well closed off.

385
00:28:15,604 --> 00:28:18,773
We must also ask if the patients at the clinic drank any liquor.

386
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:22,344
- Oh, that feels good. - My back hurts.

387
00:28:23,884 --> 00:28:25,883
What do we have here? Liquor?

388
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:28,354
Let me have a whiff.

389
00:28:29,453 --> 00:28:30,483
It smells lovely.

390
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:32,223
I shall have a sip.

391
00:28:39,223 --> 00:28:40,263
No!

392
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:05,983
- Gosh. - My lady.

393
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,793
What was that about?

394
00:29:07,854 --> 00:29:09,753
You are so full of energy.

395
00:29:14,664 --> 00:29:17,463
Oh, dear. I am so sorry.

396
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:20,674
But you must never drink this liquor.

397
00:29:20,874 --> 00:29:22,472
The illness that has spread...

398
00:29:22,473 --> 00:29:24,374
was all caused by this liquor.

399
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,473
- What? - What?

400
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:27,814
What?

401
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:29,242
That was a close call.

402
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:30,243
Goodness.

403
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:31,243
Oh, dear.

404
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:33,384
Gosh.

405
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:35,983
Oh, dear...

406
00:30:00,844 --> 00:30:01,844
Poison?

407
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:05,443
Then what I saw...

408
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:09,013
That was a hallucination?

409
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:10,523
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:13,222
You drank liquor made with water from the Queen's well,

411
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:14,654
causing the hallucinations.

412
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:17,864
I will prescribe you haedokdan.

413
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:20,164
Do not worry about the ghosts.

414
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:22,763
That is a relief.

415
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,604
It is great news.

416
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:27,134
You saved me...

417
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:29,074
yet again.

418
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:38,983
There have been no new cases since we closed the well.

419
00:30:39,144 --> 00:30:40,654
Yes. It is good news...

420
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:42,983
that the illness was brought under control.

421
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:46,223
What?

422
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:48,993
What does this mean?

423
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:50,893
- Step aside! - Step aside.

424
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:52,363
- Step aside. - Step aside.

425
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:53,364
Oh, dear.

426
00:30:53,664 --> 00:30:55,232
What is all that about?

427
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,963
The famine and plague...

428
00:30:57,604 --> 00:31:00,874
is a curse from the heavens caused by the King's shortcomings.

429
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:08,374
Find them.

430
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:17,723
I will execute all who are plotting treason!

431
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:50,054
Do you truly...

432
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:54,124
not fear death?

433
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:15,614
Where are you?

434
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:39,433
Your Majesty!

435
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:42,703
What is the matter?

436
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:46,543
Yes, Yoo Se Yeob.

437
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:49,174
Bring Yoo Se Yeob to me!

438
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:54,513
Yes, Your Majesty!

439
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:16,103
(Medical Office)

440
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:17,243
His Majesty...

441
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:21,174
summoned Yoo Se Yeob again last night.

442
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,783
My pride is truly hurt.

443
00:33:27,414 --> 00:33:30,324
If we cannot beat those quacks,

444
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:34,624
all of us will be banished from the palace!

445
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:46,833
His Majesty's condition is worsening.

446
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:49,733
We got rid of the fairy daisy,

447
00:33:50,034 --> 00:33:52,315
but he said he saw Cho Tae Hak's spirit again last night.

448
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:54,744
So the poisonous plant was not the reason.

449
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:57,813
Is His Majesty seeing things due to qi deficiency?

450
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:00,614
Or did he truly see something?

451
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,454
May I inspect his bedchamber and the surrounding areas?

452
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:09,954
What are you looking for?

453
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:11,494
Traces.

454
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:13,764
It rained last night, you know.

455
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:16,563
Maybe we can find some footsteps.

456
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:19,233
A ghost's footsteps?

457
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:26,443
But it is awfully quiet here.

458
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:29,974
His Majesty is only letting in the eunuchs that he truly trusts.

459
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:33,114
He feels anxious when he is surrounded by a lot of people.

460
00:34:38,784 --> 00:34:41,994
What? Physician Yoo, look.

461
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:47,234
I must seek an audience with His Majesty.

462
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,703
His Majesty really will not let anyone in this time.

463
00:34:50,704 --> 00:34:52,364
I must speak with him for a reason.

464
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:55,204
I have made an important decision.

465
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,773
A decision? About what?

466
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:01,244
I have made up my mind to get married.

467
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:06,813
You should not have called off your wedding. Why change your mind now?

468
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:10,074
I will not marry the Chief State Councilor's son.

469
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:11,523
Pardon me?

470
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:16,924
Why are you here?

471
00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:22,193
His Majesty said even eunuchs are not to enter his bedchamber.

472
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:24,603
How come?

473
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:27,872
His condition has been worsening...

474
00:35:27,873 --> 00:35:30,103
ever since a female physician...

475
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:33,373
had a talk with him.

476
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:36,974
How is he? Is he in critical condition?

477
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:39,014
The thing is...

478
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:52,324
Leave me be!

479
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:57,463
I will tear you to pieces once again!

480
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:06,103
Do you truly think it will appear again tonight?

481
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:10,273
Yes. The culprit must be very anxious at the moment...

482
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:12,943
because Court Maid Oh got caught sooner than expected.

483
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:15,554
You two! Why are you always glued together?

484
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,803
Make sure you are always three steps apart.

485
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:23,169
I hear that His Majesty's condition has been worsening...

486
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:25,393
ever since you said something to him.

487
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:29,094
Your Highness, that is...

488
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:30,364
Physician Yoo.

489
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:34,303
You witch.

490
00:36:34,304 --> 00:36:36,034
What are you cooking up?

491
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:41,344
His Majesty needs some time alone at the moment.

492
00:36:42,273 --> 00:36:45,213
It is her fault that I cannot see His Majesty now.

493
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:49,454
You shall apologize to me at once.

494
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:56,023
Get down on your knees and apologize. Now!

495
00:36:58,463 --> 00:36:59,523
Your Highness.

496
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:05,103
I have done nothing that I must apologize to you for.

497
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,674
Is that so?

498
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:16,174
However, I do wish to see you on your knees right now.

499
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:19,684
So kneel before me at once.

500
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,213
This is an order from the Princess.

501
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:23,954
Your Highness...

502
00:37:44,074 --> 00:37:47,003
If an apology is needed, I will be the one apologizing.

503
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:51,643
Why would you... Get up at once!

504
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:53,543
Then will you let us go?

505
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:58,184
Please get up, Physician Yoo.

506
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:10,764
Come along.

507
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:25,482
What was that?

508
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:27,313
What is going on between those two?

509
00:38:33,654 --> 00:38:34,924
Do not let it get to you.

510
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:38,123
Her Highness the Princess has a bad temper.

511
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:40,464
Even His Majesty does not know what to do with her.

512
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:44,663
You got down on your knees because of me.

513
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:48,034
I have such strong legs.

514
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:50,602
If you do not mind,

515
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:52,884
I could get down on my knees for you, whenever necessary.

516
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:55,074
I do mind.

517
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:57,913
Are you worried about my knees?

518
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:04,154
Then make some medicine to help strengthen my knees.

519
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:06,353
Make a really good one.

520
00:39:07,353 --> 00:39:09,824
Certainly. With tons of velvet antlers.

521
00:39:10,454 --> 00:39:11,463
Sure.

522
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:14,934
Well, shall we head back now?

523
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:32,543
Are you looking for me?

524
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:46,023
How dare you humiliate me...

525
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:48,724
and bring disgrace to the royal court?

526
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:25,364
What are you two doing here?

527
00:41:28,764 --> 00:41:30,833
Physician Yoo, look.

528
00:41:35,174 --> 00:41:36,603
Someone burned incense cones.

529
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:40,543
Smell this.

530
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:46,083
It smells like lilies.

531
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:49,184
Yes, it was made with the poisonous plant.

532
00:41:53,353 --> 00:41:56,324
I received a letter from Cho Tae Hak's ghost.

533
00:41:56,924 --> 00:41:58,924
The curse of Cho Tae Hak's ghost.

534
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:08,674
Your Majesty!

535
00:42:09,733 --> 00:42:11,503
What is the matter?

536
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:20,684
Who was it?

537
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:22,614
Who put you up to this?

538
00:42:32,364 --> 00:42:33,764
Absolutely no one.

539
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:38,263
There just happen to be people...

540
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,963
who are still loyal to Lord Cho Tae Hak.

541
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:41,404
How dare you!

542
00:42:42,174 --> 00:42:43,733
Have him incarcerated this second.

543
00:42:44,204 --> 00:42:46,204
I will take my time bringing up his charges.

544
00:42:46,503 --> 00:42:48,143
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

545
00:42:51,384 --> 00:42:53,813
It is still not over!

546
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:58,753
Lord Cho's vengeful spirit will get his revenge.

547
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:03,253
You will never be able to sleep in peace!

548
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:09,594
Your Majesty, you should probably lie down.

549
00:43:09,864 --> 00:43:11,744
I will bring you something to calm your nerves.

550
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:14,134
Please do so.

551
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:33,023
How did you know he was behind it?

552
00:43:33,753 --> 00:43:36,293
The night His Majesty saw the ghost...

553
00:43:36,494 --> 00:43:38,994
was also the night Princess Seo Yi saw one too.

554
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,494
A ghost.

555
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,232
Princess Seo Yi resided...

556
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:46,503
in Boknyeongjeon which is by the Queen's chambers.

557
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:49,473
However, she saw the ghost that night...

558
00:43:49,474 --> 00:43:50,904
despite having moved elsewhere.

559
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:56,273
Here are the people who knew she had moved her chambers.

560
00:43:57,543 --> 00:43:59,284
The people who were present that day...

561
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:03,083
were His Majesty, Princess Seo Yi,

562
00:44:04,324 --> 00:44:06,284
her court lady,

563
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:08,123
and...

564
00:44:09,693 --> 00:44:12,393
Meanwhile, only one of them could burn the incense.

565
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:16,663
Eunuch Yoon.

566
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:20,934
Talk about connecting the dots.

567
00:44:22,574 --> 00:44:24,174
I am genuinely impressed.

568
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:38,054
Are you saying...

569
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,583
that I am not losing my mind?

570
00:44:40,924 --> 00:44:42,223
(Two days ago)

571
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,499
We found evidence in your chambers that a poisonous herb...

572
00:44:44,523 --> 00:44:46,023
was burned as incense.

573
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:50,293
You did not see a ghost or hallucinate, for that matter.

574
00:44:50,463 --> 00:44:53,764
Therefore, you were not losing your mind.

575
00:44:55,873 --> 00:44:58,602
Someone spread rumors about Cho Tae Hak's spirit...

576
00:44:58,603 --> 00:44:59,844
to install fear...

577
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:03,043
in order to weaken your mind.

578
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:07,483
To trap the culprit,

579
00:45:07,884 --> 00:45:10,654
you must act like your symptoms are worsening for the time being.

580
00:45:17,123 --> 00:45:18,594
Leave me be!

581
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:24,304
Make it seem like he has accomplished his deed.

582
00:45:28,174 --> 00:45:30,304
Was the poisonous herb the only issue?

583
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:34,443
What are your thoughts...

584
00:45:35,043 --> 00:45:36,114
on what I saw?

585
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,603
Forgive me for overstepping my bounds,

586
00:45:42,884 --> 00:45:44,353
but you saw what was in your heart.

587
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:49,623
How...

588
00:45:51,193 --> 00:45:52,793
can I get better?

589
00:45:55,663 --> 00:45:56,793
Your emotions...

590
00:45:58,103 --> 00:45:59,333
are not an illness.

591
00:46:01,934 --> 00:46:05,344
But first, make sure you save the lives of the court maids.

592
00:46:05,674 --> 00:46:07,543
Your desire to save the lives of your people.

593
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,744
Your wish to protect your court maids.

594
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:18,522
You were only worried about the safety...

595
00:46:18,523 --> 00:46:20,684
of those loyal to you and your people...

596
00:46:21,324 --> 00:46:22,994
as should any leader would be.

597
00:46:25,463 --> 00:46:27,833
How can a father's desire to care for his children...

598
00:46:28,563 --> 00:46:30,034
be an illness?

599
00:46:33,864 --> 00:46:36,103
That heart of yours has already hardened firmly,

600
00:46:36,934 --> 00:46:38,074
and I only advise...

601
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:40,674
that you take good care of yourself as well.

602
00:46:56,924 --> 00:46:58,792
The cause of the mysterious disease that plagued the people...

603
00:46:58,793 --> 00:47:00,063
has been identified.

604
00:47:14,143 --> 00:47:15,712
Look who it is.

605
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:17,543
Goodness me.

606
00:47:27,353 --> 00:47:28,393
It is why...

607
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:31,424
I wish to recognize the contribution made...

608
00:47:31,693 --> 00:47:33,693
by Physician Yoo and Gye Ji Han.

609
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,693
That is preposterous, Your Majesty.

610
00:47:37,094 --> 00:47:38,103
First,

611
00:47:38,704 --> 00:47:41,233
they must be questioned.

612
00:47:42,934 --> 00:47:43,974
Your Majesty,

613
00:47:44,844 --> 00:47:48,273
the letter contains the crimes committed by these men.

614
00:48:05,893 --> 00:48:07,324
What is all this?

615
00:48:11,704 --> 00:48:13,733
The court has commanded me to arrest you.

616
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:15,804
Arrest us?

617
00:48:17,204 --> 00:48:20,674
Did I hear wrong? What are you barking about?

618
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:23,712
Talk about being ungrateful.

619
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:25,542
You had us work like dogs when things were urgent...

620
00:48:25,543 --> 00:48:27,713
and did not even pay for the medicinal herbs you took.

621
00:48:27,853 --> 00:48:29,683
But rather than rewarding us, you are here to arrest us?

622
00:48:29,684 --> 00:48:30,684
Exactly.

623
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,954
You should pay us back for the medicinal herbs you took.

624
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:35,494
How dare you.

625
00:48:36,753 --> 00:48:39,364
Do not be intimidated and stand tall.

626
00:48:39,824 --> 00:48:42,663
No one should be punished after saving human lives.

627
00:48:43,663 --> 00:48:44,704
Bring it in!

628
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:57,413
See? This is what you get for working for the government.

629
00:48:57,884 --> 00:49:01,482
Take the generals who led us to victory.

630
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:03,114
- Me? - No, not you.

631
00:49:04,313 --> 00:49:06,582
As long as you do not lose your life... What was it again?

632
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,753
- Consider yourself lucky. - Exactly.

633
00:49:09,123 --> 00:49:11,623
Hanyang must not be the place for me.

634
00:49:14,094 --> 00:49:16,033
Shut down Gyesoo Clinic...

635
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:18,033
that has been fooling patients with fake medical treatments...

636
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:20,434
and have Yoo Se Yeob exiled.

637
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:24,843
If you once again defend such wicked beings again,

638
00:49:24,844 --> 00:49:29,014
everyone at the Medical Office will hand in their resignation.

639
00:49:30,674 --> 00:49:35,284
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty. - Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

640
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:51,864
There was another factor behind the court maids' illness.

641
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:56,674
Anxiety.

642
00:49:57,943 --> 00:50:00,704
The anxiety of the Medical Office that would not admit their error...

643
00:50:00,904 --> 00:50:04,474
is what exacerbated this recent incident.

644
00:50:05,114 --> 00:50:06,813
What are you saying?

645
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:08,912
The craven actions of those at the Medical Office...

646
00:50:08,913 --> 00:50:11,154
who only worried about their mistake coming to light...

647
00:50:11,424 --> 00:50:13,324
worsened the condition of your patients.

648
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:15,692
Is the purpose of the Medical Office to heal people...

649
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:17,353
or to survive political wars?

650
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:29,804
Your Majesty, I do not need any reward.

651
00:50:30,204 --> 00:50:32,674
Just allow me to leave Hanyang.

652
00:50:40,543 --> 00:50:42,154
As proposed by the Medical Office,

653
00:50:43,114 --> 00:50:45,154
I will cease the operation of Gyesoo Clinic...

654
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:49,523
and order Yoo Se Yeob to relocate in Sorak Village.

655
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:54,594
However,

656
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:57,732
as to reward Yoo Se Yeob and Gyesoo Clinic...

657
00:50:57,733 --> 00:50:59,613
for its major contribution in solving the case,

658
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:03,034
I will appoint the clinic as a regional medical department...

659
00:51:03,404 --> 00:51:04,673
and bestow an official plaque...

660
00:51:04,674 --> 00:51:06,142
along with funding from my privy purse.

661
00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:07,903
(Pyeonaek: Plaque, Naetanggeum: Privy purse)

662
00:51:08,213 --> 00:51:10,844
It is why I order you to treat the people...

663
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:14,583
as a father would care for his children.

664
00:51:16,884 --> 00:51:19,154
This is preposterous, Your Majesty.

665
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:21,893
- Please reconsider! - Please reconsider!

666
00:51:22,753 --> 00:51:24,663
I will be writing the plaque,

667
00:51:24,893 --> 00:51:26,593
and the money is coming from my own pocket,

668
00:51:26,594 --> 00:51:28,134
so how can you be against it?

669
00:51:29,134 --> 00:51:31,364
If you are objecting just for the sake of it,

670
00:51:31,563 --> 00:51:33,962
I will gladly accept your letter of resignation.

671
00:51:33,963 --> 00:51:35,304
So be it!

672
00:51:46,384 --> 00:51:48,384
I am so reluctant...

673
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:51,493
to send you away again.

674
00:51:54,623 --> 00:51:58,064
You bestowed our clinic with a great award.

675
00:51:59,564 --> 00:52:01,433
How do you consider that an award?

676
00:52:02,763 --> 00:52:06,134
Now you must come to Hanyang whenever I summon you.

677
00:52:07,234 --> 00:52:09,143
I have forced you to serve me.

678
00:52:11,614 --> 00:52:15,384
Your Majesty. I thank you for your grace.

679
00:52:35,464 --> 00:52:36,734
I heard...

680
00:52:38,473 --> 00:52:39,774
you are still alone.

681
00:52:41,774 --> 00:52:43,344
What do you mean by that?

682
00:52:46,344 --> 00:52:48,984
Why are you not yet married?

683
00:52:50,413 --> 00:52:52,714
I can tell even without your reply.

684
00:52:54,453 --> 00:52:55,823
You have feelings for me.

685
00:52:59,254 --> 00:53:00,493
What feelings?

686
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:03,323
I will give you a special command.

687
00:53:04,623 --> 00:53:07,392
- You are to be my... - I do not know what command it is,

688
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:09,004
but I leave Hanyang soon.

689
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:12,303
I am sorry to say I cannot obey.

690
00:53:18,513 --> 00:53:20,174
You are leaving Hanyang? Why?

691
00:53:20,774 --> 00:53:23,484
You will not want to leave once you hear my proposal.

692
00:53:27,214 --> 00:53:28,283
I will...

693
00:53:31,053 --> 00:53:32,154
marry...

694
00:53:34,393 --> 00:53:35,564
you.

695
00:53:45,174 --> 00:53:48,743
I believe I have misheard you.

696
00:53:49,844 --> 00:53:52,013
You heard me. Are you pretending you did not?

697
00:53:54,714 --> 00:53:56,643
My home is at Sorak Village.

698
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,183
And I have much to do at the clinic there.

699
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:03,084
So please rescind your command.

700
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:17,864
Did he just reject me?

701
00:54:18,573 --> 00:54:21,473
Yes. He well and truly rejected you...

702
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:23,944
to your face.

703
00:54:25,373 --> 00:54:27,473
Why does he not like me?

704
00:54:38,493 --> 00:54:39,953
Have you seen Lady Eun Woo?

705
00:54:40,723 --> 00:54:43,393
Were you not with her in the Palace?

706
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:47,963
If you think about it,

707
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:51,603
she has a tendency to just vanish without a word.

708
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:54,773
It is almost as if...

709
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:56,803
She does not care for you at all.

710
00:54:57,674 --> 00:54:59,572
- Is what he... - Jang Gun said.

711
00:54:59,573 --> 00:55:01,013
- No. - Yes.

712
00:55:02,844 --> 00:55:03,884
Hey, you.

713
00:55:04,984 --> 00:55:07,953
Cancel your friendship with His Majesty.

714
00:55:08,553 --> 00:55:10,423
Every day brought new turmoil.

715
00:55:10,424 --> 00:55:11,992
A punishment one day, a reward the next.

716
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:13,593
He lifts us up, then drops us.

717
00:55:13,594 --> 00:55:16,593
We get to leave without a fuss because he defended us in court.

718
00:55:16,594 --> 00:55:18,023
I know that.

719
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:19,833
But if we stay connected to the royal family,

720
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,663
troubles will come looking for us.

721
00:55:23,504 --> 00:55:26,734
Running our clinic just got much harder.

722
00:55:27,473 --> 00:55:28,473
Darn it.

723
00:55:30,103 --> 00:55:31,843
I told you to clean up!

724
00:55:31,844 --> 00:55:34,174
Come on, move it. We leave soon.

725
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,004
Lady Eun Woo.

726
00:55:58,873 --> 00:56:00,533
I thought you had left.

727
00:56:01,944 --> 00:56:03,303
Without saying goodbye?

728
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,114
I am not like that.

729
00:56:06,073 --> 00:56:07,143
I know.

730
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:09,344
You are not.

731
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:12,353
But...

732
00:56:14,254 --> 00:56:16,424
we must say goodbye now.

733
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:22,663
Is your father...

734
00:56:24,393 --> 00:56:26,134
taking you back to Heuksan Island?

735
00:56:39,674 --> 00:56:40,944
Do not go.

736
00:57:03,364 --> 00:57:04,904
How am I to part with you again?

737
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:09,344
Can you...

738
00:57:10,404 --> 00:57:11,714
do that?

739
00:57:16,143 --> 00:57:17,743
You do not want to leave, do you?

740
00:57:19,584 --> 00:57:22,283
You want to see Gyesoo Clinic again, do you not?

741
00:57:28,823 --> 00:57:32,094
Then I want you to take your pick right now.

742
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:34,864
Between what?

743
00:57:36,504 --> 00:57:37,634
Is it me...

744
00:57:41,743 --> 00:57:43,044
or a marsh dandelion?

745
00:57:51,444 --> 00:57:53,353
Did I just lose to a marsh dandelion?

746
00:57:54,314 --> 00:57:56,553
No, you did not.

747
00:57:58,754 --> 00:58:02,323
It is just that my father is so adamant.

748
00:58:03,623 --> 00:58:06,094
I barely got permission to come and say goodbye.

749
00:58:44,134 --> 00:58:45,334
Take it off.

750
00:58:45,634 --> 00:58:48,702
Oh, this is delicious.

751
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,803
Is it?

752
00:58:51,303 --> 00:58:52,444
Ip Bun.

753
00:58:53,714 --> 00:58:56,183
Say I am out, that I am not here.

754
00:58:58,384 --> 00:59:01,314
Are you the girls who took my money?

755
00:59:02,484 --> 00:59:03,924
I am glad to see you.

756
00:59:04,283 --> 00:59:06,654
I will grind you all up today.

757
00:59:06,953 --> 00:59:10,262
Stop it. They are some scary ladies.

758
00:59:10,263 --> 00:59:12,393
Give back Ip Bun's money.

759
00:59:12,464 --> 00:59:14,093
Because of you frauds,

760
00:59:14,094 --> 00:59:16,533
Ip Bun gave up her dream.

761
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:20,433
That is right! I thought you were nice people.

762
00:59:40,993 --> 00:59:43,524
Ip Bun. We are so sorry.

763
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:47,694
This is three times what we took, so do not complain later.

764
00:59:48,364 --> 00:59:50,203
Yes, we paid you back in full.

765
00:59:58,274 --> 01:00:00,743
Was Jang Gun and I that fearsome?

766
01:00:02,344 --> 01:00:03,814
Totally.

767
01:00:08,353 --> 01:00:09,924
- Ip Bun. - Yes?

768
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:15,794
You tend to lose sight of things when you do what you like.

769
01:00:17,064 --> 01:00:19,834
That is why you make mistakes.

770
01:00:20,234 --> 01:00:21,734
Do not give up!

771
01:00:26,303 --> 01:00:28,234
So, now you know,

772
01:00:29,373 --> 01:00:31,044
when you are in Hanyang,

773
01:00:31,404 --> 01:00:33,444
you can get conned at any time.

774
01:00:33,873 --> 01:00:35,984
You should not trust people so easily.

775
01:00:38,183 --> 01:00:40,384
Actually, do not even think of coming to Hanyang again.

776
01:00:42,024 --> 01:00:43,353
Answer me.

777
01:00:43,654 --> 01:00:44,953
Are you high on something?

778
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:47,953
What is with the tone?

779
01:00:48,024 --> 01:00:49,893
A piece of pear got stuck in my throat.

780
01:01:00,504 --> 01:01:02,044
No!

781
01:01:02,274 --> 01:01:05,273
You cannot just let him go like that!

782
01:01:05,274 --> 01:01:07,774
What can I do? He said he did not need anything.

783
01:01:08,743 --> 01:01:11,213
I simply respected my friend's wishes.

784
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:13,453
Then what about your one and only sister's wishes?

785
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:16,052
What is your problem?

786
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:17,084
I refuse to let him go.

787
01:01:17,953 --> 01:01:20,024
I cannot let Yoo Se Yeob go.

788
01:01:22,823 --> 01:01:24,364
Then what will you do?

789
01:01:37,174 --> 01:01:39,073
I could have taken all of Hanyang by storm.

790
01:01:39,513 --> 01:01:41,743
You wench. Do not even look back.

791
01:01:42,013 --> 01:01:43,114
Why not?

792
01:01:51,823 --> 01:01:52,823
Darn it.

793
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:58,263
Do not say anything. Do not say hello to me, you pig.

794
01:01:59,734 --> 01:02:01,393
Boss Castor Bean!

795
01:02:02,634 --> 01:02:04,134
Take care!

796
01:02:09,873 --> 01:02:13,373
Oh, get going. I will follow you. This came undone.

797
01:02:14,544 --> 01:02:16,344
Go.

798
01:02:30,694 --> 01:02:31,823
Wait up!

799
01:02:32,094 --> 01:02:33,133
Wait up.

800
01:02:33,134 --> 01:02:34,433
- Come on. - Hurry.

801
01:02:45,643 --> 01:02:46,643
Oh, dear.

802
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:49,584
You can eat this.

803
01:02:50,283 --> 01:02:51,844
It is not the castor bean plant!

804
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,484
What? Wait.

805
01:02:58,123 --> 01:03:00,453
Seriously? Does everyone know?

806
01:03:01,723 --> 01:03:03,794
I wonder how Poong does not know yet.

807
01:03:04,424 --> 01:03:07,033
I am so curious.

808
01:03:21,013 --> 01:03:22,084
Physician Yoo!

809
01:03:32,623 --> 01:03:33,623
Physician Yoo!

810
01:03:42,564 --> 01:03:43,564
Physician Yoo.

811
01:03:45,373 --> 01:03:46,734
Wait for me!

812
01:03:55,044 --> 01:03:56,044
Physician Yoo.

813
01:04:07,424 --> 01:04:08,424
Hold on.

814
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:13,533
Physician Yoo!

815
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:17,334
- Oh, my. - Nice.

816
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:19,033
- Lady Eun Woo. - Physician Yoo.

817
01:04:21,674 --> 01:04:22,743
I will come with you.

818
01:04:24,674 --> 01:04:25,994
What about District Governor Seo?

819
01:04:26,214 --> 01:04:28,844
My father has given me his permission.

820
01:04:33,614 --> 01:04:34,614
I am glad.

821
01:04:35,683 --> 01:04:36,683
Truly, I am so glad.

822
01:04:50,634 --> 01:04:51,904
- Come with me, then. - Okay.

823
01:04:53,573 --> 01:04:54,573
Let us get going too.

824
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:57,642
I cannot stand those two lovebirds. We should get going too.

825
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:00,513
- Okay, let us go. - Yes, come along.

826
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:02,044
Hurry!

827
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:05,143
Come on. Hurry!

828
01:05:36,214 --> 01:05:37,454
Knowing you are coming with me,

829
01:05:38,044 --> 01:05:39,053
my heart is fluttering.

830
01:05:40,314 --> 01:05:41,314
I am happy.

831
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:45,493
I am a little scared.

832
01:05:46,453 --> 01:05:47,953
Of what?

833
01:05:48,823 --> 01:05:53,094
That you might lose everything because of me.

834
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:56,703
I will be fine as long as you are with me.

835
01:05:57,504 --> 01:05:59,973
Do you not feel the same way?

836
01:06:00,904 --> 01:06:01,904
Yes.

837
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:04,044
I feel like...

838
01:06:04,603 --> 01:06:07,174
I can only breathe when I am by your side.

839
01:06:07,614 --> 01:06:08,814
You make my heart skip.

840
01:06:09,643 --> 01:06:12,984
I wish this path were a little longer.

841
01:06:20,924 --> 01:06:22,424
Get in line!

842
01:06:23,723 --> 01:06:25,262
If you need acupuncture, wait here.

843
01:06:25,263 --> 01:06:26,834
For medicine, get in line over here.

844
01:06:27,433 --> 01:06:29,233
Get in line!

845
01:06:29,234 --> 01:06:30,234
Here, drink this.

846
01:06:33,373 --> 01:06:34,503
Get in line!

847
01:06:34,504 --> 01:06:36,242
Goodness. What did you eat?

848
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:39,614
All right. Let me check your pulse. Let me see.

849
01:06:40,614 --> 01:06:41,614
Oh.

850
01:06:43,344 --> 01:06:45,684
You ate something again in the middle of the night.

851
01:06:46,054 --> 01:06:47,812
- Make way! - Step aside!

852
01:06:47,813 --> 01:06:49,282
- Step aside. - Step aside.

853
01:06:49,283 --> 01:06:50,283
Move aside.

854
01:07:08,134 --> 01:07:11,304
How may we help you?

855
01:07:24,224 --> 01:07:26,523
Throw everything away.

856
01:07:26,993 --> 01:07:28,713
- Yes, Your Highness! - Yes, Your Highness!

857
01:07:32,094 --> 01:07:33,094
Oh, dear.

858
01:07:33,394 --> 01:07:34,394
What is going on?

859
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:36,233
- Where are you going? - Hey, Jang Gun!

860
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:38,834
- Goodness. What is this? - Move aside!

861
01:07:39,304 --> 01:07:40,532
- What is this... - Oh, dear.

862
01:07:40,533 --> 01:07:42,403
Excuse me. Let me through.

863
01:07:43,243 --> 01:07:44,243
What is going on?

864
01:07:54,613 --> 01:07:56,623
Her Highness the Princess?

865
01:08:20,613 --> 01:08:24,083
You dared to humiliate me, the Princess of this kingdom!

866
01:08:24,084 --> 01:08:26,054
You ought to pay for what you did!

867
01:08:26,613 --> 01:08:27,660
Receive His Majesty's orders.

868
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:29,623
Gyesoo Clinic is closed indefinitely.

869
01:08:30,983 --> 01:08:33,593
With that piece of paper,

870
01:08:33,594 --> 01:08:36,123
they want to meddle in our business.

871
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:39,163
I am confident. You had better get ready.

872
01:08:39,394 --> 01:08:41,663
Who are you, really?

873
01:08:42,434 --> 01:08:43,434
So Cheon.

874
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:45,163
So Cheon is gone.

875
01:08:46,474 --> 01:08:48,504
What did I do wrong?

876
01:08:48,903 --> 01:08:51,474
Can you truly call yourself a physician?
