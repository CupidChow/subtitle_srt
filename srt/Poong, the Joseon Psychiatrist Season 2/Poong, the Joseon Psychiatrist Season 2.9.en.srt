(Episode 9)

2
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,136
Would you walk next to me?

3
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:36,235
What...

4
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:38,045
should we do?

5
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:41,146
Just as we have been doing.

6
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,976
We will be fine.

7
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,616
Oh, okay.

8
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,185
Then...

9
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:49,985
I will go in first.

10
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:54,386
That would look more suspicious.

11
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:58,226
Right.

12
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:00,866
Lady Eun Woo.

13
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:02,536
Yes?

14
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:04,336
I like you.

15
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:09,075
A lot.

16
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,375
Very much.

17
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:16,246
Yes, me too.

18
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:24,955
Shall we go inside?

19
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:35,565
Dan.

20
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:37,236
You are here.

21
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:46,246
Hello, you are back.

22
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:55,086
When you are visiting Heuksan Island,

23
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:57,285
you must try some raw fish.

24
00:02:57,486 --> 00:02:58,486
Yes.

25
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:02,725
I suppose the two of you went to see the fireworks.

26
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,965
Raw fish at this late hour?

27
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:11,465
Did you...

28
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:14,504
stay up to wait for us?

29
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:17,875
What is with the stammer?

30
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:22,016
Here, let me pour you one. Heuksan Island is famous for this liquor.

31
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:23,715
I am truly sorry,

32
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,086
but could I have some honey herbal punch instead?

33
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:27,815
My gosh.

34
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,155
I heard you could not drink alcohol.

35
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,125
I suppose it was true.

36
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,396
A man cannot drink a single drop of alcohol?

37
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:39,496
Physician Yoo, you are truly...

38
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:46,065
You are so perfect!

39
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,575
Oh, my. It would be difficult...

40
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,276
to find such a perfect man like you.

41
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:59,215
Even your eyelashes are so long and beautiful.

42
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:02,285
My eyelashes...

43
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:04,616
are not that nice.

44
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:06,185
Everything about you is beautiful.

45
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,655
Look carefully, and you will find that I have beautiful features.

46
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:10,955
I shall study your face.

47
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:11,965
Yes.

48
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:14,095
My lady.

49
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:15,796
You must be so happy.

50
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:19,805
Eat up.

51
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:21,065
Please allow me to pour you one.

52
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:27,546
Everything is so delicious.

53
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:31,146
Right? Then how about you live here with us?

54
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:33,986
Shall I, Mother?

55
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:36,915
Gosh, he has to leave tomorrow.

(Gyesoo Clinic)

57
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:09,015
- Who are you looking for? - My gosh!

58
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,455
You are Mak Jin.

59
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:19,096
Are you not feeling well?

60
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,296
No, it is not that. I have not been sleeping well.

61
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:27,434
Physician Yoo is good at treating psychiatric ailments,

62
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:28,476
so I wanted to see him...

63
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:30,736
Oh, no.

64
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:32,945
He is not here. He is visiting a faraway town.

65
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:35,145
What? When will he be back, then?

66
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,575
That I do not know.

67
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:41,314
Why can you not fall asleep?

68
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:43,356
You should fall asleep as soon as you finish work.

69
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,356
I am very timid.

70
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:52,265
I had to quit my job because of the ban.

71
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,425
I had managed to get a job at the market, but...

72
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:55,966
Ever since I signed the appeal,

73
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:58,035
I have been feeling so scared and worried...

74
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,134
as if I would get the hiccups...

75
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,204
even just at the sight of a constable.

76
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:03,074
I have not slept a wink since that day.

77
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,606
My gosh. It is that bad?

78
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:06,476
I feel so bad.

79
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,916
You developed insomnia because you tried to help us?

80
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:10,315
Oh, boy.

81
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,245
Hey, let us not submit the one Mak Jin signed.

82
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:14,346
Oh, okay.

83
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:17,314
We have collected a big pile of petitions,

84
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:19,624
so we can definitely take one out.

85
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,895
No, you do not need to do that.

86
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:24,425
I will go get it now!

87
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,595
- Yes. - Yes, hurry.

88
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:27,125
No! It is truly fine.

89
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:32,166
I will just go inside and wait.

90
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:56,056
Having you by my side...

91
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:58,325
excites me...

92
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,125
and makes me happy.

93
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:02,565
My heart...

94
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:04,395
is racing.

95
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:06,606
How come?

96
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:08,935
Because we do not know...

97
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,106
what life has in store for us.

98
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,616
No matter what happens,

99
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:19,185
I will be fine for we are together.

100
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:21,885
I wish...

101
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:25,325
this path was a little longer.

102
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:31,624
This is how you wrestle with your knees. Straighten one leg.

103
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,694
- Fold it like this. - Fold it.

104
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,036
Hold it. Hop.

105
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,135
Hop, like this.

106
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:39,465
My gosh, Young Master!

107
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:41,106
How have you all been?

108
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,874
- Physician Yoo! - You left looking all confident.

109
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,575
Why did you come back alone?

110
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:47,246
Alone?

111
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:48,775
No, we came together.

112
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,275
- What? - What? Where?

113
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:54,416
- My gosh! - Lady Seo!

114
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:56,314
- Oh, my! - Gosh, what a surprise.

115
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:59,085
We had no idea you would be hiding there.

116
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:01,625
Thank goodness you two came back together.

117
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:05,165
My father truly struggled while you were away.

118
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,466
That is right. We had to close the clinic.

119
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:10,866
We had to send all our patients to Iron Birch Clinic.

120
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:16,275
Lady Seo, do not leave us again.

121
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:18,906
All right, Jang Gun.

122
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:20,775
I will not go anywhere.

123
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,014
Anyway, you two.

124
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:26,145
Any good news from Heuksan Island?

125
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,716
Come on. I am sure something happened.

126
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:32,324
I bet they got married in her family home!

127
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,926
Gosh, Granny!

128
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:35,255
No, not yet...

129
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,736
We are not married yet.

130
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,496
"Not yet?"

131
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:46,466
Then when will it happen?

132
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,504
Physician Yoo, go inside and tend to the patients.

133
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:54,675
They said Physician Gye had been very busy all alone.

134
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:55,944
Oh, right.

135
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:58,274
- There must be many patients... - Yes.

136
00:08:58,275 --> 00:08:59,345
- to tend to. - You seem flustered.

137
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:02,186
- Gosh, what is going on? - Things seem to be working out.

138
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:05,754
They certainly seem to have gotten closer.

139
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,695
How come my handsome Kang Il did not come back with them?

140
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:09,855
Things are going well between those two.

141
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,764
Why would that frog butt in?

142
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:12,895
- Right. - He should leave them alone.

143
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:18,236
You?

144
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:23,235
You confidently assured me before you left,

145
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:24,835
but I did not hear from you at all,

146
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:28,545
so I thought you were staying in the boondocks for good.

147
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:29,716
No, of course not.

148
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,586
I will destroy that secret ledger for you.

149
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:34,745
We cannot lose the perfect chance...

150
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:37,086
to finish off Yoo Se Yeob because of a few insignificant deeds.

151
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,385
You failed me as an inspector,

152
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,726
so how am I to trust you?

153
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:47,895
I am the only one who can enter Physician Gye's residence anyway.

154
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:51,635
Why did you let them find out about your weakness?

155
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:53,765
Fine.

156
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:55,336
I heard you!

157
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:57,836
Yoo Se Yeob is His Majesty's friend.

158
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:00,475
I understand you cannot step in yourself,

159
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:02,215
but you must speak to the Second State Councilor...

160
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:03,545
and finish him off for good.

161
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:05,086
Do you understand?

162
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:07,446
It seems as though...

163
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:11,655
you now hate him more than I do.

164
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:17,125
I wonder why.

166

Did the petition make you that anxious?

167
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:27,235
Your pulse is very weak.

168

It is for His Majesty's eyes, so do not worry.

170
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,545
Here is her petition.

171
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,015
Thanks.

172
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:41,645
There you go. Nothing will worry you anymore.

173
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:43,515
Please do not burn it.

174
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:46,456
You said it could help Physician Yoo keep his title.

175
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:47,525
It is all right.

176
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:50,525
We have a pile of them in Physician Gye's room.

177
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:53,625
There are many patients who are fond of Physician Yoo.

178
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,696
Now, please lie back down.

179
00:10:57,836 --> 00:11:01,106
Acupuncture treatment and medicine will help you sleep better.

180
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:03,106
Right. You can put your trust in us.

182
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:23,254
Those who are morally impaired...

183
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:25,125
should be rightfully punished.

184
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:30,066
Seeing that you wrote a petition...

185
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:32,505
makes me believe you are of that kind.

186
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:35,675
The physicians did nothing wrong.

187
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:39,805
And it is unfair to keep widows...

188
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,274
tied to their homes.

189
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:42,716
Goodness.

190
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:46,316
Are you saying that you widows...

191
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,316
have formed an alliance?

192
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,655
All right, then.

193
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:53,726
Know this though.

194
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:57,696
You are not the same kind of widow.

195
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:05,736
Did you think I would not find out that you are an immigrant?

196
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:11,904
It is not something you can keep hidden,

197
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,875
especially when it comes to one's origins...

198
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:19,885
Please spare me, my lord.

199
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:22,515
Please have mercy on me.

200
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:26,784
Look at you suddenly changing your stance.

201
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:27,925
You seem like a different person.

202
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:31,025
Get up.

203
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,765
Just do as I tell you,

204
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,405
and you will live.

205
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:44,305
What could this be?

206
00:12:46,606 --> 00:12:47,746
It is a tonic...

207
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,515
that will help you seduce a man.

208
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:58,956
Find a way to be alone with Yoo Se Poong...

209
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,456
and have him consume this.

210
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:04,226
Easy, is it not?

211
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:11,665
Have some delicious crunchy rice.

212
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,035
Delicious, is it not?

213
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:40,710
Gosh.

214
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:46,308
You can sit over there together.

215
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:49,519
You traveled from the island together, did you not?

216
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,929
Why are you staring at me like that?

217
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,058
You are one to talk...

218
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,699
when you chased after her during a busy season.

219
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,299
Granny, take his rice away.

220
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,340
Get yourself your own wife and stop being a jealous fool.

221
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,539
Poong, eat your fill.

222
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,179
That is the key to producing offspring.

223
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,750
Goodness.

224
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,990
- Offspring? - That is a funny one.

225
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,019
Let us happily enjoy our food.

226
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:29,789
Goodness.

227
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:52,880
Here.

228
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,630
Those are the good times.

229
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:09,330
It is now your turn to be swamped by patients.

230
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,830
I am off to Hanyang.

231
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,099
Man Bok, is everything ready?

232
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,169
I have our travel gear ready as well as the petitions.

233
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,638
You just have to follow me out.

234
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,639
Right.

235
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,639
I will come with you since this matter concerns me.

236
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,339
Going to the State Tribunal yourself...

237
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,479
to submit petitions...

238
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,849
that speak of your talent, innocence, and good will?

239
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,419
How embarrassing is that?

240
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,980
You can be so clueless at times.

241
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,120
You are to stay here and treat the patients.

242
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,090
You can get going now. I am sure you will get well soon.

243
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,559
Physician Gye.

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,939
I thought you had left, but you have returned.

245
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:57,740
I had no reason to run away.

246
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,419
Why should I trust you and take you back?

247
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,558
I met with District Governor Ahn at Mohwagak...

248
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,960
for a different matter.

249
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,558
Physician Yoo and I worked at the Medical Office together,

250
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,059
but we did not know each other personally.

251
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,059
Hey, Frog.

252
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,570
Do you see me as a fool?

253
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:25,539
I see the fire burning in your eyes.

254
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:28,669
Whenever the dunce is in your line of sight,

255
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,610
you secretly watch his every move.

256
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,979
Getting defensive, are you?

257
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:42,159
For years, you have felt inferior to Se Yeob.

258
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:46,229
Just like you made it your mission to study hard in Qing,

259
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,729
hone those emotions to make you a better physician.

260
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,370
Do not let it hurt you instead.

261
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,069
In what way did you administer the acupuncture...

262
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,580
that left her with no pulse?

263
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,510
- What was that? - Will she make it?

264
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,350
- What will happen? - Is she dead?

265
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,619
This is bad.

266
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,860
One, two, three.

267
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:20,089
- Goodness. - She is alive.

268
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,759
She would have died had it not been for him.

269
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,899
You almost killed this patient.

270
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:28,070
Do not administer acupuncture if it will put the patient at risk.

271
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:29,968
An unqualified physician...

272
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,600
has no place in the Palace.

273
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,469
How did someone like him get hired by the Medical Office?

274
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,649
- How should I know? - Maybe someone pulled some strings.

275
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,909
He has connections in the Medical Office?

276
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,389
How so?

277
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,388
No matter what Physician Yoo does,

278
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:52,659
everyone puts their trust in him.

279
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,830
Why am I not treated the same way when I am obviously trying hard?

280
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,729
Not even you trust me.

281
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:05,810
That is because you are not an open book.

282
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,309
Harboring secrets...

283
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,949
will never lead you to having your own people.

284
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,289
It applies to romantic relationships...

285
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,050
as well as relationships with your teachers and fathers.

286
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,729
If you think you have no one on your side,

287
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:31,199
take a good look inside yourself and see if you have built a life...

288
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:33,330
on arrogance and lies.

289
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,169
You may have been corrupted...

290
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,510
by the ways of the Medical Office,

291
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:42,169
but you are a talented physician.

292
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,949
You think quickly on your feet,

293
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,820
and you have many other qualities a physician should have.

294
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,489
I told you before...

295
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,059
that a countryside physician...

296
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,130
could save the lives of hundreds and thousands.

297
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:05,459
Do not waste your time eyeing others.

298
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,699
Use that time to save yourself instead.

299
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
Why bring me here?

300
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:32,429
I want our relationship...

301
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,159
to be deeper and stronger.

in the first chapter,

305
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,070
I wrote how we met.

306
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:21,040
I am mentioned in your first chapter?

we should write in it together.

That is what it means.

313

Is it not a great idea?

314
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,899
Yes, it's a great one.

00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Okay?

335
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:47,889
Oh, my gosh!

336
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:50,860
- Oh, no. - It is fine.

337
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:52,189
Leave it.

338
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,830
I will clean up.

339
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:56,729
Goodness.

340
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,398
You. If you want to sleep well,

341
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:06,669
you should not be drinking persimmon punch.

342
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,219
I heard they burned your petition,

343
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:20,749
and you still cannot sleep.

344
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,489
This is...

345
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,498
preserved citron and honey with some water.

346
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:31,030
It will help you sleep.

347
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:33,229
Drink.

348
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,570
Is it good?

349
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,638
People who worry so much...

350
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,909
they feel like they are walking on thin ice...

351
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:50,580
need to sooth their insides with something sweet, I heard.

352
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:55,919
We all have worries. Who does not?

353
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,330
Drink that and eat the citron pieces too, okay?

354
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,109
Can you carry all this? Will your back not break?

355
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,969
Do not worry about him at all.

356
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,540
He is...

357
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,909
much bigger and stronger than you think.

358
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:25,748
Here are some snacks that would make even the King faint if he had some.

359
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:27,849
Use it as a bribe if things do not go your way.

360
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,020
Thank you so much, Lady Namhae.

361
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,388
Before your dunce master asks to tag along,

362
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,458
we must go.

363
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,158
Do not worry about him.

364
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,398
I don't know what it was,

365
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,469
but he did something last night, and he is still fast asleep.

366
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,639
Lady Seo is also in a deep sleep.

367
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,340
They must have been busy all night long, then.

368
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:51,510
That is right. They were busy all night.

369
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,719
I saw them in the storage room.

370
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,149
- What? - What?

371
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,389
They let a child see?

372
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,090
- Tell us what they did. - Yes.

373
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:08,060
They did not sleep last night.

374
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,729
That could not be good for their health.

375
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,800
What else could they have done? It is very obvious.

376
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,770
All night long...

377
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,139
they wrote a journal about the patients.

378
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:22,639
- What? - Darn it.

379
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,738
You are so very strong.

380
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:27,550
- See you. - Bye.

381
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,679
- So long. - Take care.

382
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:36,790
I have everything in place to make sure the physician fool...

383
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:39,360
crashes and burns for good.

384
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:41,859
All you have to do now...

385
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,760
is relax, wait, and enjoy the spoils.

386
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,099
All is well, sir.

387
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,270
So...

388
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,739
what did you put in place?

389
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,610
What? Come on, the scandal.

390
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,880
You told me to create a scandal that would bury them.

391
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,139
I...

392
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,208
No, forget it. I cannot tell.

393
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:02,648
You will see for yourself.

394
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:03,880
Do not worry.

395
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
My goodness.

396
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Why are you so jumpy?

397
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:14,860
You are going home, then?

398
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Take this.

399
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,270
It is warm. What is it?

400
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,709
Open it and see.

401
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,179
Taste it.

402
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:42,219
I know well how you feel.

403
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,159
Keeping it to yourself must have worn you out.

404
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,330
That you are an immigrant.

405
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:53,330
You are from my hometown.

406
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,198
Where did you get the idea...

407
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,370
As if I would not know.

408
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,139
Look at me.

409
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:03,279
I was so tormented,

410
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,709
I completely gave up hiding it.

411
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,010
Eat up.

412
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:23,899
I never said that.

413
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,630
Believe me!

414
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,199
I was away from home with no family.

415
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:33,739
- I had to guess the weather well. - Hear me out!

416
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:36,409
Or I had to see the future.

417
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,209
I had to at least pretend...

418
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,280
to make a living.

419
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,679
People hated me and cursed at me,

420
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:46,189
but they liked my cooking.

421
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:48,649
So I worked hard and got better.

422
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:51,958
If there was a feast or a wake,

423
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,530
I was there in the kitchen.

424
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,800
Is it good?

425
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:58,959
Yes.

426
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,969
What if you run out of places to escape to?

427
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,310
One person...

428
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:12,610
will always reach out.

429
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:17,050
If you take that hand and get up, you can go on again.

430
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,260
You must have had that one person.

431
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,479
Are you all right?

432
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,860
I did.

433
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,189
I took that hand...

434
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,860
and managed to be myself until this day.

435
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I envy you.

436
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,169
Each time I hold a hand,

437
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,899
it belongs to someone who wants to cut off mine.

438
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,409
Will you take mine, then?

439
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:24,350
You have been through a lot.

440
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,219
Today, you should just relax and sleep.

441
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,590
I will not tell anyone that we are from the same village.

442
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,199
Go on in and sleep as much as you want.

443
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,130
Visit me if you ever get homesick.

444
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:02,320
Physician Gye! Man Bok!

445
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:03,959
Physician Gye.

446
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,428
Do you think the petitions are enough...

447
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:10,100
to get Physician Yoo reinstated?

448
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,300
Is there anything else I can do to help?

449
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,070
The petitions are not the only thing we have.

450
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,139
While you were in Heuksan Island,

451
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,149
we gathered some intel on the chief royal physician...

452
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,979
and the others in the Medical Office.

453
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:37,459
I wanted to tell you before I left...

454
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,320
but did not, for I thought it might worry you.

455
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:41,090
Now that we have this on them,

456
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,658
they will not be able to demand...

457
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,959
that all his records be deleted, using that fake evidence,

458
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:47,870
as long as something else does not happen.

459
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
Jeon Kang Il might find this...

460
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:54,439
in my room very soon.

461
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:56,810
I left a fake copy in my room.

462
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,978
Keep an eye on him and find out...

463
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:00,949
what he does with it.

464
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:04,249
That is what you can do for us.

465
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,820
Got it.

466
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:26,610
I planted a spy in the clinic.

467
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,509
It will all blow up when the time comes,

468
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,510
so just wait and see.

469
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:46,090
(Gyesoo Clinic, Palace-affiliated)

470
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,860
Physician Yoo.

471
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:51,860
How do you feel? Did you get some sleep?

472
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,330
I am sorry.

473
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,169
I think I should go home today.

474
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:00,669
All right, you do that.

475
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:03,639
It could be harder to fall asleep when it is not your own bed.

476
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:07,249
Wait, Physician Yoo.

477
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:10,979
Could you...

478
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,320
walk me home?

479
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:32,969
Thank you for your hard work, Physician Gye.

480
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,780
I have always been worried about Se Yeob...

481
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,479
ever since his father passed away.

482
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,310
I am truly relieved that he has you.

483
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,580
I wish I had someone like you whom I could trust and count on...

484
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,949
here in the royal court.

485
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,189
Your Majesty, that book...

486
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,760
Please do not open it yet.

487
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,560
Why not?

488
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:04,600
Nothing listed in that book...

489
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,669
is a grave crime that cannot be forgiven.

490
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,110
I made the list,

491
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
but everyone has a flaw.

492
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:18,080
Open it when you wish to help Physician Yoo,

493
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,520
when someone...

494
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:22,889
tries to falsely accuse him to cause him harm.

495
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,090
If you open it then, you will find it helpful.

496
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,199
So you are advising me not to open it now?

497
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:31,630
That is correct, Your Majesty.

498
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,969
If you read about...

499
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,439
your ministers and aides' petty acts of misconduct,

500
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,869
you might feel repulsed...

501
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:41,240
when you must face them. It concerns me,

502
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,780
so please put it away for now...

503
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,510
and only use it when and if the need arises.

504
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,180
You are concerned that I would be disheartened.

505
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:52,880
You and Se Yeob are very similar.

506
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,889
Well, I hear you have collected a giant pile...

507
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,059
of petitions from Sorak Village.

508
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,329
Yes, Your Majesty. I managed to safely deliver them...

509
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,459
to the State Tribunal before coming to see you.

510
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,130
I am truly relieved.

511
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,599
I could not make my own decision as the King...

512
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,269
for we have received so many requests...

513
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,070
to annul and delete Se Yeob's records.

514
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,640
It looks like I can now help Se Yeob...

515
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,680
as long as another problem does not arise.

516
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,518
Thank you for your trust in us, Your Majesty.

517
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,979
I am much obliged.

518
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,419
Until we can completely put it behind us,

519
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:29,220
please do your best.

520
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,720
I will, Your Majesty.

521
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,869
Physician Yoo.

522
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,840
Please sit here for a moment. I will prepare it quickly.

523
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:49,110
Prepare what?

524
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,640
I wish to cook a meal for you.

525
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,050
Oh, it is okay.

526
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,260
Robbers will target me if they find out I am a widow who lives alone.

527
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,930
I see.

528
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,169
It must have been hard,

529
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,269
having to survive alone.

530
00:35:55,309 --> 00:35:57,840
Yes, all I can do is take one day at a time.

531
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:06,689
I understand how that feels,

532
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,090
to some extent.

533
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,720
You must feel like everyone is pointing their knife at you,

534
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:16,090
threatening and persecuting you.

535
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:19,430
I bet all you can think about is the fact that you have no one.

536
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,169
You must be filled with resentment.

537
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:24,070
Perhaps, do you feel...

538
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,309
as though you are standing on the edge of a cliff?

539
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,880
None of it is your fault,

540
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,990
so please do not beat yourself up.

541
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:44,360
And look around you.

542
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,990
When you are desperately hurting,

543
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,530
you cannot even see a helping hand.

544
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:53,328
Perhaps, someone already tried...

545
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:56,099
to offer you a warm helping hand.

546
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:01,610
Mak Jin! Come and join us.

547
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:02,809
Yes, join us.

548
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:05,609
People who worry so much...

549
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,849
they feel like they are walking on thin ice...

550
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:11,419
need to sooth their insides with something sweet, I heard.

551
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:13,419
I know well how you feel.

552
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,450
Keeping it to yourself must have worn you out.

553
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:20,990
Something is keeping you up at night.

554
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,360
It is causing you so much pain.

555
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,430
I promise you that I will find out what it is.

556
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,970
It may take some time,

557
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:30,599
but I will not give up until the day I find out the reason.

558
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,209
Physician Yoo.

559
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:48,820
Physician Yoo.

560
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,419
I am sorry.

561
00:38:03,038 --> 00:38:04,507
How did it go?

562
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:09,237
Did you give him the philter?

563
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:13,177
The philter. You did, right?

564
00:38:13,308 --> 00:38:15,978
I am sure you did. Right?

565
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:18,217
Right?

566
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:19,688
Answer me!

567
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,388
Why are you not answering?

568
00:38:47,547 --> 00:38:48,777
I cannot do it.

569
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:50,587
I cannot!

570
00:38:50,947 --> 00:38:51,947
What?

571
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:54,986
Why you...

572
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:56,888
Do you wish to die instead?

573
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,397
Please do not do this. Physician Yoo is a good man.

574
00:39:00,398 --> 00:39:02,197
I am a good person as well!

575
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:05,127
You...

576
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:08,368
You will be shipped off to your motherland.

577
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:12,308
Your name will be at the top of the deportation list.

578
00:39:15,808 --> 00:39:17,047
You cannot do that.

579
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:19,607
I will let everyone else know.

580
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:23,788
I will continue to live here in Sorak Village!

581
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,657
Why you...

582
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:30,788
Let go of me!

583
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:58,248
You...

584
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,967
Darn it.

585
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,208
Physician Yoo.

586
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:02,098
Goodness.

587
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:05,697
Have you seen Lady Eun Woo?

588
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:08,538
I have not been able to see her.

589
00:44:08,737 --> 00:44:09,737
I know.

590
00:44:10,168 --> 00:44:12,207
We were finding it peculiar as well.

591
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,208
She is not in her room,

592
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:16,107
the guest room, or even the kitchen.

593
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:17,707
Come to think of it,

594
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,248
the inspector is also nowhere to be seen.

595
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:22,547
Maybe they went on an urgent house call together.

596
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:23,918
Right.

597
00:44:26,317 --> 00:44:27,317
What is that in your hand?

598
00:44:30,317 --> 00:44:32,828
Physician Yoo, please forgive me.

599
00:44:56,848 --> 00:44:57,918
I believe that Mak Jin...

600
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:00,217
tried to drug me.

601
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:02,618
- What? - What are you talking about?

602
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:04,288
Give me that.

603
00:45:11,697 --> 00:45:12,697
Goodness.

604
00:45:13,027 --> 00:45:14,737
This is a philter.

605
00:45:15,898 --> 00:45:18,407
Are you saying she tried to seduce you?

606
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:20,107
Seduce him?

607
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:24,077
Mak Jin, is she not from your hometown?

608
00:45:24,078 --> 00:45:25,078
She is also an immigrant.

609
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:28,018
Did she say anything to you while I was gone?

610
00:45:29,418 --> 00:45:31,446
How did you figure it out...

611
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:33,118
when she changed her accent?

612
00:45:33,288 --> 00:45:34,288
Hold on.

613
00:45:34,388 --> 00:45:36,288
Is she not a local?

614
00:45:36,357 --> 00:45:37,357
Did you know that?

615
00:45:37,427 --> 00:45:38,728
Of course I did.

616
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,426
She may have changed her accent,

617
00:45:40,427 --> 00:45:42,058
but I could tell.

618
00:45:42,427 --> 00:45:44,398
But it was a secret between us.

619
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:47,998
No can do.

620
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:50,067
Something must have happened.

621
00:45:50,768 --> 00:45:53,368
District Governor Ahn would not let this slide.

622
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:57,078
He could have been pressured to expose her...

623
00:45:57,348 --> 00:45:59,507
and used it as leverage to get her to work for him.

624
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,177
Come to think of it,

625
00:46:03,578 --> 00:46:05,918
Qing has requested their people be deported.

626
00:46:06,217 --> 00:46:07,918
He could have used that against her.

627
00:46:08,918 --> 00:46:10,857
Yes, that seems plausible.

628
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:14,027
District Governor Ahn was trying to turn a rumor...

629
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:16,228
into a scandal.

630
00:46:17,228 --> 00:46:18,228
My goodness.

631
00:46:18,998 --> 00:46:19,998
What about Lady Eun Woo?

632
00:46:20,297 --> 00:46:22,998
Could her being absent have anything to do with the matter?

633
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:27,837
Jeon Kang Il might find this...

634
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,808
in my room very soon.

635
00:46:30,407 --> 00:46:32,047
I left a fake copy in my room.

636
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:34,376
Keep an eye on him and find out...

637
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:36,176
what he does with it.

638
00:46:36,177 --> 00:46:39,648
That is what you can do for us.

639
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:47,328
- Lady Eun Woo! - Lady Eun Woo.

640
00:46:47,998 --> 00:46:48,998
Lady Eun Woo?

641
00:46:49,297 --> 00:46:50,558
Jang Gun, come.

642
00:46:51,168 --> 00:46:52,927
- Lady Eun Woo! - Lady Eun Woo.

643
00:46:53,797 --> 00:46:55,098
Let us go that way.

644
00:46:55,668 --> 00:46:56,668
Lady Eun Woo!

645
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:58,438
Lady Eun Woo.

646
00:46:58,938 --> 00:46:59,938
Goodness.

647
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:01,307
Lady Eun Woo!

648
00:47:01,308 --> 00:47:04,748
Young lady! This way.

649
00:47:05,148 --> 00:47:06,347
- Young lady! - Goodness.

650
00:47:06,348 --> 00:47:07,716
We already checked over there.

651
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:09,377
- Come. - No, she is here.

652
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,317
Where could she have gone?

653
00:47:12,587 --> 00:47:13,787
- Lady Eun Woo. - Come this way.

654
00:47:13,788 --> 00:47:15,518
- Physician Gye! - Right.

655
00:47:16,888 --> 00:47:17,888
Was she not over there?

656
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,027
She was not at the market today.

657
00:47:20,427 --> 00:47:22,027
Where could she have gone?

658
00:47:23,027 --> 00:47:24,027
Lady Eun Woo!

659
00:47:25,027 --> 00:47:26,398
- Lady Eun Woo! - Lady Eun Woo!

660
00:47:27,098 --> 00:47:28,598
Where did she go?

661
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:33,138
Man Bok, check the marketplace.

662
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:34,777
I will check the woods.

663
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,478
Young Master,

664
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:38,748
please be careful.

665
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:39,748
Sure.

666
00:47:42,918 --> 00:47:43,918
Let us go.

667
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:46,947
Lady Eun Woo!

668
00:50:42,828 --> 00:50:43,828
It is me.

669
00:50:51,668 --> 00:50:53,438
What on earth are you doing?

670
00:50:54,808 --> 00:50:57,138
Did I not tell you to act rashly?

671
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:07,217
Is this her?

672
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:16,697
What will you do now?

673
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:18,598
No one will know...

674
00:51:18,998 --> 00:51:21,297
of this body once I bury it.

675
00:52:13,348 --> 00:52:14,458
Gosh.

676
00:52:22,328 --> 00:52:23,797
How could a governor...

677
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:26,197
hurt one of his people?

678
00:52:26,828 --> 00:52:28,638
You shameless wench.

679
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,907
You are a widow frolicking with a physician.

680
00:52:32,507 --> 00:52:34,138
How dare you lecture me?

681
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:43,177
I just need you to be silent forever.

682
00:52:59,098 --> 00:53:00,868
What the heck was that?

683
00:53:01,538 --> 00:53:03,167
It is all over, Governor Ahn!

684
00:53:03,168 --> 00:53:04,938
You are making things worse for yourself.

685
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:09,478
Do not tell me what to do!

686
00:53:13,348 --> 00:53:16,047
Please stop this! Please!

687
00:53:18,547 --> 00:53:19,618
Physician Jeon!

688
00:53:23,788 --> 00:53:24,788
Darn it.

689
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:31,127
Run away! Go, now!

690
00:53:35,038 --> 00:53:37,737
Go! Bring people over!

691
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:29,708
Is it getting hard to breathe?

692
00:56:30,407 --> 00:56:32,777
Finally, you are quiet.

693
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:40,348
No!

694
00:56:47,257 --> 00:56:48,357
Lady Eun Woo.

695
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:50,498
Lady Eun Woo.

696
00:56:51,768 --> 00:56:52,768
Lady Eun Woo.

697
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:10,047
Please.

698
00:57:12,848 --> 00:57:14,087
Please.

699
00:59:11,438 --> 00:59:12,438
No...
