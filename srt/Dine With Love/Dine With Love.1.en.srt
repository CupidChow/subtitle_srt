1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,309
President Yu, thank you for your sponsorship and participation of this program.

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:13,169
Our program theme is when we meet people whom we don't like,

3
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,090
what should we cook to close the distance?

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,930
To dislike is because one doesn’t understand.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,809
Not understanding is often because you don't like it and don't want to know.

6
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,509
This stuffed bitter gourd requires deseeding, marinating, cutting, blanching, then mixing stuffing and filling.

7
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:26,850
Let people know that the bitter taste

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,270
can also be delicious.

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,291
Those you don't like

10
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,250
have a lovely side.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,469
Right, we are...
[Dine with Love]

12
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,469
That's it. That's right. Yes, yes, yes. That's what I told you last time.

13
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,390
Okay, that's it for now. Thank you.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,289
The programs President Yu participates in are already online.

15
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,650
It has been posted for thirty minutes.

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,730
Is the content of the manuscript all right?

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,270
Okay, thank you.

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,789
Hey, hurry!

19
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,410
I heard that the Great Devil will be back in a while.

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,670
Don't let him see us cooking.

21
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,350
The PR department is cooking.

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,470
That girl's name is Su Kelan.

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,289
She doesn't like to work overtime, but sometimes when everyone has to work overtime,

24
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:13,350
she'll take her health pot out

25
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,850
and make some "overtime" meals for everyone.

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,169
What a great company atmosphere!

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,909
Sure enough, our President Yu is a good boss.

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,190
Go, Young Man.

29
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,950
Before frying, blanch it in hot water first.

30
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,389
After a while, actually, it can be a little...

31
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:29,409
This is my boss, Yu Hao.

32
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:32,369
People who don't know him think he is perfect,

33
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,710
strong, and warm.

34
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,910
But actually,

35
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,710
he is the real bitter gourd.

36
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,590
Even though it's nutritious,

37
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,930
it's too bitter to eat.

38
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,789
President Yu, there is a program interview tomorrow at three p.m.

39
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,109
Will you participate?

40
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:48,569
Keep it under twenty minutes.

41
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:51,009
Also, the program team feels that using a body double...

42
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,769
Communicating with the program team is your job.

43
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,790
What happened to the press release?

44
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,050
Have I ever said this kind of nonsense? Who wrote it?

45
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,529
Guo Yu? The one who was late every day last week?

46
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,390
Why haven't you fired him yet?

47
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,570
Hello, President Yu.

48
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,530
Hello, President Yu.

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,150
Which department are you from?

50
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,689
I'm from the PR department.

51
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:15,550
My name is Guo Yu.

52
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,789
What do you think of my participation in the "Dine with Love" program?

53
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,169
Our APP mainly distributes fresh and semi-finished products

54
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:34,810
for people who love food.

55
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,169
They like President Yu's

56
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,469
good image, good temperament, and love for food.

57
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,289
Home cooking is still the best.

58
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:42,750
Don't you know I can't cook?

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,150
What are you thinking?

60
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,740
Putting me, who can't cook, in the "Dine with You" show

61
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,680
with people who have excellent cooking skills?

62
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,510
Whether you can cook or not,

63
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,250
it's not important.

64
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,050
You tell him.

65
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,609
"Product endorsers, if profitable, "

66
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,069
"are short-term."

67
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,869
"It will cost millions of dollars."

68
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:08,469
President Yu has a good image and temperament.

69
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:09,650
The fan base is solid.

70
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,769
And the company's brand is connected

71
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:12,890
to the long-term stability of the company.

72
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,009
But if he learns to cook for this, it takes too long

73
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:17,789
and delays the rest of the business operation.

74
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:19,670
The program is just for effect.

75
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,069
There is no need to waste time.

76
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,309
Accurate analysis of the market and user psychology

77
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:25,769
and providing public relation solutions to maximize brand benefits

78
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,789
for me and the company's image. Marketing is the responsibility of your PR department.

79
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:33,749
But you... can only say that kind of nonsense just now.

80
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,410
Do you think you are competent?

81
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,190
Go to the HR department by yourself tomorrow.

82
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,610
Hello, President Yu.

83
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,640
President Yu is here.

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,930
President Yu is coming. He's here.

85
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,330
- Here comes the boss.
- Kelan, tidy up.

86
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,989
To President Yu, who even considers eating to be a time waster,

87
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,390
is called the devil at the office,

88
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,369
by those who know him well.

89
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:19,650
No one likes him.

90
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,770
Are you done with work?

91
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,110
Why don't you leave work first?

92
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,869
The devil is back. You can't cook in front of him.

93
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:40,470
We'll order takeout by ourselves.

94
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,270
Don't worry.

95
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,849
I always thought President Yu was a warm man when I came to work here.

96
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,350
I didn't expect him to be the devil.

97
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,550
Overtime every day,

98
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,889
I don't even dare to eat a good meal.

99
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,009
All right, stop it.

100
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,169
Watch the program.

101
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:54,910
Add more comments.

102
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,829
Are you hungry in the middle of the night?

103
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,190
President Yu, do you lack a girlfriend?

104
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,430
That kind which can eat very well.

105
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,950
When it comes to cooking, it's all closeups.

106
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,129
It's a body double, right?

107
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:05,669
Look at my Weibo. There is a comparison chart.

108
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,030
How did this happen?

109
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,670
Kelan.

110
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,950
What's the matter?

111
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,229
Sure enough, if you have money, you can do whatever you want.

112
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:21,050
True capitalism comes to an end.

113
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,670
- Watch the fun.
- Watch this.

114
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,250
A boss who can't cook also advised others to eat well.

115
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,569
Cooking scenes are said to be done with a body double.

116
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,210
A body double is used to do programs. You can't cook at all, can you?

117
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,900
It must be a body double.

118
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,850
Is he just pretending to work at the company?

119
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,030
How can he be the big boss?

120
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,710
Everything on the show is fake.

121
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,289
It's excessive! To be on the show, just learn yourself.

122
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:42,440
Boycott this program.

123
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,990
[The President who doesn't cook is pursuing others to eat well.]

124
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,920
[The guest on the "Dine with You," is said to have used a different hand on the show.]

125
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,530
What are you looking at?

126
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,550
I didn't know at that time.

127
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,969
I'm about to enter the devil's kitchen.

128
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,609
Striving to make the bitter gourd

129
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,730
taste delicious.

130
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,590
[Dine with Love]

131
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,180
[Episode 1]
[Bitter Gourd Experiment: It's actually delicious.]

132
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,709
Well, our company will release a statement later, all right?

133
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,729
Please trust us. It's all rumors.

134
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:17,749
Please don't use "body double" in your reports please, okay?

135
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:20,110
President Yu really didn't use a body double.

136
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,650
Hello.

137
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,770
Hello. Yes.

138
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,670
"What to Eat" PR department.

139
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,470
Okay, thank you.

140
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,409
Right, right, right. President Yu really didn't use a body double.

141
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:30,290
Yes, yes, yes.

142
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,129
We'll be releasing a statement to the media soon.

143
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,590
Thank you.

144
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,529
So these are your solutions:

145
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,770
first, a statement. Second, control evaluation.

146
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,369
Third, abandon a body double and learn to cook.

147
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,250
Jing Chen, you said in the elevator this afternoon,

148
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,849
if I learn to cook, it has no benefit at all.

149
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,289
It seems this time I can't help it but to learn.

150
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:01,769
The situation is different now.

151
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,369
The matter of using a body double has caused a commotion.

152
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,509
- If not in time–
- Fifty minutes...

153
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,550
Thirty-seven minutes...

154
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,390
Eight minutes...

155
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,630
When the previous program team encountered an emergency,

156
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,309
the communication with the program team with the fastest time to come up with a plan

157
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:17,350
was fifty minutes.

158
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,729
Were you lazy before

159
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:22,490
or is it really a special situation this time?

160
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,589
Spending money on hot search.

161
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:33,089
From posting topics and materials to being on the hot search, how long does it usually take?

162
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,350
One hour.

163
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,949
This time, from the first comment to being a hot search online took eight minutes.

164
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,709
What?

165
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,269
Do you have to discuss this with the program team?

166
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,389
Make it impossible to stop the plan and force me to learn how to cook, right?

167
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,709
President Yu, we are doing it for the sake of the company.

168
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:01,870
If you cooperate with the program team a little,

169
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,610
- you won't be–
- So it's the program team who pays your salaries?

170
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,570
President Yu, we have done our best to communicate the company's position,

171
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,469
but the program team made it very clear.

172
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:16,709
A food columnist

173
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,329
using a body double,

174
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:20,469
I have advised you many times.

175
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:22,609
Either you abandon the body double, make the food yourself—

176
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:23,970
Or what?

177
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,269
Your job is to communicate with the program team,

178
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,369
instead of setting up and forcing your boss.

179
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,929
Are you incapable of this small task?

180
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,029
Yes, I'm working overtime. I won't be able to go back.

181
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,309
It's nothing right now,

182
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,420
but I just can't go.

183
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,449
- Bye-bye.
- Hello.

184
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:47,390
Why don't you and the baby eat first?

185
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,770
I won't be back today.

186
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,269
I can't go back.

187
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,450
You guys eat first.

188
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,290
In this situation, are you still in the mood to cook?

189
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,889
If you eat well, only then are you in a mood to work hard.

190
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,770
Sauté a glove of slices garlic,

191
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,350
add ginger, chopped green onions,

192
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,530
and a small pepper in a little bit of oil.

193
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,650
Add in luncheon meat,

194
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,729
and tofu to stir-fry until golden brown.

195
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:25,770
Add pepper and star anise.

196
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,689
Pour in dark soy sauce, soy sauce, and cooking wine

197
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:31,030
Add the soup base and bring to boil.

198
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,349
A simple pot,

199
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,049

200
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,810
it can be finished in three minutes.

201
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,390
Be careful, it's hot.

202
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,450
Sister Kelan, I'll have a taste, too.

203
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,590
Be careful. It's hot.

204
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,530
Well, it's delicious.

205
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,769
- Sister Kelan, I want it, too.
- I want it, too.

206
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,910
Yao Qian, why don't you share it with everyone?

207
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,889
- Thank you, Sister Kelan.
- Thank you, Sister Kelan.

208
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:07,249
- There is also rice here.
- Yes.

209
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,910
It smells good.

210
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,049
Can you share some with us?

211
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,569
Go away. Even we don't have enough to eat.

212
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:17,149
There is my homemade braised pork in the refrigerator.

213
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,349
Okay, thank you.

214
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:21,509
But don't touch that fish ball. She made it to feed the stray cats downstairs.

215
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:23,230
- Okay.
- I'll get a pair of chopsticks, too.

216
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,869
Even "livestock" feels like themselves again after eating.

217
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:29,710
Sister Kelan, why don't you eat with us?

218
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,350
I can't, I'll have dinner with my mother at home.

219
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,830
Sister Kelan, because you have to eat dinner with your mom, you don't work overtime.

220
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,529
Why bother? I think with your ability, willingness to work overtime,

221
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,229
you would have been promoted with a raise a long time ago.

222
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:45,229
I prefer to be idle, so I can spend more time with my mother.

223
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:47,349
I also have more time to make food for everyone.

224
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:49,610
Thank you, Sister Kelan.

225
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,649
For me, work is for survival.

226
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,549
And life means sharing three meals a day

227
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,309
with the people I love and the warmth and happiness of those spare moments.

228
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:05,749
Survival should not squeeze out your ability to live.

229
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,389
I'm Su Kelan, a salted fish that doesn't like to work overtime.

230
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,749
Kelan, why don't you go back first?

231
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:17,229
Auntie is probably starving. It's already late.

232
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,930
But here...

233
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,749
If there's one more or less of you, how much difference can you make?

234
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,250
Go.

235
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,729
All right, let me go home, have dinner with my mom, and then I'll come back.

236
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:31,389
Director Jing and the team already have a plan.

237
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:35,129
As long as President Yu shows his body in the next show, the program team will cooperate.

238
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,589
Speaking of this time, it's because he has a hand injury.

239
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,289
I think he may not be persuaded.

240
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:41,870
Why?

241
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,429
- What's the matter?
- Hot trending search.

242
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:51,870
Don't you think it went trending too fast?

243
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,009
It's trending so fast, it was well planned.

244
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,110
Well planned?

245
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,130
Are you saying...

246
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,269
Does the Great Devil know?

247
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:06,689
Even I can see it through. You tell me.

248
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,009
The Great Devil certainly doesn't like being setup by others.

249
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,630
I can't stand it anymore.

250
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,710
I resign!

251
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,369
- "Resign"?
- Right.

252
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:39,209
Do you think the world revolves around you?

253
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,750
My work ability shall not be judged by one self-righteous,

254
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,450
blindly confident person!

255
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,210
I'm also resigning.

256
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,110
I also resign.

257
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,030
I don't believe that

258
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,389
someone will clean up this sh*t for you.

259
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,370
President Yu.

260
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,629
Did you gather all employees from the PR department?

261
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:10,190
They are all here.

262
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,530
Who did this?

263
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,110
I did.

264
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,850
With what happened to the company today, you're still in the mood to cook?

265
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,309
Does the company ask you to eat or to work?

266
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:20,230
You work better with a full stomach.

267
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,949
Cooking in the company saves you the time of finding

268
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:25,569
and waiting for food outside.

269
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:29,409
You can have more energy to focus on work.

270
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,730
Isn't it faster to order takeout?

271
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,090
Immersing yourself in the take-out app may be difficult to decide what to eat.

272
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,189
The time spent waiting, you're also easily distracted.

273
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:43,249
So... I made it myself to be more efficient.

274
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,710
President Yu, is there work to be delegated?

275
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,510
Who has been with the company the longest time?

276
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,130
Who drew up the manuscript of eating bitter gourd for the last program?

277
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,809
To dislike is because one doesn’t understand.

278
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:26,950
Not understanding is often because you don't like it, and don't want to know.

279
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,770
Who wrote it?

280
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,870

00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,760
- Yes.
- You understand the concept of "Dine With You"?

284
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,570
You can say that.

285
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,889
Starting today, you're promoted to Director.

286
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:06,188
The salary is twice that of the former director. Double the bonus if you do well.

287
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,408
Sometimes you shouldn't consider yourself as someone too important.

288
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,248
The company you are leaving will be the same as long I'm here.

289

Come to my office.

290
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,169
President Yu, should we still have the new vision planning meeting?

291
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,870
Why do we need it?

292
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,069
Should we take care of the matter first?

293
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:33,209
Are you saying public relations issues are more important than product issues?

294
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,669
It's just the rubbish program team's meddling and not worth wasting my time.

295
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:42,929
Tell the product team to wait for me in the conference room. I'll be there in three minutes.

296
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,780

Turn around.

303
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,209
I want you to talk to the program team immediately.

304
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:11,209
Tell them to stop communications with Jing Chen.

305
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:14,689
They set this up just to force me to learn to cook,

306
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:17,130
but there is no possibility.

307
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,529
In the matter of personnel transfer, An Jie has to notify the program team.

308
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:23,369
You just go back and communicate with them directly.

309
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,589
Give me a call and give me a report before 9 p.m.

310

Do you mean tonight at nine o'clock?

But it's already past working hours.

312
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,650
Are you financially free?

313
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,149
Without financial freedom, why are we discussing off-duty hours?

314
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,970
From now on, your mobile phone is turned on 24 hours a day.

315
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,369
This is the most basic condition to get this salary.

316
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:46,569
If you can't do it, just quit. Someone else will do it.

317
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,470
This time, let's have the right communications with the program team.

320
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,550
Nine o'clock.

321
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,909
President Yu, can I report back to you tomorrow?

322
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:03,449
If I don't get your report before nine o'clock, go to HR by yourself tomorrow.

00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,229
If Yu Hao makes trouble, what shall we do?

353
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:25,309
- Right.
- Let's bring down the hammer.

354
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:26,749
He uses a body double.

355
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:29,589
All kinds of uncooperative blackmail materials are in our hands.

356
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,969
If you make a fuss about money, you'll be ruined.

357
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:33,950
Let him go do it.

358
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,730
You'll see.

359
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,229
Someone like Yu Hao is looking for trouble.

360
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:41,689
Who knows how many people are waiting for his fall from grace.

361
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,230
[Mom]

362
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,650
Mom, it's okay. I'm not tired.

363
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,949
Now I'm working hard as much as I can.

364
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,010
I'll make more money.

365
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,090
So in the future, I can spend more time with you.

366
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,349
Then don't earn this overtime money now.

367
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:10,949
You'll have more time right away.

368
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:12,430
It's not that easy.

369
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,969
Working overtime or not, it's not up to me either.

370
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:16,110
And if I don't work overtime,

371
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,770
how can I make money for your medical treatment?

372
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,549
Mom, I ordered you some takeout.

373
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:26,290
Remember to take an injection before you eat.

374
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,830
- Got it.
- Okay, I must go.

375
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,949
Saying she is not working overtime.

376
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:41,309
But as soon as the boss says promotion,

377
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:42,749
she works overtime immediately.

378
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:44,670
Schemer.

379
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,389
What are you talking about?

380
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:47,949
The boss already caught us.

381
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,189
You dare to say, you're not doing it?

382
00:22:49,189 --> 00:22:50,189
Not working overtime?

383
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:52,149
This is a matter of opinion.

384
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:54,109
When we usually work overtime, did she work as well?

385
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,710
She said something about her mother being sick and needing care.

386
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,790
Because of her mom's sickness, she can't work overtime.

387
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,790
It's not like she's dying soon.

388
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,469
Why are you cursing other people's mothers? Keep your mouth clean.

389
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:06,149
Yao Qian. What you're eating now is made by whom?

390
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:08,229
If it has the ability to break you, don't eat it.

391
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:10,190
You have no conscience.

392
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,630
Besides,

393
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,769
she just doesn't like working overtime in the company.

394
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,110
How many times has she helped you out

395
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,490
at home in the middle of the night?

396
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,409
You don't remember?

397
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:21,629
The script of the Great Devil,

398
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:23,949
none of you could draw it out. It was her who took care of it.

399
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:25,790
Did you forget this as well?

400
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,170
Hello.

401
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,249
Oh, yes.

402
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:34,729
Who doesn't know they are best friends?

403
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:37,869
And they live together upstairs and downstairs.

404
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,510
And...

405
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,329
I also heard that her parents often go to Kelan's to eat.

406
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,849
You can't say bad things about her when you eat her food.

407
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,890
I don't see anyone else talking about her.

408
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,269
Wan Shun, come here.

409
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,009
I brought you fish balls.

410
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,710
Eat it.

411
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,170
Here.

412
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,629
Let's go eat hotpot later.

413
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:15,610
Ask your boyfriend to join you.

414
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,830
Okay, I've been wanting to eat for a long time.

415
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,869
Let's go.

416
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:19,750
This Mao Du hotpot is very delicious.

417
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,269
Let me tell you something. The duck intestines are extremely fresh.

418
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,689
Why do we work so hard?

419
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:32,329
It's because you want to have a life outside of work.

420
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,929
But the harder you work,

421
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:37,710
the less time you have time to live.

422
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,900
[Li Xun]

423
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,369
Hello.

424
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:53,070
I heard something happened at the headquarters.

425
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,129
Three executives were let go in a row.

426
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:57,490
You have been promoted to Director.

427
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,549
Maybe I'll be fired at nine o'clock.

428
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:03,289
I'm sorry. You have so many things today.

429
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:05,649
I'm still working overtime and can't make it back.

430
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:07,589
Why don't you apply for a transfer back?

431
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,989
The company doesn't allow office romance .

432
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:12,569
If we were found out, it would be troublesome.

433
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:14,689
Besides, Chengdu and Chongqing are so close.

434
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:17,989
Every weekend I can come back and have dinner with you.

435
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:20,850
I want to eat together every day.

436
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,130
Then I'll change my name to Tian Tian.

437
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,170
It's too cool.

438
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,190
"Tian Tian" loves you every day.

439
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,560
[Finished work? Go home early for dinner]

440
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,870
Hello.

441
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,169
Express delivery?

442
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:16,690
Bring it to 3207.

443
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,390
I'll cook for you guys.

444
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,189
Director, aren't you tired?

445
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,650
Tired.

446
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,710
As a food program director,

447
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,529
how should cooking food be tiring?

448
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:35,409
It's refreshing. Don't you know?

449
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:37,129
Doesn't anyone think

450
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,709
that holding the handle of the pot in one hand,

451
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:41,129
and in the other hand a spatula for stir-fry,

452
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:42,470
feels like

453
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,850
reigning in the world?

454
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,309
- Director Jin's express delivery?
- Yes.

455
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:49,469
There he is.

456
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:51,070
Thank you.

457
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:56,109
Hello. Excuse me, are you Director Jin Xuan?

458
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:57,810
Express delivery...

459
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,390
A female?

460
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,309
Sirs and Madams, good work. I'm Su Kelan,

461
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:08,910
the new person in charge

462
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,089
of the PR department of "What to eat next?"

463
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:12,450
I'm here to drop off the express delivery for everyone.

464
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,670
W-Wait a minute.

465
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,529
Are you the one that just call now?

466
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:22,990
But there was a man on the phone.

467
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,570
It's like this.

468
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,689
The courier brother helped to make the phone call

469
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,610
and lent this outfit to me.

470
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,989
I said it's my friend's birthday,

471
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:35,110
and I wanted to surprise him.

472
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,929
Rich Golden Autumn Crab.

473
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,029
I brought you some steamed stuffed buns with crab roe.

474
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,669
This restaurant uses crabs from Yangcheng Lake.

475
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:48,569
Three crab-peeling masters working by hand.

476
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:50,769
In one day, they can only peel two hundred crabs at most.

477
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,790
Steamed 50 baskets of steamed buns,

478
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,909
exactly 15 minutes long.

479
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:57,969
If you're familiar with it, steaming longer, the buns turn yellow.

480
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,830
Everybody, try it.

481
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,330
This is good!

482
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,930
You are welcome.

483
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,889
Director Jin, try it, too.

484
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,950
I'm not eating this.

485
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,850
I've already found a sponsor.

486
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,009
You tell Yu Hao, there is no need to send someone again.

487
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,790
Director.

488
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,830
Why don't you look at this first?

489
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,269
After reading it, if you still insist,

490
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:43,230
I'll leave at once.

491
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,930
Basically, this is the situation.

492
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,549
Just follow this plan. Ensuring progress.

493
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:04,910
Good.

494
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,529
Brother.

495
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:10,129
Our plan passed so easily.

496
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:12,230
You're new here, aren't you?

497
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,209
President Yu did not give a negative opinion, it means high praise.

498
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:16,709
When your whole team sees the quarterly bonus,

499
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:17,770
you'll laugh more happily.

500
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,909
Really?

501
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:21,450
I thought President Yu was always very...

502
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,070
Mean?

503
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,329
That's just people who are not content with him would say he's mean.

504
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:26,669
People who are content with him say,

505
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:29,010
it's just his face looks mean.

506
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,150
He's actually easy to get along with.

507
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,249
These personnel changes won't affect the company's institutional structure.

508
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:37,690
President Yu.

509
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,950
Boss.

510
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,549
Didn't Su Kelan from the PR department make these to feed the cat?

511
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,689
President Yu, Xiao Guo, who you fired this morning, has a difficult situation at home.

512
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:14,750
His father is ill.

513
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,410
Is the company a charity?

514
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,750
Who told you to run around the basement?

515
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,789
Don't you know running around the basement is dangerous?

516
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:31,770
What if you get hurt?

517
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,569
I'm very serious now, I'm warning you.

518
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,310
If you run around the basement again,

519
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,410
you go by yourself tomorrow.

520
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,290
There will be no delicious food tomorrow.

521
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,970
Remember.

522
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,370
Go ahead.

523
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,349
Send me all the person's performance and weekly reports.

524
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:11,530
All right, President Yu.

525
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,270
President Yu.

526
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,850
I'm sorry about what happened before.

527
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,410
Could you please give me another chance?

528
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,769
My father is in the hospital.

529
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:25,209
My family has to pay back loans.

530
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:27,009
I really need this job.

531
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:29,390
Can you not fire me?

532
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,210
President Yu.

533
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,889
What do your private affairs have to do with the company?

534
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,750
Yu Hao!

535
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,969
I never thought that

536
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,210
Yu Hao could turn out like this.

537
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,370
Peng Xiao.

538
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,149
Read the apology from that jerk, Yu Hao, to everyone.

539
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,110
Okay.

540
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,090
"I thought about it well."

541
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,410
"Sometimes,"

542
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,069
"I am too self-centered."

543
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,429
How were you self-centered?

544
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:20,449
"I've caused a lot of trouble to those"

545
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:21,749
"whom I've partnered with."

546
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:24,769
- What kind of trouble?
- It's about the body double.

547
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,770
"I hope you can apologize to"

548
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,129
"the program group for me."

549
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:30,530
He even needs someone else to

550
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,949
pass on his apology?

551
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,309
"It will take a little time"

552
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,349
"from understanding mistakes,"

553
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:37,089
"to admitting your mistakes."

554
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:39,130
"In the subsequent program recordings,"

555
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,109
"I will cooperate with the arrangements of the program group."

556
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,490
That's wonderful!

557
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,270
It's awesome. It's awesome.

558
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,010
- Was it good?
- Yes.

559
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,570
Right, just do as I say.

560
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,249
I gave you the content. Hurry up.

561
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:57,989
You are too daring, aren't you?

562
00:32:57,989 --> 00:32:59,869
You're forging imperial edicts.

563
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:01,909
The program team and Yu Hao aren't on the same page.

564
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:03,950
They can't talk calmly to one another.

565
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,049
I'll do it this way.

566
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,829
At least I can eliminate the anger from the program team to be willing to talk to me.

567
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:10,789
But you're presenting the devil to be soft and apologize.

568
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:11,709
Let me tell you.

569
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:14,829
If people discover this, we're both screwed!

570
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,209
Director Jin, you also understand President Yu.

571
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,590
For him to do this,

572
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,690
it's already a great deal of sincerity.

573
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,589
Apologizing is just lip service.

574
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,109
I don't want the show to become his playground.

575
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,170
This is not my original intention.

576
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,030
- But...
- You're nice.

577
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,990
You're also quite good at your job.

578
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,110
But there is no need to suffer indignities from Yu Hao.

579
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,790
All right.

580
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,730
I'll cook for everyone.

581
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:56,489
Director Jin, why don't I cook for everyone to eat?

582
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:58,089
You?

583
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,670
Yes.

584
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,710
President Yu has been reflecting on himself.

585
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,289
He is interested in food, but he doesn't respect the program team.

586
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:07,729
So he wants to use me to communicate with the program team.

587
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:11,929
He also hopes that I can help pass on his passion for food.

588
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,709
Anyway, you don't have to promise anything first.

589
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:19,290
Why don't you try my cooking?

590
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,569
Yu Hao!

591
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:28,069
You cold-blooded b*stard!

592
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,490
Bitter gourd?

593
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:37,609
Bitter gourd is good. Bitter gourd is good for the body.

594
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,489
I didn't expect Director Jin to also like bitter gourd.

595
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,589
My least favorite food

596
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:44,469
is bitter gourd.

597
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,070
I don't like bitter gourd, either.

598
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,930
You don't like it, either.

599
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,090
Salted duck eggs with bitter gourd!

600
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,769
What kind of dish is this?

601
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:11,570
- Is it edible?
- Can it be eaten?

602
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,309
Have you eaten it? I haven't eaten it.

603
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,230
It's 9:00 p.m.

604
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,110
She hasn't called back yet.

605
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,430
I'm sorry.

606
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,990
The subscriber you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

607
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,049
Su Kelan.

608
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:14,269
I told you the mobile phone needs to be turned on 24 hours a day.

609
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:18,349
I don't care what you're doing. Whether you are eating or sleeping,

610
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:20,510
answer the phone right away.

611
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,570
Hello, Lawyer Shao.

612
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,129
Yes, it's about the program team.

613
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:39,449
Send a letter to Love Freshness.

614
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:40,729
They probably want to go on the market.

615
00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:44,649
That's why they risked compensation to increase their popularity.

616
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:46,969
The post went trending so fast. I believe they are the ones behind it.

617
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:48,409
Take a look at our contract for this show.

618
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:50,949
Calculate a maximum amount of compensation for breach of contract to scare them.

619
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:54,209
They're a bunch of artists in a program team that doesn't understand simple math.

620
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:56,510
They will believe in random numbers.

621
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,170
Okay, I'm hanging up.

622
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,009
Su Kelan, no matter where you are right now,

623
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:06,229
immediately meet me at the program team!

624
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:08,929
Don't take mine. I had it first.

625
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:10,530
It's delicious!

626
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,709
- It's delicious!
- I thought you said you didn't like it. Do you eat bitter gourd and rob so fiercely?

627
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,830
Did I say that?

628
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,030
Sister Kelan.

629
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,930
- Why are you taking it from me?
- How did you do it? Teach us!

630
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,410
I'll take yours!

631
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,589
Many people don't like the taste of bitterness.

632
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:25,769
So go to remove the bitterness, be meticulous

633
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,930
by removing the pulp, pickling, and blanching in water.

634
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,470
Then crush and stir-fry salted egg yolk.

635
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,070
Add in the bitter gourd.

636
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,829
Bitter gourd wrapped in salted egg yolk

637
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:36,409
can neutralize the bitter taste.

638
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:39,609
But it can be preserved, the effect of dispelling internal heat.

639
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,389
Even if you don't like certain ingredients,

640
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,209
as long as it's healthy to eat it,

641
00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:45,410
spend some time

642
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,430
to conjure up surprises.

643
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,490
Are you saying

644
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,490
Yu Hao is a bitter gourd?

645
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,050
Then he won't calm down.

646
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,990
I'll calm him down, I will.

647
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,810
Su Kelan.

648
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,450
You just made fried salted eggs with bitter gourd,

649
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,269
and what Yu Hao said in the last program

650
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:43,070
was something very similar.

651
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,290
You wrote his manuscript, didn't you?

652
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,260
Yes.

653
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,549
If you can make such a delicious meal,

654
00:39:56,549 --> 00:39:58,890
someone who is reasonable,

655
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,089
why do you work hard for Yu Hao?

656
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:05,090
I know, right?

657
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,370
I think,

658
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,610
my boss is like a bitter gourd.

659
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,729
A lot of people don't like it.

660
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:16,909
But as adults, who doesn't need to ensure hardship?

661
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:18,310
Can you

662
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,390
remove the bitterness?

663
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,250
You can get rid of the bitterness.

664
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,629
But in fact, a bitter gourd without the bitterness is soulless.

665
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:28,950
Most of the nutrients won't be there.

666
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,449
I feel like

667
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:31,749
the nutrients from the boss

668
00:40:31,749 --> 00:40:33,550
are our payroll.

669
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,929
As a worker,

670
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:39,389
you have to bear hardships in working and developing your soul.

671
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,129
I can't force myself if I can't achieve it.

672
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:43,950
I'll just procrastinate on my work.

673
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,530
I'll wait until the salary is paid.

674
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,849
The thought of buying a lot of delicious food,

675
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:50,489
making your family happy and eating well.

676
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,830
I'm quite happy.

677
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,330
Then...

678
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,450
Don't you think it's hard on you?

679
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,389
Because of his fool's head,

680
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,829
working late into the night,

681
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:03,809
and having to cook so much for us.

682
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,750
Working overnight is hard work.

683
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,529
But cooking is not hard.

684
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,110
Pleasing a stomach is much easier than pleasing people.

685
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,749
Director Jin, when will the next episode be recorded?

686
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:26,409
It's better for me to go back and see when President Yu is ready to prepare.

687
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,769
We'll record next Saturday.

688
00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:33,189
Later, I'll send you the program plans.

689
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:35,070
Thank you, Director Jin!

690
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,189
It smells good. Is the soup ready?

691
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:40,209
- Right.
- Come on, come on.

692
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:42,389
- Do you have bowls?
- Come on, come on.

693
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:45,690
- Bring me the bowl.
- Divide it. Divide it.

694
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,469
- Everyone worked hard.
- It smells good.

695
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:51,149
Director Jin, come and try it.

696
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,389
Sister Kelan, why don't you come work here?

697
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,310
I really want to be fed every day.

698
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,189
To dislike is because one doesn’t understand.

699
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:07,269
Not understanding is often because you don't like it, and you don't want to know.

700
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,780
When you take the step of understanding,

701
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,000
how far is it from liking?

702
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,410
Slow down and drink. It's hot.

703
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,510
It smells good.

00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,089
If you didn't do anything humiliating, why are you afraid of being told on?

710
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:03,749
You have to make it clear to me today!

711
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,529
When you dream talked, who exactly is this Du Du?

712
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:10,529
It's fine if you shout it once, but every time you dream, you've shouted it twelve times!

713
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:13,169
You said that it's a cartoon character. Do you think someone will believe it?

714
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:14,850
Let's break up!

715
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,510
Ladies and Gentlemen, are you satisfied with this show?

716
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,570
Eat well and drink well.

717
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,489
Quite a nice actor, movie king.

718
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:43,029
It's already the sixth time someone broke up with me like this.

719
00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:47,049
Why does no one believe me when I say it's someone from a cartoon?

720
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:51,449
The person you're screaming about is probably not a cartoon character.

721
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:54,009
It's the person that watches it with you.

722
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,910
Let's change the subject.

723
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,069
Here. Let's see how my shop is doing.

724
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,970
Just so-so, such a mess. Don't depend on anything.

725
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,589
If you don't go bankrupt in a month, you win.

726
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,929
Your Uncle, I, opened this place today and on purchase gave gifts to your staff.

727
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:13,130
Is that what you say about me?

728
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,229
This...

729
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:19,089
Where's the mess, Chinese Young Master?

730
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:22,920
You liked it when you were a child, shouting to watch it every day to take me into the tunnel, okay?

731
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,500
- Now you dislike it again.
- When we were younger, it was you crying and shouting for me to watch with you, Bro.

732
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,690
Call me Uncle.

733
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,949
Seems like the dogs ate the truth about the past.

734
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:38,849
Besides, what honest people use a body double as a setup?

735
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,830
Profiteers.

736
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,300
It was made into a big deal.

737
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,610
Now what?

738
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,029
Someone is dealing with it. Don't worry about it.

739
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,209
You, who has to do everything personally,

740
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:04,410
trust others to handle the situation?

741
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:12,210
What kind of person for you to feel so at ease?

742
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,930
Don't touch me.

743
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,170
Look at you. Order!

744
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,410
I'm sorry, I'm late.

745
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,289
- You're late for a blind date. This child is really...
- Don't worry, it's fine.

746
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:31,609

- Sit down.

Quickly, greet our guests.

748
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:36,900
My son, Li Xun, is the Marketing Director at the "What to Eat Next" Chengdu Branch.

749
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,180
He's extremely busy at work.

750
00:45:39,189 --> 00:45:41,629
- It's okay, it's okay.
- A little gift.

751
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:44,949
- Thank you.
- Eat quickly, eat quickly. I'm so embarrassed.

752
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:47,849
- Sister Kelan, where is your car parked?
- I didn't drive here.

753
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:49,769
Sister Kelan, you don't drive?

754
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:51,769
Yu Hao's salary shouldn't be that bad.

755
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:54,029
- How does the Public Relations Director not have a car?
- That's right.

756
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,669
Sister Kelan, why don't you come work with us?

757
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,210
Yes, come and work with us.

758
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,129
That's not it. Because I was born with no sense of direction, I can't drive a car.

759
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:05,150
She can't drive a car.

760
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:08,769
It's so late. I'll give you a ride.

761
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:17,349
No, thank you, Director Jin. My boyfriend will be here in a minute.

762
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:21,670
I'll wait for him. You go first.

00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,609
Director, we're leaving first. Bye-bye, Sister Kelan.

I only said, I agree not to change the sponsor for the time being.

767
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,530
It's to give Yu Hao another chance.

768
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,869
But he can't be like before, using a body double on the show.

769
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:52,389
This is the bottom line. I won't give him a third chance.

770
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:54,709
I understand. Director Jin, you can rest assured.

771
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:58,169

772

No. Don't waste the money. I'm reluctant.

Why would you spend the money on a taxi for her?

808
00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:13,709
It's just talk. It's not like she really wants it.

809
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:20,009
That's right. Can you do me a favor on the market report?

810

00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:48,829
Su Kelan is particularly good at this. Not materialistic.

880
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:51,050
Her father is gone, and her mother is chronically ill.

881
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:53,490
Not being materialistic doesn't mean you can live without food.

882
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,870
♫  Your long hair is softly scattered as you're curled up lazily on the sofa  ♫

883
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:14,270
♫  A milky blossom in coffee, melting gently in the palm of your hand  ♫

884
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:21,310
♫  As the sky slowly darkens, the kitchen lit up with light  ♫

885
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,550
♫  Day by day, you're getting used to the warmth of the smoke from the fireplace  ♫

886
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,309
Hello, a special car service. Excuse me, are you Miss Su?

887
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:27,971
Phone number ending in 2725?

888
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:29,650
- Yes.
- Please get in the car.

889
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:32,960
♫  You have short tousled hair  ♫

890
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,430
♫  You're lightly plucking the guitar  ♫

891
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,350
Mom, did you call me a taxi?

892
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,190
Hello, Miss Su. What is your destination?

893
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:47,830
The person, who placed your order, told me to let you determine the destination.

894
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,790
[Mom, did you call me the taxi?]

897
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,970
♫  I love your companionship every day  ♫

898
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:12,530

900
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:21,070
You're back?

901
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,369
Mom, you're still up.

902
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:25,810
Did you get caught in the rain?

903
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,310
No.

904
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,860
♫  I want to kiss you good night every day  ♫

905
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,540
Mom, you haven't eaten yet.

906
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,380
Come and dry yourself quickly.

907
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,899
I already ate a little.

908
00:56:38,899 --> 00:56:41,100
I still wanted to wait for you to come home.

909
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,300
Wait a minute, okay?

910
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,610
There's soup too. I'll heat it up.

911
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,560
♫  You're the warmth of a sweater being exposed to the sun, comforting and reassuring  ♫

912
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,600
I saw that it was raining.

913
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,910
Have some soup to warm you up.

917
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,240
Mom, why are you watching this drama again?

918
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,120
What "again"?

919
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,000
Just released.

920
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,499
Didn't you just finish watching the finale a couple days ago?

921
00:57:23,499 --> 00:57:25,700
You've seen the drama five times, haven't you?

922
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,600
Really?

923
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,200
I didn't watch this the other day, did I?

924
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,499
You did watch it.

925
00:57:32,499 --> 00:57:35,819
Working late into the night, there will always be fatigue.

926
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,359
The moment of healing

927
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:38,959
is under a lamp

928
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,919
with a delicious meal and being with your family.

929
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,840
In the lonely night,

930
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,640
is there any nice fragrance that can cure you?

931
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,759
Hello, President Yu?

932
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,539
You agreed to report to the company at 9:30 a.m.

933
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:47,879
Do you know what time it is?

934
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,039
Are you going to take Saturday off?

935
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,260
Are you financially stable?

936
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,899
I'm sorry, President Yu. I'll be right there.

937
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,460
Mom, why didn't my alarm clock go off?

938
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,859
Did you turn it off?

939
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:04,200
Yelling at me again.

940
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,540
Can't you share some gentleness with me like how you act in front of others?

941
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,840
Isn't it Saturday today?

942
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,360
Didn't you already solve the situation yesterday?

943
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,100
Not yet, the end of it,

944
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,240
there is still a long way to go.

945
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,120
Mom, I'm leaving.

946
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,340
Have you arrived in Chongqing yet?

947
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,839
Okay, I have to work overtime.

948
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,539
I'll be home a little later today.

949
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:37,600
Then come to my house for dinner at seven tonight.

950
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,460
Okay. See you tonight.

951
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,880
Hello, Meng Meng.

952
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,339
Li Xun and Auntie Wang are coming to my house for dinner in the evening.

953
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:49,920
Would you and your parents like to come?

954
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,420
Sure.

955
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,819
Say, the two of us.

956
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:58,239
We live upstairs and downstairs.

957
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,280
For just anything... Why waste your phone fees?

958
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,640
It's fine that you just yell it out.

959
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,079
Since you're already here, don't hurry back.

960
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,540
Turn around and help me buy groceries.

961
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,300
What? Are you not going with me?

962
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,720
I have to work overtime.

963
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,520
Overtime?

964
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,700
Because of what happened last night?

965
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,760
I'll tell you later.

966
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,940
If Li Xun and Auntie Wang arrive first,

967
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,999
- help me take care of them for me?
- Sure.

968
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:22,799
Li Xun said he would get on the train later.

969
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,500
He may arrive at four or five in the afternoon.

970
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,100
Wait a minute.

971
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,900
Get on the train later?

972
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,060
Yes, he's coming back from Chengdu.

973
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,720
What's wrong?

974
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:43,460
Remember what I told you before?

975
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,720
A sweet-mouthed person like Li Xun

976
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,820
is not necessarily reliable.

977
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,580
What do you mean?

978
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,500
Li Xun came back long ago.

979
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,020
Last night,

980
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,739
I saw him in a restaurant near the company.

981
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,220
You must be mistaken.

982
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,279
I'm going to work.

983
01:01:05,279 --> 01:01:06,500
Remember to help me buy groceries.

984
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,540
Hey! My vision is 5.0!

985
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,640
Why don't you trust me?

986
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,600
You said you'd be here immediately. How long will it take?

987
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,440
Do you want work or not?

988
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:42,640
Even cats know to go to work on time.

989
01:01:46,021 --> 01:01:48,309
Xiao Hei, time for dinner.

990
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:51,740
I tell you to come work overtime, yet you're feeding cats?

991
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,369
Where's Wan Shun?

992
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:57,229
Why is Wan Shun not with you today?

993
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,750
Wan Shun.

994
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,790
Wan Shun!

995
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:04,710
Wan Shun.

996
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:15,525
Li Xun came back long ago.

997
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,390
Remember I told you before?

998
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,630
A sweet-mouthed person like Li Xun

999
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:22,429
is not necessarily reliable.

1000
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:24,330
Wan Shun.

1001
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,849
You can't lie to Xiao Hei just because

1002
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:28,830
he is willing to believe you.

1003
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:32,230
If you lie to it,

1004
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,910
there will be no fish balls to eat.

1005
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:41,309
There may be no time in the future to cook fish balls for you.

1006
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:43,630
Come and eat more.

1007
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,049
Eat it.

1008
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:49,090
You're not eating.

1009
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,449
Then I'll leave it here for you.

1010
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:54,610
Remember to eat later.

1011
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:29,049
Xiao Yi, can people eat cat food?

1012
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,610
Hello, President Yu.

1013
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,010
What happened?

1014
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,789
Excuse me, would you please go out and wait for a while?

1015
01:03:57,789 --> 01:03:59,850
I'll call you back later.

1016
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:10,369
President Yu, you gave me the task of communicating with the program team has been completed.

1017
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:13,490
The next program will be recorded in seven days.

1018
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:17,470
That's good. What about the three chefs?

1019
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,629
I'll let you choose one, President Yu.

1020
01:04:23,629 --> 01:04:25,610
Learn to cook with him.

1021
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,590
Is this what you call the communication result?

1022
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,650
Learn to cook with them?

1023
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:40,109
What's the difference between your results and Jing Chen's?

1024
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:44,830
Allowing the program team to extortionate demands can only be zero times, not countless times, understand?

1025
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:50,049
President Yu, they're not extorting demands from you.

1026
01:04:50,049 --> 01:04:52,729
We're just using the wrong method.

1027
01:04:52,729 --> 01:04:55,420
They've realized that now.

1028
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,530
Look.

1029
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:08,510
I'm going to work.

1030
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,269
Wait, there's one more thing.

1031
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,969
"We really shouldn't for the sake of the program effect,"

1032
01:05:17,969 --> 01:05:23,289
"use such despicable means to push President Yu to the forefront."

1033
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,630
You did it again!

1034
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:29,169
"We really shouldn't for the sake of program effect,"

1035
01:05:29,169 --> 01:05:34,209
"use such despicable means to push Mr. Yu to the forefront."

1036
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:39,309
"I hope you can convey to Mr. Yu our previous apologies."

1037
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:42,209
"I hope your company can cooperate for the long term in the future."

1038
01:05:42,209 --> 01:05:44,590
"Make some sacrifices."

1039
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,050
Jin Xuan apologized, didn't he?

1040
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:55,249
That's impossible. Learning to cook with them is a waste of time.

1041
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:05,569
President Yu, you exercise regularly every day for two hours, right?

1042
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:10,530
Fitness can't increase the company's turnover or profit.

1043
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:14,289
But it's because fitness enhances your image,

1044
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:17,029
it saves on the company's celebrity endorsement fee,

1045
01:06:17,029 --> 01:06:22,249
and lets the advertising budget of the public relations department save 37%.

1046
01:06:22,249 --> 01:06:26,869
Simultaneously, fitness has reduced your health risks.

1047
01:06:26,869 --> 01:06:31,169
In case you get sick, it would bring the company potential loss.

1048
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:37,169
Some things may seem useless, but they can produce greater value.

1049
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,830
From participating in "Dine with Love,"

1050
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:48,709
the turnover of the company increased by 7.352%.

1051
01:06:48,709 --> 01:06:53,950
President Yu, the image of loving food helps improve the image of the company.

1052
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:56,489
If you learn to cook, it makes you proficient in food.

1053
01:06:56,489 --> 01:07:00,429
This image is solid, and even if the future program is over,

1054
01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:04,629
it can also keep the public's objective application, affection, and trust.

1055
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:09,440
Considering the time and cost,

1056
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,719
President Yu, you are young, promising, and smart.

1057
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:15,299
It's so difficult to run a company, but for you, it's effortless.

1058
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:18,459
The time to learn to cook during the program, on an average for every day,

1059
01:07:18,459 --> 01:07:21,260
is just about three minutes of your time.

1060
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:25,020
How about you try it first?

1061
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,699
The analysis of the first half was quite accurate.

1062
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:31,919
In the second half, except for flattery, there was no substantive content.

1063
01:07:31,919 --> 01:07:33,800
It's all nonsense.

1064
01:07:34,787 --> 01:07:40,186
Not flattery, there're facts. President Yu, aren't you clever?

1065
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,759
I've set aside 5 minutes to talk, you can go to the kitchen of a restaurant.

1066
01:07:49,759 --> 01:07:54,340
Boss, should we go observe and learn from the chefs?

1067
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,699
Stir-fried Kidney Blossoms, focus on heat control.

1068
01:08:32,699 --> 01:08:34,639
Hot Dried Silk, focus on knife control.

1069
01:08:34,639 --> 01:08:37,400
Sweet Sour Mandarin fish, focus on seasoning.

1070
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:48,279
Let's call it a day. You may go back first and wait for my news.

1071
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:51,458
I'll talk to you later. You've worked hard.

1072
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,259
Baby, I got off the train.

1073
01:09:02,259 --> 01:09:04,199
When will you be back?

1074
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:08,659
I miss you. After dinner tonight, let's go see a movie together.

1075
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:14,418
Last night, I saw him at the nearby restaurant close to our company.

1076
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:21,399
Well, President Yu, about the chefs just now, are you satisfied with any of them?

1077
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,659
Flashy and unrealistic, it doesn't fit at all with the "What to Eat Next?" brand image.

1078
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:31,620
Do you think it's appropriate?

1079
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,838
You don't even think it's appropriate and asked me what I think.

1080
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:45,359
What kind of food do you think conforms to the brand image of the company?

1081
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:55,149
I remember a saying.

1082
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:58,130
The matter of eating is quite interesting.

1083
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:01,489
When you eat alone, you don't think there's anything special.

1084
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:04,549
Once you start to eat with someone,

1085
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:06,730
when you eat alone again,

1086
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:09,989
you will feel lonely and quiet.

1087
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:12,910
Maybe what matters is not what you are eating,

1088
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:16,790
but who you're eating with.

1089
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,760
I heard you're good at cooking. Why don't you try it?

1090
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:40,200
This thing needs to be done. Someone will do it. You try it.

1091
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,099
Take it as an interview.

1092
01:10:43,099 --> 01:10:48,239
- But President Yu, I am now–
- If you can, tomorrow I'll have the finance department put the tuition fee on your card.

1093
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:55,159
I heard you usually go to work not even willing to take a taxi. You must be very short of money.

1094
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:59,979
As it is now, extra money opportunities are falling from the sky. Are you sure you don't want it?

1095
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:25,810
♫  Who's hiding in a corner of their memories, talking to themselves?  ♫

1096
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:31,170
♫  Even in the void of the night, there's no one there answering  ♫

1097
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:35,390
♫  The moment the wind blows, it awakens me from my fatigue  ♫

1098
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:41,280
♫  Looking at the city lights, it's a contrast to reality  ♫

1099
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:47,460
♫  But we've got to continue down the road  ♫

1100
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:53,670
♫  Taking a step further, will my dream develop into something more  ♫

1101
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:59,510
♫  This world of fireworks, there are unexpected changes  ♫

1102
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:04,930
♫  Being reluctant to be swept away by the scenery  ♫

1103
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,460
♫  As far as the eyes can see, sometimes it feels like you're stranded  ♫

1104
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,620
♫  When I see my future self,  ♫

1105
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,220
♫  only then can I understand why I'm moving forward  ♫

1106
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,930
♫  Still be as stubborn as I've always been  ♫

1107
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:30,270
♫  The uncertain suspense of this world  ♫

1108
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,990
♫  Who has never cried their eyes out before?  ♫

1109
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:36,640
♫  Self-reflection will diminish what may come tomorrow  ♫

1110
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,380
♫  Reconcile with yesterday  ♫

1111
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:41,400
♫  When the raindrops can sigh and cover the glimmer of the starry sky,  ♫

1112
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,140
♫  I look forward to sunny days coming soon after  ♫

1113
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:47,630
♫  Stop and look up to see if we're moving forward together  ♫

1114
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:50,620
♫  Is our pace the same as before?  ♫
