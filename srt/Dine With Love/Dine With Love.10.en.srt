00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,840
I will go back to work now.

3
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,720
I need to familiarize myself with my new job as soon as possible.

00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,360
Today after work, come home with me,

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,340
and we can have dinner together.

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,720
I...

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,000
need to go home and have dinner with my mom.

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,520
Then are you planning

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,280
to continue going back and forth like this in the future?

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,640
Given my family's situation,

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,120
I can't let my mom live alone.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,040
Then how about this?

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,360
You can leave for home early today

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,900
and have dinner with your mom,

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,180
then come to my house

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,900
to have some snacks with me.

An Jie,

21
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,280
is the Marketing Department looking for a new spokesperson?

22
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,220
Yes. Now that we are preparing to go public

23
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,780
we need a promotional campaign.

24
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,040
They're so mysterious and don't discuss anything with us.

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,160
Do they have a problem with us?

26
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,880
Let's go.

27
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,740
Earlier when Director Su entered the office,

28
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,800
she wasn't wearing that outfit, right?

29
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,320
All right. That is fine. No problem.

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,000
In addition, when President Yu entered the office

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,960
he wasn't wearing those clothes, either.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,120
I...I'm not sure.

33
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,020
Director Wang,

34
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,260
shall we go over the project

35
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,040
with the PR Department?

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,500
Instead, why don't you submit an application

37
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,660
requesting a transfer to the PR Department?

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,120
The PR Department

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,940

40
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,360
If she finds out about this matter,

41
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,920
our project will be ruined.

42
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,440
Instead, you should contact the other company directly.

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,700
- Okay.
- All right.

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,780
Why is he so afraid of Director Su finding out about this project?

45
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,760
Everyone knows that President Yu and Director Su are in a relationship.

That's right.

I am about to die of happiness.

Yuhan told me that

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,840
Yu Hao contacted our company to look for a new PR spokesperson for "What To Eat Next."

55
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,260

next time, don't call me even if you are really dying.

59
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,680
Don't go.

60
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,400
I put a lot of energy into helping you change your style.

- For better or worse, you're still a man.
- What?

72
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,220
If I want to win Yu Hao over, I obviously need to know what guys like.

Help me figure out which dress is better.

74
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,620
You are the spokesperson for the seller,

75
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,700
and your job is to attract more female buyers.

76
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,940
Those dresses will make you look like someone trying to flirt with their husbands.

77
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,060
You'd be lucky if the women don't beat you up.

78
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,160
Yu Hao must've been out of his mind to let you be the spokesperson.

79
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,420
What do you think?

80
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,120
Very professional.

Isn't this pretty, innocent,

82
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,140

What's the matter with you?

85
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,340
Yu Hao and Su Kelan are already together.

86
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,660
That doesn't mean they can't break up.

87
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,540
There is no way Su Kelan and Yu Hao can stay together.

88
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,240
Why not?

89
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,640
I heard that she didn't move into his apartment.

90
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,860
Who is the most important person to Su Kelan?

91
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,160
It is not Yu Hao

92
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,640
but her mother.

93
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,500
She needs to take care of her mother,

94
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,700
so it is impossible for them to live together like regular couples.

95
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,520
And what's the most important thing to Yu Hao?

96
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,020
It is his work, not Su Kelan.

97
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,640
So do you think their relationship can last?

98
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,420
Since Yu Hao loves work so much,

99
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,340
of course, he and I are

100
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,840
a perfect match.

101
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,780
He's a workaholic, and so am I.

102
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,920
I'm also the spokesperson for his company.

103
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,420
As for Su Kelan...

104
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,920
What about Su Kelan?

105
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,800
Of course, she's best suited for you.

106
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,900
She loves cooking, and so do you.

107
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,440
She cares about her mother, and you do, too.

108
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,820
Most importantly,

109
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,640
her mother also likes you.

110
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,600
That's what makes you two a perfect match.

111
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,420
I've got an idea.

115
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,780
Yes.

116
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,660
They are working on a plan right now.

117
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,300
I will report back to you once it is finalized.

118
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,360
All right.

119
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,660
Okay. See you.

120
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,360

Make sure to check this data carefully.

122
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,160
Don't make any mistakes.

123
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,860
Okay.

124
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,380
And these too. Okay?

125
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,940

126
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,140

Please include me in the next meeting of the Marketing Department.

130
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,560
Some investors want to know about our plans for promotion.

131
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,420
I'd like to join the meeting so that I can brief them.

132
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,780
Director Su, you don't have to use the investors as a front.

133
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,040
You can just notify me whenever you want to call a meeting.

134

Director Wang, I didn't mean that.

135
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,260
I will join the meeting as just an attendee.

136
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,520
You are the VP who's in charge of the Marketing Department.

137

Then I will discuss the time with you later.

139

Have you handled the problems with the contract I mentioned to you?

140
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
Are you still working on it?

141
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,120
Get it done as soon as possible.

142
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,760
Especially the sixth article.

143
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,880
We can't let them write it that way.

144
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,120
Otherwise, it'll be too much of a risk for us.

145
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,060
That's right.

146
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,980
Discuss this with the lawyer

147
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,840
and find a middle ground.

148
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,420
Get this done as soon as possible.

149
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,840

150

What's wrong?

151
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,260
You didn't inform Wang Yi that I'm not taking the VP position?

152
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,980
I didn't.

153
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,480
Why not?

154
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,560
With your competence,

155
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,100
you are the perfect fit for the VP position.

156
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,880
Besides, you deserve a better career development path.

157
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,700
This way, we will also have more time to be together. Isn't that nice?

158
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,960
What about my mom then?

159
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,400
If you keep me at work, who will take care of her?

160
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,020
I'm not saying that I'll keep you from taking care of her.

161
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,000
I just think...

162
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,040
Kelan,

163
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,380
your life has been revolving around your mother,

164
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,760
and you didn't care about yourself at all.

165
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,420
Neither did you plan for your future.

166
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:36,480
I sincerely hope that you'd start thinking more about yourself and pay more attention to your career.

167
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,860
After all,

168
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,180
your mother can't stay by your side forever.

169
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,240
What do you mean my mother can't be with me forever?

170
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,840
I'm going upstairs.

[Su Kelan]

172
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,180
- Thank you, Director Jin.
- Auntie, please don't mention it.

173
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,600
- Please take good care of yourself.
- I will.

174
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,420
Director Jin, what brought you here?

175
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,720
With the right tool,

176
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,180
you can poach anything you want.

177
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,080
Go to Kelan's home?

178
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,640
Wouldn't that be troublesome for her?

179
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
She's so busy with work.

180
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,540
If you help take care of her mother and keep her company,

181
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,960
she'd be really grateful to you.

182
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,920
If you think it is too awkward,

183
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,640
I can wait for you downstairs.

184
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,440
I will help you stall her when she comes back.

185
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,760
You can leave as soon as you get my message.

186
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,500
Director Jin noticed last time that I like fish,

187
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,880
so he brought me some.

188
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,320
Thank you.

189
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,920
You are welcome.

190
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,240
Auntie, Kelan, I won't disturb you anymore.

191
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,900
I'm leaving.

192
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,460
Director Jin,

193
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,420
thank you for helping Kelan.

194
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,620
When you are free,

195
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,640
Kelan and I would like to treat you to a meal.

196
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,080
Okay.

197
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,180
Kelan, see him off.

198
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,380
Don't bother.

199
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,200
I can find my way out.

200
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,280
Auntie, see you next time.

201
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,300
Take care.

202
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,180
Why didn't you see him off?

203
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,300
Would you like me to come upstairs?

204
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,460
Don't bother. I'm fine.

205
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,280
Please go home. You don't have to wait for me.

206
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,160
Please don't mind what I said earlier.

207
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,800
I will have dinner with my mom,

208
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,180
and then come over to your apartment.

209
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,780
How to please your mother-in-law?

210
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,580
President Yu, go upstairs.

211
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,060
Go upstairs and make it a competition.

212
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,180
That would be very thrilling.

213
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,460
Why did you come back?

214
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,200
Why didn't you stay longer?

215
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,760
Why didn't you text me that Kelan came back?

216
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,000
I got distracted and didn't see her.

217
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Where's my phone?

218
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,420
Go upstairs to get it back, and you can even stay for dinner.

219
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,600
Don't let my big plan go to waste.

220
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,760
Big plan?

221
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,560
Which big plan?

222
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,140
I'm just trying to help you.

223
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,740
So you didn't tell me Kelan was back on purpose?

224
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,900
I can't believe you...

225
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,080
Su Kelan?

226
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,280
- Kelan.
- Director Jin.

227
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,840
You forgot your phone.

228
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,300
Here.

229
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,660
Thank you.

230
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,020
I should thank you.

231
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,920
I'm sorry that I resigned so suddenly

232
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,700
and caused you trouble.

233
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,600
It is no trouble at all.

234
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,260
How have you been doing?

235
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,640
I'm good. Just a little busy.

236
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,820
What about you?

237
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,160
I've been busy with the program.

238
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,680
Kelan, can you please visit the site to coordinate the shooting next time?

239
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,500
Peng Xiao said he's gotten used to working with you.

240
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,780
Han Meng has come back from her honeymoon.

241
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,100
She's very easy-going.

242
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,300
There shouldn't be a problem working with her.

243
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,480
Then...

244
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,540
Then can you visit the site during the shooting next time?

245
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,720
If Yu Hao makes a scene again, you are the only one who can calm him down.

246
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,580
She can't.

247
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,460
My mom forgot to pick up her medicine at the hospital today.

248
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,400
Director Jin stopped by to bring it to her.

249
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,740
He forgot his phone, so I came down to give it to him.

250
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,740
Got it.

251
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,640
Then I should thank you, Director Jin,

252
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,080
for coming all the way here.

253
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,680
Auntie is the most important person to Kelan,

254
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,600
So, of course, I had to come here.

255
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,720
Unlike you,

256
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm not that self-centered.

257
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,260
Director Jin, I appreciate your help today.

258
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,440
My mom and I will treat you to a meal one day.

259
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,620
Then we are leaving.

260
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,820
Let's go.

261
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,620
Sure.

262
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,580
See you, Director Jin.

263
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,800
Come on. Follow them.

264
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,180
Confront him head-on.

265
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,200
It must be very awkward for Yu Hao to have dinner with Mrs. Su.

266
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,260
You'll definitely win this round.

267
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,400
Zhang Bi,

268
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,700
you are being really silly right now.

269
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,500
I'm being silly for the sake of your happiness.

270
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,180
How dare you blame me?

271
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,380
Don't make it sound like you don't want to steal her away from him.

272
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,600
Open the door.

273
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,380
Jin Xuan! Jin Xuan!

274
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,180
You are a jerk!

275
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,340
- Let's eat.
- Let me.

276
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,380
It is okay. I can handle it.

277
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,060
Sit.

278
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,860
Mom, let's eat.

279
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,760
Help yourself.

280
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,980
These are just some home-cooked dishes.

281
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,640
- Here.
- Auntie.

282
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,300
Mom, have some meat.

283
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,460
Mom, have some soup.

284
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,860
The soup

285
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,480
is delicious.

286
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,580
Then have some more.

287
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,380
Mom.

288
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,020
Auntie,

289
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,960
is this tofu?

290
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,820
Yes, it is tofu.

291
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,200
I thought it looked like tofu.

292
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,160
I didn't know you were a conversation killer.

293
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm not as good as Jin Xuan in terms of having casual conversations.

294
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,260
When are you going to invite him over for dinner?

295
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,540
- Are you angry?
- No.

296
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,280
- Jealous?
- Not really.

297
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,780
Come on.

298
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,000
I will teach you how to have casual conversations.

299
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,740
What do you want to cook for the next episode?

300
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,220
You can come over. My mom and I can teach you together.

301
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,720
Okay?

302
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,600
I don't want to attend the next episode.

303
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,520
You've been doing very well. Why not?

304
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,700
I don't know what to say.

305
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,480
It is okay.

306
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,620
- I will draft a speech outline for you.
- Please don't.

307
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,920
I don't want to give that Jin Xuan another chance to get close to you.

308
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,400
We are talking about work. Why are you thinking like a lover?

309
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,280
Kelan,

310
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,600
to be honest,

311
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,660
it is not like I don't want to be a part of your life.

312
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,560
I just…

313
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,620
need more time to get used to it.

314
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,880
I can see that.

315
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,180
Don't worry.

316
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,720
In our relationship,

317
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,340
both of us will have to learn to compromise,

318
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,420
until we can find the right rhythm that works for us.

319
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,040
So stop obsessing over who should be

320
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,900
making the compromises, okay?

321
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,540
That doesn't sound right.

322
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,720
What's wrong?

323
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,040
You're the one who got upset first. Remember?

324
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,180
All right, then

325
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,600
whoever gets upset will be punished in the future.

326
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
What's the punishment?

327
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,020
The punishment...

328
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,000
will be...

329
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,120
to be kissed by the other.

330
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,620
Have I been punished enough?

331
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,860
Nope.

332
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,260
Divorce?

333
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,310
[Marriage Certificate]

334
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,700
What on earth is going on, sister?

335
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,460
Are you serious?

336
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,380
How come you got divorced right after the honeymoon?

337
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,760
What did you do exactly?

338
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,540
[Car Maintenance]

339
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,420
Hi.

340
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,460
Please help me maintain the car.

341
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Sure. This way, please.

342
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,320
Honey.

343
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,820
We are back home now. Why are you so upset?

344
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,420
You didn't have enough fun?

345
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,540
You forgot to pack lots of stuff

346
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,820
and even got us lost.

347
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,180
Can you be a little more "reliable" than that?

348
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,280
But

349
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,080
if we had not been lost and gotten stuck on the way,

350
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,880
we wouldn't have encountered those herders,

351
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,040
and embarked on a true adventure with them.

352
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,480
Getting the opportunity to live with the locals,

353
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,740
is much more interesting.

354
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,120
They even gave you a hand-made, consecrated bracelet.

355
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,740
Isn't it pretty?

356
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,510
As pretty as you are.

357
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,720
Where's your ring?

358
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,500
Since the beginning, you had your eyes on the bracelet,

359
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,320
and they didn't want to give it to you.

360
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,400
So the night before we came back, I had a drink with them,

361
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,760
and they finally agreed to trade.

362
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,060
Don't get angry.

363
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,320
I was planning on buying a new ring first thing tomorrow morning.

364
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,300
I promise it'll be the same as before.

365
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,430
Meng Meng. Meng Meng.

366
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,160
So that's why you divorced him?

367
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,620
How can you laugh at me?

368
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,780
Can I post a moment?

369
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,400
Are you laughing?

370
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,460
How can you laugh?

371
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,880
Don't you remember how I helped you chase Su Kelan?

372
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,700
Your uncle just got divorced.

373
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,580
How can you laugh?

374
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,300
When she said she wanted a divorce,

375
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,100
you could've said no.

376
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,520
It takes two to make a marriage work.

377
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,160
I have my temper too, okay?

378
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,020
I apologized and begged the whole way,

379
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,420
but she kept on becoming more and more unreasonable.

380
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,500
So I let it be.

381
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,380
Like I really care.

382
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,740
With your personality,

383
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,900
I bet in a few days

384
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,660
you'll be begging her to marry you again.

385
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,160
I bet that you two will get married again in a few days.

386
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,180
- No way!
- No way!

387
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,480
How could he trade our wedding ring?

388
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,640
Do you think that I really liked that stupid bracelet?

389
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,940
He actually traded our wedding ring for it.

390
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,500
It is just a ring.

391
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,680
I can easily buy another one that looks exactly the same.

392
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,820
Who... Who would've thought she'd divorce me over it?

393
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,360
Do you know what "saying something out of anger" is?

394
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,580
The moment I said divorce,

395
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,440
he actually agreed without hesitation.

396
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,160
How could he trade our wedding ring?

397
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,780
Kelan.

398
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,840
Mom.

399
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,340
How is Meng Meng doing?

400
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,000
She fell asleep.

401
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,060
She didn't tell her parents about the divorce.

402
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,000
I think she still wants to get back together with him.

403
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,400
Oh!

404
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Are you going to Yu Hao's to discuss this with him?

405
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,300
Yes.

406
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,460
Then will you

407
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,800
keep going back and forth like this in the future?

408
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,600
Then are you planning to continue going back and forth like this in the future?

409
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,720
Is he okay

410
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,420
with your current situation?

411
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,500
If he's not okay with it,

412
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,890
I will dump him.

413
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,140
All right.

414
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,760
About the Marketing Department's matter, you can talk to Vice President Su directly.

415
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,760
What are you doing in the office?

416
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,340
Gong Wenxing took over my apartment.

417
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,080
They are angry with each other right now.

418
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,940
Meng Meng didn't tell her parents about the divorce.

419
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,370
Gong Wenxing didn't tell his mother either, right?

420
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,810
No.

421
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,180
Then let's find a time

422
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,440
and have them sit down.

423
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,780
I think they'll forgive each other after they meet and talk it out.

424
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,340
Sure.

425
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,800
Then is there anything else?

426
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,940
If there's nothing else, I will

427
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,300
go home now.

428
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,640
Your mother is unhappy, isn't she?

429
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,880
My mother?

430
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,430
I bet your mom's unhappy.

431
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,610
[How does one get along with the mother-in-law?]

432
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,620
Talk about your slow reaction.

433
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,060
Are you worried about my mom now?

434
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,260
But I really didn't expect that

435
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,110
you would be so bad at having casual conversations.

436
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,020
How do you have casual conversations anyway?

437
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,340
Just talk about day-to-day stuff.

438
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,040
Haven't you ever chatted at home with your—

439
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,720
I'm sorry.

440
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,340
When my mother was still alive,

441
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,980
all she talked about was my father's work.

442
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,680
After my mother passed away,

443
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,820
my grandmother always

444
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,040
thought her death was my father's fault.

445
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,020
Therefore, she wouldn't let him see me.

446
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,280
Ever since then,

447
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,100
I have always lived with Gong Wenxing and my grandmother.

448
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,160
Maybe it was because I was so young at the time,

449
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,920
I didn't dare to say much, since I was afraid I'd say something wrong.

450
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,940
If I said the wrong thing and they got upset, it would have been so awkward.

451
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,300
Maybe that's why,

452
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,420
even now,

453
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,520
I can't really maintain casual conversations.

454
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,040
Then you...

455
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,140
Ever since then, have you never seen your father?

456
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,640
Once, at the beginning of middle school,

457
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,740
he came looking for me

458
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,660
at the school entrance.

459
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,760
It was my birthday that day,

460
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,980
and he brought me a pair of shoes.

461
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,240
But my grandmother threw them away.

462
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,320
Since then,

463
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,160
I haven't seen him.

464
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,400
So your hatred for your father...

465
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,600
is it because of your mother?

466
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,920
I'm not saying I hate him.

467
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,320
Then why didn't you meet him?

468
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,300
If I saw him,

469
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,380
I wouldn't know what to say.

470
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,680
You are not good at holding casual conversations,

471
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,620
and you are afraid of awkwardness.

472
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,770
Yet I still dragged you to have dinner with my mother.

473
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,020
It is okay.

474
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,490
I will learn.

475
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,100
Since you felt so uncomfortable at dinner,

476
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,400
I bet you didn't get enough to eat, right?

477
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,110
Then why don't I cook something good for you?

478
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,270
Here you go.

479
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,190
Thank you.

480
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,712
It is sweet.

481
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,120
Yes.

482
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,920
Why is it sweet?

483
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,780
It is supposed to be sweet.

484
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,580
Have you never had it sweet like this before?

485
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,560
Shouldn't soft bean curd be salty or spicy?

486
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,920
Spicy?

487
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,500
Isn't it normal for people from Chongqing to eat spicy food?

488
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,520
That doesn't mean that everything has to be spicy.

489
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,740
Would you make dark brown sugar sticky rice cake spicy?

490
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,500
That makes sense.

491
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,360
But soft bean curd isn't a dessert.

492
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,840
But people also make sweet soft bean curd.

493
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,740
Wait a minute. How can someone who created a fine food app be so uninformed?

494
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,380
Knowing it and accepting it

495
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,740
are two different issues.

496
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,160
Don't you think that

497
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,420
what we just talked about isn't very enlightening but is still quite interesting.

498
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,400
How is that interesting?

499
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,400
My father used to tell me that

500
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,040
food is the perfect topic to break the ice.

501
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,280
He said that

502
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,660
no matter how different the food is between the north and the south,

503
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,760
when people first greet each other, they all say,

504
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,600
"Have you eaten?"

505
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,500
Food reflects culture, one's character, life experiences, etc.

506
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,720
It is the best way to get to know someone.

507
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,840
If you are curious and truly care then,

508
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,740
having casual conversations isn't actually that hard.

509
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,920
Is the sweet soft bean curd tasty?

510
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,400
I still think it is a little odd.

511
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm full.

512
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,190
Let's stay in the office tonight and work.

513
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,060
Don't you think that if someone suddenly came in to do some work—

514
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,660
No one will come.

515
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,650
Even if they do, they won't be able to get in.

516
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,660
I turned off the electronic lock.

517
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,900
Now, let's work.

518
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,020
I don't want to.

519
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,580
Yes, you do.

520
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,580
No.

521
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,160
Yes.

522
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,600
No.

523
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,910
[President Zhao]

524
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,980
Hello? President Zhao.

525
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,760
Yu Hao,

526
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,420
President Zhao said he will come by next week.

527
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,700
Let's work overtime.

528
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,150
My phone is ringing.

529
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,480
[An Jie]

530
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,120
Shouldn't I answer my phone since we're working overtime?

531
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,260
Director Han, are you back from your honeymoon?

532
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,420
Yes.

533
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,340
You've got dark circles under your eyes.

534
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,780
Have you been under that much pressure at work?

535
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,180
Last night, he came back to the company to grab some documents.

536
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,940
Who knows what happened, but he somehow got locked in.

537
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,240
Don't talk about last night anymore.

538
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,940
What happened?

539
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,580
Oh...

540
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,160
Last night,

541
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,820
I was working overtime in the office.

542
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,510
Somehow I got locked in.

543
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,940
It is rare that President Yu doesn't want us to work overtime.

544
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,700
Why are you back in the office?

545
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,800
I still have some unfinished work.

546
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,040
I'm afraid I will get yelled at tomorrow if I don't finish it.

547
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,560
Okay, okay. See you tomorrow.

548
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,300
Okay, good.

549
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,520
I don't know what else to say.

550
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,460
Last night, were you really locked in the office?

551
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,560
Well, did anybody see my goji berries?

552
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,720
President Yu,

553
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,380
Kelan didn't come home last night either.

554
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,600
If I remember right, someone stayed at your house last night.

555
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,160
Yao Qian, please talk to the programming crew about the theme for the next week's episode.

556
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,950
All right, Sister Kelan.

557
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,230
Director Su,

558
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,140
last night I came up with a detailed plan for the commercial shoot.

559
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,140
Would you like to check it?

560
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,820
Director Su, let's check it.

561
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,140
What?

562
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,820
You went to the office,

563
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,660
and he locked the door?

564
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,240
So you two just sat face to face and worked together?

565
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,820
Yes.

566
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,440
Good for you.

567
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,940
As if you were two high school students preparing for the college entrance exams.

568
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,680
You have already worked the whole night. Now stop checking your phone.

569
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,460
I can't believe you wasted such a precious evening.

570
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,560
Or

571
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,340
is the office too small

572
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,280
for you to do stuff?

573
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,640
What are you talking about?

574
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,360
You know the intern with black-rimmed glasses from the IT Department,

575
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,460
don't you?

576
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,440
He also spent the whole night in the office last night.

577
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,700
Will you confess or not?

578
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,080
I've got a witness here.

579
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,300
Can you promise that you two

580
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,380
spent the whole night working

581
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,500
and didn't

582
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,160
do anything else at all? Not even a little bit?

583
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,480
Tell me the truth.

584
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,240
Come on.

585
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,310
[Director Wang]

586
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,420
Director Su, I'm free right now and am available to report the matters regarding the marketing department.

587
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,180
Director Su, are you there?

588
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,780
Director Su?

589
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,240
Give me 10 minutes.

590
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,540
Director Su?

591
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,940
If it is too late, I will find another time.

592
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,180
It is okay.

593
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,780
No problem.

594
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm listening.

595
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,400
All right.

596
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,820
Director Su?

597
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,680
Hold on a second, please.

598
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,060
Sure.

599
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,750
You can start now.

600
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,100
If there are any changes,

601
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,240
I will have Yao Qian follow up.

602
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,620
You can also talk to Yao Qian directly.

603
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,920
Okay.

604
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,620
I see.

605
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,060
How many people?

606
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,640
When will the plan be finalized?

607
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,180
All right.

608
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,980
Any more questions?

609
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,660
That's not a problem.

610
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,180
Yes.

611
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,160
That's right.

612
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,060
All right, if you have any other questions, call me any time.

613
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,480
The number on the contract is incorrect. How can they send it over to me like that?

614
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,540
Could you get me a cup of coffee?

615
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,640
Su Kelan, I can't believe you.

616
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
You even brought along the toiletry kit, yet you didn't do anything.

617
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,920
Lower your voice.

618
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,700
Gosh.

619
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,800
New message. Hurry.

620
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,920
Try to get off work early today and have dinner with your mom.

621
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,108
Then come over to my apartment after dinner.

622
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:04,920
Oh wow, "Come over to my apartment."

623
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,100
Reply to him.

624
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,960
Hurry. I want to see it.

625
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,780
Are you going to ask me to be your assistant and make coffee for you again?

626
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,000
Then

627
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,820
are you upset with him?

628
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,665
You were the one who started the meeting.

629
00:47:17,665 --> 00:47:19,580
How can you blame him?

630
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,600
I had the meeting for his sake.

631
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,480
He promoted me as the VP,

632
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,200
and Old Wang is very upset about it.

633
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,140
That's why he called me that late on purpose.

634
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,760
If I hadn't answered, he'd have made things more difficult for me.

635
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,380
Then you may as well ask him to follow your lead as the VP.

636
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,940
I didn't agree to be the VP.

637
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,540
What?

638
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,060
That's what bothers you?

639
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,860
I thought it was for something more important.

640
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,360
Most people can only dream of

641
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,980
being promoted and getting a raise.

642
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,240
You are the only one who's hesitating like this.

643
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,040
Is this your way of showing off?

644
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,520
No.

645
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,800
You already know my family's situation.

646
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,920
He refused to remove me from the position.

647
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,960
If I keep asking, he will get upset again.

648
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,500
I think,

649
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,050
if he really gets upset about this,

650
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,800
then he truly cares about you.

651
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,900
Look,

652
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,620
most men

653
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,780
would prefer their wife to stay-at-home full time.

654
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,520
But he promoted you,

655
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,820
because he hoped to spend more time with you,

656
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,580
and most importantly,

657
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,120
because he trusts you,

658
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,720
and appreciates you.

659
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,420
I know.

660
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,140
- But my mom—
- Kelan.

661
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,080
It may sound a little harsh,

662
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,280
but if you think about it,

663
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,320
for the rest of your life,

664
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,320
who do you think can stay by your side and accompany you

665
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,020
till the end?

666
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,040
Ever since that accident happened to your family,

667
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,100
you've been letting your life,

668
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,860
and relationships revolve around your mother.

669
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,440
You've completely lost yourself.

670
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,660
It is true that Yu Hao

671
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,600
should've discussed it with you first before making the decision.

672
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,960
But if you come to think of it,

673
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,680
this job

674
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,560
is important to you

675
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,000
mostly because of its value and meaning.

676
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,320
Meng Meng,

677
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,480
don't forget that we'll be having dinner together tonight.

678
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,600
Are you still angry with him? How long are you planning on staying at my house?

679
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,430
What?

680
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,840
What are you saying? Am I wasting your time?

681
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,900
Do you think changing the subject will solve the problem?

682
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,380
You are changing the subject as well.

683
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,480
Whatever!

684
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,340
Anyway, I don't want to see him.

685
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,440
There's no way I will talk to him first.

686
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,580
Such sulky thoughts are really unnecessary in a relationship.

687
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,380
- Do you also think it was just me being sulky when I mentioned divorce?
- Yes.

688
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,840
Then let me ask you.

689
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,900
If you were him,

690
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,760
would you trade your wedding ring for something so insignificant?

691
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,400
When he put this ring on my finger,

692
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,640
and laid his eyes on me,

693
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,080
I felt like he entrusted the rest of his life to me.

694
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,640
And when I put that ring on his finger,

695
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,640
to me the ring

696
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,960
was a symbol of my promise,

697
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,500
and loyalty. That I'd be with him

698
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,970
forever and ever.

699
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,400
And yet he, on the other hand,

700
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,840
thoughtlessly traded that ring,

701
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,140
and still doesn't get why I am so upset.

702
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,170
I'm heartbroken

703
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,060
because he misunderstood my sadness to be a willful act.

704
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,620
You didn't come home last night.

705
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,840
So consider this as my room rental.

706
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,660
As your uncle, I hope you can keep up the good work,

707
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,633
and achieve greater glories.

708
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:32,469
[Special for Men]

709
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,360
Han Meng is downstairs right now. She and Su Kelan go downstairs for coffee every day.

710
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,460
Who said I'm here to see her?

711
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,000
Listen, if you want to apologize to her and butter her up, then please go ahead.

712
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,160
But could you please stop disturbing me at work and staying at my house. Stop taking over my personal space, brother.

713
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,000
Call me "Uncle."

714
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,720
We used to live together, and you never had any problem with that.

715
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,440
So what's the difference now?

716
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,030
Wow.

717
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,680
I know you.

718
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,720
Home can be boring.

719
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,840
It is more exciting...

720
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,340
in the office.

721
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:41,480
What's the matter with you? Knock it off, will you?

722
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,720
- Don't talk to your uncle like that.
- Give it to me.

723
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,580
No! I won't! Hao Hao, stop it!

724
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,380
No! Don't!

725
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,920
Come on, you need to leave. Go, Just leave,

726
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,080
else I will call security.

727
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,120
Do you think that,

728
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,920
trading the wedding ring

729
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,680
is a terrible thing?

730
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,340
You should ask her. Why are you asking me?

731
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,380
Because you are rational.

732
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,760
There's no rationality when it comes to love.

733
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,760
Besides, if we are being rational here, the wedding ring belonged to both of you.

734
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,440
You shouldn't have made the decision by yourself.

735
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,220
Come home early tonight. I will join you for dinner.

736
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,820
You know what? If you don't leave, Han Meng will be back at work soon.

737
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,540
But I did apologize to her. I said I was sorry, and I begged for her forgiveness.

738
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,540
It was just a ring. Could it be more important than me?

739
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,040
She wanted a divorce over such a trivial matter. Isn't this partly her fault?

740
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,100
So... I'm the unreasonable one,

741
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,060
and you are completely innocent and have been tolerating me all this time.

742
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,900
So now you can't stand me anymore, right?

743
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,500
Meng Meng!

744
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,480
If you don't even care,

745
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,480
why should I still keep it?

746
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,020
- Meng Meng!
- Director Su,

747
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,860
Director Li from China International Capital Corporation will be here soon.

748
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,940
Please enter.

749
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,320
Director Li,

750
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,900
I will confirm with the law firm and the accounting firm as soon as possible,

751
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,420
so that we can avoid the potential compliance risks.

752
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,940
That's very thoughtful of you.

753
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,960
By the way, are you making Zhang Bi your spokesperson for your next marketing campaign?

754
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,000
- Zhang Bi?
- Yes.

755
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,780
Hasn't Old Wang been communicating with Zhang Bi's agency lately?

756
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:21,300
- Has Zhang Bi's agency confirmed it?
- They have.

757
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,740
- Did they make any—
- Director Wang.

758
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,480
Sorry to interrupt. May I have a word, Director Wang?

759
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,380
There's something I need to confirm with you.

760
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,440
Director Su, if it is about work,

761
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,380
we can talk here.

762
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,560
Are you going to make Zhang Bi our spokesperson?

763
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,820
About that...

764
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,400
Yes, I've communicated with her agency.

765
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,071
Do you have a problem with that?

766
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,480
I don't have a problem with finding a new face,

767
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,300
but Zhang Bi is not the right fit for "What to Eat Next."

768
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,000
Look, I almost forgot.

769
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,180
Kelan,

770
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,660
since you are President Yu's girlfriend, you may be feeling uncomfortable about this.

771
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,080
But if you let your emotions get the best of you at work,

772
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,580
don't you think that'll greatly affect your judgment?

773
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,200
Director Wang,

774
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,820
our potential target customers are female.

775
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:34,320
Have you thought about Zhang Bi's acceptance rate among female customers?

776
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,120
What if they don't accept her well?

777
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,300
Wouldn't it affect our sales?

778
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,220
I hope you can give up this idea as soon as possible.

779
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:47,140
For the sake of the interests of our company, I will not approve this proposal.

780
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,000
Has the spokesperson contract reached you?

781
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,300
Leave it for now. Thanks.

782
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,420
I heard Director Wang's proposal was turned down by Su Kelan.

783
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,200
Have you heard that Director Wang wanted to make Zhang Bi our spokesperson?

784
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,440
Really?

785
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,080
That's so interesting. No wonder Kelan went to the Marketing Department just now.

786
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,640
You know what?

787
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,380
Sister Kelan told him right away that she wouldn't approve this proposal.

788
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,860
I didn't expect Sister Kelan to be this tough.

789
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,480
Who could stand that?

790
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,340
If my husband did that to me, I wouldn't stand by either.

791
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,920
If I were her, I'd report it to President Yu directly,

792
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,960
instead of confronting Director Wang myself.

793
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,420
Do you think it is President Yu's idea to let Zhang Bi be the spokesperson?

794
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,040
Hey, what nonsense are you talking about?

795
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,240
Considering our company's interests, Zhang Bi is not the right face for us.

796
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,280
I think Sister Kelan is right.

797
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,980
If she let President Yu solve this problem,

798
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,660
people would think she's not competent enough.

799
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:20,200
Even if President Yu stepped up and objected to this idea, people would still think Sister Kelan made him do it.

800
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,040
You guys are so ignorant.

801
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,080
Would you like to have lunch with me?

802
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,600
Not today, I'm concerned about Meng Meng.

803
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,640
I will go look for her and keep her company today.

804
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:03,120
President Yu, Director Su is too busy to reply in time.

805
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,320
It'll affect our working process.

806
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,340
Could you please reply to us directly?

807
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,340
Is Wang Yi giving you a hard time?

808
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,760
President Yu, IT Department is facing some problems.

809
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,620
Do you have time for a meeting?

810
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,180
Sure.

811
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,280
Where are you? Are you okay?

812
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,360
Hello? Yao Qian.

813
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,420
Hello? Sister Kelan, bad news.

814
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,160
Someone leaked the information about Zhang Bi's spokesperson contract.

815
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,200
I told you to leave me alone.

816
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:18,420
President Yu, which dress do you think is more suitable for the endorsement?

817
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,040
What if he likes both?

818
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,980
[Yuhan]

819
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,000
What? I'm busy. Stop calling me.

820
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,300
Sister, didn't you see the news?

821
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,040
Then forget about it.

822
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,460
Hello? Hello?

823
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,980
I heard Zhang Bi wanted to be the spokesperson for "What to Eat Next."

824
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,180
I don't think she's the right fit.

825
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,920
She's not classy and graceful enough.

826
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,100
Not the right fit indeed.

827
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,620
Yao Qian, I thought the proposal has been rejected. How come the news spread already?

828
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,560
It must be Director Wang who leaked the news.

829
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,640
He wanted to provoke Zhang Bi into pressuring Sister Kelan.

830
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,220
Is he stupid or what?

831
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,420
- Hello? Sister Meng.
- Yes?
- Something bad happened.

832
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,300
Director Wang,

833
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,860
are you sure it is still not the time to have the advertising company change the plan?

834
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,580
Director Su said she wouldn't approve the proposal of having Zhang Bi as our spokesperson.

835
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,240
I asked you guys to leak the news to the media.

836
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,080
Have you done it?

837
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,640
Yes.

838
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,000
If she isn't in agreement,

839
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,360
she can tell that to Zhang Bi herself and shoulder the blame.

840
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,900
Anybody on Su Kelan's side,
[Han Meng]

841
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,820
cannot be good.

842
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,600
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...

843
01:03:02,274 --> 01:03:04,172
[Han Meng]

844
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,220
Are you out of your mind?

845
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:22,000
You think the media would take your side and help you pressure Su Kelan by leaking the news?

846
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Check the news. Everybody is saying Zhang Bi is not the right fit.

847
01:03:31,922 --> 01:03:33,663
[Su Kelan]
[Conference Call]

848
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:00,380
What's the big deal?

849
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,900
It has at least got us more exposure.

850
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,480
I will be in hiding for a while.

851
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,620
And now, Su Kelan will have to approve it.

852
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,880
What's the matter with Wang Yi? Why didn't he join the conference call?

853
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,700
Yao Qian, go to the Marketing Department and find him.

854
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,380
The people in the Marketing Department claim that they are having a meeting with the advertising company.

855
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,940
I've got tons of phone calls from the media, and I didn't answer any.

856
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,420
If I keep ignoring them,

857
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,180
it'll spark controversy, and our company's reputation will be negatively impacted.

858
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:26,220
Then make a statement and tell people that it was just a rumor.

859
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,560
As for Zhang Bi's agency, let that fool deal with that mess himself.

860
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,540
Director Wang,

861
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,360
please check this message.

862
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:33,880
Director Wang,

863
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,200
you don’t normally deal with the media, so you don't understand the situation.

864
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,840
If we don't deal with this issue and clarify the facts right away,

865
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,300
this problem will escalate.

866
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,240
Our competitors will also take this opportunity to attack us,

867
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,920
and accuse "What to Eat Next" of leaking the news and lacking credibility.

868
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,020
Yao Qian,

869
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:49,500
if we clarify right now that we didn't invite Zhang Bi to be our spokesperson,

870
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,760
would they find excuses to attack our company?

871
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,320
If we act fast, it'll still be fine.

872
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,060
And after the clarification, they won't have any excuse to cause any more trouble.

873
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,360
But it will definitely hurt Zhang Bi's feelings.

874
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,560
Because many brands will think she's not classy enough.

875
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,760
If we make a statement...

876
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,580
It is totally unnecessary.

877
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,700
What's there to discuss?

878
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,440
They'd only say that it is fake news,

879
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,260
and state that I'm the one

880
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,430
who leaked the news.

881
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,420
These people...

882
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,200
They just can't wait to see me make a fool of myself.

883
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,000
Meng Meng,

884
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,240
please go talk to Director Wang and confirm the commercial plan with him.

885
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,780
Let Zhang Bi star in the commercial.

886
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,540
- You agree?
- What?

887
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,580
No.

888
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,280
Listen,

889
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,780
Yao Qian, please talk to the media,

890
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,260
Zhang Bi's agency and the Marketing Department.

891
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,860
Just say that President Yu and Zhang Bi are good friends and

892
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:47,020
President Yu wants to invite her to star in one of our commercials,

893
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,740
but somehow, it was misinformed as an endorsement instead.

894
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,180
What? Is there any problem?

895
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:54,100
No. This way,

896
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,980
the problems of both sides will be solved.

897
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,500
- But...
- Why do we have to clean up Wang Yi's mess?

898
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,780
It is all his fault.

899
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:04,020
We all work for the same company. No matter whose fault it is,

900
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,700
anything he says would represent our company.

901
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,480
If we made him the scapegoat,

902
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,780
people will think that we manage our people poorly.

903
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:12,660
Sister Kelan,

904
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,780
shall I call the media right away, or wait until after you have talked to Zhang Bi and President Yu?

905
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,140
Don't wait.

906
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,880
The one who's being criticized must be feeling very bad right now.

907
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,340
And the longer we wait, the less convincing our statement will be.

908
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,440
Do it right now.

909
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,240
All right.

910
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:36,163
[Zhang Bi]

911
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,125
Yes, Mrs. Han?

912
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:51,360
I believe that you just pity Zhang Bi because she got badly criticized.

913
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,630
At this point, why do you still care about her?

914
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,560
Is it appropriate for us,

915
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,320
to put her in the middle of our internal conflicts?

916
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,320
Then you'll just watch them shoot a commercial together?

917
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,960
Aren't you worried?

918
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,840
Mrs. Han,

919
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,800
if he's the type of man who makes me worry all the time,

920
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,680
I'd rather dump him.

921
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,160
If he doesn't make you feel worried at all,

922
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,020
either he is a really good person, or you are simply too broad-minded.

923
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,260
If you believe he's a good person,

924
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,280
then would he think that you are too broad-minded?

925
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,280
Let say

926
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,344
that he thinks you are too broad-minded,

927
01:07:23,344 --> 01:07:26,040
then would you still think that he is a good person?

928
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,900
Is this a tongue twister?

929
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,180
It is too complicated. I don't get it.

930
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,240
You are just playing dumb.

931
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,540
Since you are such an expert, how are you doing yourself?

932
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,960
I... I'm fine.

933
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,440
Where are you?

934
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,080
Send me your location. I will come over.

935
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,660
Director Jin, sorry to bother you.

936
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,520
I hope you can do me a favor.

937
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,920
In the commercial, make Zhang Bi's role that of a friend of President Yu.

938
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,240
Do not include any sign of romance.

939
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,860
Otherwise, it'll cause another scandal.

940
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,220
If it happens again,

941
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,660
we won't clean their mess anymore.

942
01:08:34,313 --> 01:08:36,685
[Fan Wenxing]

943
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:48,640
Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed can not be reached.

944
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,000
Please try again later.

945
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,640
Can't you stop bothering me?

946
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,040
Why are you calling me right now?

947
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,680
To laugh at me?

948
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,480
No.

949
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,080
I also think it is a good idea.

950
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,440
Let's do it. Goodbye.

951
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,760
I will be with Meng Meng tonight.

952
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,780
