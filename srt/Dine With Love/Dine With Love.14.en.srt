00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,240
Excessive eating caused acute gastric perforation, accompanied by septic shock.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,840
Luckily, you got him here fast enough to be treated.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,020
He's out of danger now.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,900
He will have to stay here and be put on a drip for a few days.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,960
He can't eat any food for three days.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,800
After that, he can eat a little rice porridge

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,960
and have a bland diet.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,760
Thank you, Doctor.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,600
You people either eat nothing or too much...

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,940
You shouldn't think that you can do this simply because you're young.

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,560
You should take better care of yourselves.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,740
He had a gastric ulcer the last time he broke up,

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,640
and this time, it is gastric perforation.

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,880
You really torture yourself.

[Episode 14]
[Porridge: The Best Comfort Food]

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,820
Su Kelan, what is the point of everything you've done?

18
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,390
How is it Yu Hao's fault that your mother fell ill?

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,540
- It is not his fault.
- Then why are you blaming him?

20
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,040
Do you know how much he's done for you?

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,500
He was hesitant about starting a relationship

22
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,060
because he was afraid of getting hurt if he committed wholeheartedly.

23
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,340
It is true that

24
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,100
he was living in a pit before,

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,520
but at least he was comfortable in that state.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,400
You were the one who dragged him out of there,

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,240
and finally, he gathered the courage to be with you.

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,020
And now you are kicking him back into that pit just because you're tired.

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,140
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,720
I couldn't balance my life.

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,780
What nonsense is that?

32
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,140
What's the real problem here?

33
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,240
You just want to look after your mother, right?

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,100
Do you think he'd stop you from doing that?

35
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,140
If you needed more time, then you could have taken a leave.

36
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,340
It is not like he can't work without you by his side,

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,200
and even if you didn't want to work at all, it is not like he can't support you.

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,140
What kind of problem do you have that can't be resolved?

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,980
Or is it that you don't want to solve it simply because you don't love him enough?

40
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,980
Gong Wenxing! Why are you yelling at her?

41
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,680
Kelan's hands are already full right now.

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,900
Why are you putting even more pressure on her?

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,740
- Does she have to drag everybody down with her just because her hands are full?
- Shut up.

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,940
Come on. Just ignore him.

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,090
Yu Hao is in the hospital because of gastric perforation and septic shock.

46
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
Do you know why he had gastric perforation?

47
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,300
Because in the house that he bought for you, he cooked a lot of dishes and ate them all.

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,960
Fried rice, scrambled eggs with tomatoes, instant noodles, and pork knuckle.

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,080
Do you remember all these dishes?

50
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,580
Meng Meng.

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,480
Meng Meng.

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,700
I made a mistake. I was wrong.

53
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,000
How were you wrong?

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,520
I shouldn't have confronted your best friend behind your back.

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,200
All women tend to be emotional.

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,700
There's no point in reasoning with them.

57
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,940
- Does this sound like an apology?
- Of course it does.

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,400
Because no matter what, my wife is always right.

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,700
So is there any need to reason it out?

60
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,300
Gong Wenxing,

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,220
don't always think that women cause trouble without any reason.

62
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,340
Do you still remember the time

63
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,030
when Kelan went to celebrate Yu Hao's birthday, and he stormed out?

64
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,360
But... but that was different.

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,900
You already know that it was because of Yu Hao's mother.

66
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,420
So

67
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,080
men can get emotional because of their mothers, and take it out on their women,

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,820
but when women get emotional for their mothers, they can't take it out on men.

69
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,960
Do you know how important

70
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Kelan's mother is to her?

71
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,520
Kelan was always a top student.

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,560
She wanted to go to a college outside of Chongqing.

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,480
She was very happy because she got high marks on the college entrance exam.

74
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,380
We had decided to go on an overseas trip to celebrate.

75
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,000
Since both our families were strict

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,420
we wanted to indulge ourselves for once.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,280
So we turned off our phones.

78
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,260
But when we landed

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,220
and turned our phones on...

80
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,780
Don't turn on your phone.

81
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,440
We still have two more hours of freedom.

82
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,840
You know my mom.

83
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,420
She will beat me up if she can't reach me.

84
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,780
See? They've already sent messages.

85
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,887
[Tell Kelan to call back immediately!]

86
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,800
Dad, Mom.

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,500
Kelan, your parents were in a car accident.

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,090
Your mom was saved, but your dad...

89
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,030
Kelan, you will have to be strong for your mom.

90
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,160
Kelan.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,340
Sorry for your loss. Take care of yourself.

92
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,620
This time, she was in Shanghai.

93
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,100
When she landed,

94
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,000
and found out that her mother was in urgent care,

95
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,520
it probably brought her back to the summer when she was 18.

96
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,250
Kelan,

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,770
I've never told you,

98
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,180
but every time I see this photo of your first day at college,

99
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,600
I can't help but feel sad.

100
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,420
I remember

101
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,940
that you dreamt of becoming a lawyer ever since you were little,

102
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,680
and your dream college was Peking University.

103
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,260
Your exam results

104
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,640
were good enough for you to attend your dream college,

105
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,740
but you chose to stay

106
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,960
for my sake.

107
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,180
You always say

108
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,400
that you don't think taking care of your family is a sacrifice,

109
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,420
but I still feel bad about it.

110
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,260
Because of me, you couldn't fulfill your childhood dream.

111
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,540
After graduation,

112
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,080
you got an offer from a famous law firm,

113
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
but since you didn't want to work overtime,

114
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,740
you ended up choosing a job that's close to home and didn't require you to work overtime.

115
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,820
But I had once overheard your conversation with Meng Meng.

116
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,000
Since you never worked overtime,

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,100
your coworkers used to criticize you.

118
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,740
But no matter how difficult things were at work,

119
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,680
you never complained in front of me.

120
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,200
Luckily,

121
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,980
you've met someone you love at work, and he also cherishes you.

122
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,980
Seeing you have your own life now,

123
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,380
makes me very happy.

124
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,160
Kelan,

125
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,420
I want to tell you

126
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,040
that it is normal for older people to get sick or die.

127
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,920
A day will come

128
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,860
when I will leave you.

129
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,680
I don't have much time left,

130
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,800
but you still have a long life in front of you.

131
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,600
I hope that for the rest of your life,

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,020
you can stop worrying, and making sacrifices.

133
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,800
Find your own happiness,

134
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,160
spend your life with the one you love,

135
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,040
and go anywhere and do whatever you want.

136
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,540
Mom.

137
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,320
I'm fine.

138
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,560
You don't have to stay here all the time.

139
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,720
Why did you take it off?

140
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,720
I don't need it anymore.

141
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,400
When did it happen?

142
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,320
A few days ago.

143
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,460
Was it because of me?

144
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,820
Mom, please don't think like that. It wasn't because of you.

145
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,740
Mom, you...

146
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,780
Put it on.

147
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,860
Mom.

148
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,540
How come I can't put it on?

149
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,300
Mom.

150
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,230
Mom. It is broken.

151
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,500
It can't be worn anymore.

152
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,740
Mom.

153
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,480
What is it?

154
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,560
Are you feeling unwell?

155
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,500
I will go get the doctor.

156
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,120
I've caused trouble

157
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,100
for you again.

158
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,140
Mom, what are you talking about?

159
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,720
You didn't cause any trouble.

160
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,940
Daughters in other families

161
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,850
are protected by their parents.

162
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,050
I have such an outstanding daughter,

163
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,890
yet she

164
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,500
has given up so much because of me.

165
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,820
And now,

166
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,820
when you'd finally started your own life,

167
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,500
and found someone

168
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,930
who loved and cherished you...

169
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,270
I'm so sorry, my daughter.

170
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,160
Mom, stop saying that.

171
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,980
Nothing makes me happier than knowing

172
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,980
that you are happy.

173
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,440
I also think that Kelan made a reckless decision.

174
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,800
But if

175
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,620
someone truly loved and cherished her,

176
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,360
they should understand what she's currently going through.

177
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,060
Give her some time.

178
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,760
Wait until she feels better and everything gets back to normal.

179
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,080
But what about you?

180
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,980
- All right.
- Thank you.

181
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,980
Bi Bi, I'm surprised to see you this calm.

182
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,420
Yu Hao broke up with Kelan and was admitted to the hospital.

183
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
Why didn't you visit him?

184
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,990
Huh?

185
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,160
When did that happen?

186
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,720
Didn't you know Yu Hao is in the hospital?

187
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,600
Sister, everybody in his company knows, and the fans have been talking about it as well.

188
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,360
- Did you have no idea?
- Why didn't you tell me?

189
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,500
I thought you'd be the first to know, and that you'd have gone to visit him right away.

190
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,620
Yes. I thought you wouldn't come to shoot the program today.

191
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,480
I shouldn't have told you about this.

192
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,290
What if you are no longer in the mood for shooting the program?

193
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,060
This is strange.

194
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,380
They broke up,

195
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,380
but it doesn't make me happy.

196
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,320
Yu Hao is in the hospital.

197
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,380
Yes. He has acute gastric perforation.

198
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,640
Maybe he was upset about the breakup and ate excessively.

199
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,460
But he should be fine now.

200
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,880
It has been a few days.

201
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,120
He should be released soon.

202
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,400
Yu Hao is in the hospital,

203
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,820
so why am I not feeling worried?

204
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,100
Is something wrong with my head?

205
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,430
Or with my heart?

206
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,680
This is a program about food.

207
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,880
About food, okay?

208
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,960
Buy the ingredients in the morning,

209
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,140
not the day before.

210
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,880
As for photography,

211
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,040
communicate based on what I just told you, and ask Le Le to keep an eye on it.

212
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,820
And you should pay attention to it as well.

213
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,080
Got it?

214
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,580
Go ahead.

215
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,060
What are you standing there for?

216
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,380
Go get your makeup done.

217
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,150
We will start soon.

218
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,580
Okay.

219
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,680
Su Kelan and Yu Hao broke up,

220
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,700
then Jin Xuan...

221
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,220
I just felt bad right now.

222
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,420
What's going on?

223
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,400
- What are you mumbling there?
- Huh?

224
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,240
Director, check out my pose. Do I look good?

225
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,180
Oh, no. I just felt bad right now.

226
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,880
Keep an eye on Yu Hao.

227
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,260
Don't let Shen Zhilin take advantage of this chance.

228
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,800
Why are you criticizing her all of a sudden?

229
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,220
That day when Kelan's mother was critically ill and

230
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,960
Yu Hao ran off to work with Shen Zhilin.

231
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,080
He claimed that he didn't want Kelan to take the blame if the investment fell apart.

232
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,110
But guess how that investment actually fell apart?

233
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,140
How?

234
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,080
An Jie just sent me a message.

235
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,680
It was because Shen Zhilin had called the Chairman of Chuang Ying.

236
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,780
How scheming was that?

237
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,420
Why aren't you saying anything?

238
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,600
Didn't you hear me?

239
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,280
It is not that.

240
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,520
I didn't quite understand Shen Zhilin before.

241
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,820
But when you told me about Su Kelan's story,

242
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,960
It seems like now I can suddenly understand Shen Zhilin.

243
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,600
What?

244
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,180
How is he doing?

245
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,240
Don't worry.

246
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,140
He will only be depressed for a few days because of the breakup.

247
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,340
He is someone who can use work to work through his emotions.

248
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,680
He's already started to ask An Jie to report back now.

249
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,160
Kelan,

250
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,640
soon your mom will get better,

251
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,410
and your life will also get back to normal.

252
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,940
Thanks.

253
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:38,020
Do you think that I'm really annoying, that I baffle you?

254
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,100
Since I was the one who broke up with him,

255
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,680
why have I come back into his life now?

256
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,260
Back then, he wanted to come home and start his own business.

257
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,380
He had asked me to come back with him,

258
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,340
but at that time I didn't want to.

259
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,640
In response, he said that he had changed his mind,

260
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,140
and he'd stay in the U.S. with me.

261
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,200
But I refused again,

262
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,870
so we broke up.

263
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,660
You don't understand why I did that, do you?

264
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,660
Before my mother gave birth to me

265
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,140
she had a successful career,

266
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,970
and was very close to my father.

267
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,920
But after I was born,

268
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,220
in order to take care of me and our family,

269
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,640
my mom became a housewife.

270
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,480
Later on, my father's business kept expanding.

271
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,940
His career started booming, and he was making more and more money.

272
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,300
That was when he told my mom

273
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,980
that they didn't have anything in common,

274
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,760
and that my mom wasn't at the same level as him.

275
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,600
So they got divorced.

276
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,380
You see,

277
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,670
no matter in life or at work,

278
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,320
if two people can't keep up with each other, there'd be no way for them to stay together.

279
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,320
I couldn't give up my career for Yu Hao,

280
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,120
and I was also afraid that he'd blame me if he missed

281
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,520
the chance of starting his own company.

282
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,550
I had hoped that we could give each other some time

283
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,680
to calm down and think.

284
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,480
I heard that

285
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,940
you were the one who broke up with him.

286
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,820
I think you do love him,

287
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,020
but you are afraid that you're incompatible

288
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,520
and eventually, you might end up blaming each other.

289
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,820
Love is a luxury.

290
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,920
You won't be able to guard it well

291
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,480
unless you are fully prepared.

292
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,760
Otherwise, it'd be worn off

293
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,440
little by little by the trivial things in life,

294
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,560
until even the last bit of glow is gone completely.

295
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,360
To me,

296
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,960
my career is the main factor.

297
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,960
To you,

298
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,900
it is your family.

299
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,060
And to Yu Hao,

300
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,180
it is his personality.

301
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,880
For all those things,

302
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,800
we'd even give up on our love.

303
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,880
So you mean

304
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,800
you came back this time

305
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,420
because you're determined not to give up on love?

306
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,240
When Yu Hao and I were in the United States,

307
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,480
a stray cat always followed him around.

308
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,860
Yu Hao named it Tomato.

309
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,460
I knew he's a cat person,

310
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,880
but I also knew

311
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,580
he had bad memories of raising his first cat in his childhood.

312
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,300
So I told him

313
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,660
not to adopt it

314
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,640
until he's fully ready for it.

315
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,140
And later, when Yu Hao came back home,

316
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,880
I'd still go and check on Tomato every now and then.

317
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,820
Actually, I'm not a cat person.

318
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,000
Tomato.

319
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,300
But I realized that I was truly happy every time

320
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,580
I was with Tomato.

321
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,360
So I thought

322
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,740
that one day, when I was ready

323
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,620
I'll bring Tomato home

324
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,840
and tell Yu Hao that

325
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,080
we can raise a cat together.

326
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,480
Two months ago,

327
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,500
I got another promotion.

328
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,540
But when I was ready to bring Tomato home,

329
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,380
I couldn't find it anymore.

330
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,380
That's why I decided to come back.

331
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,700
I'm sorry.

332
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,900
I ended up telling you all these things.

333
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,260
Shen Zhilin.

334
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,280
Tell him to eat regularly

335
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,260
and not to hurt his stomach again.

336
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,880
Yun Teng's contract is ready now.

337
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,060
About the modification...

338
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,560
You didn't eat anything the last couple of days. You must be starving.

339
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,380
Have some congee first.

340
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,440
Go on.

341
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,520
President Yu, maybe you should eat something first.

342
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,960
An Jie,

343
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
please get some congee for me.

344
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,520
Bring it to him.

345
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,340
Tell him you bought it.

346
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,410
Director Shen,

347
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,460
President Yu is eating now.

348
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,920
- Good.
- Then I'm leaving.

349
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,440
What?

350
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,700
Are you not going back to the United States?

351
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,060
You've been cold to me ever since you woke up.

352
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,020
You went into shock because of gastric perforation. Do you know you could have died?

353
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,220
Luckily, I found you.

354
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,660
And for that, I should be considered as your savior.

355
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,820
And this is how you treat me?

356
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,300
The reason why you called Chairman Wu of Chuang Ying

357
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,760
and told him I'd talk to them is

358
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,820
because you wanted to raise the price and then go to Frank.

359
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,620
I'm not planning to go back to the United States.

360
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,260
Last time I came back

361
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,440
with Yang Zhen,

362
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,200
and told you I was on a vacation.

363
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,600
But actually, I came back for a reason.

364
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,380
Do you still remember I told you in the car that I'd go to Shanghai?

365
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,100
I was going to Shanghai because I had an interview with a Hedge Fund.

366
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,000
I've decided to come back.

367
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Five years ago,

368
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,500
I wanted both of us to calm down

369
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,600
because I didn't have the confidence.

370
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,900
I wasn't confident enough to give up on my career for you,

371
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,640
and I wasn't confident enough to ask you to do that for me.

372
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,400
I was afraid that we'd end up like my parents.

373
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,420
In the past five years,

374
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,860
I've been working very hard,

375
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,400
because I wanted to be confident enough

376
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
to stand by your side

377
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,880
no matter where we were.

378
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,020
I don't know whether I've gained such confidence or not,

379
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,960
but if I keep waiting,

380
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,300
I may miss you forever.

381
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
That's why I came back.

382
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,360
I've been waiting for five years.

383
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,340
I don't mind keeping on waiting.

384
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,960
Sister.

385
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,640
Sister. What are you doing? Let's go.

386
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,160
It is a wrap.

387
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,420
Where's Director Jin?

388
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,360
I want to check the playback, and see if I looked good today.

389
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,660
Director Jin has left for the hospital.

390
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,700
Bi Bi, are you going to the hospital later to check on Yu Hao?

391
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,280
I...

392
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,940
I...

393
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,060
Auntie, have some water.

394
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,280
Thank you, Xiao Jin.

395
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,880
You are welcome.

396
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,260
You've come here and visited me for days.

397
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,680
Would it affect your work?

398
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,100
Not at all. If I didn't come to see you,

399
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,080
I'd feel worried.

400
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,560
How are the kids doing?

401
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,320
They are all fine.

402
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,960
Don't worry. Just rest well and get better.

403
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,160
Are you sure it wouldn't affect your work?

404
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,960
I'm sure. I come to the hospital once a week anyway.

405
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm here to visit Auntie.

406
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Director Jin, you are also here. What a coincidence!

407
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,380
Would you like to have dinner with me?

408
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,156
But we may get caught by the fans if we eat out.

409
00:30:52,156 --> 00:30:54,560
Why don't you come to my place?

410
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,620
No.

411
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,540
It is too obvious.

412
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,100
I fell in love with another man so quickly.

413
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,720
People may think I'm a playgirl.

414
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
What a coincidence!

415
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,020
Aren't you here to visit a patient?

416
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,940
Yu Hao's on the fifth floor.

417
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,570
I'm not here to see him.

418
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,260
So are you here to see my mom?

419
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,120
Then go on in.

420
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,760
If you don't, Director Jin may leave.

421
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,780
Would he leave so soon?

422
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,120
If you've heard it all, then why are you pretending?

423
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,020
I...

424
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,160
I was just practicing my lines.

425
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,400
Even if you didn't say anything,

426
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,060
it was already quite obvious

427
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,520
since instead of checking on Yu Hao,

428
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,860
you were wandering outside my mom's ward, and staring at Director Jin.

429
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,880
Oh, no!

430
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,360
I...

431
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,100
I did fall in love with someone else.

432
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,640
So what?

433
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,100
Is it really that obvious?

434
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,860
Could you still notice, even if I didn't say anything?

435
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,650
It is written all over your face.

436
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,100
If it is so obvious that you could notice,

437
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,780
then it must've been very clear to the crew as well.

438
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,360
Then how come he couldn't notice?

439
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,820
Since when did you start having feelings for him?

440
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,160
I...

441
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,360
I...

442
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,960
I'm not sure.

443
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,940
The more time I spent with him,

444
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,420
the less I cared about you and Yu Hao.

445
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,060
And little by little,

446
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,360
all I could think about was the happy times I had with him.

447
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,290
Then why don't you tell him directly?

448
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,060
He doesn't like me.

449
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,190
He says that I'm silly.

450
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,900
Since when did you start to worry so much?

451
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,420
What do you mean?

452
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,240
Do you also think that I'm silly?

453
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,920
Su Kelan, you know what?

454
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,900
I've thought it through.

455
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,960
Since I've fallen in love with someone else,

456
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,600
then I will try my best to make it work this time.

457
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,320
I need to make a good plan.

458
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,860
I can't spook him.

459
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,040
Since you are so great at this,

460
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,480
could you teach me how to go after him?

461
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,340
After all, I'm one of the people who saved your mother.

462
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,800
You should repay me, right?

463
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,900
What can I teach you?

464
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,980
Or do you want Jin Xuan to be your backup since you broke up with Yu Hao?

465
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,920
No. Of course not.

466
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,740
How can I steal a guy away from the girl who saved my mother?

467
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,870
Really?

468
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,740
Yes.

469
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,080
Definitely.

470
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,640
Tell me, what do you want me to do to help you out?

471
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,460
Teach me how to cook Jin Xuan's favorite dishes.

472
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,140
How would I know what Jin Xuan likes to eat?

473
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,560
He likes everything you cook.

474
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,860
Just teach me the dishes you're an expert at making.

475
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,260
All right.

476
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,250
Come on. Let's go inside.

477
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,640
Let's go.

478
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,360
Where do you want to go after you've recovered?

479
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,800
To the Tianxing Temple.

480
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,020
The Tianxing Temple?

481
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,940
Who do you want to see there?

482
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:08,360
♫  Your long hair is softly scattered as you're curled up lazily on the sofa  ♫

483
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:15,747

I want some meat.

498
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,120
You can't.

499
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,440
You have to wait until you are recovered.

500
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,720
That's right.

501
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,780
Try this. I cooked it.

502
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
I did.

503
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,520
Did you cook this? It tastes like Kelan's food.

504
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,120
You're lying.

505
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,260
Just tell me if it tastes good.

506
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,220
- Of course, it tastes good since Kelan cooked it.
- You...

507
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,140
- It is good. Whatever you guys make is good.
- Yes.

508
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,580
That's all I wanted to know.

509
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,040
Have some more.

510
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,000
Auntie, eat more.

511
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,980
President Yu, I bought some congee for you.

512
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,010
- It is from the same restaurant.

When you come for your next check-up, we'll discuss a plan for treating your thrombosis.

519

- Kelan!
- Hey.

525
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,360
Something came up, so I couldn't go with you to pick up Auntie.

526
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,680
- It is okay.
- How's your mother?

527
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,960
She's asleep. She sleeps better at home.

528
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,600
This is finally over.

529
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,240

- Yes.

530
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,820
Why are you drinking so much?

531
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,640
Drink with me.

532
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,880
I'm pregnant.

533
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,260
You are?

534
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,500
Seriously?

535
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,930
I'm really pregnant.

536
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,020
Come on, have some more.

537
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,320
Listen, you can starve yourself, just don't starve my baby.

538
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,180
All right. I hear you.

539
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,020
You'd better reserve the godmother post for me.

540
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,440
Who else can it be?

541
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,200
I didn't get a chance to tell you earlier.

542
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,020
- Have some more.
- Okay. You, too.

543
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,380
Did you and Gong Wenxing get a new marriage license?

544
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,260
Not yet. Because he's been arguing so much with me lately.

545
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,600
Now I've got a "hostage."

546
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,380
I will let him propose a few more times.

547
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,760
That makes sense.

548
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,680
Here. Eat.

549
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,020
So have you two really broken up?

550
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,580
Since your mother has recovered already, is it really necessary?

551
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,440
Slow down.

552
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,380
Have some dishes.

553
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,050
I will drink it, then.

554
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,120
Stop.

555
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,540
Hello?

556
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,160
President Yu. The real estate agency has listed the house online..

557
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,540
Send someone to pack everything.

558
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,340
Give the combination to the agency.

559
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,880
Once it has been packed, where should we send it?

560
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,850
Throw it away.

561
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,380
Careful, sir.

562
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,920
President Yu.

563
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,500
Thank you, everybody.

564
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,200
Let's call it a day.

565
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,030

Stop it. Stop drinking.

581
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,980
I've never seen you drink this much.

582
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,632
Kelan, I'm a pregnant woman.

583
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,900
Did Meng Meng bring me back?

584
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:05,050
[BBQ Three Sisters] [Han Meng invited Zhang Bi to the group]

585
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,040

586
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,440
Come on.

587
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,280
Tell me what happened last night.

588
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,640
[Kiss! Kiss!]

589
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,800
Stop it. Stop drinking.

590
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,140
I've never seen you drink this much.

591
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,180
- Boss, four bottles of beer, please.
- Kelan, easy.

592
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,860
Careful.

593
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,280
Kelan?

594
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,260
My master!

595
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,940
Master?

596
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,740
It is really her.

597
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,200
Master?

598
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,800
She's teaching me how to pursue Jin Xuan.

599
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,860
What?

600
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,380
You-You...

601
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,524
You...

602
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:50,740
are going after Jin Xuan?

603
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,140
Aren't you in love with Yu Hao?

604
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,420
I don't love him anymore. Don't make a fuss about it.

605
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,020
Just like Yu Hao, you can't hold your alcohol either.

606
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,160
What's going on?

607
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,140
Kelan!

608
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,040
- What's wrong?
- I...

609
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,200
Sister, where are you going?

610
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,920
Wait! Slow down!

611
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,020
Sister! Hey Sister!

612
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,060
You haven't paid yet!

613
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,540
Kelan. Slow down.

614
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,856
It is good to do something wild after drinking.

615
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,280
- It is getting late.
- You are pregnant, You should go home and rest.

616
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,220
- Kelan.
- Meng Meng.

617
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,200
It is the wrong place. I shouldn't have come here.

618
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,160
- I want to go home.
- No. Wait.

619
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,080
This is the right place. This is your home.

620
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,980
It is not my home. We broke up.

621
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,520
No, you didn't.

622
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,780
It was just a dream.

623
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,140
A dream.

624
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,520
This is your home. Go ahead.

625
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,300
Come on.

626
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,840
Go.

627
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,190
It is a good deed to bring a couple back together.

628
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,230
Let's go.

629
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,640
Mom, I will be back later.

630
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,120
Why didn't you stop me?

631
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,560
I'm a pregnant woman.

632
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,320
I don't have the same strength as you do.

633
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,080
You wanted to go to Yu Hao's, I was just giving you a hand.

634
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,040
What did you say when you got in? And what did he say to you?

635
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,800
Come on.

636
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,520
How does it feel to get back together with him?

637
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,060
If you get back together with him, Jin Xuan will give up.

638
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,700
That's right.

639
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,280
What's the matter?

640
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,110
I don't remember anything.

641
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,370
Do you have amnesia?

642
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,140
Even if you have amnesia,

643
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,040
he would have said something to you this morning, right?

644
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,540
Yes.

645
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,640
When I woke up this morning,

646
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,820
I was in my own bed.

647
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,300
Hold on. Didn't you spend the night at his place?

648
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,900
I don't remember what I said to him.

649
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,710
But I do remember

650
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,320
that he drove me home.

651
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,740
We sent you right to his door, yet he drove you back home.

652
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,280
My goodness.

653
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,280
I will go to the office later.

654
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,420
I think Yu Hao would be getting back to work today.

655
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,420
Would you like to go?

656
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,570
I submitted my resignation

657
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,940
a few days ago.

658
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,080
What?

659
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,200
Why?

660
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,200
- Your mom has already been released from the hospital.
- That's right.

661
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,140
But

662
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,720
my mom is still suffering from congestive heart failure.

663
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,480
She will have surgery in a few days.

664
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,900
I don't think I can just leave her alone.

665
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,180
Is the surgery a must?

666
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,330
Can't they treat it conservatively?

667
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,910
Doctor Wang suggested surgery.

668
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,000
My mom is also suffering from renal failure.

669
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,020
Dialysis is not a permanent solution.

670
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,560
We've been waiting for a kidney for years. It should be our turn soon.

671
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,700
If we really get one, and my mom can't do anything about it because of her heart problem,

672
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,900
it'd be such a pity.

673
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,440
Why don't you take a long leave?

674
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,640
I want to take care of my mom until she's fully recovered.

675
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,130
And I don't know how long that'd take.

676
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:44,605
[From Yu Hao. Reply to resignation]

677
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,040
He's approved

678
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,000
my resignation.

679
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,120
Then

680
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,120
do you want to go to the office with me and pack your stuff?

681
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,520
I will pass.

682
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,460
You can help me do it.

683
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,360
You are going back to work already?

684
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,000
Why don't you rest for a few more days?

685
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,480
Then won't you say that I neglect my work for personal issues?

686
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,060
But you've just been released from the hospital.

687
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,060
Being sick is also a personal issue, isn't it?

688
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,580
I won't argue with you, just take good care of yourself.

689
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,700
I only want the best for you.

690
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,880
What's going on?

691
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,920
I heard that Su Kelan went to your place last night

692
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,680
yet you drove her back home?

693
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,580
What were you thinking?

694
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,820
Wanshun, were you waiting for me here?

695
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,140
What's up?

696
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:35,880
Yes.

697
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,980
President Yu, for the upcoming meeting of the marketing department, will you...

698
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,190
Okay, I will be there.

699
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,860
An Jie,

700
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,160
do you think, it is okay to keep a cat in the office?

701
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:54,620
It is okay if you say so.

702
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,020
He should find a new person in charge of IPO.

703
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,050
Yes. We still have a chance.

704
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,820
I will negotiate again soon.

705
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,140
Hello?

706
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,590
Are you free this weekend?

707
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,930
What?

708
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,460
You wanted to visit Diaoyu Fortress, didn't you?

709
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,440
If you are free this weekend, we can go together.

710
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,520
Okay.

711
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,640
Yu Hao,

712
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,360
love is a luxury.

713
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,640
When you're not prepared for it, a lot of things can make it go awry.

714
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,800
For you, it is your personality,

715
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,600
and for me, it is my career.

716
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,260
I don't want our love to suffer because of these things.

717
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,420
I hope we can both calm down,

718
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,360
and sort out our lives.

719
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,820
Why have you always wanted to visit Diaoyu Fortress?

720
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,740
In the Southern Song dynasty,

721
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,600
the battle for the defense of Diaoyu Fortress lasted for 36 years,

722
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,100
which means being persistent is not pointless.

723
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,600
I've read your proposal. I have no problem with it.

724
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,540
When can we sign it?

725
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,660
What?

726
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,160
Do you think there's a problem?

727
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,260
No.

728
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,580
Why are you so happy and smiling?

729
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,430
Of course, I'm happy when there's progress in work.

730
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,300
And what makes me even happier

731
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,720
is that you finally started to care about my feelings.

732
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,180
Coming to Diaoyu Fortress has always been a wish of yours.

733
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,320
So was making progress at work.

734
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,240
I hope your wishes can be fulfilled.

735
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,900
Actually, I have another wish.

736
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,140
I can't fulfill all your wishes, though.

737
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,660
I came here with you

738
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,980
because I wanted to apologize to you.

739
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,180
Back then,

740
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,500
because of our different views about careers and love,

741
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,040
you said we should separate and take a break.

742
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,840
At the time, I was very angry.

743
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,000
I was thinking

744
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,460
that I had clearly tried so hard, put in a lot of effort.

745
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:03,000
So why couldn't you just believe in me?

746
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,160
So I deleted all your contact information

747
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,060
and blocked out everything related to you.

748
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,940
That was the only way

749
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,700
I could calm myself down.

750
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,540
But I never thought

751
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,620
about why you were so hesitant at that point.

752
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,440
And I didn't think

753
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,920
about you and how much you were suffering.

754
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,080
- Since you understand now...
- After we've missed our chance, we can't go back.

755
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,360
I've waited for you for five years. And I don't mind continuing to wait for you.

756
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,360
I remember

757
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,800
you once told me

758
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,480
that love was a luxury,

759
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,730
You wanted more time to improve yourself.

760
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,520
But when you chose to improve yourself,

761
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,680
you also chose to walk away from love.

762
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,080
But I didn't know how to wait

763
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,240
so I lost you.

764
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,580
And now,

765
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,220
I don't want to make the same mistake with her.

Yes.

771
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,260
Are you hungry?

772
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,560
You probably haven't had dinner yet.

773
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,720
You're so busy. I will cook something nice for you.

774
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,560
You're so busy with work, you surely wouldn't have eaten anything.

What are you doing here anyway?

779
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
I've missed you.

780
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,160
Missed you so much.

781
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,100
I've really missed you.

782
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,190
When I was in the hospital, you were the one who sent me the congee, right?

783
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,080
How did you know?

784
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,130
I missed you.

785
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,980
If you miss me, why did you break up with me?

786
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:07,340
If you miss me, why did you go through all the trouble to have Shen Zhilin and An Jie give me the congee?

787
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,000
If you miss me, why didn't you contact me?

788
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:23,940
If you miss me, why can't you look me in the eyes?

789
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,540
I'm not lying.

790
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,500
I really missed you a lot.

791
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,860
But,

792
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,200
whenever I think of you,

793
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,000
I also think about

794
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,600
what my mom looked like when she was sick and hospitalized.

795
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,180
As soon as I see you,

796
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,300
it is as if I see

797
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,180
that critically ill notice again.

798
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,960
I really don't know what to do.

799
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,400

800
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,080
I... I really don't know.

801
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,400
I used to think I was the victim in our relationship.

802
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,150
But actually,

803
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,640
I'm the one who owes you an apology.

804
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,380
For my lack of understanding back then,

805
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,720
I sincerely apologize to you.

806
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,680
You know that what I want isn't an apology.

807
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:10,120
Back then, we had such a lovely time.

808
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,700
I was muddle-headed and ignorant in high school.

809
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,600
You were the one who dragged me out of that state.

810
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,660
If it weren't for you,

811
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,720
I wouldn't have become who I am now.

812
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,580
So

813
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,920
I also hope that you can get over the past

814
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,300
and start to pursue the things that matter to you.

815
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,440
In fact, I've had this feeling for a long time,

816
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,520
that we couldn't go back again.

817
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,320
Back then, when I had to choose between love and a career,

818
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,660
I chose my career.

819
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,080
I thought that only when I had a successful career

820
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,380
would I have the right to have a relationship.

821
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,980
Giving up on love was the choice I made at the time,

822
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,920
and I didn't even hesitate when I made that choice.

823
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,080
So now that I've got that successful career,

824
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,960
how would it be fair if I so casually try to get it back?

825
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,640
Actually, to me, coming back this time

826
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,160
feels like taking an exam you're not ready for.

827
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,640
I know it was stupid.

828
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,460
But I still hoped that I would be lucky

829
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,600
and maybe win you back.

Tomato.

01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,732
Tomato is gone.

I want to come back home.

836
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:25,220
You can't keep it unless you are fully prepared for it.

837
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,980
Fully prepared?

838
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:31,060
So what's considered 'fully prepared?'

839
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,360
Tomato, let's go home.

Tell me, exactly what is Han Meng thinking?

841
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,240
Why won't she stop dragging it out and agree to marry me again?

842
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,760
Actually, love is a luxury.

843
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,330
What?

844
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,040
There are a lot of things that make love go awry,

845
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,120
and your problem is that you're too carefree.

846
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,920
I'd guess that Han Meng is worried that you aren't ready to raise a baby.

847
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,500
You can only live your life one step after another, right?

848
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,400
Of course, you can live your life that way,

849
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,940
but when it is two people's lives...

850
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,980
you have to match your partner's steps.

Nephew, are you going to become a monk because of the breakup?

852
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,200
I should think about it.

853
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,060
I saw Shen Zhilin's "Moments" a couple of days ago,

854
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,800
and I noticed that she took off the tomato bracelet.

855
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,060
Now that you two have ended your relationship on good terms,

what are you going to do next?

Love is a luxury.

858
