00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:02,010
Her current record is nine bottles.

177
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,200
Look at the director, he looks like a bandit.

178
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,180
He wanted to speak with Su Kelan,

179
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,800
but up until now, he hasn't uttered a single word.

180
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,340
One step forward, two steps back.

181
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,060
He may be drinking one bottle right now, but his current score is twelve bottles.

182
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,010
Is it?

183
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,560
Your best friend is the ultimate winner today

184
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
so why is she drowning in her sorrow?

185
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,720
Then you should ask your nephew.

186
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,740
Where is he?

187
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,050
My nephew...

188
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,180
Yu...

189
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,679
President Yu, where have you been?

190
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,690
Shouldn't you take this drink?

191
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,380
What's going on?

192
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,660
What's the matter? This is...

193
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,280
The time is up for this room.

194
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,100
I have a suggestion.

195
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,040
Cheers!

196
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,900
I've never scored higher than 20 on math tests.

197
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,379
You have to drink.

198
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,450
- Are you stupid?
- Stupid!

199
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,840
This actress is trying to get President Yu drunk.

200
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,760
That must be her intention.

201
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,220
President Yu, that's mine.

202
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,100
It's my turn. I'm single.

203
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,370
No love interests.

204
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,380
None of them?

205
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,320
It's just the two of us.

206
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,849
Take back your hands. Let's drink.

207
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,170
Director, you must be confused.

208
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,050
We're all single and have no love interests. Why are we attacking each other?

209
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,370
I've been single since birth with no love interest. Can you compete with me?

210
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,260
Single.

211
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,449
Director, you need a stylist to fix your style.

212
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,880
What kind of girl would be interested in you?

213
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,920
Isn't it? Isn't it?

214
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,909
Why are you staring at me? Are you trying to intimidate me?

215
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:27,800
What's wrong with you?

216
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,960
This person,

217
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,100
how can his temper be better than mine? He is annoying and fussy.

218
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,759
Can you ladies try not to stare at him like hungry wolves?

219
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,280
It depends on the look and style.

220
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,060
Just like his uncle!

221
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,660
- Just like me.
- Come on! Come on!

222
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:48,659
Director! Director!

223
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:51,250
Come on!

224
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,289
This is his true nature, Genji Takiya.
(T/N: The main character from the Japanese manga Crows Zero)

225
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,660
So many titles?

226
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,180
- He is very handsome.
- He also dominated Suzuran All-Boys High School.
(T/N: The high school from the Japanese manga Crows Zero)

227
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,040
Perhaps you watched too many movies.

228
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,680
Do you think you are a martial arts master?

229
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,880
How do you want to compete? Lying down or crawling?

230
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,900
Director! Just let it go.

231
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,620
Just sit here and continue playing.

232
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,650
Yes.

233
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,880
Sure.

234
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,730
That's my spot. Get up.

235
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,031
You won't get up?

236
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:34,700
I won't get up.

237
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,770
I said, I won't get up.

238
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,170
Kelan told me to.

239
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,580
So I'll sit here… It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

240
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,281
Come on, come on. Let's drink.

241
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:50,240
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

242
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,440
- President Yu, let's drink.
- Go on, go on.

243
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,539
Cheers, cheers.

244
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,880
Bottoms up. Cheers.

245
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,610
- Carry on.
- It's my turn.

246
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,200
I have Han Meng.

247
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:11,569
What do you mean by that?

248
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,490
Sister Bi, are you all right?

249
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,060
I'm fine.

250
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,450
In a bit, I'll ask them to go to their rooms to rest.

251
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,830
At that time, you'll have to distract those two employees of President Yu.

252
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,050
That's right, have you notified the reporters?

253
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,270
I did.

254
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,190
Lipstick, lipstick.

255
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,670
Go on, go on.

256
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,340
- Sister
- I'm busy right now.

257
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,430
Perfect. Let's go.

258
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,890
Let's go.

259
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,940
I'm back! Where is everybody?

260
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,970
- Where is everyone?
- They all left a long time ago. They wanted to say their goodbyes,

261
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,169
but you were in the bathroom for ages.

262
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,470
Why didn't you tell me?

263
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,590
Let's go.

264
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,850
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, we're heading out.
- Bye, bye.

265
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,270
- Take care!
- Goodbye.

266
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,030
Bye. Be careful on the road.

267
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,709
What's wrong with you?

268
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:29,669
- What's wrong with me?
- You're so lucky when it comes to love interests.

269
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,310
When The Great Devil came back, we all were playing and drinking together.

270
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,889
Clearly, he was concerned because of that Director who looks like a bandit.

271
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:35,689
Look at the fight that broke out because that director spat out the truth after getting drunk.

272
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,650
He didn't even allow him to sit next to you.

273
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,069
- When did you tame The Great Devil?
- What do you mean?

274
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:44,351
All... All...

275
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,889
They're all gone. This way, this way.

276
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:47,990
President Yu, are you okay?

277
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,790
He's not good with drinks. He'll get better after throwing up.

278
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,969
Who said that I can't drink well? I can drink very well.

279
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:55,589
Does your nephew always act like this after a few drinks?

280
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:58,049
Not really.

281
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,329
Perhaps we should take him home. Where does he live?

282
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:04,849
I'm not going home.

283
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:06,649
Mom and Dad aren't there, either. I don't want to go.

284
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:08,650
We're not going. We're not going.

285
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,290
How about this, Kelan,

286
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,130
can you take him to his room? My stomach is not feeling well either.

287
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,210
I'll go and bring some medicine.

288
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,889
This room is free. It will be such a waste if we don't use it.

289
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,670
I'm not feeling too good, either. Let's go together.

290
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,749
Let's go together.

291
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,430
Meng Meng!

292
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,630
President Yu.

293
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,510
Wait a minute. President Yu.

294
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,850
Wait a minute. Let me have a look.

295
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,560
This way! This way!

296
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,770
- President Yu, wait a minute.
- Keep drinking.

297
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,280
Slow down.

298
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,889
Hi, Mom, I'm busy with something. I'll be home a little late.

299
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:50,830
Don't stay up for me. Go to bed.

300
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,320
Bye-bye.

301
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,690
Kelan told me to.

302
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,230
So I'll sit here… It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

303
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,950
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! Hey!!

304
00:22:42,302 --> 00:22:44,002
President Yu.

305
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:47,066
What are you...

306
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,810
I'm preparing something for you.

307
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,730
It's quite late right now.

308
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,570
I'm going home.

309
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,970
I bet you haven't eaten.

310
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,890
Let me make you something nice.

311
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,370
You're drunk.

312
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,650
I have heated some water for you.

313
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,569
Have a little tea and go to bed early.

314
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,370
I'm not drunk.

315
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,970
I can't sleep.

316
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,130
Let me prepare something nice for you.

317
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,790
There are no ingredients here.

318
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,370
There is nothing here.

319
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,789
You should go to bed early. There will be a meeting tomorrow morning.

320
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,130
It's fine.

321
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,250
I'll go and get something.

322
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,249
Where will you buy it in the middle of the night?

323
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,110
I'll go get something.

324
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,830
Let's go.

325
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:10,070
Boss, what are you doing?

326
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:19,229
Boss, let's go. What if someone shows up?

327
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:20,470
I found the refrigerator.

328
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,070
What?

329
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,750
- Boss.
- I'm going to...

330
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,850
do a good job today.

331
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,650
Boss, let's just go.

332
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,409
What if someone sees you stealing food from here?

333
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,510
Imagine how bad it'll be if this news spreads.

334
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,810
What are you afraid of? It's not like I won't pay for these.

335
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,730
Where are the tomatoes?

336
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,610
You... like tomatoes the most.

337
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,090
Here you go.

338
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,970
Boss, we should leave now.

339
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:17,830
My stomach hurts.

340
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,630
- What's wrong?
- It hurts!

341
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,370
I laid a huge egg.

342
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,549
I have started to mutate. What should I do now? I have started laying eggs.

343
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:34,670
- What's wrong?
- Sit down, sit down!

344
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,790
Be quiet.

345
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,390
It's fine now.

346
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,990
Let's go.

347
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,070
Weren't we,

348
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,190
acting just like ostriches right now?

349
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,170
How should I eat this egg?

350
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,890
Are you not going to eat?

351
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,000
Why don't we eat at the table?

352
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,640
On the table...

353
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,960
it is too cold and hard.

354
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
Won't you even try it?

355
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,700
Are you afraid that my cooking isn't good?

356
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,160
It took me so long to learn this.

357
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,420
Or do you think...

358
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,920
this is a waste of time?

359
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,980
How is it?

360
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,760
Delicious.

361
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,759
I wonder which amazing chef taught you?

362
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,720
Why did you cook this dish?

363
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,340
It's ordinary,

364
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,920
but it is also special.

365
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,779
It's simple,

366
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,839
It might be simple, but it is often the taste you miss the most.

367
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,300
I call this the ordinary taste for the extraordinary.

368
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,119
but it is the ordinary taste for the extraordinary.

369
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,360
But ordinary...

370
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,020
is often overlooked

371
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,600
and not cherished.

372
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,740
If it is easily obtained,

373
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,940
then it will be taken for granted.

374
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,620
It is easier to be forgotten and abandoned.

375
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,260
Do you believe in ordinary happiness?

376
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,900
I do.

377
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,820
How about you?

378
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,280
I do.

379
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,660
Also,

380
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,139
this is not ordinary at all.

381
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,380
This is an ostrich egg.

382
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,470
Don't move.

383
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,880
Why bother to hide? We already ate the ostrich eggs.

384
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,980
♫  I love your companionship every day  ♫

385
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,750
♫  A simple tea and meal  ♫

386
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,940
♫  All I wish for is to kiss you goodnight  ♫

387
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,800
♫  Year after year and forever in this lifetime  ♫

388
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,390
♫  From dawn till dusk, through odds and ends  ♫

389
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,930
♫  I want to dine with you every day  ♫

390
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:59,200
♫  I want to kiss you and wish you goodnight every day ♫

391
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,380
Don't you think that something is missing?

392
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,320
It seems like something is missing.

393
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,430
Where is the director?

394
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,990
He didn't come with us?

395
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,320
I wasted money on the hotel rooms.

396
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,910
That's right. Tree Hollow Hotel.

397
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,340
Su Kelan!

398
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,779
President Yu, please give me a second.

399
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,080
I'll call someone to deliver your clothes.

400
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,100
Which clothes?

401
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,580
You don't remember?

402
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,090
What are we waiting here for?

403
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,850
Why are there reporters here?

404
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,630
Come over here.

405
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,999
Yu Han, why there are reporters?

406
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,620
Didn't you ask me to call them here?

407
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,059
Yu Hao didn't come over, and our plans fell apart.

408
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,330
What's the point of having them here?

409
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,359
Forget it. Those reporters have to work as well.

410
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,680
How about this, let's communicate with the Hotel,

411
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,480
perhaps I can get them onto the hot search list.

412
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,260
It'll be even better if I could be their spokesperson.

413
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,959
I'm in Room 301.

414
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,170
Okay. That's it.

415
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,819
Who threw me under the table?

416
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:32,150
Why are you here?

417
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,960
That's it.

418
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,130
This group of heartless people left me here on my own?

419
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,220
Let's go! Go!

420
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,939
That's right. How come there are so many reporters?

421
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,700
Tree Hollow Hotel.

422
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,840
I asked you, why there are so many reporters here?

423
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,210
How would I know?

424
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,020
Do you suspect me of calling the reporters?

425
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,570
Do you think I set you up so that the reporters can take pictures of us?

426
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:15,919
What for? To blackmail you?

427
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,580
Do you think someone like you can even be threatened?

428
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,819
If I did that, you might as well fire me.

429
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:24,680
Do you think your director of Public Relations can be that stupid?

430
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,510
I have a suggestion!

431
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,140
Zhang Bi?

432
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,900
This foolish girl?

433
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,460
You were pulling me, kissing me, and wouldn't let me go.

434
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,260
Now you're accusing me of setting you up.

435
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,870
What are you talking about?

436
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,690
I said that I didn't know you couldn't handle your drinks.

437
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,339
Who was the last one to leave yesterday? Also, why am I sleeping under the table?

438
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:08,840
Do you all want to die? Wait for me.

439
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,180
There are reporters outside.

440
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,600
It's not like that!

441
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,760
It's the room over there.

442
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,770
Come over here.

443
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,260
Why don't you let the reporters leave first?

444
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,670
No, I have a meeting today.

445
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,300
Where are my clothes?

446
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,160
I washed them.

447
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,610
You washed them!

448
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,519
- You...
- Why don't you wear this first?

449
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:49,210
Just wear it.

450
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,090
Fine, I won't tease you. I have to tell you something important.

451
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,480
[Marriage License]

452
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,760
A shotgun marriage?

453
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,060
Are you out of your mind?

454
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:08,400
[Husband: Gong Wenxing; Wife: Han Meng]

455
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,500
You met this man yesterday!

456
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,859
Weren't you dumped by several girls because you keep calling for "Dudu" in your dreams?

457
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:18,550
Aren't you afraid that history will repeat itself, and she'll divorce you eventually?

458
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,380
Dudu! Dudu!

459
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,170
Dudu?

460
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,140
Who is Dudu?

461
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,900
I panicked when she asked me.

462
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,720
I didn't think she would believe me, but I explained it to her anyway.

463
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,720
I told her that when I was a kid no one celebrated my birthday so I ran away.

464
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,000
Then a little girl and her family took me in.

465
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,620
When I was having dinner at their place,

466
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,760
we watched Chūka Ichiban together.
(T/N: A Japanese manga about Chinese food)

467
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,140
Because of that, I called that girl Dudu.

468
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,820
Dudu!

469
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,340
Dudu!

470
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,340
And guess what?

471
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,539
No way! You had already met each other when you were young?

472
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:12,320
Isn't that interesting?

473
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,279
I found him on the streets,

474
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:18,460
and that silly boy kept telling me that no one wanted to celebrate his birthday.

475
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,200
It turns out that he was Gong Wenxing.

476
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,060
Isn't that serendipity?

477
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:28,000
If this isn't fate, what else could it be?

478
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,100
When fate comes your way, you shouldn't avoid it.

479
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,540
If fate comes to you, don't avoid it.

480
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,259
Su Kelan?

481
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,499
I said that I didn't know you couldn't handle your drinks.

482
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,460
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

483
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,560
- Morning.
- Going to work again?

484
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,559
- Morning, President Yu.
- Morning, President Yu.

485
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,940
Morning, President Yu.

486
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,280
Hello? So...

487
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,460
What is this situation?

488
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,819
President Yu, we are ready for the meeting.

489
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:33,919
- Should we start?
- Yes.

490
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:36,581
Sister Kelan of the Public Relations Department is presiding.

491
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,499
Cancel the meeting.

492
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:41,320
Understood, President Yu.

493
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,580
President Yu. This week's public opinion—

494
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,479
Just send me a message.

495
00:43:13,479 --> 00:43:14,880
What?

496
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,800
Here.

497
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,419
What's up with President Yu today?

498
00:43:21,419 --> 00:43:22,879
It's my first time seeing him so quiet.

499
00:43:22,879 --> 00:43:25,099
He didn't hold a meeting or scold people.

500
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:26,600
Right.

501
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,699
And this morning, he didn't even get on the elevator.

502
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:29,680
What's the situation?

503
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,200
I have no idea.

504
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,880
It's all your fault.

505
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,979
Even jumping into the Yangtze River won't cleanse me.

506
00:43:59,979 --> 00:44:01,560
- It's the Yellow River.
- Who cares?
 (T/N: The original phrase is "Jumping into the Yellow River")

507
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,600
You suggested our hotel stay.

508
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,499
You drank too much and ended up squirming under the table.

509
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:06,680
Why did you rush to open the door?

510
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,299
Director, when will the next theme for the show be announced?

511
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:22,280
I will ask President Yu to prepare in advance.

512
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,880
Su Kelan?

513
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,440
Do you like her?

514
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,400
How will someone like you chase a girl?

515
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,260
Why does it matter to you?

516
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,199
I want to chase Yu Hao.

517
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:48,380
You're going after Su Kelan.

518
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,979
Then if you succeed,

519
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,200
won't it be a big help for me?

520
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,119
Use work as an excuse and ask her out to talk about the show.

521
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:57,479
Talk about work!

522
00:44:57,479 --> 00:45:00,659
Won't that increase the frequency of your interactions?

523
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,739
Okay, I'll make an appointment now.

524
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:03,799
Not right now!

525
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:05,339
What time is it right now?

526
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:08,099
If you ask her out right now, you will only be able to say a few words.

527
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,159
Wait until dusk,

528
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,259
then you can even have dinner together while you're at it.

529
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,019

00:58:22,189 --> 00:58:24,609
pour in vegetable oil...

712
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:27,729
After the heat becomes high, add minced meat...

713
00:58:27,729 --> 00:58:29,110
Mom,

714
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,970
I'm hungry and can't wait for you anymore.

715
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,029
I will do it instead.

716
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:33,990
You just take care of the noodles.

717
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:40,829
Take finely chopped pork shoulder

718
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:42,269
with fat and thin portions,

719
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,429
add in egg white and starch, and mix well.

720
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:46,150
This will lock in the juices.

721
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,110
Add in a spoonful of oil and mix well.

722
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:51,669
This will cause the meat to easily get stir-fried when added to the pot.

723
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,710
Now add the chopped meat to the pot and stir-fry until dry.

724
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,269
Add a spoonful of cooking wine and stir-fry until dry.

725
00:59:07,269 --> 00:59:10,530
Now stir-fry with minced onion and ginger on high heat.

726
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,409
Add in a spoonful of sweet bean sauce

727
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:17,070
and bean paste each. Stir-fry evenly.

728
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:24,989
Add in a small spoon of soy sauce, oyster sauce,

729
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,789
sugar, and pepper oil as well.

730
00:59:29,789 --> 00:59:31,570
Continue to stir-fry evenly.

731
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,569
Add a small amount of bone stock.

732
00:59:38,569 --> 00:59:39,989
Wait until the soup thickens

733
00:59:39,989 --> 00:59:41,910
before removing it from the pot.

734
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:51,369
Double sauce noodles

735
00:59:51,369 --> 00:59:53,650
means that there are two kinds of sauce toppings.

736
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,629
The usual dry minced meat topping is often prepared at home,

737
00:59:55,629 --> 00:59:57,749
and then the freshly prepared mixed meat sauce

738
00:59:57,749 --> 01:00:00,149
is added to the noodles.

739
01:00:00,149 --> 01:00:01,269
When sprinkled with chopped green onions.

740
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:03,170
it tastes particularly delicious.

741
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,210
How is the aroma?

742
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,690
Fragrant, right?

743
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:10,829
Cooking together.

744
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:12,110
Eating together.

745
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,550
This kind of life

746
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:16,250
can never become exhausting.

747
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,649
The person with whom

748
01:00:17,649 --> 01:00:20,150
I can enjoy these simple leisures.

749
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,770
Where is he?

750
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,270
President Yu, you should go to the hospital and get it checked.

751
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,049
Let's get an X-ray done.

752
01:00:54,049 --> 01:00:56,210
What if your bones or muscles are hurt?

753
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,269
If you ignore minor injuries, and they worsen later on,

754
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:02,289
won't that be a waste of time and affect your work?

755
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:14,960
Um...

756
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,370
I'm okay.

757
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,450
Thank you.

758
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,970
[Yu Hao]

759
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:48,290
Send me this week's public opinion report.

760
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,530
A man who only knows how to work.

761
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:55,090
Will you be able to understand the meaning of leisure?

762
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,170
Probably not.

763
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,770
[Su Kelan]

764
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:08,870
Is it all right now? Are you satisfied?

765
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:11,970
It is time for dinner.

766
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:13,209
Did you take your shot?

767
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:15,010
I did.

768
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,170
Where's the report?

769
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:41,040
I told you to send it. Why isn't it done yet?

770
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:44,709
I clearly said that you need to handle work 24 hours a day.

771
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:50,010
Kelan.

772
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:52,210
This President Yu—

773
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:59,670
Check in the work group.

774
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,870
It has already been sent there.

775
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:39,669
I asked you to send it, but you asked someone else to send it instead.

776
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:55,770
As Director of the PR department,

777
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:58,010
I need to distribute work reasonably.

778
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:00,169
Besides, Yao Qian's report was well done,

779
01:05:00,169 --> 01:05:01,630
worthy of being seen by the boss,

780
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,310
and getting encouraged and commended.

781
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,030
Boss, please handle the work rationally.

782
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,310
Don't get emotional.

783
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,990
People were already against me. Now you're against me as well.

784
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,300
Right?

785
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,089
If you're going to turn off the water, couldn't you at least notify me in advance?

786
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:24,490
What kind of apartment is this?

787
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:41,170
Your nephew.

788
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,990
What the hell is his problem?

789
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,569
With the way that he looks at Kelan. He clearly likes her.

790
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:48,510
Then why is he hiding from her?

791
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,970
He is just too pure.

792
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,070
Eat.

793
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:00,670
Hello, the subscriber you dialed is currently...

794
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:19,569
Hello, the subscriber you dialed is currently unavailable.

795
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:22,210
Please dial again later.

796
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,749
Hello, An Jie.

797
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,709
Sister Kelan.

798
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,129
Are you shooting the show with President Yu right now?

799
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:49,031
No. Why?

800
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:51,269
The Marketing Department had a contract that needs to be signed.

801
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:53,290
President Yu has to confirm it by tonight.

802
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:55,749
I have already called him several times, but he didn't answer.

803
01:06:55,749 --> 01:06:58,370
He didn't answer his phone?

804
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,030
Mom, it is okay, eat.

805
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,450
Could something have happened?

806
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,510
He...

807
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:36,230
hurt his back earlier today.

808
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,069
Sister Kelan.

809
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,570
Hello, Xiao Yan.

810
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:49,409
Where did President Yu go after he left the Chrysanthemum Restaurant?

811
01:07:49,409 --> 01:07:52,130
I sent him home.

812
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:56,109
Could you please send me his home address?

813
01:07:56,109 --> 01:07:57,850
Mom, I will come back soon.

814
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:00,130
You haven't even finished your noodles yet.

815
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:02,070
It is okay.

816
01:08:41,929 --> 01:08:44,269
Hey, where are you?

817
01:08:44,269 --> 01:08:45,609
At home.

818
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:48,890
You're at home? Then, didn't you hear the doorbell?

819
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,550
I heard it.

820
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:53,609
If you heard it, then why aren't you opening the door?

821
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:55,090
I can't move.

822
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:57,448
What's wrong? Did something happen?

823
01:08:57,448 --> 01:08:59,349
Are you seriously hurt?

824
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:08,130
Tell me your door's password. I'll come in.

825
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,910
No need. Go back home.

826
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:18,569
Hey, what's up, Kelan?

827
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:21,749
Hey, Meng Meng. What's Gong Wenxing's telephone number? Give it to me.

828
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:23,610
He's right next to me.

829
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:25,270
Kelan.

830
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:26,709
Hello?

831
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:29,028
Hello, Gong Wenxing...

832
01:09:29,028 --> 01:09:30,750
Your nephew is injured.

833
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,308
I'm in front of his house right now,

834
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:35,790
but I can't get in. Can you please tell me his door's password?

835
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:36,890
What?

836
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:39,269
The password is 408129. You should go in first. I'll be right there.

837
01:09:39,269 --> 01:09:41,509
- Let's go.
- What's the matter?

838
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,711
- President Yu.
- Why did you come in?

839
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:02,689
- I'm coming in.
- Don't you dare come in.
