00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,720
I already told you that you can still be part of the commercial.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,100
What are you still crying about?

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,156
Why do they say I throw myself at him?

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,740
I'm just trying to get what I want.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,320
Is there something wrong with that?

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,952
No. I'm not drunk enough.

7
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:27,581
Call those guys from the crew over here.

8
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:31,860
Boss, I'll book the whole restaurant for today. Bring me the menu.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,440
Why did she order so much?

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,520
Look at how Sister Bi is going to do the barbecue herself.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,760
- Sister Bi, will the barbecue you make be edible?
- That's right.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,040
When I weighed 100 kg, I was the best BBQ cook in the village.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,370
- When she was100 kg?
- 100 kg?

14
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,110
Have you seen that?

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,688
You guys just wait.

16
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:01,241
- Where are you going?
- What's going on?

17
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:03,468
Did she leave?

18
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,124
All done.

19
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:40,040
What do you think?

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,660
- Not bad, right?
- Not bad.
- It smells great.

21
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,460
If she'd been like this before,

22
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,604
she really could have been the spokesperson and tricked housewives into buying the food.

23
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:51,620
Shut up. Don't bring up the spokesman thing anymore. So annoying.

24
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,900
Now, eat up. Eat up.

25
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,100
- Go ahead.
- Okay. Thanks, Sister Bi.

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
It's good.

[Eggplant in Boiled Blood Curd: Unnecessary but Interesting]

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,888
Happy birthday!

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,920
Gong Wenxing of Chongwai High School's 8th class in the 12th grade is lucky to have met you!

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,624
Gong Wenxing.

32
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,224
Where is everybody?

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,520
Gong Wenxing.

34
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,120
- Meng Meng.
- Auntie.

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,076
Kelan, you're here, too.

36
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:27,180
- Mom.
- What are you doing here?

37
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,860
Auntie, Meng Meng said she has some clothes that don't fit anymore.

38
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,020
So she's giving them to me.

39
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,080
That's good. Good timing, why don't you stay for dinner?

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,920
All right. Thank you.

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,880
Mom, I'll get started on dinner.

42
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,580
Okay.

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,900
Go ahead.

44
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,520
Kelan, we can have a family get-together today.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,880
Give Yu Hao a call and ask him to come back early.

46
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,620
Auntie, Yu Hao has been very busy lately.

47
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,096
He's in a meeting right now.

48
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:03,950
Which is more important? Work or his girlfriend?

49
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:06,664
I'll call him.

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,080
Hello? Hao Hao, come to your uncle's house for dinner.

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,256
Kelan is also here.

52
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Just look at you.

53
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,340
Which is more important to you? Your work or your girlfriend?

54
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,060
Hurry and come back. We'll wait for you.

55
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,680
Where are you?

56
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,200
Mom, something came up. In a little while, I'll order takeout for you.

57
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,900
Why hasn't that rascal come home yet?

58
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,940
Don't worry. I'll be waiting for you here.

59
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,520
It's dinner time. Stop playing with your phone.

60
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,560
Just a minute. I need to review a contract. It's urgent.

61
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,560
Go ahead.

62
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,160
Hurry and come home. Without you here, it's so awkward.

63
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,780
Hao Hao, let's eat. That Gong Wenxing is so unreliable.

64
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,980
Let's not wait for him anymore. Let's just eat.

65
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,920
Okay.

66
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,684
Hao Hao, give some to Kelan.

67
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,560
Thank you, Grandma.

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,180
- Go ahead.
- I can help myself.

69
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,380
Kelan, don't be shy. You're one of the family here.

70
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,920
Okay.

71
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,980
President Yu.

72
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,360
It's the first time Kelan has come to our house for dinner.

73
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,880
If you mess around on your phone, I'll take it away from you on behalf of Kelan.

74
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,360
I'll eat.

75
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,981
Oh, wow. What's going on here?

76
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:36,660
So many people, I thought I'd come through the wrong door.

77
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,740
What's wrong with you? You aren't a child anymore. Look at the shape you're in.

78
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,180
We're having a family dinner today, and you let Meng Meng do all the work on her own.

79
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,510
You have no sense of responsibility.

80
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,550
Stop nagging. I'm home, aren't I? I'm starving.

81
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,841
Look at you. You are as brazen as always, no manners at all.
(idiom: a dead pig fears no scalding water)

82
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:01,340
Isn't everyone you care about here, Mom?

83
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,900
Why make me your punching bag to let off steam?

84
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,200
Have I said something wrong?

85
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,300
Kelan and Yu Hao have come for dinner.

86
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,700
You can't even come home early to help with a little something.

87
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,080
Yu hao is not good at small talk. You know that.

88
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,280
What took you so long? The dishes are all getting cold. Hurry.

89
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,964
Go ahead and change first.

90
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,700
This is delicious.

91
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,848
Why are you standing there like that? What's your problem?

92
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,300
Why are you yelling at me?

93
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,500
Shouldn't I be angry when you're so rude?

94
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,740
- Grandma.
- Mom.

95
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,580
Stop talking. What's the matter with you?

96
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,440
It's rare for Hao Hao to bring Kelan for dinner.

97
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,280
- You think...
- You're yelling at me because I wasn't here to support Yu Hao, right?

98
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,700
Do you care about me?

99
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,040
Were you worried about me when I ran away from home on my eighth birthday?

100
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,901
When I got into a fight and broke my hand, what did you do besides yell at me for it?

101
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:58,780
Were you even concerned about why I got into a fight?

102
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,140
Do you know why I forgot you were coming tonight?

103
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,160
Because I had a fight with Han Meng. Do you even care? Do you?

104
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,400
Go to your room and rest up. Calm down a little.

105
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,080
What do you mean by "calm down"? Am I the one who isn't clear about things here?

106
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,184
I should just hold my temper forever and make others happy, right?

107
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,460
He doesn't celebrate his birthday, so I can't, either.

108
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,880
If I said I wanted to celebrate my birthday, you'd say I was causing trouble. Why?

109
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,520
He didn't like eggplant, so we never had eggplant in this house.

110
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,980
If I said I wanted some, you'd say I wasn't being considerate. Why?

111
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,960
I come back to my own home for dinner, and I still have to help him look good in front of his girlfriend. Why?

112
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,820
Have any one of you really cared about me? Cared whether I'm happy, whether I've suffered, whether I'm upset?

113
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,816
I've had enough!

114
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,460
Grandma, get some rest.

115
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,420
Don't think too much.

116
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,540
The moment he walked in, I noticed

117
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,540
that he wasn't wearing his wedding ring.

118
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,272
I know they're having a fight,

119
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:49,320
but I don't know how to comfort him.

120
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,920
You know

121
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,880
that he's been rebellious and mischievous since he was little.

122
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,580
If he doesn't want to tell me something,

123
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,760
he would always joke about it and laugh it off.

124
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,952
I thought he was able to solve his own problems.

125
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,760
And I was worried that if I meddled too much,

126
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,824
he'd go against me on purpose.

127
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:15,392
But I had no idea that he's been so unhappy.

128
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,900
Grandma.

129
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,360
Actually... Actually, he understands it all.

130
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,040
You know him very well. He's not a resentful type of person.

131
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,928
We took a vow that we'd have each other's back.

132
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,830
But turns out he's been

133
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:49,910
trying so hard to pamper me.

134
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:53,930
As a result, I took his indulgence for granted

135
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:57,784
and enjoyed his care so much

136
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,620
that I became more and more willful.

137
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,684
Since he has been the one who spoils you,

138
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:09,556
shouldn't it

139
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:12,136
be your turn this time?

140
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,020
When I was little,

141
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,060
no one would comfort me even if I felt angry or sad.

142
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,564
Then I thought

143
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:06,280
I might feel better if I acted like

144
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,580
I didn't care.

145
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,760
I'm sorry.

146
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,610
This time I'll apologize first,

147
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,240
and I'll comfort you in the future.

148
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,940
Okay?

149
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
It's my fault.

150
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,180
When you threw away your wedding ring, I felt

151
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,600
what you felt when I traded my wedding ring.

152
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,092
I'm sorry.

153
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,940
It's just a wedding ring.

154
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,740
Now, unlike us, the ring is just an object.

155
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,420
We can always buy another ring that looks exactly the same.

156
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,480
How come it sounded so familiar?

157
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,652
That's what you said.

158
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:06,480
No wonder it makes so much sense.

159
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,840
- Makes sense? Does it? Does it?
- No, it doesn't.

160
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,321
- Does it make sense?
- It's complete nonsense.

161
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:14,284
Does it... make sense?

162
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:17,980
Didn't you just say you'd comfort me in the future?

163
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,500

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,660
I promise,

174
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,520
I will never, ever leave you again.

175
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,980
♫  From dawn till dusks, through odds and ends  ♫

176
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,660
♫  I want to dine with you every day  ♫

177
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,020
Are... are you hungry?

178
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,640
No one ate dinner

179
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,188
because of me?

180
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,140
- Then let's go home and eat.
- Go home.

181
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,800
Let's go.

182
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,800
Come on. Let's eat.

183
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,960
The food here is delicious.

184
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,440
Try the wheat gluten and the stinky tofu.

185
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,452
The stinky tofu is so tasty.

186
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,268
You guys carry on.

187
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,240
What's wrong? Tired from grilling?

188
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,920
Today, why did you

189
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,020
come to comfort me all of a sudden?

190
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,000
Kelan asked me to come.

191
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,101
I just knew that a careless person like you wouldn't know I have a problem.

192
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:27,660
She said

193
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,500
you must feel very bad being criticized like that.

194
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,648
So fake.

195
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,080
She cared about you. Don't be ungrateful.

196
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,960
She could've just made a statement and clarified that they didn't ask you to be the spokesperson.

197
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,384
But to protect your feelings, she'll still let you do a commercial.

198
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,748
So annoying.

199
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:52,000
Why is it annoying?

200
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,180
How could there be such a nice person?

201
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,056
She leaves no chance for anybody else.

202
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,404
Everybody

203
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:04,932
is nice in different ways.

204
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,240
No way.

205
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,976
You all like her.

206
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:19,064
No one likes me.

207
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,100
It's Sister Zhang Bi.

208
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,360
Yes, that's Sister Zhang Bi.

209
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,692
Right. What's up?

210
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I like you so much. When I grow up, I'll marry you.

211
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,560
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

212
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,440
Why are you laughing?

213
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,660
Nothing.

214
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,300
Are you okay?

215
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,760
I'm fine. We fought a lot when we were little.

216
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
We'll be good in no time.

217
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,224
What is it? Are you unhappy?

218
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,400
No.

219
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,340
It is because of Wang Yi?

220
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,581
If you really don't want to be the VP, I'll go to the office and tell them tomorrow.

221
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:07,045
But I think it'll be a waste of your talent.

222
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm unhappy because you kept checking your phone when we had dinner just now.

223
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,640
You are always busy with work. And last night, you...

224
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,160
Are you going to talk about what happened in the office last night?

225
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,264
You were the one who started the conference call first.

226
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,900
It only took me half an hour, but yours lasted eight hours.

227
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,496
You even asked me to make coffee for you. You...

228
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,740
Tell me, does work really mean so much to you that you can't even stop for one minute?

229
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,740
You know that the deal may be off if I don't deal with it right away. Business never waits.

230
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,740
- And people would?
- You wouldn't?

231
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,900
I would.

232
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,840
But sometimes you can't wait, even if you want to.

233
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,160
When I was in high school, I never enjoyed a full meal time with my family.

234
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,080
I always left the table to do my homework right after I finished my food.

235
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,640
Whenever I got some free time, I'd go hang out with Han Meng.

236
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,050
I seldom stayed at home.

237
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,292
Because I knew

238
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:37,840
my parents

239
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,720
and my grandparents were my family,

240
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,212
and they'd be there and waiting for me as long as my home was there.

241
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,720
The year I graduated from high school, I went on a trip with Han Meng.

242
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,536
When we got back, I had learned

243
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,860
that my family had a car accident.

244
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,520
The time you can spend with the people you love

245
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,760
might be shorter than you thought.

246
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,952
If you miss it,

247
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:15,804
you can never get it back again.

248
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,240
But of course,

249
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,080
one should also have his own life.

250
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,260
But at least during a meal

251
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,260
or the time to say goodnight,

252
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,548
you should be there for them.

253
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,200
So, in the future, could you be more attentive

254
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,720
when you are with your family?

255
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay.

256
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,020
I'm starving.

257
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,660
I'll go warm up the dishes.

258
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,700
Let me. Go ahead and clean up first.

259
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,260
Then I'll be right back.

260
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,864
Go ahead.

261
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,280
I'll help you.

262
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
Okay. Let's warm up the dishes.

263
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,580
All right.

264
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,072
You were right.

265
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,220
By the way, could you do me a favor?

266
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,520
I've told Zhang Bi she can still do a commercial for us.

267
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,060
I know that.

268
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,540
And...

269
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,580
Director Wang promised her that we'd make her our spokesperson.

270
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,560
The solution for now is mainly to stop the negative comments,

271
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,216
but her agency would more or less think that we broke our word.

272
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,160
You can easily hold Wang Yi accountable for that.

273
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,900
He's part of our company, so he represents the company.

274
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,781
Besides, he's one of your friends who helped you establish the company.

275
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,220
How can we let him take full responsibility?

276
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,796
Then what do you want to do?

277
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,620
I'm thinking if we can find an endorsement

278
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,640
that suits Zhang Bi better.

279
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,600
Her image is perfect for a fashion brand.

280
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,740
But she hasn't received any offers yet.

281
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,420
Yao Qian told me many brands think that she's not classy enough.

282
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,864
So I'm thinking

283
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:32,980
if it's possible

284
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,040
to ask your colleague friends who might have the resources to do so.

285
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,820
If there are, you can give them to me, I'll talk to them on her behalf.

286
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,320
It's been done.

287
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,940
So you've been busy finding an endorsement opportunity for her?

288
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,496
So what do you think?

289
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,140
You...

290
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,860
How did you know what I was thinking?

291
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,184
I am your boss.

292
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,820
They've sent me the contract through e-mail. Look.

293
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,000
Really?

294
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,208
Thank you! Thanks!

295
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,740
I knew that good luck would favor a delightful girl.

296
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,520
I got another endorsement deal!

297
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,860
It's awesome!

298
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,792
I got another endorsement deal!

299
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:36,936
Let's drink!

300
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:39,020
Cheers!

301
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,640
Dinner is ready.

302
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
Come on.

303
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,585
♫  The moment the wind blows, it awakens me from my fatigue  ♫

304
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,540
[Mom, I'll be home late.]
[It's okay. I’ll wait for you.]

305
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,700
Kelan, Hao Hao, let's eat.

306
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,720
We're leaving now.

307
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,170
Kelan's mother is still waiting for her.

308
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,570
♫  Will my dream developed into something more  ♫

309

Oh.

311
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,830
♫  How many journeys to take before I'm astounded and speechless?  ♫

312

♫  Even in the void of the night, no one answers  ♫

319
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,900
Stir.

320
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,410
♫  It awakens me from my fatigue  ♫

321
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:49,310

It's nice.

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,892
Here. Try the sweet and sour fish I cooked.

325
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:58,110

336
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,200
Auntie, I don't know if you like the dishes.

337
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,692
If you don't, you can eat less.

338
00:26:30,692 --> 00:26:32,500
I like them.

339
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,664
I didn't know you were a good cook.

340
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,580
Just relax.

341
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,820
Make yourself at home.

342
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,820
Mom.

343
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,104
I don't have a kitchen, and I never cooked at home.

344
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,824
Mom, have some tomato.

345
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,180
Auntie,

346
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,780
please try this.

347
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,360
I didn't expect you'd have a special taste.

348
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,440
Is anybody in your family from the South?

349
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,996
The South?

350
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:28,520
Su Kelan told me you usually ate sweet bean curd at home.

351
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,688
Mom, try this. It tastes very good.

352
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,380
She fooled you.

353
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,404
You've been such a liar since you were little.

354
00:27:38,404 --> 00:27:42,120
Mom, how could you call your own daughter a liar?

355
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,620
Yu Hao, let me tell you.

356
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,000
When Kelan was little, we took her to a food expo.

357
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,780
Her father insisted on letting her try the sweet soft bean curd.

358
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,660
And she finally agreed to take a bite, and that was it.

359
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,280
It's very hard for one to change their taste.

360
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,040
What matters is the meaning hidden behind it. Don't you think?

361
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,580
Not at all. You are a liar.

362
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,220
Remember last time you pretended to be one of the crew members to apologize to me

363
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,640
and pissed me off?

364
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,240
- I did that because...
- Stop defending yourself.

365
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,720
Yu Hao, when she was in middle school, in order to comfort a classmate

366
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,040
whose parents just got divorced,

367
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,400
she made me sound worse than Snow White's stepmother.

368
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,600
Mom.

369
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,640
That classmate of hers did feel better,

370
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,132
but whenever she saw me, she'd walk away.

371
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,860
Stepmother... no...

372
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,560
Auntie, you know what?

373
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,100
She cooked poached egg in fermented glutinous rice soup for me once.

374
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,400
And she kept telling me she bought it nearby my home.

375
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,040
How did you know I prepared it?

376
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,640
Just ignore her. Go on.

377
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,240
She insisted that she bought it from nearby.

378
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,400
But there was no restaurant near my home at all.

379
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,100
She had no idea.

380
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,680
If you knew, just keep it to yourself.

381
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,120
Why do you have to say it out loud?

382
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,920
Gosh.

383
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,780
- It just hit me that...
- Mom, stop.

384
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,000
You are really like a stepmother now.

385
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,172
How could you say that about your own daughter?

386
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,780
I used to think

387
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,580
every conversation should be proceeded for a purpose.

388
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,868
But someone taught me the fun of life was hidden in every small talk

389
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:27,660
that was seemingly meaningless, like discussing what to eat.

390
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,980
The decision was not the point,

391
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,300
yet the process of making the decision was.

392
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,720
Why did you put eggplant in spicy boiled blood stew?

393
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,600
Because... I wanted you to ask that question.

394
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:00,380
- I want to try.
- I want to try, too.
- Let's give it a try.

395
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,484
Well said.

396
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,505
It's your reward.

397
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:13,925
[Message from Wang Yi]

398
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,132
Director Su, please confirm the advertisement plan.

399
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:23,000
If you don't want to be this busy,

400
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,660
I'll go to the office tomorrow and remove you from the VP position.

401
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,572
But you hope I can spend more time with you at work, right?

402
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,620
I'll listen to you.

403
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,176
Have some water.

404
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,500
- Thank you, Mom.
- Thank you, Auntie.

405
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,880
Don't stay up too late.

406
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,780
- Okay.
- Okay.

407
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,540
Are you still working?

408
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,240
Yes.

409
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,600
You are always busy at work when you are with him. Are you happy?

410
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,492
I think you are.

411
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,040
Kelan, actually I don't need you to take care of me all the time.

412
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,240
Seeing that you have your own life,

413
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,140
it makes me feel happier.

414
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,180
Also, he's changed for you.

415
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,372
So you should get closer to him.

416
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,700
You took a step forward toward me, so I think

417
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,080
I should take a step forward toward you.

418
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,916
So can I start working now?

419
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,740
Have you picked them up?

420
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,000
Yes. Take them directly to the site.

421
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,280
Hello. Is there a problem with the site?

422
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,700
Okay.

423
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,480
Wasn't that already confirmed?

424
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,240
- Why are you changing the plan so suddenly?
- Let me look at the plan.

425
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,800
We stopped those rumors from a few days ago from spreading. It's completely calmed down at this point.

426
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,060
During the filming of the commercial, pay attention to what you say to the media.

427
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,260
You must not give them any impression that they are a couple.

428
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,080
If another problem crops up, you go resolve it by yourself.

429
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,100
Today, we'll stop here.

430
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,440
Everyone needs to get ready and prepare everything at the site.

431
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,680
Take good care of the media and our partners.

432
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,120
Thank you. The meeting's over.

433
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,000
Director Wang, the company told me

434
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,840
that you were the one who got me the endorsement.

435
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,480
I really appreciate it.

436
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,470
I'll thank you in person later.

437
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,900
Director Su.

438
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,120
That stupid Wang.

439
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,800
He's never had a private meeting with Kelan before.

440
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,140
Could he be up to something again?

441
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,500
I don't think so. If someone like Director Wang wants to make trouble, he'd do it behind your back.

442
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,240
Besides, didn't you see his expression just now?

443
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,900
It's clear he knows he was wrong.

444
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,320
I suppose he just feels awkward since Kelan hasn't said anything about it to him.

445
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,520
That makes sense.

446
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,320
Yao Qian, I'm impressed.

447
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,472
Kelan was right when she said you were good at observing people.

448
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,640
Zhang Bi just thanked me for finding an endorsement opportunity for her.

449
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,480
Did you tell her that?

450
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,940
The Marketing Department communicates directly with Zhang Bi's agency. We'll need their cooperation in the future.

451
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,840
If you helped her when she was in trouble,

452
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,330
things will go more smoothly for you.

453
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,436
I owe you one.

454
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,740
Director Wang, it has nothing to do with doing favors.

455
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,461
Objecting to making Zhang Bi our spokesperson at the beginning,

456
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:12,980
then communicating and choosing this now are all rational considerations for our company.

457
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,560
I know

458
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,300
that it's difficult for people to disregard a person's identity and experience and make a judgment about them.

459
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,461
And you know

460
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:22,460
our coworkers all feel a little awkward when they are around me now.

461
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,860
But...

462
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,852
it might be less complicated when you try to make rational choices.

463
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,000
When I owe someone, I repay them.

464
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,760
What? Are you going directly to the dinner party?

465
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,860
You won't be going to the site?

466
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,260
Give me a break. You don't want to see me anyway.

467
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,550
Why would you think I don't want to see you?

468
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,400
I called you that day, but you didn't pick up.

469
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,000
And you didn't even bother to call me back.

470
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,930
What was that about?

471
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,240
That day... I was

472
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,340
in a meeting.

473
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,140
Yes. So why did you call me?

474
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,980
Nothing. You'll see tonight.

475
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,810
What?

476
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,460
Okay, then see you tonight. Bye.

477
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,280
It's about time to go to the site.

478
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,920
I thought An Jie was in charge of site arrangements. How come you came over?

479
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,600
He saw that you were on the phone, so he didn't want to interrupt.

480
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,080
Will you wear this?

481
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,680
Yes.

482
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,600
The stylist said it's best not to be too formal, it'll make people feel you're out of reach.

483
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,400
Formal?

484
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,860
If it's too formal,

485
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,660
then...

486
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,880
what do you think I should wear?

487
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,580
Let me see.

488
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,220
How about a black shirt?

489
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,560
It looks mature.

490
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,790
And it goes with a light-colored jacket.

491
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,130
Try these on.

492
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,300
President Yu,

493
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,160
shouldn't you avoid getting dressed in front of a female employee?

494
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,780
It's my office; why should I?

495
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,956
Then I'll avoid it.

496
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,136
Yu Hao,

497
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:08,860
don't mess around.

498
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,820
There's still time if we leave a half hour late.

499
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,120
It's daytime.

500
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,800
If you talk so loudly, they'll hear us outside.

501
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,520
Yu Hao...

502
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,360
We've been busy preparing the commercial for the last few days.

503
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,520
A little later, there's an interview with the media

504
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,600
and tonight there's a dinner party with our partners.

505
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,660
Since we have a bit of time now, let's take a break.

506
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,900
By the way... about Zhang Bi being the product representative, did you tell her

507
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,240
that Wang Yi was the one who helped her?

508
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,440
Yes.

509
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,696
In order to avoid Director Wang

510
00:38:19,696 --> 00:38:23,460
getting blamed for the mess that day.

511
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,580
That would make his job harder.

512
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,900
So you gave him a way out.

513
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,120
But he doesn't seem to appreciate it.

514
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,220
If I hadn't done it,

515
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,920
I wouldn't even have a slight chance of being appreciated.

516
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,240
Doing this, at least it won't make things worse.

517
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,280
Besides, he's been with you since you established the company.

518
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,260
If I really can't get along with him,

519
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,070
then I really don't deserve to have the position of vice-president.

520
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,610
You can help your mom pack her stuff now.

521
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,740
What?

522
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,140
My neighbor across the hall will move out next week.

523
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,920
At that point, your mom can move in and live there.

524
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,340
Your neighbor across the hall is moving?

525
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,760
What a coincidence.

526
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,440
Any problem?

527
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,188
Are you that anxious for me to move in with you?

528
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,400
Are you not in a hurry?

529
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,200
I'm not.

530
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,600
Are you sure?

531
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,120
I'm not in a hurry.

532
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,048
President Yu, Director Su, please...

533
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,790
Sorry to disturb you.

534
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,440
It's all your fault.

535
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,480
What did he say? Please what?

536
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,520
Hey. What are you doing?

537
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,072
I...

538
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,880
- President Yu.
- What's up?

539
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,100
- Something happened at the site.
- I've confirmed it many times.

540
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,560
I don't want to hear any excuses. I only want results. Do you understand?

541
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,220
President Yu.

542
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,760
Director Su.

543
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,440
Tell us.

544
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,820
What do you think of my outfit?

545
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,280
I'll be filming a commercial with Hao Hao in a little while.

546
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,520
Doesn't it look respectable?

547
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,560
Why did you send me a picture and ask for my opinion?

548
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,880
Don't you have a stylist for the commercial?

549
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,760
Hao Hao's taste has to be different from the stylist's.

550
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,480
I want Hao Hao to like it, not the stylist.

551
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,541
I thought you realized what you really wanted when we were at that BBQ last time.

552
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,760
I just got a little lost for a moment.

553
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,360
Now I've pulled myself together.

554
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,760
So what if the fans are criticizing me? I'll make their negative comments my stepping stone to success.

555
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,960
I'll let everybody envy me being with Hao Hao.

556
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,140
What? Are you still upset?

557
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,901
Think about it. If I can win Hao Hao over, Kelan will be yours.

558
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:52,920
I realized that she's really a nice girl.

559
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,180
You deserve her.

560
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,320
I'll do even more to split them up. That way,

561
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,000
we can both be with the right person. Soon, I'll be filming a commercial with Hao Hao

562
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,560
and I'm going to a dinner party with him.

563
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,480
I am looking for to it.

564
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,080
I need to go.

565
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,240
Miss Zhang Bi, we're about to start the next scene.

566
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,940
Please change your clothes.

567
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,380
Didn't you say we'd be done at 11 o'clock and I could go?

568
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,080
Assistant Director, isn't Miss Zhang Bi ready yet?

569
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,270
Touch up Miss Bi's make-up.

570
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,360
You...

571
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,880
Hurry. Hurry.

572
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,520
Hello?

573
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,440
Yu Han, where are you?

574
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,760
Didn't we say I could leave at 11?

575
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,680
Yesterday, I confirmed it many times.

576
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,600
But Zhang Bi's company said the film crew wouldn't let her go.

577
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,900
They want us to shoot the other parts first, and she'll be here in three hours.

578
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,140
In three hours?

579
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,480
But the media and our partners are already on the way to the site.

580
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,520
We don't have time.

581
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,760
Hello, hello.

582
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,320
Thank you for coming. Please go inside and have a rest.

583
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,800
Here.

584
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,100
This way, please.

585
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,890
We're here! Long time no see. Please take a rest in here. Thank you for coming.

586
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,640
This way, please.

587
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,800
Hello?

588
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,180
What?

589
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,520
The film crew wouldn't let her go?

590
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,800
Oh.

591
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,880
The last car just left the hotel.

592
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,040
They'll be there in half an hour, at the latest.

593
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,141
First, let's go to the film site. We'll calm the media when we get there.

594
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:17,480
While we're on the road, keep communicating with the film crew.

595
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,120
Find out exactly what's going on.

596
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,880
Hurry and negotiate with them to let Zhang Bi leave on time. If she can't, let's agree on the story.

597
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,770
We'll tell the media that Zhang Bi fell ill suddenly, and we have to reschedule.

598
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,130
Okay.

599
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,360
We've signed an agreement.

600
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,580
You're not entitled to being three hours late

601
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,420
because of your shooting schedule and that it's okay to be late, understand?

602
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,900
The media are there waiting already. And we have a dinner party after the shooting.

603
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,340
I didn't expect that the crew wouldn't let her go.

604
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,400
They said they had to finish the shooting today because of the change in the scenes.

605
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,680
Don't say that nonsense to me.

606
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,580
Why can't you just take her to leave? They broke the agreement first.

607
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,040
The producer has come to the site in person, and there are many other actors.

608
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,840
If she leaves now, people would say she's a snob.

609
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,880
So you are afraid that she's called a snob,

610
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,040
but it's okay to be sued by us?

611
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,520
Let me warn you, you are playing a snob in front of us right now.

612
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,400
And you've to pay the financial losses.

613
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,840
- But...
- You should do the math

614
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,360
and figure out what's the right thing to do. Get it?

615
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,980
Director Wang, I know Yu Han very well.

616
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,252
Could you hand me the phone and let me talk to her?

617
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,741
Yu Han, it's me, Su Kelan.

618
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:41,248
Sister Kelan, it's not that I didn't try.

619
00:43:41,248 --> 00:43:43,540
It's okay, Yu Han. Calm down first.

620
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,340
- You just said that the producer is there, right?
 - Yes.

621
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,120
- Is he the decision-maker?
- Yes.

622
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,420
How should I address him?

623
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,804
We call him Director Li.

624
00:43:53,804 --> 00:43:55,220
Then please put him on the phone.

625
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,160
- Let me talk to him.
- Okay.

626
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,460
Just focus on the shooting. Don't worry about her schedule.

627
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,260
- Okay.
- Director Li.

628
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,480
Hello?

629
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,820
Director Li, I'm Su Kelan, the VP of "What to Eat Next."

630
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,460
Director Su. I'm sorry, but Zhang Bi has to stay here for a while.

631
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,480
If she leaves, we have to shoot this scene again,

632
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,240
and all the actors have to work an extra day.

633
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,220
Look, Zhang Bi doesn't have to show up in every scene of your commercial, right?

634
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,340
You can shoot the others first, and shoot her parts later.

635
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,260
Wouldn't that be win-win situation?

636
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,360
What win-win situation? So we'll let the media stand there and wait?

637
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,700
Go ahead and ask them. We've had an agreement.

638
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,980
Yet they break their word over and over again.

639
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,960
Don't you have any respect for the contract?

640
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,560
Wang Yi.

641
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,480
Director Li, so if you let Zhang Bi go,

642
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,980
you'll have to shoot the same scene again,

643
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,620
and that'll increase the budget, right?

644
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,421
Director Su, spot on. You are so smart.

645
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:52,630
Look, the setting costs us a lot of money every day...

646
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,350
[Yao Qian]

647
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,910
Sister Kelan, the media have already...
- Yao Qian,

648
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,200
do you have a way to get

649
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,900
the shooting location chart of the film Zhang Bi stars in?

650
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,981
Sure. I remember I've seen it in the fans group.

651
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:10,736
Send it to me.

652
00:45:10,736 --> 00:45:12,240
Director Su?

653
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,476
Director Li, I'm listening.

654
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,800
Yu Han has another phone.

655
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,900
Give her a call and ask her

656
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,740
if they've found a location for the supermarket scene.

657
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,188
Okay.

658
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,560
Have you shot the supermarket scene? Have you found a location yet?

659
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,780
Let's make a compromise and work around

660
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,230
each other's schedule, okay?

661
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,000
Hello? Director Su?

662
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,480
- Hello? Director Su, are you there?
- Director Li, I'm here.

663
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,580
There you are. So I only need her for another three hours.

664
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,480
I promise I'll let her go in three hours, okay?

665
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,460
Director Li, you have a supermarket scene in the film, right?

666
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,680
You haven't found a location or this scene yet, have you?

667
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,680
How did you know?

668
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,240
Here's the thing. Our company has a supermarket.

669
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,200
If we let you use it for free, it can offset the overrun

670
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,964
for today's scene, right?

671
00:46:09,964 --> 00:46:12,601
Exactly. And if they shoot in our supermarket,

672
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:15,720
we can include our logo in the scene,

673
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,400
and it'll be a no-loss but only gain deal for us.

674
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,660
All right, Director Su. I like this idea.

675
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,260
Thank you, Director Li. I'll send someone to help you with the location scouting.

676
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,561
If you have any background requests, we'll try our best to make it work.

677
00:46:26,561 --> 00:46:29,580
All right I'll go talk to the director right now and let them accelerate the shooting.

678
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,840
And then we'll let Zhang Bi leave as soon as possible, okay?

679
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,040
All right. Okay.

680
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,480
Director Wang.

681
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,960
President Yu, Director Wang, let's pull over later.

682
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,280
An Jie and I will get off the car.

683
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,980
Aren't we going to the filming site?

684
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,280
Let's go get Zhang Bi first.

685
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,860
Hasn't they agreed to let her go?

686
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,740
We have no idea how long it'll be to shoot a scene.

687
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,520
What if they are late again?

688
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,100
Now, An Jie, please get the contract for the filming location ready.

689
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,220
Let's go find Zhang Bi and ask Director Li to sign the contract.

690
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,160
That way, they'll have to honor their word.

691
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,780
And leaving early may affect Zhang Bi's reputation.

692
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,540
Let's bring some gifts so the crew won't pick on her.

693
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,040
Okay.

694
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,180
Sorry, everybody, to have kept you waiting.

695
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,740
President Yu is here.

696
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,580
- Will President Yu be in the commercial?
- Of course.

697
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,920
He's our biggest and permanent spokesperson.

698
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,560
Director, President Yu is in the makeup room now.

699
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,420
Zhang Bi will be here soon. Is everything ready here?

700
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,060
Almost.

701
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,860
Thanks.

702
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,260
Gu Xiao.

703
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,021
Where are you? Gu Xiao, come out!

704
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:09,380
Miss, please...

705
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,580
I gave you everything I had. How could you treat me like this?

706
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,380
Cut.

707
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,680
Bi Bi, well done. That was the right emotion.

708
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,061
Adjust the camera, and let's do another take.

709
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,260
Shall we let her go after this scene?

710
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,660
Keep her here as long as possible. Let's hurry up.

711
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,012
Maybe we can finish it.

712
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:31,080
You are so smart.

713
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,760
Right over there.

714
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,200
Director Li, Director Chen. This is Director Su of What to Eat Next".

715
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,800
Director Su.

716
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,220
- Director Li, nice to meet you.
- You, too.

717
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,840
Director Su brought some of our best ready-to-cook meals

718
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,608
for the crew to enjoy.

719
00:48:49,608 --> 00:48:54,476
Director Li, I also brought the filming location contract.

720
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,536
Director Wang, when will the shooting start?

721
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:04,140
Soon. Sorry about the delay.

722
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,200
Please give us a little more time. Okay?

723
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,200
- Lawyer Shao.
- Director Wang.

724
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,836
Ladies and gentlemen, please come with me.

725
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,880
It looks nice here.

726
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,748
Long time no see.

727
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:19,300
Please allow me to introduce.

728
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,700
This is Lawyer Shao, and he's very well-known in the merger and acquisition field.

729
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,440
He's the one who made the Galaxy Securities' case happen.

730
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,441
If you'd like, you can interview him. It is a rare opportunity.

731
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:30,070
Come on.

732
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,560
Please take your time. One after another.

733
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,100
Sister, you'll have time to fix your makeup.

734
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,680
I'll see my Hao Hao very soon.

735
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,000
I need to make sure I look good.

736
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,440
Is everything okay? When will you be here?

737
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,770
Everything's fine. Will be there soon.

738
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,020
Director Wang.

739
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,800
Director Wang.

740
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,240
They are on the way.

741
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,840
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Sorry.

742
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,360
Kelan, I've talked to the Director. We'll put it off for 30 minutes.

743
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,960
You've informed the fans of both sides, right?

744
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,240
All done. Don't worry.

745
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,236
Okay. Thanks.

746
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,240
Sister, stop competing. It's hopeless.

747
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,728
How can you compare to her?

748
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,584
Go back to work.

749
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,300
Dear media friends, and dear partners, our commercial shooting will start soon.

750
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,260
Please take a seat.

751
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,240
Please remain quiet during the shooting.

752
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,040
Thank you very much for your cooperation!

753
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,740
Action.

754
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,100
What to eat next?

755
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,340
Dine with love.

756
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,940
Cut.

757
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,180
Ladies and gentlemen, the commercial shooting have ended.

758
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,380
Please come to this side. Next is the unscripted interview with President Yu.

759
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:35,040
Thank you. This way, please.

760
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,860
President Yu, what do you think of this new commercial?

761
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:43,000
"What to Eat Next" connects everyone's appetite and warms your heart through food.

762
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,060
I hope this new commercial can also convey

763
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,480
the atmosphere of a fireworks show.

764
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,721
President Yu, the rumor says you are dating Zhang Bi. What will you say about that?

765
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:53,440
We are here today for the commercial shooting.

766
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,960
And we've all devoted a lot of effort and ideas to this new commercial.

767
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,840
to this new commercial.

768
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,920
I hope you can put your focus on the commercial instead of meaningless gossip.

769
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,240
of meaningless gossip.

770
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,660
I hope when you see this commercial, you can...

771
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,780
Here.

772
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,800
President Yu.

773
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,340
Why are you hiding here alone?

774
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,560
I am responsible for the situation almost becoming troublesome.

775
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,780
Before

776
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,920
when I insisted on making Zhang Bi our spokesperson,

777
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,940
it almost caused a mess. That was also my fault.

778
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,748
Thanks to Su Ke—

779
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,900
Vice President Su.

780
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,740
Wang Yi,

781
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,940
how long have we known each other?

782
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,620
Ten years.

783
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,696
Ten years...

784
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,064
Time flies by so quickly.

785
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,280
When I started this company, you were the first to join.

786
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,120
In the beginning, we tried to persuade the restaurants

787
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,080
to sell their signature chef-made dishes in a ready-to-cook way, but they all ignored us.

788
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,160
So you went to one restaurant after another

789
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,020
to talk to them individually,

790
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:44,480
and finally, a few restaurants were convinced to give it a try.

791
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,884
After that,

792
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:49,640
you started to distribute flyers to our customers,

793
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,440
and send messages to them, asking them to give good ratings

794
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,180
and to experience our physical store.

795
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,240
Over time, those restaurants started to realize

796
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,160
that our platform

797
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,900
could really help them improve their brand value,

798
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,020
thereby increasing their turnover.

799
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,620
Because of the mutual trust,

800
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:14,000
we brought in more dish varieties, and more restaurants were willing to join our platform.

801
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,340
Hey.

802
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,112
Are you very upset that I didn't promote you as the VP?

803
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,560
I know now

804
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,860
why you'd promote her instead of me.

805
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,280
You've never

806
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,720
brought it up

807
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,760
or talked to me since, because you wanted me

808
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,280
to see it clearly for myself.

809
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,040
If I talked to you, wouldn't you think even more that I did it for the wrong reasons

810
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,400
and was being irrational?

811
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,280
Honestly, I'm surprised that you trust her this much.

812
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,652
Because she is trustworthy.

813
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,000
Then

814
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,760
was it also because of her

815
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,892
that you rejected Goldman Sachs's offer to be our IPO underwriter?

816
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,680
As your employee,

817
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,480
I have nothing to say.

818
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,680
But as your friend, I have to warn you.

819
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,360
Even though I understand why you included her

820
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,080
in the management team,

821
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,380
would our partners understand?

822
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,360
See you later, my friend.

823
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,480
We still have a dinner party tonight.

824
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,360
Qian Qian, what are you doing?

825
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,840
Sister Kelan, someone asked me to be a "fairy godmother" today.

826
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,840
I'll get you on the "pumpkin carriage" later.

827
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,612
What pumpkin carriage?

828
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,560
Welcome, Ms. Su.

829
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,200
I'll leave Ms. Su to you now.

830
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,741
President Yu asked me to prepare this for you.

831
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,800
Is this your way of saying you're losing face because I don't dress like a VP,

832
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,120
so you want me to clean up nice for the dinner party?

833
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,700
There are all kinds of people at the party.

834
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,600
I bet some would judge people
by appearance.

835
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,028
I don't want those with poor taste to give you a hard time.

836
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,160
Have fun.

837
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,760
Miss Zhang.

838
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,740
President Li.

839
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,920
Nice to meet you. Long time no see.

840
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,560
Miss Zhang, you are so stunning, even prettier in person than on TV.

841
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,840
I'm flattered.

842
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,528
Enjoy yourself.

843
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,940
President Zhang.

844
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,200
How are you doing?

845
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,000
I heard you are shooting a new movie.

846
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,040
We'll definitely go and watch it when it's released.

847
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,800
Thanks for your support!

848
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,300
See you later.

849
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,900
Director, you know what? There are so many investor moguls here.

850
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,320
There are so many investor moguls here.

851
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,980
I mean we are talking about investments in billions.

852
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,680
Hello, Miss Zhang.

853
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,380
Hello.

854
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,040
Nice to meet you.

855
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,324
Do you want to...

856
00:59:13,324 --> 00:59:14,480
Do you want to eat?

857
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,332
I'm sorry?

858
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,140
Have you eaten?

859
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:23,220
I don't speak Chinese. Sorry.

860
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,480
Why are you holding my hand?

861
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,200
You are wearing high heels.

862
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,980
If you fall, it'll affect our company's image.

863
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,080
You are the VP, remember?

864
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,716
People are watching.

865
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,616
See?

866
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,168
Just listen.

867
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,420
Excuse me.

868
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,548
Yu, who is she?

869
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,640
Hi, I'm Su.

870
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,840
I'm the Vice President of "What to Eat Next."

871
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,840
I'm in charge of the listing work.

872
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,000
I'm Jonathan with Morgan Stanley.

873
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,140
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

874
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,140
So how long have you been in Chongqing?

875
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,144
Only under a day.

876
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,140
Sister, seriously. Stop competing.

877
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,500
I think

878
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,980
maybe you can come to visit our company some time because I think

879
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,000
maybe we can work together.

880
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,660
Me, too. That would be wonderful.

881
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:52,820
- Really?
- Yeah.

882
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,700
Yeah? Okay, have a good time.

883
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,000
Thank you. Enjoy.

884
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,260
- President Wang.
- How are you doing?

885
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,380
- President Li.
- President Li.

886
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,860
President Wang. Nice to meet you.

887
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,460
We'll be over there.

888
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,480
What you said last time about...

889
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,180
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

890
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,380
Please try again later.

891
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,240
Gong Wenxing,

892
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,600
is our lock broken?

893
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,920
Also, you asked me to come home early.

894
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,960
I even skipped the dinner party.

895
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,780
So where are you?

896
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:44,404
At 9:16, on March 31, 1993,

897
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,548
a baby girl weighing only 3.4 kg was born.

898
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,520
Small as she was, she let out a loud cry, surprising everyone.

899
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,902
I want to stand by your side as you face the unknowns of this world.

900
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,580
In photos and in memories, time isn't necessarily linear.

901
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:16,800
And in such nonlinear time, I want to go with you and experience your joy,

902
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,472
sadness, sweetness, and what touched your heart.

903
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,760
What's he done?

904
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,176
You stole my idea.

905
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,320
And in the future, I'd like to take the risk to go with you

906
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,340
as you fulfill your dreams.

907
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,840
Just like when you wanted to study ballet when you were a child,

908
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,100
but you were forced to learn Taekwondo instead.

909
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,800
I bet if you'd put on your ballet clothes to practice your Taekwondo,

910
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,132
you'd surely look very charming.

911
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:20,720
And as time passes, I understand more how you've become the girl

912
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,720
that touches me; who breaks my heart, who makes me laugh hysterically.

913
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,336
And the one who even makes me lash out in anger.

914
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,540
You, such a special person, and I, just as special,

915
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,400
fell in love.

916
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,820
We are so different from each other, and our love can be bittersweet.

917
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:46,160
We are both looking for ways to resolve our differences.

918
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,080
But perhaps, the answers are in our hearts.

919
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,900
Hey,

920
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,720
you're not trying to say

921
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,060
that you're the gift to me.

922
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,824
Such a line would be

923
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,852
too cheesy.

924
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,696
Hurry up and come out.

925
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,300
Aren't you dying to get out of there?

926
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,760
Hey.

927
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,200
Are you suffocating in there?

928
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,900
Gong Wenxing!

929
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,340
Meng Meng.

930
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,720
A ring...

931
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,672
You didn't exchange it, did you?

932
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,340
People are alive, a ring is just an object.

933
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,640
Isn't it okay if I bought another one just like it?

934
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,961
- Gong Wenxing.
- I know I was wrong in saying that.

935
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,276
That's why I got it back.

936
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,780
I know,

937
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:08,352
we grew up in different environments,

938
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,580
and we are two people

939
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:14,220
who are very different from each other.

940
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,184
In the future, we'll probably continue to clash and argue a lot.

941
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,940
But I still want to be with you

942
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,380
to experience all the little things

943
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,376
and challenges in life.

944
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,680
Up until the last day of our lives.

945
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,940
Do you dare?

946
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,980
Why wouldn't I?

947
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,264
Only a coward would bail.

948
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,204
Now, hurry up.

949
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:57,010
♫  I'll abandon reason and do my best to fight for it  ♫

950
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:02,390
♫  I can feel your love  ♫

951
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,808
Your reward.

952
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,760
I have hands and legs. I can walk on my own.

953
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,600
I can get my own food.

954
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,520
Hello, President Yu.

955
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,000
What are you staring at?

956
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:45,524
Actually, if you dress up, you can totally turn into eye candy.

957
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,521
It's a social event. Pay attention to your facial expressions and behavior.

958
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,836
Why isn't Han Meng here?

959
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,660
She can't work late today.

960
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:10,696
She has a more important date.

961
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,200
Do you have to go home and cook for your mom after the party tonight?

962
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,121
No. I knew it would be late after the party.

963
01:09:43,121 --> 01:09:46,000
So I ordered take-out for her. She'll have dinner by herself.

964
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,932
Good.

965
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,820
So tonight...

966
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,685
you won't need to go back home, right?

967
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

968
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,720
Do you speak English?

969
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,876
Not really.

970
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:08,496
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

971
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,264
Hey, Jonathan.

972
01:10:16,264 --> 01:10:18,992
- Long time no see.
- Nice to see you.

973
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,700
She's even prettier than you, and even more elegant than Kelan.

974
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,136
Who is she?

975
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,420
- President Yang.
- It's been a while. President Li.

976
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,400
President Zhang.

977
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,320
This is Shen Zhilin, a vice-president at Goldman Sachs.

978
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,320
Hi, President Zhang.

979
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,940
Hello, President Li.

980
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,100
We'll mingle.

981
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,260
Enjoy yourselves.

982
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,860
We can talk later.

983
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,100
Yu Hao.

984
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,196
We meet again.

985
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,740
It seems like I didn't invite Goldman Sachs, did I?

986
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,780
An outstanding VP should be persistent.

987
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:11,024
This is what I was talking to you about on the phone.

988
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,140
This is...

989
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,120
Vice-President Su?

990
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,964
This is Su Kelan, she's also my girlfriend.

991
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,220
Nice to meet you.

992
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,720
I'm Shen Zhilin, Yu Hao's classmate from college.

993
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,820
I'm also the VP of Goldman Sachs,

994
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,440
Shen Zhilin
