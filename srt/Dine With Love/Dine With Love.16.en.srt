1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,860
So he left?

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,500
And you just came back?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,940
What's that cat and mouse thing?

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,153
- Playing cat and mouse!
- Playing cat and mouse!

5
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:13,520
Wait.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,320
Kelan is teaching him how to cook again and has also asked about sunflowers.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,220
She's made it clear that she wants to get back together.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,940
Then why is he playing cat and mouse?

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,080
Since she was the one who broke up with him, maybe he wants to win a round.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,790
Can he be this narrow-minded?

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,700
I think he can.

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,560
Men are less tolerant than women.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,000
But my husband is okay.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,660
Jin Xuan is just dim-witted.

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,560
Does he still not know that you were the one who called the journalists?

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,040
That's why I call him a simpleton.

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,820
Then you should be more proactive.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,100
I've been so proactive. What else can I do?

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,160
Be direct. Just tell him.

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,560
Yes. Just tell him directly.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,840
- Are you going to confess your love to him?
- I'm not talking about myself.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,080
I'm talking about you.

23
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,520
What?

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,500
Guys are either narrow-minded or dim-witted.

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,020
As girls, we must be flexible.

26
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,720
Su Kelan, just tell Yu Hao that you want to get back together.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,900
Are you talking about me?

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,000
Then why don't you tell Jin Xuan about your affections first?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Are our problems the same?

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,140
My problem is that he doesn't like me so I will adopt a long-term plan.

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,980
But your problem is that you two are in love, but you're both too proud.

I will be back soon.

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,420
Aren't you going to visit Yu Hao today?

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,680
Why come back? Just stay there.

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,540
Mom, what are you talking about?

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,360
I'm having dinner with Meng Meng and the others. I will be back soon.

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,960
Bye.

What're you doing?

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,260
Yu Hao, shall we get back together?

42
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,360
Love you.

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
You! Give it back!

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,140
Don't send things like "I love you!" He will realize that it is not from Kelan.

45
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,880
- Wait.
- Hurry up!

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240

Kelan!

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,660
Kelan!

How can you guys do this?

52
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:12,960
You're no fun.

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,570

[Braised eggplant: Let's face it all together]

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,960
I saw it.

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,460
Where's his pride?

58
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,220
Just one push and he's given in.

59
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,600
Don't forget to invite me to your wedding!

60
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,700
But I won't give you a red envelope.
 (T/N: Money given in a red envelope for good luck is a traditional wedding gift.)

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,200
It wasn't you who sent it, right?

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,160
Is he playing dumb?

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,856
How can he not realize that we're testing him and helping him out of this dilemma?

64
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,160
Is he taking advantage of her weakness?

65
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,900
- I will send it again.
- Never mind.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
Whatever the reason, I was the one who broke up with him.

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,580
When I didn't want to see him, I broke up with him.

68
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,320
Since I want to see him now, so I'm asking him to get back together.

69
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,060
Why should everything revolve around me?

70
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,430
If I were in his place, I wouldn't be happy about this, either.

71
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,840
- Let's drink beer!
- Okay.

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,480
Boss, bring us a case of beer!

73
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,600
And for me, I want a bottle of...

74
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,420
orange juice.

75
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,640
I can only drink orange juice.

76
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,780
Come on! Cheers!

77
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,260
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

78
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,060
I have to go.

Our little monster should be awake now.

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,800
You guys are so boring. You haven't even drunk enough beer and you're already leaving.

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,559
Bye!

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,990
Isn't that Yu Hao's car?

83
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
Is this another unexpected encounter?

84
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,700
It is just fate. Let's go check it out.

85
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,880
That's not a good idea.

86
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,460
Maybe he's working.

87
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,840
Then just wait until he's finished with his work.

88
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,060
Let's go.

89
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,740
Don't overthink it.

90
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,900
They're surely discussing... work.

91
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,140
That's right. A hotel, a café. They're discussing work. That's normal. Quite normal.

92
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,260
Right.

93
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,130
What time is it now?

94
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,180
Ten o'clock.

95
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,600
He's never made an appointment with a female client after dinner.

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,540
It is nothing. Maybe they just have a simple relationship.

97
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,700
What do you mean?

98
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,460
You haven't seen him for almost a year.

99
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,560
There may be some simple issues that need to be taken care of. Isn't that right?

100

It is getting late. I will send you back.

101
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,760
Hello, Meng Meng.

102
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,820
Are you really going to give up like this?

103
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,060
Give up on what?

104
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,290

105
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,780
Gong Wenxing is at a dinner party right now.

106
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,840
When he comes back, I will ask him to figure out what his nephew has been up to.

107
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,920
Forget it.

108
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,660
Forget what?

109
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,240
Isn't that what I just said?

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,480
Don't play dumb with me.

111
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,180
Yu Hao asked you to cook boiled cabbage with him and said those words to you.

112
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,580
He also asked you to go see his cat.

113
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,540
This shows that he's still interested in you.

114
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,340
Why are you still hesitating at this point?

115
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,460
Meng Meng.

116
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:45,000
What do you think Shen Zhilin was thinking when she met me?

117
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,280
Why are you bringing her up again?

118
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,340
What's the point?

119
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,580
She was probably thinking

120
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,760
that Yu Hao was dating me just to fill the emptiness inside him.

121
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,980
She was surely thinking that Yu Hao would accept her again.

122
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,600
So she did all those things.

123
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,560
If I go to Yu Hao now,

124
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,560
what's the difference between Shen Zhilin and me?

125
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,480
- But...
- I broke up with him.

126
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,320
Whatever the reason, I hurt him.

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,900
Now that I feel better,

128
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,340
what right do I have to ask him to come back?

129
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,180
Just forget it.

130
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,940
Stay with Yu Hao a little longer.

131
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,180
Don't come back so soon.

132
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm already on my way back.

133
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,550
Yu Hao, hurry up!

134
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,780
It is Hei's favorite food, put it in your bag.

135
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,300
I forgot to give it to him at his house.

136
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,240

137
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,440
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,680
I will give you a different address.

139
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,320
Okay.

140
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,480
Don't worry about it. I know what to do.

141
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,920
Bye.

142
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,680
Su Kelan, you didn't give me the cat food I asked you to take care of.

143
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,580
It is with me. I will ask Meng Meng to bring it to you later.

144
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,360
I'm watching a movie with my mother. It is not convenient to answer the phone.

145
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,240
The cats are hungry. Bring me the cat food once the movie is over.

146
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,740
Aren't there any pet stores from where you could buy some in an emergency?

147
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,840
They're all closed.

148
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,500
There's a 24-hour pet hospital.

149
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,740
But it doesn't sell this brand.

150
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,300
Now Hei and Wanshun have become fussy eaters.

151
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,760
They're picky.

152
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,020
By the way, remember those fish balls you used to make earlier, bring some of those as well.

153
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,760
They love them.

154
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,320
Don't you have a surplus in your company? Just go get them yourself.

155
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,620
They have expired.

156

Is it so hard for you to come to my house?

158
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,180
Wait. Weren't you supposed to be meeting someone else?

159
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,820
I will bring them to you later. Wait for me at your house.

160
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,740

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,440
I want to take this class

178
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,720
to learn to cook a meal

179
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,180
for two people.

180
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,540
You know one of them.

181
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,330
My grandmother.

182
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,560
The other...

183
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,790
The other person...

184
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,070
I haven't seen him in a long time.

185
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,040
My father.

186
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,330
For so many years,

187
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,620
my grandmother and I

188
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,710
have been blaming my father.

189
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,270
We thought that,

190
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,740
if it weren't for my father,

191
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,020
my mother wouldn't have...

192
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,050
On my birthdays,

193
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,910
my father always sent me messages,

194
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,280
asking me if I wanted to go with him to visit my mother's grave.

195
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,880
Lately, I have been thinking that back then,

196
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,910
when my father was so busy that he rarely came home,

197
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,990
it wasn't because he didn't love my mother.

198
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,470
Instead, he just wanted to

199
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,880
give my mother and me a better life.

200
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,860
I want to get to know him better

201
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,780
and also help myself

202
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,340
in truly overcoming my past.

203
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,440
Will you help me?

204
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay.

205
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,360
Tomorrow at 3 p.m. See you at my house.

206
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,820
Don't bother about the cat food today.

207
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,960
Just bring it with you tomorrow.

208
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,640
Okay, see you tomorrow.

209
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,300
See you tomorrow.

210
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,320
Exactly what does he want to do?

211
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,280
Tell me, exactly what is he doing?

212
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,320
Here you go.

213
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,360
I just realized

214
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,140
the last message that I sent you last night

215
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,080
failed to deliver.

216
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,360
Really?

217
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,860
But I received it.

218
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,520
Maybe there's a bug in your phone.

219
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,160
Bug? Are there bugs in phones? Let me check.

220
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,176
What do you want to cook today? Let's get going.

221
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,340
Eggplant.

222
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Why?

223
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,980
I thought eggplant was your least favorite.

224
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,600
I want to cook it for him.

225
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,820
For your father?

226
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,120
When I was a child, my mother didn't want me to be fussy about food

227
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,520
so she forced me to eat eggplant.

228
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,040
But the more she forced me, the less I liked it.

229
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,600
The less I liked it,

230
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,560
the more she learned to cook it in creative ways.

231
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,960
Finally,

232
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,540
eggplant became my mother's specialty.

233
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,100
Unfortunately,

234
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,700
I never grew to like it.

235
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,700
I want to cook

236
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,520
an eggplant dish for him

237
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,180
that has my mother's flavor.

238
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,300
Actually,

239
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,400
since you're just making a meal for your family,

240
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,540
you shouldn't force yourself to eat something that you don't like.

241
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,040
All my life,

242
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,730
my grandmother and I continuously put the blame for what happened to my mother

243
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,820
on my father.

244
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,580
That's because we're running away.

245
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,640
We couldn't face or admit the fact

246
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,120
that the responsibility for it wasn't just my father's.

247
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
I know

248
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,480
that my father loved my mother very much.

249
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,180
If he hadn't,

250
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,600
he wouldn't have collapsed and been unable to recover

251
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,940
since that time.

252
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,400
So I want to cook an eggplant dish with my mother's flavor.

253
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,240
So that I, along with him,

254
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
and Grandmother,

255
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,800
can really face things,

256
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,640
reconcile,

257
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,360
and can finally get relieved.

258
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,540
Then...

259
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,000
Do you remember anything about the eggplant dish that your mother cooked?

260
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,900
Can you describe it roughly?

261
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,360
I remember

262
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,020
it is a pile of

263
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,160
sticky, blackish

264
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,380
and oily stuff.

265
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,120
It seems like you really don't like eggplant.

266
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,820
Are you sure

267
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,340
that it was this type of eggplant?

268
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,800
There are actually many types.

269
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,460
For example, eggplant can be long, round, or flat.

270
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,300
Long eggplant also comes in different colors.

271
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,460
Long purple eggplant.

272
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,440
It looked like these.

273
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,940
What about the cutting?

274
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,240
Straight, side, or rolling?

275
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,800
Cutting?

276
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,416
With straight cutting, you will get large pieces with skin and tight pulp.

277
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,400
So it is usually used to make eggplant patties.

278
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,800
Or steamed in a clear soup and served cold.

279
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,936
With side cutting, you will get slices that are soft and easy to cook.

280
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:28,980
It is suitable for stir-frying and sautés.

281
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,700
With roll cutting, we can keep the skin and the eggplant can absorb the sauces.

282
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,660
So it is usually used to braise in soy sauce or oil.

283
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,480
When cut in half lengthwise...

284
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,460
and added to seasonings,

285
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,780
it is suitable for both steaming and baking.

286
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,200
Does it ring a bell?

287
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,110
Roll cutting!

288
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,900
Was it braised eggplant then?

289
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,120
I can't remember clearly.

290
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,280
That's okay.

291
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,840
I will braise one dish each in soy sauce, oil, and dressings respectively.

292
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,620
Then you can taste them all and decide which flavor is the closest.

293
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,200
Okay.

294
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,620
Try them.

295
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,136
Why don't you close your eyes and pinch your nose and then try to eat them?

296
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,500
No need.

297
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,870
Braised eggplant in oil.

298
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,920
It is soft and fragrant.

299
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,660
Is it the one?

300
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,700
No.

301
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,720
Braised eggplant in dressings.

302
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,600
It is refreshing and crisp.

303
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,100
It's not the same.

304
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,500
Braised eggplant in brown sauce.

305
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,400
The flavor is pure with concentrated juices.

306
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Is it this one?

307
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,280
It seems like it,

308
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,340
but it also seems like it isn't.

309
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,080
Which flavor is missing?

310
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,560
Sweet, salty, or sour?

311
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,680
Or is there insufficient mashed garlic?

312
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,640
I don't know.

313
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,180
It's okay.

314
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,040
I will make some adjustments, and you can try it again.

315
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,000
It still isn't quite right.

316
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,380
How is it?

317
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,320
No problem. Quite close.

318
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,006
Quite close?

319
00:30:02,006 --> 00:30:04,660
That means it is still not the same.

320
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,820
What should we do? Your birthday is tomorrow.

321
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,580
I just feel it is a little bit different,

322
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
but it is not a big deal.

323
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,620
After all, even if my mother cooked it herself,

324
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,100
the flavor wouldn't be exactly the same every time she made it, right?

325
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,320
Haven't you already tasted it?

326
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,280
You don't have to eat this eggplant that you hate.

327
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:37,680
I've been eating it these last few days. It seems like it is not that bad.

328
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,620
Hao Hao, hurry.

329
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,776
The eggplant your mother cooked today is particularly delicious.

330
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:34,520
Come on. Hurry up and have a taste.

331
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,320
Come on. Try a bite.

332
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,320
Hurry up and have a taste.

333
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,080
Just one bite. Come on.

334
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,060
Have a taste.

335
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,020
What's the matter?

336
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,140
I haven't seen him in almost ten years.

337
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,840
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

338
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,580
If I end up cooking the wrong dish,

339
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,520
it will be of no use.

340
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,100
Or even if I make the right one but he doesn't remember it, what then?

341
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,910
Grandmother.

342
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,060
Kelan.

343
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,320
Have a seat.

344
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,860
Hao Hao.

345
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,900
you're not afraid of celebrating your birthday now.

346
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,780
That's great.

347
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,820
Let bygones be bygones.

348
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,740
Grandmother,

349
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,300
actually,

350
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,180
recently, I've started to learn to face things

351
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,480
and try to let them go.

352
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,020
You can do this, too.

353
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,193
Because

354
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:24,300
letting go of the past

355
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,420
doesn't seem to be that hard.

356
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,520
I'm all right.

357
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,340
It has been so many years.

358
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,240
As long as you're all right,

359
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,440
I will be fine, too.

360
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,040
Who else is coming?

361
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,020
Gong Wenxing?

362
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,920
I will get the door first.

363
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,020
Hao Hao.

364
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,220
Come in.

365
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,960
Hello, Uncle.

366
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,300
Happy birthday.

367
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:47,786
You?

368
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Why are you here?

369
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,540
You've been ignoring him all these years.

370
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,220
What's the point of bringing the trash here?

371
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,740
He's not eight years old. He's already thirty.

372
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,680
Today is my birthday.

373
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,120
I just hope we can have a meal together.

374
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:16,359
Today is also your mother...

375
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,520
These were your favorites when you were a child.

376
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:55,073
Have a seat, please. Dinner will be ready soon.

377
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:20,173
Do you remember that beef-lamb mix?

378
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:23,740
That kind of air-popped snack you could get for fifty cents a bag?

379
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,360
Right.

380
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,660
I especially loved it when I was little.

381
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,876
Every time my mother bought snacks, she'd bring me one packet.

382
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:36,060
Even now, from time to time

383
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,880
my mom still buys it for me at the convenience store next to my elementary school.

384
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,930
Because in her eyes, I will always be

385
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:47,460
that innocent little girl who cried and made a fuss over snacks.

386
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,280
My mother was like that, too.

387
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,400
When I was little, every time she wanted me to be happy,

388
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,620
she would buy these for me.

389
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,080
Your father...

390
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,800
I think he's always been concerned about you.

391
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,280
He just doesn't know how to get along with you.

392
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,500
I won't eat eggplant. I want to eat Denying Beef!

393
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,220
Okay.

394
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,900
Then take a bite of eggplant.

395
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,100
What's the matter?

396
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,200
I remember what's missing in the eggplant.

397
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,280
Time for dinner.

398
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,780
Grandmother.

399
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,200
Uncle.

400
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,880
I will do it.

401
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,680
Grandmother. Dig in.

402
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,760
Grandmother, have some soup.

403
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,460
Uncle, the soup.

404
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,680
Not for me.

405
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,800
Grandmother, have this.

406
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,820
Uncle, you should try it as well.

407
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,140
I thought you didn't eat eggplant.

408
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,360
People can change.

409
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,140
Besides, I no longer think that eggplant tastes bad.

410
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,220
This flavor...

411
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,320
It has been more than twenty years since I tasted this flavor.

412
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,670
Can you

413
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,660
cook another plate of this?

414
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,380
I will do it.

415
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,360
Here you go.

416
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,610
To stop me from being picky,

417
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:50,980
my mother used to put my favorite snack in the eggplant.

418
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,920
He brought it,

419
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,180
so now the flavor is complete.

420
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,900
How does he have the guts to eat this?

421
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,740
What did he say when your mother

422
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,080
married him?

423
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,940
He promised to make her happy, didn't he?

424
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,160
But in the end

425
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,660
he never came home.

426
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,040
If it weren't for him,

427
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,180
your mother wouldn't have...

428
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,360
I know that

429
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,160
in the beginning, no one thought I was good enough for her.

430
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,910
I worked hard

431
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,590
because I wanted her and Hao Hao

432
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,180
to live a better life.

433
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,640
I really want to go back to the past,

434
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,700
but even if I do,

435
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,430
I don't know what else I could have done.

436
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,780
Father.

438
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,180
Grandmother.

439
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:21,720
In a few days, let's visit your mother's grave together.

440
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:54,093
Are you all right?

441
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,340
Yes.

442
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,600
Indeed,

443
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,180
only when you face the past can you really put matters to rest.

444
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,400
Now my family can finally be normal.

445
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,570
Since when did you start caring about whether your family is normal or not?

446
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,800
Thank you for your help today.

447
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,420
You're welcome.

448
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,880
- I will drive you home.
- Okay.

449
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:24,073
By the way,

450
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,999
it seems like you haven't seen Wanshun and the others for a long time, right?

451
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:30,750
Do you want to go see them?

452
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,060
What's the matter?

453
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,850
It is late.

454
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:42,310
Oh.

455
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,460
That's right.

456
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,190
You need to keep auntie company. I forgot about that.

457
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,460
My mom doesn't need my company so much now.

458
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,320
Won't anyone else come to celebrate your birthday?

459
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,076
The other day, I saw you enter a hotel with a woman.

460
00:47:02,076 --> 00:47:04,050
Did you...

461
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,880
Never mind. It is nothing.

462
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,980
Can I ask you for one more favor?

463
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,680
After it is over, I will tell you about it.

464
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:27,440
Of course, if you don't want to know, just pretend I didn't say anything.

465
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,420
What's the favor?

466
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,160
I need a helper for the next episode's recording.

467
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:46,800
The chairs must line up, and those vegetables in the foreground need to be fresh and placed in the front.

468
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,160
- Okay?
- Go on.

469
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,460
Come here.

470
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,680
We will do this.

471
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,160
It is...

472
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,940
Let's go.

473
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,420
Everyone, then zoom in on the speaker. Everyone has understood, right?

474
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,240
You don't need me to say it again, right?

475
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,520
Wait. I'm going to put on a little less makeup.

476
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,960
Does this look too gaudy?

477
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,540
Wait. Your name is Mary Sue, right? Since when have you started caring whether you look too gaudy?

478
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,680
Wait. Let me check.

479
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,320
President Yu?

480
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,480
Peng Xiao, please find someone to help her with her makeup.

481
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,860
What?

482
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,620
I need a helper for this episode.

483
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,720
But President Yu, I don't think we have this procedure.

484
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,740
I think I'm the sponsor, isn't that right?

485
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,340
Just change the procedure. It's not a big deal.

486
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,300
Get your makeup done. I will see you afterwards.

487
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,560
Sister Kelan, wait for a moment. I will go ask Director Jin whether the procedure can be changed.

488
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,560
Peng Xiao!

489
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,760
What's going on here? Are you guys back together?

490
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,940
Didn't you say that if he was dating someone else, things would be difficult for you?

491
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,060
Or have you figured out his relationship with that woman?

492
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,280
He said

493
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,380
he'd tell me after the recording.

494
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,420
Wow.

495
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,900
He's clearly leaving you hanging.

496
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,500
Sister, are you going to change your makeup or not?

497
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,300
I have things to do.

498
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,000
Why does he suddenly have so many ideas?

499
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,970
I told you, we shouldn't have let him be our sponsor.

500
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,560
Go and tell him,

501
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,500
if he can do the recording, then let's do it. Otherwise, he can go to hell!

502
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,900
Hello?

503
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,740
Can you stop giving the crew so much trouble?

504
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,780
Have you still not gotten your makeup done?

505
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,780
I will get someone to arrange it quickly.

506
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,180
- Sister Kelan?
- Long time no see, Sister Kelan.

507
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,980
Long time no see.

508
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,620
Kelan!

509
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,540
Meng Meng.

510
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,120
I'm here to coordinate your helper job for the program.

511
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,910
I will go see to that.

512
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,880
- Why are you here?
- I came with her.

513
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,800
I'm afraid she won't be able to handle it and make Yu Hao angry.

514
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,100
Or she won't be able to handle it and will take it out on Yu Hao, thus making him angry.

515
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,060
- Okay, I will go see to it.
- Okay.

516
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,680
Meng Meng.

517
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,860
Su Kelan.

518
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,390
We have come to visit you.

519
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,850
Are we not welcome?

520
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,460
He's in the dressing room.

521
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,630
We're here for you.

522
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:42,890
What?

523
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,620
Last time,

524
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,416
the matter with Wu Dong caused you a lot of trouble.

525
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:49,940
I've explained everything to them.

526
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:55,180
We behaved a little radically at the time as well.

527
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,940
That's okay. It is the past.

528
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,660
Don't stare at me like that.

529
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,920
I've already let him go.

530
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,680
I care more about my career.

531
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,180
Even if he and I got back together, dating is time-consuming and unprofitable, so what's the benefit?

532
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,587
I heard that Yu Hao and another woman...

533
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,360
Take it easy.

534
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,570
For a woman, her own well-being is the most important.

535
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,620
Yes.

536
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,260
- See you around.
- Okay.

537
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,900
Let's go.

538
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,060
- Sister.
- Yes?

539
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,920
Director Jin has agreed. Hurry and get your make up done.

540
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,700
Ming Zhe,

541
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,400
Director Jin is asking you to do the makeup for Sister Kelan.

542
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,160
Okay.

543
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,170
Sister Bi, it is done.

544
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,240
Has the extra procedure been approved?

545
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,560
Yes.

546
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,560
I just knew it. Jin Xuan wouldn't object for sure.

547
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,380
Because you're the one who has been added.

548
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,380
You still haven't talked it over with him?

549
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,820
He still won't like me.

550
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,560
When did you start to like Jin Xuan?

551
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,720
The first time he painted me.

552
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,060
Did he paint you?

553
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,280
Don't overthink it.

554
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,000
He wasn't interested in me.

555
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,120
Back then he wanted to pursue you.

556
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,420
I knew he was good at painting so I advised him to paint a portrait of you

557
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,840
and practice by painting me.

558
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,170
But in the end, what the heck did he paint?

559
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,420
- Isn't that an exaggeration?
- You don't believe it?

560
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,380
Let me show you.

561
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,360
It is terrible, right?

562
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,220
- It is nice.
- This is "nice"?

563
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,480
What else did you want?

564
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,200
This one is okay.

565
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,980
Let me see.

566
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,740
Why did he draw it like that again?

567
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,840
We quarreled that day. He painted it to apologize to me.

568
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,300
- He painted you face-to-face?
- No.

569
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,480
- Zhang Bi.
- Yes?

570
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,770
Confess your affection to Jin Xuan.

571
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,770
He likes you for sure.

572
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:07,670
It is just that he hasn't figured it out yet.

573
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,280
Thank you, Director Jin. We're sorry to trouble you.

574
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,580
This line, please cut it.

575
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,313
Tang Lixuan!

576
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,080
I shouldn't....

577
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,980
Come on. Trust me.

578
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,600
- There won't be a problem.
- You're not going to screw me over, are you?

579
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,100
- When have I ever done that?
- What if you've misjudged the situation?

580
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,380
What's the matter?

581
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,320
- She's got something to say to Director Jin.
- I don't.

582
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,860
You always say I'm smart, right? When have I ever lied to you?

583
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,200
Then why are you and Yu Hao still a mess?

584
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:50,540
Anyway, since you and Jin Xuan were in the news, he's been avoiding you.

585
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,400
If you tell him, it can't get any worse, can it?

586
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,980
That seems to make sense.

587
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,560
Just go.

588
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,280
Jin Xuan!

589
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,340
Why are you avoiding me?

590
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,300
Well...

591
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,040
Recently… there's been news about you… that… that hasn't been good for you.

592
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,000
We should avert suspicion.

593
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,660
Don't run away.

594
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,560
Stop right there!

595
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,920
Hua Xu!

596
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,000
Don't film. Don't film this.

597
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,160
- I'm telling you...
- Jin Xuan, I like you!

598
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,620
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

599
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,580
Don't film!

600
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,140
You!

601
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,780
Director.

602
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,260
Director.

603
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,980
It is done.

604
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,820
Got it.

605
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:23,990
Zhang Bi showed me a portrait you painted. It is beautiful.

606
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,540
I-I just painted it casually.

607
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,680
You painted her one before.

608
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,580
That one was average.

609
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,240
At that time, I didn't know her very well.

610
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,680
In your painting,

611
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,340
you depict how that person looks in your eyes.

612
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:47,420
Her first portrait was average because in your eyes she wasn't that attractive.

613
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,720
But when you painted her the second time, it wasn't done face-to-face.

614
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,200
Still, you painted her so beautifully, by memory alone.

615
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,500
This means that, in your eyes, she's very beautiful.

616
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,880
Actually, you like her.

617
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,560
You just haven't realized it yourself.

618
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,480
Welcome to "Dine with Love."

619
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,980
The theme of this program is

620
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,720
"What to cook when inviting your best friend to a meal."

621
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,980
So our guest Yu Hao has invited his most precious friend to be his helper.

622
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:55,060
President Yu, please introduce your friend.

623
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,240
Su Kelan.

624
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,320
Could you tell us a little more about her?

625
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,620
She's my most important friend.

626
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,180
Your most important friend?

627
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,800
What does that mean?

628
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,600
When I need someone to keep me company, the first person I think of is her.

629
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,660
When I feel happy, I want to share it with her.

630
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,780
When she's sad I want to comfort her immediately.

631
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,740
If I can't see her, I feel desolate.

632
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,940
Each day I'm with her makes it a good day.

633
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,080
That's why I call her my most important friend.

634
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,210
Okay, let's welcome Su Kelan!

635
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:35,980
Absolutely!

636
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,640
In our lives, we all have friends that are the most important to us.

637
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:44,620
They're worth our most sincere feelings and considerate protection.

638
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,900
So, you two, what are you going to cook today?

639
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,500
Yuxiang Shredded Pork.

640
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,020
Okay. This way, please.

641
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,740
Let's start today's first course, Yuxiang Shredded Pork.

642
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:06,620
But, come to think of it, Yuxiang Shredded Pork is the most common home-made dish.

643
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:12,000
So I want to ask President Yu, why did you want to cook it in this episode?

644
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,020
Yuxiang is different from plain sweet and sour.
(T/N: Yuxiang is a specific seasoning mix used in Chinese cuisine)

645
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:18,160
It is a brand new and harmonized flavor.

646
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,860
It blends sweet, sour, and spicy flavors and turns it into the most special taste.

647
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,220
This is just like our life.

648
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,480
We need to constantly adjust, harmonize, and balance various relationships.

649
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,700
For example, the balance between our life, work, and family.

650
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,560
First, blanch these in boiling water.

651
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,540
I'm starting to salivate.

652
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,100
Good.

653
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:14,840
It looks like our sweet and sour Yuxiang Shredded Pork is done.

654
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,680
Done!

655
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,020
The first course tonight is completed.

656
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:23,960
Yuxiang Shredded Pork.

657
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,560
- It smells so good.
- I can't wait any longer.

658
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,640
Then I will have a taste.

659
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,600
- I want to try it as well.
- How is it?

660
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,240
President Yu,

661
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,980
you mentioned the relationship between life, work and family just now.

662
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,480
How do you balance and harmonize them?

663
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,740
Actually, I used to be a very selfish person.

664
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,180
All I focused on was work.

665
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,910
I couldn't even cook at all.

666
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,960
What President Yu is saying is that he wasn't very good at cooking then.

667
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,400
You're so modest. The food you cooked then was delicious.

668
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,100
In the recordings of those programs, I used a body double.

669
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:03,980
What, a body double?

670
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:07,680
- What, a body double?
- Were they even real?

671
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,600
Should we edit the recording?

672
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,280
But so many people have already heard this.

673
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,740
What I'm saying is the truth.

674
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:17,200
And this is what want to say the most at this moment.

675
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,560
So, Director Jin,

676
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,780
I hope you won't cut this piece out.

677
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,920
Thank you.

678
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,600
Earlier, I used a body double

679
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,900
because I thought that learning to cook was just a waste of time.

680
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,160
But someone told me

681
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,580
work is for making a living.

682
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,780
It is not an objective in itself.

683
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,100
Some things seem useless

684
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,090
but they're actually of the greatest value.

685
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,600
If I must lose my job to have time to cook at home,

686
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,960
I will resign now.

687
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,680
Because of her, I began to experience life.

688
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:07,940
She helped me and encouraged me to face the pain of my past.

689
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,680
Gradually,

690
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,040
she quietly stayed in my mind.

691
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:27,720
Suddenly one day,

692
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,400
I realized she had become more and more important to me.

693
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,100
I couldn't live without her.

694
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,960
So...

695
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,280
I tried every possible means to keep her by my side.

696
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:48,200
But at that time, I just didn't know how to get along with a person apart from work.

697
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,020
Despite my efforts,

698
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,460
I offered little compared to her needs.

699
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,360
I was so ignorant at the time that I thought

700
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:05,340
keeping her by my side was me being loving and caring.

701
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,940
Because of my ignorance,

702
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,540
I even argued with my working partners.

703
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,556
You should not only be responsible for her but for all the investors as well!

704
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:16,600
But after various disputes,

705
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,040
she was the one

706
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,780
who suffered in the end.

707
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,760
All this time,

708
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,510
I was giving her what I thought she needed.

709
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,400
But I'd overlooked

710
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,960
what she valued most.

711
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,960
Mom's

712
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,860
causing you trouble again.

713
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:45,640
Your happiness

714
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,660
brings me the most joy.

715
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,680
It is not your fault.

716
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,420
I'm not perfect,

717
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,720
and I don't want to cause trouble for others.

718
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:13,780
Your pressures all came from me.

719
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,480
I don't want to become your burden.

720
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,000
So I've learned to wait,

721
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,000
and to not fear caring for someone.

722
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,860
Finally,

723
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,020
I've also learned to face my past.

724
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,520
Birthdays have always been my nightmares.

725
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,440
But the eggplant my mother used to cook

726
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,820
might act as a bridge.

727
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:53,380
So I asked a hotel chef to help me recreate the dish.

728
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,460
But I realized I was wrong.

729
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,060
Why don't you just ask Kelan for help?

730
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:16,860
I was afraid that if it didn't work out,

731
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,280
she might get depressed.

732
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,320
Your confusion and frustration is part of you.

733
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,120
If you can't show it to her honestly,

734
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,100
that means you don't trust her enough.

735
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,280
Is she willing to see you hide your confusion

736
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,960
and not talk about it with her?

737
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,000
When Kelan's mother was sick,

738
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,580
did you expect she'd distance herself from you and undertake it alone,

739
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:46,900
or she'd turn to you to face it together?

740
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,080
Stand still. Don't move. I will adjust its position.

741
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,460
We are just cooking scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

742
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:16,990
Let's record the process for you to review later.

743
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:22,636
After all, you'll attend the program. So posture and manners are very important.

744
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,640
Mom?

745
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:16,470
I won't try to hide my vulnerability and confusion anymore.

746
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,800
Likewise,

747
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,340
you don't have to pretend to be strong.

748
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,640
The last thing I would want to see

749
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,680
is you crying in the corner.

750
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,420
This course of Yuxiang Shredded Pork

751
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,200
is for you.

752
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,800
I want to harmonize my life and yours.

753
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:51,336
I hope that you won't have to bear all the pressure.

754
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:53,960
You won't have to be perfect at all times.

755
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,620
You can feel free to cry

756
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,270
or laugh.

757
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,820
I want to be someone you can rely on.

758
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,100
I want to be your family.
